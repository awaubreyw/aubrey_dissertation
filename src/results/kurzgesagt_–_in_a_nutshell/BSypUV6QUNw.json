It&#39;s amazing to see the progress Kurzgesagt made in terms of visual style from the first immune system video to this one. Building on that, I think I have a suggestion that might be interesting for the Kurzgesagt team: I feel like the font used in videos and thumbnails doesn&#39;t match the animations anymore.

And the IS program was meant to create the successor to the KV by making a new heavy tank that could resist the German long 75 and 88mm found on the Panther and Tiger respectively. This eventually resulted in the IS-2 which could resist German guns and packed one hell of a punch in the form of the 122mm D-25T anti-tank gun that could punch a hole effortlesslt through every tank the Germans had.<br><br>The Germans, however, noticing their new big cats were being destroyed effortlessly by Soviet IS-2&#39;s and T-34-85&#39;s, initiated a program to create <b>even bigger tanks.</b> This resulted in many prototypes and 2 vehicles that went into production: Tiger-2/Kr\u00f6nigs(King) Tiger and Jagdtiger. These were the biggest and heaviest tanks the Germans ever fielded, both being able to resist the Soviet 122mm. The King Tiger employed a slightly improved 88mm gun that could perforate the IS-2&#39;s armor at certain angles. The Jagdtiger, however, boasted a 128mm PaK 44 L/55 gun that could annihilate any Soviet tank from a great distance.

With little difficulty you can see the seals of the Single, Eternally Besought One on the page of the earth, so raise your head, open your eyes, and look too at the great book of the universe. You will see that on it as a whole a stamp of unity is read out which is as clear as it is big. For like the components of a factory or members of a palace or town, these beings support one another, stretch out their hands to assist one another, and answer the needs and requests of one another, saying: &quot;Here I am, at your service!&quot; Assisting one another, they work together in order. Joining efforts, they serve animate beings. Co-operating and turned a single goal, they obey an All-Wise Disposer. They conform to a rule of mutual assistance which is in force from the sun and moon, night and day, and winter and summer, to plants coming to the assistance of hungry and needy animals, and animals hastening to the assistance of weak, noble men, and even nutritious substances flying to assist delicate, weak infants and fruits, and particles of food passing to the assistance of the cells of the body. They show to anyone who is not altogether blind that they are acting through the strength of a single, most generous Nurturer, and at the command of a single most wise Disposer.<br>   Thus, on the one hand this mutual support and assistance, this answering one another&#39;s needs, this mutual embracing, this subjugation, this order, testify decisively that beings are administered and organized by a single Disposer and are being impelled and directed by a single Nurturer. And on the other hand, this perfect grace within the universal wisdom to be seen plainly in the art of things; and the all-embracing mercy which shines within the providence; and the sustenance spread over that mercy and scattered so as to answer the needs of all living beings needy for sustenance; -these form a stamp of Divine unity so brilliant that anyone whose mind is not altogether extinguished will understand it and anyone who is not altogether blind will see it.<br>   Yes, a veil of wisdom demonstrating intention, consciousness, and will, has covered the whole universe, and upon that veil of wisdom has been spread a veil of grace and favour exhibiting beneficence, adornment, embellishment, and benevolence; and over that adorned veil of favour a garment of mercy displaying flashes of making known and loved, of bestowal and the granting of gifts has enveloped the universe; and spread over that illuminated veil of universal mercy is a table of general provisions showing kindness and bestowal and benevolence and perfect compassion and fine nurturing and dominical favour.<br>   Yes, all beings from particles to suns, whether individuals or species, or large or small, have been clothed in a magnificent shirt of wisdom embroidered with fruits and aims, benefits and purposes. And over the wisdom-displaying shirt, a garment of favour embroidered with flowers of grace and beneficence has been cut out in accordance with the stature of things; and over that ornamented garment of favour, a general table of sustenance has been set up, lit up with flashes of love, bestowal, affection, and the granting of gifts, to which the decorations of mercy have been attached, and which, together with bestowing those illuminated and jewel-encrusted decorations, is sufficient for all the groups of living beings on the face of the earth, and meets all their needs. Thus, this matter points to an All-Glorious Provider Who is All-Wise, All-Generous, and All-Compassionate, and shows Him as clearly as the sun.<br>   Is that so? Is everything in need of sustenance?<br>   Yes, like individual beings are in need of sustenance and all the necessities to continue their lives, we see that all the beings in the world, and especially living beings, whether universal or particular, wholes or parts, have many desires and needs, material and otherwise, for their existence, their lives, and the continuation of their lives. But their wants and needs are for such things that their hands cannot reach the least of them and their power is insufficient for the smallest of them. Yet, we see that all their wishes and material and immaterial sustenance is given to them From where he could not imagine, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 65:3.} from unhoped for places, with perfect order, at the appropriate time, in a suitable fashion, with perfect wisdom. And so, does this want and need of creatures and this manner of unseen help and assistance not show an All-Wise and Glorious Nurturer, an All-Compassionate Beauteous Disposer?<br>Risale-i Nur Collection Words - 309 Bedi\u00fczzaman Said Nursi (R. A)", "comment_date": "2019-09-01T09:18:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MEHAZ", "comment_text": "FIRST MATTER: In every facet of the motion of all particles the light of Divine unity shines like the sun. For as is proved briefly in the First Indication of the Tenth Word and in detail in the Twenty-Second Word, if every particle is not an official of God acting with His permission and under His authority, and if it is not undergoing change within His knowledge and power, then every particle must have infinite knowledge and limitless power; it must have eyes that see everything, a face that looks to all things, and authority over all things. For every particle of the elements acts, or can act, in an orderly fashion in all animate beings. But the order within things and laws according to which they are formed differ from one thing to the next. If their order was not known to the particles, the particles could not act, or even if they could act, they could not act without error. In which case, the particles which are performing their duties in beings are either acting with the permission and at the command, and within the knowledge and at the will, of the owner of an all-encompassing knowledge, or they themselves must have such an all-encompassing knowledge and power. Yes, all particles of air can enter the bodies of all animate beings, the fruits of all flowers, and the structures of all leaves. They can act within them, although the way the beings are formed is all different and their order and systems quite distinct. As though the factory of a fig was a loom for weaving cloth and the factory of a pomegranate, a machine for producing sugar, and so on; the programmes of their structures and bodies all differ from each other. A particle of air, then, enters or can enter all of them. It takes up its position and acts in a wise and masterly fashion without error. And on completion of its duty it departs. A mobile particle of mobile air, therefore, either must know the forms, shapes, measures, and formations with which plants and animals, and even fruits and flowers, are clothed, or else it must be an official acting under the command and will of one who does know. Similarly with a stationary particle of stationary earth: since it has the ability to be the means and place of cultivation for all the seeds of all flowering plants and fruit-bearing trees, either there must be in the particle itself or in the handful of soil that is its little house immaterial machinery and factories in good working order to the number of the varieties of the trees and plants, and flowers and fruits in fact, it is in every single particle that there must be a factory peculiar to it and all the equipment and machinery necessary for the running of the factory or else it must have a miraculous knowledge that knows all things about all things and a miracle-working power that creates everything from nothing; or, those duties are performed at the command and with the permission of One Who is Knowing of All Things, and through the power and might of One Who is Absolutely Powerful over All Things. If an untrained and inexperienced, common, ordinary, and blind man was to go to Europe and in all the factories there to work at all the trades and crafts in perfect and masterly fashion, and if he was to display a wise and artistic skill to such a degree that it left everyone speechless with amazement, anyone with a grain of consciousness would know that the man was not acting on his own initiative, but that a master of all trades was teaching him and causing him to work. And if there was a blind and impotent man who lived in a simple little house and was unable even to rise from his place, and if small fragments of stone, and bits and pieces of material like bone and cotton were to enter his little house and then sacks of sugar, bales of cloth, crates of jewelry, finely-made clothes encrusted with jewels, and delicious foods were to emerge, would anyone with a grain of intelligence not say: &quot;That man is a wretched doorkeeper or merely a latch on the door of the factory of a wondrous miracle-working being, which is the source of his miracles&quot;? In exactly the same way, the motion and duties of particles of air in plants and trees, and blossom and fruit, all of which are missives of the Eternally Besought One, antique dominical works of art, miracles of power, and wonders of wisdom, indicate that the particles are acting under the command and at the will of an All-Wise and Glorious Maker, an All-Generous and Beauteous Creator. Particles of earth, also, since they are the source and means for the shoots and plants produced by seeds, each of which is a different factory and workbench, a different printing-press, treasury, and antique, a different manifesto proclaiming the Glorious Maker&#39;s Names and ode hymning His perfections, it is as definite as two plus two equalling four that the particles of earth are acting at the command, with the permission, and through the will and power of an All-Glorious Maker Who is Lord of the command of &quot;Be!&quot; and it is, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 36:82, etc.} and to Whose command everything is subjugated. In this we believe.

It has little time to find its victim (real time fraction of a second) before it loses energy (neutralized by water molecules). If C3b is successful, it latches itself onto an invader\u2019s vehicle. Then it changes its shape to attract other soldiers. It changes its shape many times then.\r<br>\r<br>Finally, it forms a recruiting platform that activates more C3 soldiers. Eventually, many recruiting platforms are made following the same steps and the invaders and their vehicles are covered with many soldiers that can cripple, slow down and even make the invader helpless. However, this is not enough to stop them.\r<br>\r<br>Meanwhile, C3a becomes a messenger and thousands of these messengers run away from the battle scene to alert others for help. Stronger soldiers or warriors hear their screams and follow them back to the battle site. The more messengers they see, the more aggressive they become.\r<br>\r<br>These strong soldiers start killing the enemy. The first warriors to arrive are trolls (phagocytes). They swallow the enemies, trap the invaders in a prison within them then kill with acid. However, trolls have a lousy grip as they are so large. Fortunately, the recruiting platforms latched onto the bacteria assists in helping the trolls grip.\r<br>\r<br>The shape of the recruiting platform changes again (from C3 convertase to C5 convertase) and recruits new robot soldiers. \r<br>\r<br>Together, these new soldiers construct a bigger structure called The Membrane Attack Complex. Long spears anchor themselves deep into the earth of the structure until a hole is ripped that cannot be closed.\r<br>\r<br>Gushing water escapes the hole and drown the invader, the pressure of the water flooding their insides and causing it to explode out. This causes them to bleed to death.\r<br>\r<br>The surviving invaders are wounded and tired and distracted from fighting the small soldiers. Taking advantage of the distractions, they are quickly eliminated by arriving warriors.\r<br>\r<br>The civilians did not even notice all of the commotion because the job was done so quick.\r<br>\r<br>*Scenario #2\r*<br>\r<br>Conquerors instead of plain enemies\r<br>\r<br>Conquerors looking for as much as land that they could occupy. Outside of land, they are mindlessly hoping to bump into a castle with just pure luck. \r<br>\r<br>With no castles or habitable places around, they are defenseless as they do not have any hosts. The foot soldiers easily cripple them and cut their defenses, guiding the warriors to the conquerors. \r<br>\r<br>*Scenario #3\r*<br>\r<br>A formidable and fearsome conqueror has come (vaccinia virus)\r<br>\r<br>When it steps foot on a kingdom, it forces it to send a soldier to dismiss all robot soldiers. \r<br>Now the conqueror easily creates safe zones around occupied castles. When it destroys castles and attempt to conquer more, it is more likely to be successful. \r<br>\r<br>*Scenario #4\r*<br>\r<br>An enemy that hides well and is undetectable\r<br>\r<br>Some invaders can camouflage themselves using civilians to keep the robotic soldiers calm as they go unnoticed\r. They are capable of more damage.<br><br><br><br><br>NOTE: I know this analogy is a tad faulty and bizarre so I would appreciate feedback and ways to improve it.

video and I find people that believe life came about by itself is pure ignorance. <br>Now don\u2019t get me wrong, religion is hypocritical at its finest in many cases and Darwin hated religion too and came up with evolution to try and disprove intelligent design. But I mean there has to be something or someone smart enough to all of a sudden have mindless proteins activated and that is not counting how they move in real life. I seen an animation It\u2019s amazing if it\u2019s true to life.<br>This is what sold me that life didn\u2019t come about randomly: <br>\u201cLife cannot exist without DNA and DNA cannot exist without RNA\u201d <br>Both extremely complex and believe it or not, difficult to replicate even in a lab setting. Let alone in some stupid soup all of a sudden there\u2019s single life organisms. <br>Unless you explain in detail that transition how it came about over the course of millions and millions of years, evolution has no foundation to explain the origin of life. It leaves more questions than answers. That\u2019s my mindset. But I do believe there has been changes in species over time yes I\u2019m saying that to say evolution is the reason and origin of life is kinda not wise. <br>And I\u2019m not stupid, I\u2019m aware religion sometimes does more harm than good, what I\u2019m getting at is that I\u2019m 100% convinced this life isn\u2019t folly and there\u2019s more to it. <br>Hey at least I try to sleep better at night \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T15:30:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tora fx", "comment_text": "i could literally listen to this dude for hours", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T15:30:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SIBORG 545", "comment_text": "Epiccc", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T15:30:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mladen Risti\u0107", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt: &quot;You are the reason these videos are being made&quot;<br><br><br>No, you guys are the reason, these videos are international treasure and not everyone is willing to make something like this or able to.", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T15:29:28Z", "likes_count": 246}, {"comment_by": "adrian anto", "comment_text": "what&#39;s up with the sound quality in this episode? usually it&#39;s better", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T15:29:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DankMemeLord", "comment_text": "KILLER QUEEN!", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T15:29:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C.J.

Where I was originally standing, a picture of a hamburger rests on the ground.<br><br>3 Cuils:\u00a0You awake as a hamburger. You start screaming only to have special sauce fly from your lips. The world is in sepia.<br><br>4 Cuils:\u00a0Why are we speaking German? A mime cries softly as he cradles a young cow. Your grandfather stares at you as the cow falls apart into patties. You look down only to see me with pickles for eyes, I am singing the song that gives birth to the universe.<br><br>5 Cuils:\u00a0You ask for a hamburger, I give you a hamburger. You raise it to your lips and take a bite. Your eye twitches involuntarily. Across the street a father of three falls down the stairs. You swallow and look down at the hamburger in your hands. I give you a hamburger. You swallow and look down at the hamburger in your hands. You cannot swallow. There are children at the top of the stairs. A pickle shifts uneasily under the bun. I give you a hamburger. You look at my face, and I am pleading with you. The children are crying now. You raise the hamburger to your lips, tears stream down your face as you take a bite. I give you a hamburger. You are on your knees. You plead with me to go across the street. I hear only children&#39;s laughter. I give you a hamburger. You are screaming as you fall down the stairs. I am your child. You cannot see anything. You take a bite of the hamburger. The concrete rushes up to meet you. You awake with a start in your own bed. Your eye twitches involuntarily. I give you a hamburger. As you kill me, I do not make a sound. I give you a hamburger.<br><br>6 Cuils:\u00a0You ask me for a hamburger. My attempt to reciprocate is cut brutally short as my body experiences a sudden lack of electrons. Across a variety of hidden dimensions you are dismayed. John Lennon hands me an apple, but it slips through my fingers. I am reborn as an ocelot. You disapprove. A crack echoes through the universe in defiance of conventional physics as cosmological background noise shifts from randomness to a perfect A Flat. Children everywhere stop what they are doing and hum along in perfect pitch with the background radiation. Birds fall from the sky as the sun engulfs the earth. You hesitate momentarily before allowing yourself to assume the locus of all knowledge. Entropy crumbles as you peruse the information contained within the universe. A small library in Phoenix ceases to exist. You stumble under the weight of everythingness, Your mouth opens up to cry out, and collapses around your body before blinking you out of the spatial plane. You exist only within the fourth dimension. The fountainhead of all knowledge rolls along the ground and collides with a small dog. My head tastes sideways as spacetime is reestablished, you blink back into the corporeal world disoriented, only for me to hand you a hamburger as my body collapses under the strain of reconstitution. The universe has reasserted itself. A particular small dog is fed steak for the rest of its natural life. You die in a freak accident moments later, and you soul works at the returns desk for the Phoenix library. You disapprove. Your disapproval sends ripples through the inter-dimensional void between life and death. A small child begins to cry as he walks toward the stairway where his father stands.<br><br>7 Cuils:\u00a0I give you a hamburger. The universe is engulfed within itself. A bus advertising hotdogs drives by a papillon. It disapproves. An unnatural force reverses Earth&#39;s gravity. You ask for a hamburger. I reciprocate with a mildly convulsing potato. You disapprove. Your disapproval releases a cosmic shift in the void between birth and life. You ask for a hamburger. A certain small dog feasts on hamburger patties for the rest of its unnatural, eternal endurance. Your constant disapproval sends silence through everything. A contrived beast becomes omnipotent. You ask for a hamburger. I give you a hamburger your body becomes an unsettled blob of nothingness, then divides by three. The papillon barks. The universe realigns itself. You, the papillon, and the hamburger disapprove. This condemnation stops the realignment. Hades freezes over. A pig is launched is launched into the unoccupied existence between space and time with a specific hamburger. You ask for a hamburger. I give you a hamburger. It screams as you lift it to your face. You laugh maniacally as I plead with you. You devour the hamburger as it pleads for mercy. I disapprove and condemn you to an eternity in a certain void where a certain pig and its specific hamburger are located. The Universal Space-time Continuum Committee disapproves of my irrational decision. You are locked away and are fed hamburgers for the rest of your natural existence. A pickle refuses to break down during the process of digestion. You die in a freak accident. A certain pickle lives the rest of its life in a comatose state. Your soul disapproves. Down the street a child cries as a hamburger gets stuck in, and climbs back up, her esophagus. You ask again for a hamburger. I refuse to reciprocate. You demand a lawyer. I remind you harshly that this is the new world order. Lawyers no longer exist. Only papillons. Your name is written on a list of sins. Blasphemy. You ask for a hamburger. The comatose pickle vanquishes your soul from this universe. Realignment occurs. You beg for a hamburger. A certain papillon&#39;s name is written on an obelisk in Egypt. Mumble. Peasants worship the obelisk. Your soulless corpse partakes in the festivity. Hamburgers are banned universally. The sun implodes. All planets cease to have ever existed. Mercury. Venus. Earth. Mars. Jupiter. Saturn. Uranus. Neptune. Pluto is the only mass in existence. Conveniently, you are on vacation here. Your need for hamburgers re-establishes space-time. Earth is recreated under your intergalactic rule. Hamburgers are your army. You wake up. Clowns. Clowns everywhere. Your dream rushes to meet you. You are kidnapped. You ask for a hamburger. They hand you a hotdog.", "comment_date": "2019-07-28T13:09:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sheamus", "comment_text": "I&#39;d rather not imagine being covered in flies thanks.
