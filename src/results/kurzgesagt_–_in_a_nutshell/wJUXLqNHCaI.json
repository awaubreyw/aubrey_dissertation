There was a massive issue a few years ago in the uk where a new pill containing a cocktail of drugs turned out to be poisonous and a lot of people got very sick and some even died, but that money to treat them came out of the tax payers pockets and was in no part paid for by the money spent on the drugs themselves.

There&#39;s an aspect of humans being human that often leads to problems in peoples lives, but which is likely to always exist to some extent. <br><br>I suppose if we &quot;got tougher&quot; I suppose we could just force people to become what we want to force them to be, though. Maybe torture (or more torture) would do the trick? But I doubt if it&#39;s worthwhile. That vector seems to extend in a quite scary direction, actually. If I was on a train heading off on a journey that might have no end in that direction, I think I might jump out the window and see if I get lucky and survive this, rather.<br><br>I think it&#39;s pretty obvious that the very best way to cope with the problem aspects of peoples use of mind-altering substances (like alcohol, and in subtle ways, nicotine, and others of course) would be to have a state monopoly over these. That way you have some actual control over the phenomenon, after all. And the costs of the problem could be borne by the people who take the risk. Sounds fair to me? Sell drugs at a profit, and put the profit into something useful.<br><br>First line of defence: Try to achieve perfect Informed Consent on the part of users. Have a &quot;layered&quot; &quot;drug-driver&#39;s-licence&quot; system, where before you gamble your life on the small beer, you &quot;do the Knowledge&quot; - attend and pass a course that imparts the current best knowledge of the nature of the substance first. Then abuse small beer for a few months to qualify to do the full-beer course. And then the Special Brew course. And then maybe the dope course - depending on what the Relative Harm Scale of the day says is the next most dangerous. Onward and upward, if you insist, too. Right to the heroin course or the crystal meth course. Offer a bit of resistance. Just take great pains to be utterly reasonable about this, though. That might be enough to save quite a lot of people, just by prevention; and part of the Knowledge for heavier stuff would be things like, &quot;How to tell that it&#39;s getting out of hand&quot;, and, &quot;How to get help.&quot;<br><br>And then finally, be willing to give something to &quot;completely worthless people&quot; (put that way just to bring even those who feel that way about addicts on board). As a last resort, be ready to feed and house a certain proportion of people who refuse to work, and just want to dive deep into the drug world. You could put some reasonable restrictions on some people, though. No children, for instance. If you do heroin, you get an IUD or vasectomy (could put a straw or so of semen in a sperm bank just in case of recovery, but if you make yourself incompetent as a parent, you shouldn&#39;t even become the &quot;parent&quot; that only contributes some sperm). And maybe if you do the deep dive, you have to volunteer to be part of the world&#39;s &quot;brain astronaut&quot; workforce? You blow your mind; allow us to read it if we can; between us, humanity gains some new knowledge, and the voluntary guinea pig suffers no harm not voluntarily assumed.<br><br>That last bit is important. If we&#39;re tight fisted toward the people who will still unravel due to drugs, we push them into desperation. And in desperation we already know that the world of drugs does things like keep the world supplied with child prostitutes &quot;sold&quot; by their desperate mothers. With our complicity. If she&#39;s scum, so are we.<br><br>It&#39;s a bit of a complicated replacement for the War on Drugs, but at least it meets those who have legitimate reasons for those bad policies half way. And if you just go all &quot;Reagan-Hippy Free Enterprise Cures all Disease&quot; when dropping the war, you legitimize some businesses whose proprietors should probably be banished to Antarctica without blankets. There&#39;s no need to make &quot;respectable&quot; (with &quot;respect&quot; being something else, surely?) citizens out of the dealers. Let them suffer. It&#39;s OK. It doesn&#39;t matter if they suffer. Not the least bit. It&#39;s just the addicts that need some compassion here.

It&#39;s doing what it set out to do. I don&#39;t mean reducing drug abuse, addictions, or related socioeconomic and health concerns, because that&#39;s what its official goal is. The unofficial and actual goal is to systematically target minorities and working-class citizens and use them as an excuse for racism and legal slavery during their prison sentence. The 80s saw the rise of the private prison system that exists solely to profit off of prison slave labor. Outside of that, making drugs illegal doesn&#39;t eliminate the demand, so there are going to be illegal organizations, such as the mafia, cartels, and street gangs who provide the supply and protect their enterprises all outside the boundaries of the law, making related crimes of murder, extortion, robberies, racketeering, and others a common practice for a billion-dollar industry, which, in turn, allows ignorant people to justify racist practices, social stigmas against the working class, and associate entire countries with their drug markets. Rich people do drugs, too, but when they do, it&#39;s treated as a scandal on the same level as cheating on a spouse if they&#39;re caught, and they have access to rehabilitation because they have money. They can also fake going to rehab or continue to do the drugs in secret because they have the money and the ability to feed their drug habit while experiencing little if any, jail or rehab time.  So long as racist, corrupt governments (like the United States) and the corporations that benefit from their laws exist, the war on drugs will never end because it won&#39;t stop the racist practices that make them rich. <br><br>If you want to address a health problem, you need a healthcare solution. The perfect example is the pandemic we&#39;re living in now. You don&#39;t go around arresting people who have COVID-19 or killing them to stop the disease, you make it so you treat the sick and prevent further cases through vaccinations and lockdowns. The drug abuse solution is simple: legalize all substances, make them simple to get, and create safe areas for people to get high without the risk of OD&#39;ing while providing counseling options, with many of them being free. This shifts the demand to a legal market where illegal enterprises hold no power and save more lives by treating it as a health, rather than a criminal problem. If you think that sounds ludicrous, that&#39;s exactly what Portugal did to address their drug problem, and drug-related deaths declined by over 50% in one year in that nation. <br><br>&quot;But who&#39;s going to pay for that? Isn&#39;t that communism? What about this and that and blah blah blah.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m sure most Americans and citizens of other nations would prefer to see their loved ones treated at a government-funded hospital rather than suffer at a private or government-funded prison. This practice is as communist as the current COVID-19 vaccine rollouts happening worldwide. We don&#39;t hate people who have addictions, as opposed to violent criminals, we pity them. We wish they could get help.

I watched it when it came out. I think this video did a really poor job overall. It explained everything fine. But I have lived my entire life thinking it was something that was unstoppable. And knowing that it was was pretty insightful to me. This video never made that clear. We are dealing with the mess ups of the generations before just like everything else. But I had the understanding of it was something that was always going to happen. But it actually wasn&#39;t. They had a chance to stop it like 50 years ago and messed it up so badly that we will never have a chance again. Because as time goes on cartels just exponentially grows. So there was a point of no return somewhere along the lines that we will never know of. Because I mean Mexico&#39;s government is outgunned now by cartels that started off selling drugs after prohibition. But I think I got the impression of it being inevitable from this video. I watched a VICE documentary that I think covers this a lot better. You just used yours to bash the US prison system, meanwhile Joe Biden and his crime bill created the disparities in prisons. But you push the same ideology subliminally that voted for Joe Biden 20 years later. But this video is supposed to make you feel helpless and then narcisistically good about yourself because you want to let people who are in prison for stupid reasons out. Which is a childish argument of &quot;Yes I have common sense. And everyone who disagrees with me is evil.&quot; Meanwhile you just voted the guy in who did it. Smart people use limited truths to push agendas. Not lies. The tricky part is setting it up so you&#39;re argument is always the good side and everyone against you is evil. Thats why you need really simple childish arguments like &#39;Yes we should let the father of 5 children out of prison. Who had a joint in his car 20 years ago.&#39; Its never that simple and you presenting it that way is malicious. If anyone wants to learn about this stuff more I&#39;d recommend watching VICE&#39;s old documentaries. Their company is just propaganda now. But they do have some good ones. But their videos on drug addicts in Florida and the other ones are really good. Theres one that focuses on the war on drugs that does a much better job than this video. And in that video on VICE the scariest thing I learned is that in 2011 they shut down &#39;pill mills&#39; which were places were people walked in to get prescriptions and they would be given 100&#39;s of pills without even talking to another person. So like its not just the 50 years ago thing we had a choice with. We were actively promoting it and probably still are. We just don&#39;t know. Its a lot easier to say &quot;I want to let people out prison and get tax payers to pay for their everything so I feel good about myself.&quot; And watching addicts trying to recover is one of the saddest things you&#39;ll ever see. There are two people who are angels who run around trying to help these people.

Drugs make humans behave in terrible, destructive ways. This fact does not depend on rules imposed by society on itself. <br><br>In the United States, most drug abusers are arrested after royally screwing up, i.e.  driving intoxicated, wrecking their car and endangering or killing others. Arresting people who are endangering others is common sense. You lose the privilege of driving AND making your own choices.<br><br>Why do people in the US engage in so much drug-related crime including theft, prostitution, etc.? It is to fund their addiction. When they run out of money, they turn to crime in order to get that money. Then they get in trouble with the law, and are subsequently arrested for the harm and destruction they cause other human beings. This is not unjust.<br><br>True, sometimes people are arrested on nonviolent possession charges. Perhaps there could be some reform here. But if you have ever worked in public service before, you know that drugs are almost always involved with harmful, illicit behavior. This behavior is unnecessary if you are a functional addict.

Some people voluntarily go, many do not. The one thing about US rehab is in general we don&#39;t keep your addiction going, we help you quit cold turkey. Unfortunately this is extremely difficult to do, but it is necessary for long term health and happiness. <br><br>The real argument for or against the efficacy of the Swiss model is whether or not the model reduces drug dependence.

Kurzegstat makes a good point about how certain societal ills can be reduced if someone intervenes in the process. But we need to know, does this actually help solve the drug addiction problem?<br><br>The ultimate goal of society should be to live sober and drug-free, not to help people continue making terrible choices. Believe me, it is possible to live this way, and quite common.<br><br>The Swiss model is also a war on drugs, it&#39;s just a different philosophy.", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T22:06:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "somebody nothing", "comment_text": "Just give us drugs mmmmkay", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T15:43:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Philip Damberg", "comment_text": "This YouTube channel is teaching me more than school", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T12:46:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "karlos katerman", "comment_text": "Warum auf einglisch wenn der Titel deutsch ist?", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T08:30:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lello Lemon", "comment_text": "I should totally stop binging these videos and start doing my homework but I&#39;m learning way more and this is WAY more fascinating", "comment_date": "2021-11-12T05:21:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sekroz", "comment_text": "Drugs won.", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T23:40:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fabrizio Carbajal Pimentel", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt is the best philosopher I\u2019ve ever met, it talks with proves and when it is wrong it admites it is, rather than accomplish and blame others.

There&#39;s a reason it wasn&#39;t wall street guys taking stimulants that ended up in the mass incarceration, there&#39;s a reason it was Black neighbourhoods that the cia flooded with crack to fund the contras, and there is a reason why crack carries a harsher prison sentence than the drugs rich white people are using. Politicians lie, the war on drugs was never about the drugs. The war on drugs was just what the think tanks came up with to target people who have been targeted by this country since its founding. Slavery in the united states is illegal except for in prisons where America just so happens to have more prisoners per capita than anywhere else in the world, and the people brought to the country as slaves are over represented in this prison system. Good o&#39;l US of A never stopped its enslavement of Black people and have since expanded the industry to capture white ones as well. Ask any poor person and they&#39;ll be able to tell you why substance use is so high in poor communities. In a country that would see you homeless and begging for table scraps over a medical emergency, where people spend 40+ hours a week toiling to watch the majority of their earnings go to landlords, the mental and physical stress is unbelievable. Joints stiff and swollen day in and day out as you go through constant psychological and emotional pain; substances are the only way to get through it. The &quot;drug&quot; problem is a problem of America&#39;s making and a problem it could solve any time by treating its citizenry like humans as opposed to cattle. And even if you are the perfect gold star little boot licker who downs the koolaid and follows every law to a T, you can still end up as one of the country&#39;s slaves. All it takes is one traffic stop where an officer plants something on your vehicle and your life is over. Even if you keep your head down and do your best to get through your slave term you are going to walk out of that place heavily traumatized and unable to find work. Good luck getting through ptsd without substances when you&#39;ve been displaced from your community by several years and no one will hire you because of your criminal record. Therapy is more expensive than any substance you&#39;ll find helpful, and because you&#39;ve already been brutalized by the system once you&#39;re going to be an easy target for police harassment. Good luck staying out of prison. There is a reason why America has one of the highest recidivism rates in the world. And once you&#39;ve been through it once, they can throw an even harsher amount of years at you the next time you&#39;re tried.

Well they undercut the people who are doing it legally, and cut their profit margins so that the small businesses growers don\u2019t make it and go bankrupt. The unpermitted growers also go out into national forests and set up illegal grows where they divert natural streams which kill native species of fish, they use illegal pesticides which are highly toxic to humans and wildlife, and the field workers living remotely in secrete have to live off the land and they kill every animal in a 10 mile radius for food. And illegal grow site is disgusting. Pesticides, trash, and dead animals everywhere. Oh a d those illegal growers carry guns. Even more fun for law enforcement. So just remember, legalizing doesn\u2019t solve all your problems, there are new ones to tackle.

Drug users are like Indians, they&#39;re up in the trees going, &quot;[puff puff puff puff] Are they fightin&#39; us? We&#39;re not even in that fuckin&#39; field! I guess we&#39;re winning by default! No combat, we&#39;re ahead!&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Drug... you know, War on Drugs.\r<br>Hey, I don&#39;t get it, because alcohol and cigarettes are drugs. So the war has definitely taken a cease-fire here, hasn&#39;t it? Yeah.\r<br>Alcohol and cigarettes kills more people than crack, coke and heroin combined!\r<br>\r<br>You never see a positive drug story on the news, do ya? No.\r<br>Always negative. News is supposed to be objective, isn&#39;t it? Supposed to be? THE news? But every drug story is negative?\r<br>Well, hold it! I&#39;ve had some killer times on drugs!\r<br>I&#39;m not promotin&#39; it, but I&#39;m not denying it. Let&#39;s hear the whole story!\r<br>Same LSD story every time. &quot;Young man on acid thought he could fly, jumped out of a building. What a tragedy.&quot;\r<br>What a dick!\r<br>Don&#39;t go blaming acid on this guy. If he thought he could fly, why didn&#39;t he take off from the ground first and check it out?\r<br>He&#39;s an idiot. He&#39;s dead. Good.\r<br>You mean there&#39;s one less doorknob in the world? Whoo! What a tragedy!\r<br>&quot;Why so down, Bill?&quot;\r<br>&quot;We&#39;re missing a moron! Ohhh! We&#39;re missin&#39; a moron.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>I&#39;d like to see a positive LSD story, would that be newsworthy? Just once? Hear what it&#39;s all about?\r<br>&quot;Today, a young man on acid realized that all matter is merely energy condensed to a slow vibration, that we are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream and we are the imagination of ourselves. Here&#39;s Tom with the weather!&quot;\r<br>&quot;Gol&#39;. Did you see the news?&quot;\r<br>\r<br>You know it&#39;s not gonna... it&#39;s not a War on Drugs. It&#39;s a War on Personal Freedom is what it is, okay? Keep that in mind at all times. Thank you.\r<br>They lump all drugs together, that&#39;s not gonna work. Pot AND crack? Hey hey hey, dude, don&#39;t put pot in the drug category. It&#39;s an HERB, man.\r<br>Like TEA.\r<br>\r<br>Not only do I think pot should be legalized, I think it should be mandatory.\r<br>Think about it, you get in traffic behind somebody, [imitates truck horn honking]\r<br>&quot;Shut up and smoke that.

Drugs are EVIL!\r<br>Except for that guy! [giggles] They work real good for him.

Get some hits!\r<br>\r<br>This guy defies the edge, man.\r<br>Keith Richards outlived Jim Fixx, the runner and health nut dude.\r<br>The plot thickens.\r<br>\r<br>You remember Jim Fixx?

They&#39;re in traffic.\r<br>&quot;I gotta get skinnier. I gotta be thinner.&quot;\r<br>Dude, you&#39;re gonna get hit in the head with a car.\r<br>You&#39;re gonna look real good like a puddle, okay?\r<br>&quot;Wow, what a thin-looking, healthy puddle that is!&quot;\r<br>&quot;I&#39;m uh, still... I&#39;m still not good enough.\r<br>Still not good enough.&quot;\r<br>Alright.\r<br>I was born perfect. Been that way ever since. Sorry. I have an unscrappable faith.\r<br>\r<br>Remember Jim Fixx, though? This guy used to write books about jogging.\r<br>What do you jot down about jogging, you know? &quot;Right foot, left foot... Faster faster... Go home shower.&quot;\r<br>Oh, okay! Thanks, Jim, for putting that literary mind to the jogging issue.

But I would say a bigger problem that America is facing with its drugs is culture.  Yes, you can easily set up rehab clinics everywhere, and yes, you can create wholesome jobs for people to find beneficial purpose in life, BUT... controlling the environment is going to be difficult. Closing businesses that have a harmful effect on human mentality and physical health without having the data to back it up will be difficult, and even if you do have the data, the argument that because the substance does not kill someone instantly and effects are reversible means that it could be an issue held up in the courts for decades (e.g like trying to close a bakery store, not a nutritious product but the harmful effects are not instant). Then you need to be concerned with the already implemented merchandise which glorifies the interaction with the drugs (e.g Weed t-shirts), not to mention that the art itself (music, image, video) that encourages the use of drugs, even at first if you don&#39;t think it is beneficial, repeated exposure to content that suggests otherwise will loosen your willpower (a limited resisting resource) to resist drugs especially during a life experience that has harmful effects, the brain will try to find a way to ease the pain, both mentally and physically. CULTURE is the number #1 danger in America, and it is something people in their sensitivities will fight for, ultimately not being aware of the long-term damaging effects. Not every aspect of every culture is wrong but if you attack anyone&#39;s culture isolating a single action and not dealing with all other cultural problems, the attacking party will be perceived as having the intention of irradicating said culture. It&#39;s like trying to remove a pet leech from someone&#39;s arm and that person loves the leech dearly and won&#39;t demonize it because instantly they are not dying and conflates weakness from the leech effect and slight pain with general weakness and pain in life, not understanding the difference which is caused from not being instilled with the ability to distinguish (something your parent are supposed to do), Knowing clearly what is beneficial and what is harmful.", "comment_date": "2021-05-09T05:56:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ISLANDCREATURES", "comment_text": "Remeber future generations if you tell humans to not do something....theyll do it.", "comment_date": "2021-05-09T04:12:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wilfred V", "comment_text": "Great video, but only apply in the ideal condition where the Gov dont find convenient the cash flow coming from seize illegal operations.<br>From another perspective it could be seen as indirect taxation on population. <br>Im just saying", "comment_date": "2021-05-08T23:27:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Based American Interventionalism", "comment_text": "In the United States there are drug courts, which provide aid, help, and probation to drug users.

The real problem of the substance itself is the high potential for addictions. That combined with street heroin usually containing less than 10% heroin in favor of other substances that are a lot more toxic than the heroin itself. Also the injection as method of application is even more dangerous than other methods.<br>Furthermore the active dose is not that much lower compared to the lethal dose. This means that, especially after developing some tolerance, just small errors in the dosage can have lethal consequences. And not knowing how much heroin actually is in your stuff makes these errors a lot more common.<br>Therefore the access to clean heroin can not only allow measures for improving the patients general or social life to take effect but also heavily improves their physical health.", "comment_date": "2020-12-25T16:52:42Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "James Handaja", "comment_text": "The solution used in Switzerland will never be applied in the US.

I&#39;ve never met another like this.<br>So he had the drive and foundation to be dufferent, but sadly he took the wrong turn that friday night and it fucked him up real bad.<br>He found help and right now it&#39;s his second year if being clean.<br>I sometimes talk to him and couple of days I saw him after like 5 years or even more.<br>Sure... it left a mark on him.<br>He isn&#39;t the loud, hyperactive and always talking person like he was, but seeing him smile and he telling me how he wore a bag over his head when he was going for clean needles so no one could recognize him was ... really hard to listen to.<br>Now...<br>Imagine if he didn&#39;t had the chance to get help, rather was fined and put to jail with fellony (at least that&#39;s what I think is you are charged for in the USA mainly if you are a minority)<br>It&#39;s just so fucking stupid and backwards...<br>I talked with him about this and he told me it&#39;s like playing Dark Souls, but with only 1 hp.<br>It is possible to finish the game (get clean) but it&#39;s really, REALLY hard where with every restart you are more leaned towards ragequitting (keep on returning to drugs)<br>I just can&#39;t imagine the state of thought when you are black, hyspanic or whatever in the US and having drug problems.<br>Another thing is healthcare in general... paying for even calling an ambulance, then for the time spent there and for getting fixed.<br>I&#39;d rather rot alive then have some huge debt up my ass... another reason not to seek help (I&#39;ve heard aboutfree organizations that helps addicts, but ffs it should be the state to take care of it&#39;s citizens, not other people from their good will)<br>Anyone wondering how medical stuff works here, it&#39;s that you pay insurance every month (~$50-$100 don&#39;t know exactly the number)<br>and everthing is for free.<br>You broke a bone? no problem.<br>You have some serious injury? same thing<br>But when you are emloyed anywhere... the employer the pays the insurance.<br>So if you work like a regular person should, there&#39;s nothing to care or worry about.<br>Well, anyone bored/interested to read this whole thing and having something to say, please do ...

I&#39;ve found the &#39;War on Drugs&#39; to be one of the greatest failures in U.S. history. These failures include: Economic, Legislation, humanitarian, foreign relations, and adoption of corruption within government and policy . <br><br>From its very inception, it has been Machiavellian in nature written up by a President who was removed from office for his corruption and you got it.... His Machiavellian practices. Who would have thought he had &#39;The Prince&#39; on his bedside table (ironic). Rarely did this administration mob which gave life to such a failure, consider the best interest of the 100&#39;s of millions of lives this would impact in a very negative manner. <br><br>The negative impact this has had, is by and large one of the greatest tragedies in the free world. Once again, defined by a person who felt it necessary to exercise their will above the constitution of the United States as a &#39;necessary evil&#39;. There are absolutely zero studies suggesting that in any way, shape, or form that the &#39;war on drugs&#39; has been successful. These negative impacts include: Popularizing drug culture, promoting systemic stigmas on behavioral health, exposing our police force, by over extending their responsibilities. In ways that are both unethical, and unconstitutional. We should not blame the police for failed policy and legislation. They didn&#39;t write it, they&#39;re enslaved to it.<br><br>It takes more lives of innocence than all of the world wars combined, but we still condone this, and go so far as to fund this with no study, scientific, or mass acceptance illustrating any success at all. Don&#39;t defund the police, end the greatest failure in U.S. history. End the &#39;war on drugs&#39;. Sorry.... saying the &#39;war on drugs&#39; feels idiotic in every sense of the word. It equivalent to saying &#39;the war on the mentally ill&#39; or &#39;the war on the impoverished&#39;. It&#39;s simply one of the dumbest things ever conjured up by a human. Which has created so much despair that it can never be reconciled, only forgot.... we will look back on it in the future as a brain fart, another shameful part of our rocky history.

You understand what I\u2019m saying? We knew we couldn\u2019t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d<br><br><br>The thing also is, this was not the first time this occured. In the 30&#39;s, in order to secure foundings, a campaign was launched against marijuana consumption, stating this drug made murderous degenerates out of those who take it, and tying this consumption to mexicans - for good measure.<br><br><br>Time for a retractation/update video maybe?", "comment_date": "2019-11-11T19:14:40Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "nisa202", "comment_text": "Now stop promoting abstinence and we&#39;ll have stop that teen pregnancy problem too.", "comment_date": "2019-11-11T09:23:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kit", "comment_text": "2 types of drugs:<br>Drugs-abusing em<br><br>Drugs-using em", "comment_date": "2019-11-11T08:15:31Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "hotdogsoda", "comment_text": "the government after seeing this video:<br><b>KURZGESAGT IS SECRETLY A DRUG CARTEL SHUT EM DOWN BOYS</b>", "comment_date": "2019-11-11T07:43:16Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "Aditya Purnama", "comment_text": "Breaking bad Easter egg at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUXLqNHCaI&amp;t=1m50s\">1:50</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUXLqNHCaI&amp;t=2m20s\">2:20</a>", "comment_date": "2019-11-11T00:40:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Torres", "comment_text": "I will just go back in time and kill the person who discover drugs", "comment_date": "2019-11-10T15:30:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R\u0103r\u0103", "comment_text": "This is bullshit!

So, yes, it&#39;s an improvement but the real solution is to end prohibition entirely.<br><br>As the video shows with the supply-side graph it is not possible to reduce demand of drugs by increasing the cost.

Therefore, reducing stress reduces the demand for drugs. This is one reason why Harm Reduction tends to work. However, thinking that Harm Reduciton alone is the solution and that prohibition can be in place and society can more or less go on as it is is misguided.<br><br>Prohibition needs to end, the social stresses that push the desire to consume drugs needs to be addressed, and sure HR outreach, most especially prescription heroin need to be in place.

They won&#39;t compromise to reality, instead, they want reality to adjust to their expectations and values.

I think the Hardline policy is similar with what is implemented here in the Philippines. The government informed the public that there will be a war on drugs to be implemented and they are asking for those people involved to surrender and undergo  rehabilitation program. I do not have much idea on how it works but it proves effective in our society because it lessens the crime rate and more filipinos would say that they feel safer with its implementation. You see, we filipinos do not tolerate drug use by any member of the family. It is not practiced mostly on each filipino family and if one family is involved, other members of the society are vocal on exposing them and would tell younger generation to avoid them because it would never bring benefits to themselves. Most filipino families do not own guns too to show power and threat to anyone who wishes to expose that they operating drug use or merchandise. The use of drugs is definitely not part of our culture since it is already embedded in our minds the bad causes it will bring so there is no reason to try. Filipinos are family-oriented and when told what bad thing is, we follow for the sake of respect and understanding. The real questions would be, why do we need these kind of drugs? Is it really necessary? Would it help your family better? Would it make your society happy and peaceful? Tolerating drug use is like allowing everyone to try these drugs because most people do it which I also mean that even those who do not want to try would experience peer pressure. Even regularizing drug use offers the same idea however, if this practice of regularizing drug use is effective to some then I am not against it as long as it helps these people.

The reason they haven&#39;t made the switch is simple - money. The US government actively supports drug trafficking and makes an enormous and lucratively tax free profit while doing so. There is sadly no method I can think of to actually end the US war on drugs. What needs to happen is for the profit that they are making to be cut-off so that that harm reduction becomes a more economic alternative to making shitloads of money trafficking drugs. The standing problem is that the US government essentially &#39;has that shit locked down&#39; war makes money, and war in places that are rich in the raw materials for the drugs, like vietnam and afghanistan make double money, half from war production and half from covert drug extraction. Additionally the prison crisis of over incarceration also makes big bucks due to government contracts with private prisons that often threaten to shut themselves down if more prisoners are not packed in (that&#39;s probably the most fucked up). Additionally pharmacuetical contracts encourage the medical industry to over-prescribe opiates to get people addicted to their prescription opiates until they realize the government trafficked street opiates are more personally cost effective. The only drug thats been largely untouched is the marijuana industry due to the incredible ease of growing a plant and waiting a bit then cutting some leaves and waiting a bit longer, since its something so many people can and will do the non government illegal market is more thriving than the former. Thus the US government has responded by attempting to sway public opinion towards legalization so that it can tax the substance and make money off it that way. I have little doubt that around the time 30 states have legalized recreational marijuana, the US government will federally legalize it to impose a federal tax on the substance along with the local state taxes that exist in legal state markets. The government knows what its doing and the only way to stop the war on drugs is to stop the US government from covertly trafficking them.", "comment_date": "2019-04-03T06:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "neoasura", "comment_text": "This is a nice naive view on the war on drugs.

You understand what I&#39;m saying? We knew we couldn&#39;t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.\u201d<br><br>And <i>that</i> is why we have the war on drugs, straight from the horse\u2019s mouth.

Prohibition has failed in every manner possible and it&#39;s actually made things worse. The only possible solution I can see is legalization and regulation of quantity and quality. But that is extremely hard because the drug industry is huge and its tentacles have reached the foundations of our society. In other words there&#39;s a lot of money to be made and it&#39;s a market that will never cease to exist. Legalizing drugs would mean huge price drops and consecutively a halt to all sorts of illegal money making activities and jobs not to mention legal institutions that benefit from drug money would suffer insane losses.

A more Acidic body if you need energy.<br>Just remember that Cancer and other Molds prefer Acidic Environments.<br>Easy way to remember, the more acidic the battery, the more juice to start of run things. If your blood is to acidic, your red blood platelets will be attracted to each other and circulation will slow down. Also, the more your blood is acidic, your body will steal calcium from your bones to reduce the acidity. Not good. So having a lot of energy is not a sign your body is healthy, it is a sign it is acidic. Energy is just a side effect of the Alchemy your body is doing, with what you are feeding it. SO what is acidic inside the body?<br>Meats<br>Milk, Cheese, Ice Cream and Yogurt of any kind<br>Nuts and Seeds (milks made from nuts)<br>Grains and Rice (Milk made from rice)<br>Oats<br>Pasta (grains)<br>Breads (grains)<br>Soda of any kind, even carbonated water as that is Co2 charged water.

It is a massive failure. In Vancouver they established safe injection sites, free needle/crack pipes,  methadone programs, the government bought all the seedy hotels and cleaned them up. There are dozens of agencies &quot;helping&quot; addicts . It was and still is held up as a model for harm reduction. The results - in 2016 there was a dramatic increase in ODs - 1400 people died in a city of 2 million including 17 in one day. 2017 is on a course to smash through the 2016 record. Cheap and powerful fentanyl is the problem.  So in their wisdom they decided to give addicts free morphine. They go every day to the drug store to get their morphine which they then sell on the street and use the money to buy more fentanyl. Yes the person is supposed to take the morphine pills right in the pharmacy but they are junkies and will do whatever to smuggle it out. The pharmacies also get paid a per diem so they turn a blind eye on the junkies leaving with the pills. HIV is down but who cares because that is treatable and most addicts will die of overdose long before AIDS. The downtown east side (DEST) is a disaster zone. Ambulances and paramedics are running through the streets 24x7, drug dealers on every corner. You can and I am not exaggerating buy down (fentanyl or heroin) or cocaine within 60 seconds in the DEST 24x365. If this is what success looks like I would hate to see what failure looks like. I was in the Netherlands a short time ago where they were thinking of putting a safe injection site in a neighborhood in Haarlem. The Vancouver &quot;model&quot; was held up as one that was highly successful. I showed the hotel owners public available stats and picture of what the model resulted in. I know the people that brought it in meant well but now they distort and lie about what is happening. They cannot however hide the death rate and the government hotels/SROs are unbelievable - junkies shooting up in the hallways and stairwells and rooms and all of this right under the noses in clear sight of the staff that work there.

I grew up during those times and I saw how harmful heroin can be to a society, and the difference today is unbelievable. Drug addicts have several places where they receive new needles, get HIV screening and most important of all, information. The staff are trained to steer them towards rehabilitation. We decriminalized drug possession up to a certain amount, which stopped draining government money and resources on pointless arrests of drug addicts and spent the money instead on rehabilitation programs. Today, drug-related crime decreased and we seldom see drug addicts on the streets (in contrast to the ubiquitous used syringes everywhere).  I&#39;m sad to see the US government hasn&#39;t learned yet from the ever-increasing amount of successful examples of that change in strategy. Drug addicts are victims, not criminals.

Your arguments you presented in this video are just kinda impractical.<br>Drug abuse and addiction has always caused issues in society, drug addicted people aren&#39;t productive cause they can&#39;t hold jobs and many turn to crime to support their expensive drug habits, it literally binds the mind to where people neglect hygiene and well being because their addicted to whatever, they devolve into lowlifes who don&#39;t do anything and have many dead brain cells.<br>You can&#39;t completely stop drug use and sales but to inform the population about the dangers of drugs and why you shouldn&#39;t use Meth, Heroin, etc. is a smart choice, while also stopping those who sell these substances for a quick buck. Mexico is a country that used to be safe but has had drugs binded into it&#39;s culture to where it&#39;s not a safe place to live and faces many issues. For decades Mexico has had issues with homicide and other crimes and the reason is because of drug cartels, organized crime in Mexico is out of control and though the country still has structure, Mexico and Central American countries have gotten to the point to where the drug cartels rival the power of law enforcement and even sometimes the government. Tons of Mexican citizens are murdered by drug cartels because the drug lords want the population to fear them or maybe just because a person happened to witness a crime. Police officers hesitate to do their job when it comes to arresting these drug distributors because they might retaliate and kill one of their family members.<br>Some government officials are even bribed to keep quiet about illegal activities because the drug lords can offer them more money than they make in 10 years. Firearms are banned but yet the cartels have arsenals of guns. One of the reasons why Mexicans are entering the U.S. is to leave their country which has been plagued by poverty and organized crime. <br>Maybe these issues root from Poverty and that&#39;s why people sell drugs, but it&#39;s poisonous to society.<br>I could keep going on about this but I don&#39;t ever think that the U.S. government is gonna provide welfare or support for drug users, the concept of using tax payer money to provide addicts with whatever their smoking isn&#39;t gonna do much, there still gonna be drug addicts. Even if you do take the criminal equation out of selling drugs it&#39;s still bad, people are gonna abuse Opium and other drugs no matter what but if you don&#39;t take measures to stop drug trafficking and teach people about the dangers of drugs then your just letting a problem arise.<br>And for the most part I think the exact opposite of what you should do is give heroine addicts free heroine.<br>Sorry if this comment was too long.", "comment_date": "2017-06-22T04:18:37Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "Avry", "comment_text": "Oh because of course drug cartels would require the state justice to solve problems between then, such a happy fake world", "comment_date": "2017-06-22T00:25:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WafflyNimb", "comment_text": "Well, let&#39;s see what&#39;s America&#39;s most likely answer to your solution proposal:<br><br>Americans: THAt&#39;S COMMUNISM TALK!

Libertarians would have countries&#39; governments address the problem of drugs by very stringently and dogmatically refusing to be involved in any way with anything or anyone related to drugs that is not also involved in an actual crime. Even though it does appear true that vast community benefits can arise from providing state care to addicts, we believe that it is categorically wrong to do so for ideological reasons and while we would of course encourage everyone to donate to non-profit charities that could be involved in such endeavors, we could not be more opposed to a government operation to do the same. (some libertarians may disagree and that is valid, it is because <b>moderate</b> libertarians believe that at present all nations are so far removed from the ideal of <b>radical</b> libertarianism that it is the most useful to try to focus on just small changes to the most important issues, to make the most difference that can be made in a world where libertarianism is really very unpopular and typically unknown.

It was designed to convince the viewer of Kurzgesagt&#39;s political position, rather than to analyse the problem. That&#39;s okay, if rather out of place for a pop-science channel, given science&#39;s objective nature. For an example of an important issue omitted from the video due to its falling on the other side of the debate, consider the cost of providing the recommended health service. Developed countries generally spend very large portions of their budget on healthcare, and healthcare budgets generally increase at a rate outstripping inflation for a variety of factors. The long term economic implications of Kurzgesagt&#39;s proposed policy are complicated, and rather off-putting. That isn&#39;t to say Kurzgesagt&#39;s position is wrong. I just think it is important to intake this piece of media whilst understanding its bias.<br><br>On a separate point, it is worth noting that anyone who intentionally uses illegal drugs at the moment is likely contributing to crime and harm (unless you know the exact way in which your drugs were produced, and are sure no one was harmed in their production). The point of this is that to use illegal drugs now is probably wrong, because the use of the drugs supports the harmful means by which they were produced and transported. Hopefully this serves to encourage people to not use drugs at the moment, especially imported drugs, because of the negative effect they have on the world.

Even if they only meant to try a drug, they knew there was a chance they&#39;d get addicted, and took that risk. Everything that follows is on them.<br>Why should welfare be cut when the country is in economic crisis, but people who are addicts get free drugs? Someone can be born unable to work for themselves, be hit by a car, or something like that, but no one is born holding a heroine needle, and no one walking on the side of the street suddenly gets hit by one, and has it happen to them again and again until they become dependent on it.<br>Think of the purge, it&#39;s a dystopian society where one night a year people are allowed to commit any crime they want, because the government gave up on fighting it. How&#39;s that different from giving addicts free drugs? A whole group of criminals (I.E. dealers and customers) Is going to be legalized in this hypothetical scenario, because they put up so much of a fuss killing and stealing, that the U.S government just gives in, and actually enables them by GIVING them drugs and housing. What other groups of criminals are going to be humored because they&#39;re a danger to themselves and others? What ever happened to &quot;America doesn&#39;t negotiate wit terrorists&quot;?<br>If you are an average human being, you are capable of following the law, and working in society. You don&#39;t have the right to choose to get addicted to something, become a danger to yourself and others because of it, and then use that as a way of negotiating what laws you will and won&#39;t follow, and where, when and how you&#39;ll be a productive member of society again. No one deserves that kind of special treatment, not even the president should be allowed to act like that, so why should any random citizen. <br>Do you think if we were to start doing this, everybody else in society would continue to do their jobs and pay their rent, and stay off drugs? No. There would be no legal consequence to doing drugs, and there would be benefits. And despite the law, drugs will still continue to have horrible physical consequences. We can&#39;t have a society of people with fried brain cells and weak, breaking bodies by their own self infliction, telling the police the government or whoever that they will and will not be a drain on society, or a hazard to others whenever they do and don&#39;t feel like it. And the worst part, this wouldn&#39;t be like welfare where you have to be born disabled, or be disabled by an accident or something. Anyone would be able to find drugs, get addicted, and then get more for free. There are people who take advantage of welfare, but most people wouldn&#39;t face the terrible pain of breaking their legs to permanently cripple themselves, or give themselves a life threatening heart condition that makes it dangerous for them run or physically exert themselves. What would someone have to do to get on the free drugs and housing program? Get high and keep doing it for free. Why should we add a whole new branch of what&#39;s basically welfare, for people facing the consequences of their CHOICES? It&#39;s not that much better than sending them to prison, except they still get to do drugs and have free range of the streets. It&#39;s basically wasting tax dollars to not solve the problem.<br>Yes, there are problems with the war on drugs, and no it isn&#39;t very effective, but one percent is still saving millions of people, as appose to enabling them.  Things do need to change and be made more efficient, but not by legalizing everything, and giving away drugs for free on tax dollars. That&#39;s the exact opposite of helping, for the same if not higher price in taxes.", "comment_date": "2016-03-07T01:36:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hello Sir I see that you are reading my name that definitely is not long and convoluted", "comment_text": "its kind of a good thing though because weed is getting better every year", "comment_date": "2016-03-07T01:03:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan R", "comment_text": "Switzerland is proven great once again", "comment_date": "2016-03-07T00:50:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Doug Holmes", "comment_text": "What, you&#39;re saying that we should be treating people with empathy versus outright hostility?

The war on drugs here in the US is a bunch of bullshit. Hell, I was once addicted to a drug many years ago, and as someone with no money.. when I finally realized how bad my life had gotten and wanted to stop, I tried to get help. After calling everywhere in the state, my options were basically go to rehab for 600-1000+ dollars.. more than I had.. or get a free crappy counselor meeting (where I was told I&#39;d have to wait 5-6 months just to get into a little 20-30 minute talk/session with them). Oh, and there was one other option, which was a methadone clinic. Not only did I have to pay for it.. it was a 45 minute drive from where I lived. And with these clinics, you have to come there once a day just to get your doses for that one day. I didn&#39;t even own a car. So, I was pretty much forced to do a really dangerous cold turkey, which was potentially deadly because of how serious it was. Though, thankfully, I&#39;m alive, obviously.<br><br>And now, because I had one drug addiction once in my life many years ago, and never had any other drug/alcohol abuse history, nor any criminal record whatsoever.. I&#39;ve been treated like shit by doctors and those in the medical field ever since then.

If you have a democracy, you can elect yourself fascist. Fascism is the imposition of the opinions and beliefs of the minority onto the majority. -Ralph Metzner<br><br>The state, should not in the matter of drugs, any more than in the matter of sex, act as the secret agent for the agenda of the church. People want to stimulate themselves, they want to explore their consciousness, they want to sedate themselves, who are we to stand in their way with a moral ideology and the long heavy arm of the law to interfere with that. It distorts civilized values. That&#39;s the bottom line. Drug repression distorts civilized values and political discourse. -Terence McKenna<br><br>When the state sends us to prison for essentially exploring our own consciousness, this is a grotesque abuse of human rights. It&#39;s a fundamental wrong. If I as an adult am not sovereign over my own consciousness, then I&#39;m absolutely not sovereign over anything. I can&#39;t claim any kind of freedom at all. And what has happened over the last 40-50 years under the disguise of the war on drugs, is that we have been persuaded to hand over the keys of our consciousness to the state. The most precious, the most intimate, the most sapient part of ourselves... The state now has the keys. And further more, they&#39;ve persuaded us that that&#39;s in our interest. This is a very dangerous situation. -Graham Hancock<br><br>There is no war on drugs, you can&#39;t have a war on inanimate objects. There&#39;s a war on drug addicts. -Gabor Mate<br><br>Drugs might actually cause people to wake up to some of the abuses and scams being run by capitalism and government -Terence McKennna<br><br>The whole drug thing is properly understood as a civil rights issue. People should be able to take whatever drugs they damn well please. In the same way they should be able to express their sexual preferences. In the same way that women should be allowed to vote. In the same way that people of low incidence of light reflectivity should be treated like everybody else. You cannot have a free society and regulate people&#39;s drug use.

The Bible-thumper: Those who have never read Genesis <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUXLqNHCaI&amp;t=1m11s\">1:11</a>, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUXLqNHCaI&amp;t=1m29s\">1:29</a>, 9:3, and Ecclesiasticus 38:4 or just ignore them. <br><br>2. The Authoritarian: Those that think that people have the right to tell another peaceable person what they can or cannot put on or in their own body under threat of physical and monetary punishment. <br><br>3. The Sheep: Those who just do as they are told without question and think the government knows what&#39;s best for them. Remember, slavery was legal. The Holocaust was legal. Segregation was legal. Never use the state as a metric of ethics. <br><br>4. The Over Protective Parent: Those who don&#39;t want it in the hands of children, yet they probably have alcohol and prescription drugs in the fridge or cupboard, not realizing that those can kill their children and cannabis cannot. <br><br>5. The Ignorant: Those who think that it can kill you even though it has an ED50:LD50 of between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUXLqNHCaI&amp;t=1m20s\">1:20</a>,000-<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJUXLqNHCaI&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a>,000; and those who think it has no medicinal value even though we have things like Marinol and U.S. Patent #6630507. Those that think smoking cannabis is the only way to ingest it and those that think it kills brain cells. <a href=\"http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/does-marijuana-kill-brain-cells\">http://www.drugpolicy.org/blog/does-marijuana-kill-brain-cells</a><br><br>6. The Idiot: Those who aren&#39;t intelligent enough to realize that something that can&#39;t kill you (cannabis) is unequivocally less dangerous than something that can kill you (alcohol, caffeine, cocaine, crack, heroin, meth, nicotine, prescription drugs). It is a safer alternative to lethal, recreational chemicals. <br><br>7. The A**hole: Those who don&#39;t want to admit that they have been wrong all these years and/or have punished someone for it. <br><br>8. The Pig: Those who enjoy depriving humans of their life, liberty, happiness, loved ones and possessions over non-violent, victim-less acts such as possessing an all-natural and 100% non-lethal plant. Also, anyone who benefits from asset forfeiture. Cops, judges, prosecutors. <br><br>9. The Greedy: Those who stand to lose money if it was legalized nationally. Cops, judges, prosecutors, cartels, the private prison system, oil companies, Big Pharma, lumber industries, alcohol companies, tobacco companies, etc. <br><br>10. The Hypocrites: Those who think it makes you dumb, yet they will never be as intelligent as Carl Sagan; those who think it makes you lazy, yet will never be as physically adept as Micheal Phelps; and those who think it makes people worthless, yet will never be as talented as their favorite musician. Also, people who drink alcohol and say that drugs are bad, not realizing that alcohol is a drug. <br><br>11. The Nosy: Those who want it to stay illegal because they don&#39;t like the smell of it. Even though by that logic we should outlaw cooking meat because vegans don&#39;t like the smell of burning flesh. They probably think we should outlaw farts and water treatment plants, too. <br><br>12. The Straight edge: The arrogant people who think that because they don&#39;t want or like something, no one else should be allowed. <br><br>13. The Gateway theorists: Those that think it is a gateway drug. If that&#39;s true, Willie Nelson has some explaining to do. Also, curiosity is the only gateway drug. <br><br>14. The &quot;it causes crime&quot; people: Cannabis doesn&#39;t cause crime, prohibition does. Example: Alcohol prohibition and Al Capone.<a href=\"http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/marijuana-legalization-colorado-one-year-status-report\">http://www.drugpolicy.org/resource/marijuana-legalization-colorado-one-year-status-report</a> <br><br>15. The &quot;what message does it send to the kids?&quot; people: It sends them the message to not ingest lethal recreational chemicals. It sends the message that intelligent people know that cannabis is far less dangerous than any man-made chemical. <br>BONUS: How to talk to your kids about drugs; 1. Don&#39;t do drugs. 2. Don&#39;t do drugs. 3. If you are going to use drugs, choose the only one that can&#39;t kill you from overdose.<br><br>Cannabis doesn&#39;t kill people, people kill people; which, ironically, makes it unequivocally less dangerous than the evil, soulless, sub-human sloppy pools of maggot ridden dog excrement who support and enforce it&#39;s prohibition; and those that support the enforcers that have failed miserably at their endeavor to eradicate it from our country. <br><br>Note: If you don&#39;t oppose the legalization of cannabis, none of these apply to you. Also, I didn&#39;t write this for your arrogant ass.

Acetaminophen, AKA Tylenol, can cause liver damage and internal bleeding if taken in high doses or for long periods of time. Shit, you can get crazy high from Robitussin!!! And if you think the drug cartels are ruthless, how about charging people THOUSANDS of $$ for HIV meds, you know the ones THEY NEED TO LIVE!! I used to work in a pharmacy and I&#39;ve see it all. The drug companies are in cahoots with the insurance companies to make sure they make a ton of money. I mean, that one dude bought out an HIV med and raised the price to &gt;$700 a pill. A PILL. FOR A DRUG PEOPLE NEED TO LIVE SO HE CAN BANK MORE BUCK!!! I&#39;ll tell you this too, there is a good chance these companies have cures for diseases. They won&#39;t sell it because you can&#39;t profit from people that are cured. You can only rape them for money by selling them a little bit of the antidote over long periods of time. WAKE UP PEOPLE! Not only does the war on drugs need to change, but so does the entire drug industry. You should not be able to patent a remedy or a cure, yet it&#39;s done all the time SO YOU CAN GET RIPPED OFF!!
