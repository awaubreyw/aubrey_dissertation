However there are some errors in it, a few common misconceptions, that I thought would need addressing :<br><br>- <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=3m18s\">3:18</a> : this is only valid for a static observer, who uses rockets to stay motionless at a constant altitude (so an observer who experiences a very strong acceleration, which is actually what creates this fast-forward effect in their field of view). For a falling observer the passage of time in the outside universe would actually look slowed down, because of the Doppler effect. The observers falls away from the light of distant stars, and hence they receive it in increasingly slower motion.<br><br>- <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=4m31s\">4:31</a> : this is not correct. As a free falling observer, you would never have the impression of crossing the horizon, and the universe behind you will always take more than 50% of your field of view, even when you are technically inside the black hole. (See for example the simulations by Andrew J. S. Hamilton about falling into a Schwarzschild black hole) This is due to the effect of light aberration, caused by your very high speed. Actually, nothing special can be seen when you cross the horizon, you can&#39;t determine visually that you just crossed it, it&#39;s a fundamental principle due to the fact that the horizon is not a physical surface, and it doesn&#39;t exist locally (the horizon only makes sense on a global sense, at a large scale). And in particular you can still see the outside universe when you are inside the black hole, since the light from distant starts falls with you.", "comment_date": "2022-05-19T18:01:40Z", "likes_count": 80}, {"comment_by": "\u0160imon Kubi\u0161", "comment_text": "Thanks god you are here.

I&#39;m astonished I got that idea correct, after seeing this several years later! I love space and physics so much as a teen I actually programmed a space simulation of planets on my texas instruments calculator. I managed to make two objects orbit around each other using Newton&#39;s laws of physics. I&#39;m obsessed with how they work and I&#39;ve watched countless hours of simulations. It&#39;s just heartwarming to see that all those things I imagined many years ago are in coordination with these theories here. <br><br>One thing I like to point out is that if these black holes shrink mass escapes the black hole. The black hole loses its size because of anti particles. Which means, the mass that escaped is a COMPLETELY new mass that never existed since the beginning of the universe. So after a incomprehensible amount of time I wonder if the Universe can be reborn again if the particles that were ejected pull each other back to a correlated center. I think if civilizations found out a way to enter and exit a black hole at the perfect time you could potentially see the second rebirth occur. If this new mass thing is true, that means it will be compliant to the fear of time paradox. Once you enter, the mass of you will slowly wither away because of anti-matter and the existence of your atoms will never be seen ever again. Because of this the fear of time paradox&#39;s will be null and void because no matter inside the black hole will get a chance to influence matter outside it. This is very good news because this means the Universe potentially will restart and stars can burn once again. <br><br>White holes are a different story, and I have to study that a lot more to understand what it could potentially do.", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T10:13:50Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "LODIELIE B", "comment_text": "but what do we know?", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T23:37:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ilvaia", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a>", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T03:03:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "FT Wan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=2m29s\">2:29</a> that particle just winked at me \ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2022-05-07T02:02:07Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Skip", "comment_text": "&quot;there are no cool ways to die&quot;<br>Cool ways to die:", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T13:32:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Da H rubber", "comment_text": "I just wanted a stellaris black hole travelling mod but I&#39;ve found this.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T22:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I am strange", "comment_text": "Probs to the guy who went into a black hole for this video", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T10:17:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ash Ary", "comment_text": "Just think for a second if you ever fell into a black hole you&#39;ll live as long as the universe, because everything outside the Black hole will age much faster and die in a split second, you&#39;ll be the last concious being to die and when that happens the universe will age infinitely fast because there are no observers to see it age.", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T06:00:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SAIKYO", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=9m35s\">9:35</a> lol this coment", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T03:41:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hannah Main", "comment_text": "Guys don\u2019t watch this while high", "comment_date": "2022-05-05T00:35:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GGGunnerdog", "comment_text": "i somehow learned more from this 12 minute video than in a span of 5 school years", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T23:37:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrLender89", "comment_text": "Loved the little Portal reference!", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T14:36:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "not macncheese", "comment_text": "Jupiter was my favorite planet because of it\u2019s gravitational pull.

They just created it to look exactly how science <i>says</i> it should look.  That it turned out to be something so visually arresting was just pure good fortune.  And yet, from now on for the rest of time that&#39;s how black holes are going to be depicted visually, or at least it&#39;s the clean-break starting point that may be elaborated on in the future as the science changes and our ability to turn theory into visuals advances.

And this is a legit, please-educate-me question! :-)<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=08m45s\">08:45</a> According to my limited understanding of Hawking Radiation, quantum particles are born from nothing (in essence) because when they are born, each fluctuation produces one particle of matter (+1) and one particle of anti-matter (-1), thus when they recombine they = 0 and both cease to exist, as you so awesomely stated.<br><br>However, at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=09m10s\">09:10</a>, you stipulate that Hawking radiation is &quot;new stuff, stealing mass from [the black hole]&quot;.<br><br>My question is that (again, according to my extremely limited understanding) nothing is stolen from a black hole, but rather the quantum radiation creates a particle or matter (+1) that escapes the event horizon, as well as one particle of anti-matter (-1) that is sucked into the black hole, and annihilates from existence the first particle of matter it touches. <br><br>Yes, the math is the same, whether the particle of hawking radiation &quot;steals&quot; the mass from a black hole, or whether the particle of mass is simply created and the resulting particle of anti-matter obliterates a particle of matter from the black hole, over all, the black hole is -1 particle of matter from the ordeal, HOWEVER, I don&#39;t agree with (and thus obviously don&#39;t properly understand) that black holes would thus ONLY shrink and die over time from a bombardment of 10^100x anti-matter (-1) particles.<br><br>Because (unless ONLY anti-matter particles are affected by the gravity at an event horizon) roughly half (50%, statically speaking due to the fact that only one of two possibilities can occur) of the quantum fluctuations would result in either the particle of anti-matter (-1) being sucked in (as previously outlined) OR, if the orientation of the initial fluctuation split is reversed, a particle of matter (+1) would get sucked in, resulting in the black hole GAINING a particle of matter and the resultant particle of anti-matter would drift off into space until it randomly crashed into a passing comet (or whatever), annihilating one particle of matter in our spacetime, resulting in the black hole increasing in size by one particle of matter instead of shrinking. <br><br>So my argument would be (again, everything statistically speaking) that either the black hole would remain the same size from exactly 50% of all hawking radiation fluctuations falling on both sides of the bell curve of matter (+1) or anti-matter (-1) being sucked in, OR the other argument is that some offset from the 50% would occur in which 50%+X% of the anti-matter particles get sucked in resulting in a smaller black hole, but that would theoretically be balanced out from another statistically mated black hole where 50%-X% of anti-matter particles get sucked in, resulting in a bigger black hole.<br><br><br>Thank you for your time with this question! :-)", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T17:37:06Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "A.K 47", "comment_text": "Like my coment and the video if u like/love science", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T17:03:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A.K 47", "comment_text": "I love science", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T17:03:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick N\u00e0y C\u1ee7a Qu\u00fd", "comment_text": "Love ur art", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T14:37:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Hawk", "comment_text": "Too sus", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T14:04:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The110678", "comment_text": "Scientists are horrible at naming things.", "comment_date": "2021-08-23T06:18:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The110678", "comment_text": "I love space.

I believe that people viewing a black hole see everything stop at the event horizon, because to the observer gravitational time dilation at the event horizon is infinite, so matter just appears to stop.

If these were the things God would judge us by, would He find us innocent or guilty? The answer? Guilty. Sinning against an infinite authority figure brings infinite punishment.

No, the fine has to be paid.<br><br>What about asking for forgiveness? If a criminal stands before a judge and says, I&#39;m really sorry... Should the judge let him go free? No, because that would be a bad judge. If he forgave every criminal because he loved them, that would not be doing justice. Justice has to be paid.

This is at least one field-theoretic way of describing the Hawking radiation more precisely, there are other complementary descriptions.", "comment_date": "2021-08-04T15:04:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rai Raicat", "comment_text": "I think we all are living in some organism\u2019s body and we all are tissues etc. And government is like an immune system that manages us all, and also if pandemic happens it comes up with anti virus like vaccine or quarantines us all.

It makes no sense to me to think that there would be anything else inside a black hole that isn&#39;t just everything that fell into its gravitational pull to became converted into a squished mesh of atoms under its enormous gravity. no portal to a different dimension, just a perfect ball so introvert it won&#39;t even let you see it. like imagine a planet, but put gravity and escape velocity to max settings. Its simple yet logical. i think psychologically speaking we have a hard time with black-holes because we think in a concept of a vacuum cleaner, were we assume that the trash it sucks in will be somewhere in its regular form in some other dimension when we should think in the concept of a super compressing gravity powered tool and everything become one thing converter.

Submitted to an extreme gravitational pressure, space-time changes its characteristics and starts to behave like an Incompressible Fluid and tends to grow and swell with time.

When it&#39;s gone, it is reconstructed and one single atom is removed from the Earth on the right. And again, the Earth on the left is deconstructed one atom per year, and when it&#39;s gone again, a 2nd atom is removed from the Earth on the right.

But no matter how high that kinetic energy is, it\u2019s not enough to escape the black hole. But there are two ways for a rocket to escape earth\u2019s gravity. One is for it to give itself enough kinetic energy that the kinetic energy exceeds the energy required to escape. The other way is for it to blast its engines continuously, maybe at a very slow rate but strong enough to make progress, and keep going and going and going until finally it gets far enough away that the gravity gets small enough that it escapes. Now, no rocket works that way because it would take an incredible amount of energy to escape that way, it\u2019s far easier and less energy consuming to just build up enough kinetic energy. But if you can\u2019t build up enough kinetic energy, as in the case of a black hole, then that alternative method, why wouldn\u2019t it work?<br><br>Let\u2019s look at it a different way. Suppose you stay well away from the black hole and you lower somebody down into it on a rope, a very strong rope or cable. Once they\u2019re down inside, past the black hole event horizon, you start pulling them back up. Why couldn\u2019t you pull them out?

If they are composed of &quot;black hole matter&quot; they shouldn&#39;t have it, or they should all have a charge proportional to their masses, and if it is due to charged particles they swallow, the electromagnetic field propagates as a wave at the speed of light, so it should not be able to go outside of the event horizon, should it?<br><br>2 - why the hawking radiation removes mass from the black hole? As I understand, it is in fact swallowing one particle, and gaining one particle of mass, not loosing it.<br><br>3 - this one is a thought experiment. If I had a very long rope, and I go near to a black hole and release the rope, so one extreme crosses the event horizon while I hold the other extreme (let&#39;s suppose I have an spaceship with enough power to keep me at a fixed distance of the black hole), what would happen? Would I be pulled into the black hole by the rope no matter what? Would the rope mechanically break due to the tension, with a piece falling inside and I keeping the other?

Do we know for certain that Black Holes have a Singularity? In the sense that everything is at a single point with 0 Dimensions. It is possible that it is a physical sphere that exists in 3 Dimensions like a Neutron star but more densely packed (say a Quark star)? Mathematics and logic would suggest that it must have a true physical size and not a single point with no dimensions (division by zero is illogical to even state as an equation, it not only has no answer but has no reason to ever be asked). Say a Neutron star of 10KM that has an escape velocity of 50% the speed of light, what if it compacts to 5KM as a Quark Star (or some other sub-Neutron sized particle) with an escape velocity of equal / greater than the speed of light so we cannot see it and would &quot;think&quot; we are looking at a Black Hole but if we could it would still be a sphere, just more Dense (I know that math isn&#39;t perfect, just creating a concept)... why do we default to an idea that it has 0 physical size? Do we really know for sure this isn&#39;t the case? Maybe a different sub-atomic particle that we have or haven&#39;t yet discovered is the true &quot;crunch limit&quot; of matter and the stuff Black Holes are made of. I&#39;ve heard before about Singularities that (they are not real, just a placeholder explanation for what we cannot yet explain like saying &quot;Magic&quot; in the middle ages for events that we could not explain via science at the time).

Because you can\u2019t get matter to squeeze any closer to itself then it already is, and we are saying literally a whole planet squeezed into a drop basically, but with your other video about neutron stars, the core of the neutron star has been theorized to be either a super dense core of protons, neutrons and electrons or a sea of quarks, and I understand that, but how can you squeeze something smaller then a quark? I just thought of something though, there is that thing it was, like, Einstein\u2019s quantum fabric theory or something like that, the smallest thing in the universe making everything up, I saw it on a website so I\u2019m not positive about it, but like, we don\u2019t know what the singularity of the black whole is but maybe it\u2019s made of a film of sorts basically it breaks down molecules by squeezing them tighter together until they burst like with the younger black holes, they squeeze you until your basically just a paste, through spaghettification so what if through the black holes it has the ability to break things down to yet simpler things, since it has as you\u2019ve said infinite mass, and since it is spinning so fast too, it must have to have infinite energy as well, which is something that us as humans would almost never be able to obtain, even using our current technology we would not even get close. Also, you said something about quantum fluctuations, how basically it\u2019s matter and antimatter being created out of nowhere colliding then becoming nothing again, I\u2019ve thought about it for a long time, cause I like thinking, and I don\u2019t do research making all my claims probably useless, but I\u2019ve been thinking, matter and anti matter when collided create a large amount of energy when they collide, where a gram of antimatter can do more damage then anything human made, but I\u2019ve thought, what if that is the other way to reach the smallest theorized building block, of course there\u2019s no way to know and no way to even interact with it, but it makes sense, it gives off an enormous amount of energy which would have to be the molecules obviously tearing themselves to shreds, but they \u201cbecome nothing\u201d but if you can\u2019t create or destroy matter, then they aren\u2019t, well, nothing, but the massive amount of energy, where does that come from, I believe it comes from not the separation of the molecular structure or anything, but the separation of the literal quarks because they all have a super tight grip on eachother, which without that super tight grip, then they never would\u2019ve been able to even make the first molecule stable enough to connect with another, or maybe, from the molecules of course having opposite charges, the quarks are actually tearing away from eachother in the antimatter and joining the other quarks in the regular matter which then they connect and who knows what happens next, they could\u2019ve either completely destroyed eachother or joined to make something new. Ok, enough rambling, what I\u2019m trying to say is even though a singularity may not have and surface area, that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t exist, so since they exist, how are they getting molecules so close to eachother, well, I don\u2019t think they are actually, I\u2019m thinking it could possibly exist somewhere else, because it may break the ways we see general relativity but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s breaking anything, that just means that it\u2019s somewhere else, and of course, this is all now science fiction, but how do wormholes work, they are a hole, on a 3D plane, but there\u2019s a problem, how do they exist? Well, maybe from expired supermassive black holes, or something, because even though from Hawking radiation all black holes die off eventually, well, there could be something special that happens with certain black holes where they loose enough mass to just become, neutral, they can\u2019t suck anything in anymore, but instead the gravity stops existing within the black hole, allowing it to possibly either tear itself apart still again with Hawking radiation or stabilize, and become a wormhole, everything has a stable point anyway, that\u2019s how we are alive and the suns and the planets and everything, they are stable, black holes are unstable on the outside yet stable on the inside, it if becomes stable on the outside it forms a wormhole...<br>Now don\u2019t take my word for any of this, I probably got a lot wrong, I just wanted to get my thinking out there because I love this kind of stuff, it\u2019s absolutely beautiful and fun to learn about, so if I got anything wrong, please tell me, thanks...", "comment_date": "2021-05-08T23:54:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hen ko", "comment_text": "&quot;their even more screwed up then they get credit for&quot; Me: Thank god some one is at least a fraction of how screwed up I am", "comment_date": "2021-05-08T23:31:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AxeLotE", "comment_text": "que buenos videos!", "comment_date": "2021-05-08T23:21:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert", "comment_text": "You should make a video on the covid-19 vaccine", "comment_date": "2021-05-08T23:12:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kolbren K2", "comment_text": "god is a myth<br>jesus is a myth<br>there are 4200 religions and 30.000 gods + in hinduism 33gods............<br>whats the point of telling the same lie over and over for 5000 years?...<br>THE ONLY GOD ARE THE GALAXIES<br>only 14% of the world is atheist not counting chinese population<br>NOTHING WILL HAPPEN IF YOU PRAY<br>do u live in the 14th century??

And I can say with 100% assurance, that in the next 5 years every single science book that has been produced over the past 70 years will have to be rewritten. <br><br>The latest observation which has no gravitational explanation, and is verification of a exclusive Electric Universe prediction. Was the discovery of Magnetic Field lines surrounding our first imaged &quot;Black Hole&quot;. Magnetism doesnt exist without electricity. The Black Hole is not a Black Hole, but rather a Plasmoid. A Plasmoid transforms and emits electricity throughout its corresponding galaxy to all of the stars which then pass it on to all of the planets and it goes all the way to our cells in our bodies. The Universe is a perfected engine that is interconnected via electro-magnetism. This not arguable anymore it is 100% proven both observationally and scientifically here on Earth in the best labs across the world. Feel free to come and join the real science, but please be sure to leave your dark energy, dark matter, dark black hole fudge factor bullshit at the door. And please also leave behind the Bible derived Big Bang &quot;We are all just random floating groups of rocks and stars floating away from everything&quot; garbage at the door. <br><br>It is 2021 and its about god damn time the Fascist/Marxist regime that took over and runs mainstream science today is put down! <br><br>First and foremost the Mainstream Geological theory has been debunked ever since they were able to plot echos through the crust through the mantle and through their proposed &quot;iron core&quot;. Their is no iron core and the Sun is not a gaseous Hydrogen ball. As Dr. ROBITAILLE from Youtube channel SkyScholar has undeniably proven. And most importantly the universe is not Gravitationally based random floating balls of matter. point in time, any true scientist who goes after the evidence for themselves or who makes up their own mind based off observational evidence, combined with physical evidence on Earth, and who wont allow theory killing fudge factors to be added every couple of months to keep their dead theory alive.... Any true scientist who does these things would 100% know that the Sun is not a gaseous ball, and there are such things as Black Holes. <br><br>Dr. ROBITAILLE on YT channel SkyScholar has unrefuttably and undeniably debunked the Mainstream Solar model over the course of 15 different theory killing facts. We can now say 100% certainty the Sun has a condensed liquid mettalic Hydrogen core which lines right up with all visual and scientific evidence without the need for the Mainstream fudge factors aka the Socialist injected tools of control and monetary gain<br><br><br><br><br>The universe is Electro-Magnetically interconnected between the biggest Plasmoids (mainstream sciences Black Holes that divide into infinity which debunks them off the bat), all the way down to the cells in your body. <br><br><br><br>The Earths exponentially weakening Magnetic shield (which has weakened more in the past 5 years than pre-2010 mainstream science predicted it would weaken over hundreds of years) is directly tied to the increase in seismic activity and it will get exponentially worse the closer we get to our 2035-2050 creshendo. The truth is in the 40s our sciences were hijacked by fascists and later marxists that like to limit knowledge by implementing unnacceptable fudge factors, especially when observationally and experimentally their is no need for these. And as a result people have no clue what is truly happening because they fall into a cuckoldly conformist viewpoint. It all starts with the core beliefs of our universe being sadly misguided! <br><br>Electro-Magnetism and Plasma are the driving forces behind what we see in Galaxies and the universe. Astronomical science has finally started to evolve from this pit full of assumptions built upon fudge factors like their theoretical versions of black holes, dark matter and dark energy, the pendulum has finally started to swing back towards where we were almost 100 years ago before we got off track with this nonsense.... <br><br>Gravitational theory has been proven wrong. The universe is made up of and controlled by electro magnetism. Gravity is the weakest force in the universe, the electric force is 100 billion trillion times stronger aka 10 to the 46th power. Gravity is itself an Electro-Magnetic effect. But it is not what shapes the cosmos. Anyone with a half a brain who looks at the complexity of the universe\u00a0 and the interconnectdness would realize this. <br><br><br>The spiral formation of galaxies is the result of NOT A BLACK HOLE. But rather everything you see in any of the millions of pictured galaxies by hubble and more, is caused by the centralization of the surrounding galaxies electro current waves/sheets as everything rotates and spirals around individual galactic cores as a result of a centralized tauroidal focused points that amplify unquantifable amounts of Electro Magnetism that then sculpt there individual galaxies. <br><br>Electricity on a galactic scale has a built in mechanism that allows 2 parrel circuits of electricty to spiraled around each quickly and form a PLASMOID. They have recreated these on Earth for decades in Plasma chambers. <br>rather these objects are more accurately described plasmoids and act as the Electro Magnetic heart of a galaxy and explains why no matter where we look in the galaxy stars that are 100s of millions of light years from their galactic centers rotate evenly with the stars that are light years form the center. Which is IMPOSSIBLE if your basis is Gravitational theory because there is no gravitational lag observed! It also explains why we have discovered stars forming within a couple light years of our &quot;Super Massive Black Hole&quot; which is another supposed impossibility by Grav theory. Due to this huge error in modern day astronomy, they have invented some more make believe physics in dark energy and dark matter. <br><br>Its important to understand that NOONE even up into the 2000s predicted or believed that Space would be full of Magnetic Fields. Because if your universe is built upon Gravity, their was never anything that would cause the creation of Large Instellar Magnetic Fields. Anyone with half a brain knows that you CANT create a field of Magnetism (like the one found around our plasmoid) without first having an Electric Force and a difference in charge. Mainstream astronomical physics did all sorts of quirky psuedo math and explaining to try and explain the unfortunate discorvey and still hold onto their newly Falsified theory. Or should I say, any respectable group of Scientists would have falsified their opposing theories after this discovery was made in the late 2000s. But the big bang and gravity research recieve too much funding, so ofcourse they wanna milk it first. <br><br>EU explains why there are big electro magnetic beams from the Sun directly to the poles of each major planet in our solar system. EU laughs at theory of gravtiational collapse and proves the sun is not just a big ball of gas that has an outer shell hotter than any other part of it. <br><br>Mainstream completely ignores the fact that Gravity is an attractive force and that is all. Nothing about Gravity explains why objects in space spin. <br><br>HOLTON ARP proved (1990s) the final nail\u00a0 in the coffin of mainstream science by disproving the assumption that Redshift can be tied to distance in Space... He showed countless numbers of Observations of Quasars being linked together to Galaxies that had extremely different redshifts like almost a billion light years. These instances are only possible if redshift is not just a measurement of distance. But rather redshift is an overall fluctating scale of how old stars and objects are individually. Even Hubble himself stated he didnt believe the expansion theory of Redshift. And the observations made by Harp falsified this belief decades ago yet once again Mainstream funded scientists swept it under the rug! Mainstream science believes ALL Quasars are really old and were only around in the beginning of the Universe. Where observational evolution shows this is silly and stupid and shouldve been stopped decades ago! People like Anton here have no means of thinking for themselves. They just open their small minds for mainstream sciences hot load of falsified shit and fudge factors every day. <br><br>The Saffire Project just proved this and as a result has put us centuries ahead. They transmuted Hydrogen with electricity in a state of the art plasma reactor. And they were able to hit 87% output power with only 7% of the power the mainstream theory scientifically estimated would need 100% input to achieve. The only explanation for this is Transmutation. So far they have transmuted Hydrogen into 13 different elements on the periodic table, including one rare earth metal. Which also disproves the mainstream belief that all the metals on Earth are from rare star explosions which is just silly when you think of how big space is. <br><br>They can even use nuclear waste as a fuel for the &quot;medium temp&quot; plasma reactor and de-engineers the waste into original base molecules.<br>The plasma transmutation of elements is how the universe works and is the key to future wide scale unlimited energy use. As Steinbrenner, Heavyside, and Tesla theoretically and arguably proved with evidence so long ago before the limiters took over. And, 2 years ago Saffire expiment proved this. <br><br>Heres best and most important channels are SuspiciousObservers, SkyScholar, See The Pattern, Thunderboltsproject, Magnetic Reversal News, Diehold Foundation, Adapt2030p", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T01:09:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H.

Protest, donate or get involved with your local politics.<br><br>- Carbon capture is another bold-faced lie made by oil/gas industries that do not wish to use their Billions of dollars to change their existing infrastructure toward sustainable energy. Hold those industries accountable. <br>- Decentralizing agriculture and localizing produce to cut back on emissions and cut back on overproduction/food waste.<br>- devoting a fraction of the US military budget alone toward Reforestation programs would be monumental in aiding the climate crisis.<br>- Legislate Into law that companies/corporations accountable via massive taxation or steep fines to compensate for the exploitation and negligence of workers and affected environments.<br>- Subsidizing renewable energy programs as if it&#39;s the new oil industry (it is)<br>- Able access to food, shelter, healthcare accsess, drinking water and education must become the measurement of value to a Country.

At least I don&#39;t know any other factors that would kill you before then. The problem of course, is that once you cross that border there is only one direction that&#39;s possible to move in, which would mean that your body (or any other form of matter) instantly desintegrate, because electromagnetism presumably work due to virtual photons acting as carrying particles that bind atoms and molecules together, and the strong nuclear force works on a similar principle. Those carrying particles needs to move backwards and forwards to communicate between the elementary particles that form matter, which would be impossible within a black hole. It may be able to move forwards, but there is no backwards. Thus all the forces we know about instantly ceases to affect reality, and any matter that slip inside presumably becomes a slur of elementary particles heading for the singularity. A singularity it will never reach, of course, because the closer it gets the more time will slow down for it. It&#39;s like Zeno&#39;s paradox. One can get very close to the singularity, but it would literally take infinite time to actually reach it from an outside perspective. That means the black hole will have vaporized from hawking radiation an infinite amount of time before anything could actually reach the singularity, including the stuff that originally created the black hole, so really, there is no singularity.<br><br>...<br><br>Feeling confused yet?", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T22:05:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Howard Williams", "comment_text": "Do a video about Bitcoin!", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T22:04:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "C96", "comment_text": "What happens if 2 black holes collide?", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T22:04:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "It\u2019s Broiso", "comment_text": "Woo yeah let\u2019s go this is just what I\u2019ve been waiting for", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T22:03:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Compte Test", "comment_text": "Hello Kurzgesagt, if someone in your team speaks french you should look at the work of french scientist Jean-Pierre Petit, who is working on a cosmology model alternate to Lambda-ACDM model, which entails interesting consequences for singularities", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T22:03:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Russian Severe Weather Videos", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=10m19s\">10:19</a> &quot;Personally, I think that\u2019s a hell of a bird.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T22:03:07Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "E", "comment_text": "Merci les sous titres vietnamiens auto", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T21:59:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kek mit Keks", "comment_text": "It is incredible what amount of information you manage to put in such a short video and  still make it understandable", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T21:55:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greg!", "comment_text": "Black holes seem kinda mean :( \ud83d\ude1e", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T21:51:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian Abhari", "comment_text": "Love the doctor who TARDIS, I wonder what they would think of black holes", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T21:50:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suvojit Paul", "comment_text": "Black captured everything and make it a 3d to 2d then this things out from it ,which is Hacking Radiation ,if we scan the radiation, can we get the memory of things??", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T21:49:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wilberator", "comment_text": "Feeling taller than before.<br>Seeing back-to-front.<br>Everything you do takes forever. <br>Everything around you happens too fast.<br>Everywhere you go looks the same.<br>No memories whatsoever.<br><br>How was Steven Hawking getting this wasted at work?", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T21:48:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OuiOuiFrenchbred", "comment_text": "I really like this video!

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  . <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. <br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019  .", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T15:02:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vignesh Nandakumar", "comment_text": "u know wats inside a black hole ? - Murphy&#39;s bookcase............. want a kurzgesagt style black hole tee", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T15:00:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eka Cahyono Putra", "comment_text": "Please english subtitle", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T14:57:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sev", "comment_text": "who&#39;s the lad that narrates these vids", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T14:56:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Not a Funny Guy", "comment_text": "Basically, a god", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T14:55:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Oniric", "comment_text": "beeeee-hooooooold!

I learned that a female supervisor at my workplace suffered from many ailments that the hospital could not treat. Despite spending nearly a thousand yuan, she still had difficulty breathing.\r<br>\r<br>Since I had just begun working there, I was not on close terms with anyone, so I asked a practitioner who was hired before me to suggest that the supervisor say, \u201cFalun Dafa is good, Truthfulness-Compassion-Forbearance is good.\u201d The practitioner did. The supervisor asked me, \u201cWill reciting the phrase help me?\u201d I said, \u201cAs long as you do it sincerely, it will work.\u201d It was time to go home. She locked the door and then shouted loudly, \u201cFalun Dafa is good! Truthfulness, Compassion, Forbearance is good!\u201d\r<br>\r<br>The next day, she shouted \u201cFalun Dafa is good!\u201d as soon as she saw me and the other practitioner.\r<br>\r<br>A few days later she told us she was able to breathe easily. There was a growth on her neck that had been plaguing her for six years, and the pain made her irritable. She said excitedly, \u201cSince I started to recite the phrase, the growth subsided. How extraordinary!\u201d\r<br>\r<br>The other workers commented that she looked healthier. She said to them, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you all say \u201cFalun Dafa is good.\u201d It truly works! Just keep saying it and you\u2019ll see the results.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>\u201cI recite it while I am driving, before going to bed, and the first thing when I wake up in the morning,\u201d she added.\r<br>\r<br>Now, when she sees me, she recites the phrase loudly. I was worried that the manager upstairs would hear it and I was amazed by her courage. She told me that she once shouted the phrase out loud while driving around on her electric bike since she was alone. Suddenly, a man who was also driving an electric bike pulled alongside her and looked at her. She asked, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d and then shouted, \u201cFalun Dafa is good!\u201d This took a lot of courage!\r<br>\r<br>Under her influence, my colleagues at work began to recite the phrase as well. Even the manager kept saying the words. Not only did they quit the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), they even got their family members to renounce their Party memberships.\r<br>\r<br>One day the supervisor said, \u201cMy husband said, \u2018You seem to have changed.\u2019\u201d She asked her husband, \u201cHow have I changed?\u201d He said, \u201cYou are kinder. You don\u2019t throw a temper anymore.\u201d She said she used to be a domineering woman. No one at home dared to upset her. She explained that after she started to sincerely recite, \u201cFalun Dafa is good,\u201d she stopped losing her temper and she became kinder.

It&#39;s a ring of material that goes around the black hole in a single direction. But the reason why it is usually animated so that you can see the rotating material from the top and bottom of the black hole as well is because the light is bent. What you are seeing is the rotating material from the other side of the black hole. But instead of it being obscured by the black hole, you can see it from the bent light waves that go above and below the black hole.<br><br>This means that if the material is rotating horizontally from right to left in front of the black hole, as you show it at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=10m30s\">10:30</a>, then the image of the rotation that you see on the top and bottom of the black hole must move from left to right. You animated this properly on the top part, but not the bottom part, which you erroneously made flow from right to left.<br><br>To better understand this, it may be helpful to realize that the part of the rotating disc that is on the other side of the black hole is visible twice here: on the top and on the bottom. These are not two different flows; it&#39;s the same flow. If you threw a planet to the right side of that black hole and watched it orbit, you&#39;d see the planet move in front of the black hole from the right side to the left side. Then, when it hits the far left side, you&#39;d see TWO DIFFERENT VIEWS of the planet on both the top and bottom side of the black hole.

As this video demonstrates, the overall concept of a singularity can be explained in practical terms easily, with the main problems coming into play when regarding complications like a surface area of zero and other absurdities. All jokes about never needing advanced mathematics in real life aside, most higher-level math and physics equations do have an intrinsic value beyond any immediate utility, in that they generally provide additional elaboration that can help better understand the behavior of something already reasonably well-understood elementary-level math or description in laymans terms.<br><br>The division by zero metaphor is apt regarding this concept, albeit not perfect. For most cases, the elementary explanations for why division by zero are invalid, notably &quot;division as inversion of multiplication&quot; and the potential for fallacious results from attempting to reverse multiplication by zero, do not seem to benefit much from elaboration via higher-level math. The very noteworthy exception, and the reason I said it&#39;s not a perfect comparison, is that higher-level mathematics does provide a fleshing out of why dividing zero by zero is also not allowed, when at first glance it would make perfect sense for zero divided by zero to equal zero. And it does so in a way that uses, and fleshes out, the second elementary-level explanation by which division by zero could hypothetically return any result if permitted.", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T02:25:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ShengTang Zhao", "comment_text": "If Hawking&#39;s radiation separates matter and anti matter does that mean we can actually observe or make use of anti matter in the space closest to black holes before the anti matter anialates", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T02:25:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fanny Tondo", "comment_text": "Imagine Kurzgesagt and Vsauce collabing together just to explain why your anime waifu isn&#39;t real.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Or is it?", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T02:25:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "IamNotUta", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a> No Kursgesagt.

And couldn&#39;t the doppler effect be explained if the surrounding universe has waaaay more mass (e.g. they&#39;re all heading towards insanely large blackholes etc)?", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T16:31:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vanvice", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=10m04s\">10:04</a> Because relativity of time, could it be that a black hole already lost all of its mass and is dead in its own &quot;time&quot;?", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T16:30:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just a random person", "comment_text": "They are awesome", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T16:28:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperiorSpud", "comment_text": "Where did you get your name?", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T16:28:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Algot Karlsson", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt hope ur back pain gets better.<br>From carrying youtube so hard.", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T16:28:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JUST LiSTEN (lyrics)", "comment_text": "Again if you never check me", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T16:27:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pollywap Gaming", "comment_text": "We&#39;ve only explored 5% of the earths ocean yet we&#39;re already moving into the biggest area.

And I can say with 100% assurance, that in the next 5 years every single science book that has been produced over the past 70 years will have to be rewritten. <br><br>The latest observation which has no gravitational explanation, and is verification of a exclucive Electric Universe prediction. Was the discovery of Magnetic Field lines surrounding our first imaged &quot;Black Hole&quot;. Magnetism doesnt exist without electricity. The Black Hole is not a Black Hole, but rather a Plasmoid. A Plasmoid transforms and emits electricity throughout its corresponding galaxy to all of the stars which then pass it on to all of the planets and it goes all the way to our cells in our bodies. The Universe is a perfected engine that is interconnected via electro-magnetism. This not arguable anymore it is 100% proven both observationally and scientifically here on Earth in the best labs across the world. Feel free to come and join the real science, but please be sure to leave your dark energy, dark matter, dark black hole fudge factor bullshit at the door. And please also leave behind the Bible derived Big Bang &quot;We are all just random floating groups of rocks and stars floating away from everything&quot; garbage at the door. <br><br>It is 2021 and its about god damn time the Fascist/Marxist regime that took over and runs mainstream science today is put down! <br><br>First and foremost the Mainstream Geological theory has been debunked ever since they were able to plot echos through the crust through the mantle and through their proposed &quot;iron core&quot;. Their is no iron core and the Sun is not a gaseous Hydrogen ball. As Dr. ROBITAILLE from Youtube channel SkyScholar has undeniably proven. And most importantly the universe is not Gravitationally based random floating balls of matter. point in time, any true scientist who goes after the evidence for themselves or who makes up their own mind based off observational evidence, combined with physical evidence on Earth, and who wont allow theory killing fudge factors to be added every couple of months to keep their dead theory alive.... Any true scientist who does these things would 100% know that the Sun is not a gaseous ball, and there are such things as Black Holes. <br><br>Dr. ROBITAILLE on YT channel SkyScholar has unrefuttably and undeniably debunked the Mainstream Solar model over the course of 15 different theory killing facts. We can now say 100% certainty the Sun has a condensed liquid mettalic Hydrogen core which lines right up with all visual and scientific evidence without the need for the Mainstream fudge factors aka the Socialist injected tools of control and monetary gain<br><br><br><br><br>The universe is Electro-Magnetically interconnected between the biggest Plasmoids (mainstream sciences Black Holes that divide into infinity which debunks them off the bat), all the way down to the cells in your body. <br><br><br><br>The Earths exponentially weakening Magnetic shield (which has weakened more in the past 5 years than pre-2010 mainstream science predicted it would weaken over hundreds of years) is directly tied to the increase in seismic activity and it will get exponentially worse the closer we get to our 2035-2050 creshendo. The truth is in the 40s our sciences were hijacked by fascists and later marxists that like to limit knowledge by implementing unnacceptable fudge factors, especially when observationally and experimentally their is no need for these. And as a result people have no clue what is truly happening because they fall into a cuckoldly conformist viewpoint. It all starts with the core beliefs of our universe being sadly misguided! <br><br>Electro-Magnetism and Plasma are the driving forces behind what we see in Galaxies and the universe. Astronomical science has finally started to evolve from this pit full of assumptions built upon fudge factors like their theoretical versions of black holes, dark matter and dark energy, the pendulum has finally started to swing back towards where we were almost 100 years ago before we got off track with this nonsense.... <br><br>Gravitational theory has been proven wrong. The universe is made up of and controlled by electro magnetism. Gravity is the weakest force in the universe, the electric force is 100 billion trillion times stronger aka 10 to the 46th power. Gravity is itself an Electro-Magnetic effect. But it is not what shapes the cosmos. Anyone with a half a brain who looks at the complexity of the universe\u00a0 and the interconnectdness would realize this. <br><br><br>The spiral formation of galaxies is the result of NOT A BLACK HOLE. But rather everything you see in any of the millions of pictured galaxies by hubble and more, is caused by the centralization of the surrounding galaxies electro current waves/sheets as everything rotates and spirals around individual galactic cores as a result of a centralized tauroidal focused points that amplify unquantifable amounts of Electro Magnetism that then sculpt there individual galaxies. <br><br>Electricity on a galactic scale has a built in mechanism that allows 2 parrel circuits of electricty to spiraled around each quickly and form a PLASMOID. They have recreated these on Earth for decades in Plasma chambers. <br>rather these objects are more accurately described plasmoids and act as the Electro Magnetic heart of a galaxy and explains why no matter where we look in the galaxy stars that are 100s of millions of light years from their galactic centers rotate evenly with the stars that are light years form the center. Which is IMPOSSIBLE if your basis is Gravitational theory because there is no gravitational lag observed! It also explains why we have discovered stars forming within a couple light years of our &quot;Super Massive Black Hole&quot; which is another supposed impossibility by Grav theory. Due to this huge error in modern day astronomy, they have invented some more make believe physics in dark energy and dark matter. <br><br>Its important to understand that NOONE even up into the 2000s predicted or believed that Space would be full of Magnetic Fields. Because if your universe is built upon Gravity, their was never anything that would cause the creation of Large Instellar Magnetic Fields. Anyone with half a brain knows that you CANT create a field of Magnetism (like the one found around our plasmoid) without first having an Electric Force and a difference in charge. Mainstream astronomical physics did all sorts of quirky psuedo math and explaining to try and explain the unfortunate discorvey and still hold onto their newly Falsified theory. Or should I say, any respectable group of Scientists would have falsified their opposing theories after this discovery was made in the late 2000s. But the big bang and gravity research recieve too much funding, so ofcourse they wanna milk it first. <br><br>EU explains why there are big electro magnetic beams from the Sun directly to the poles of each major planet in our solar system. EU laughs at theory of gravtiational collapse and proves the sun is not just a big ball of gas that has an outer shell hotter than any other part of it. <br><br>Mainstream completely ignores the fact that Gravity is an attractive force and that is all. Nothing about Gravity explains why objects in space spin. <br><br>HOLTON ARP proved (1990s) the final nail\u00a0 in the coffin of mainstream science by disproving the assumption that Redshift can be tied to distance in Space... He showed countless numbers of Observations of Quasars being linked together to Galaxies that had extremely different redshifts like almost a billion light years. These instances are only possible if redshift is not just a measurement of distance. But rather redshift is an overall fluctating scale of how old stars and objects are individually. Even Hubble himself stated he didnt believe the expansion theory of Redshift. And the observations made by Harp falsified this belief decades ago yet once again Mainstream funded scientists swept it under the rug! Mainstream science believes ALL Quasars are really old and were only around in the beginning of the Universe. Where observational evolution shows this is silly and stupid and shouldve been stopped decades ago! People like Anton here have no means of thinking for themselves. They just open their small minds for mainstream sciences hot load of falsified shit and fudge factors every day. <br><br>The Saffire Project just proved this and as a result has put us centuries ahead. They transmuted Hydrogen with electricity in a state of the art plasma reactor. And they were able to hit 87% output power with only 7% of the power the mainstream theory scientifically estimated would need 100% input to achieve. The only explanation for this is Transmutation. So far they have transmuted Hydrogen into 13 different elements on the periodic table, including one rare earth metal. Which also disproves the mainstream belief that all the metals on Earth are from rare star explosions which is just silly when you think of how big space is. <br><br>They can even use nuclear waste as a fuel for the &quot;medium temp&quot; plasma reactor and de-engineers the waste into original base molecules.<br>The plasma transmutation of elements is how the universe works and is the key to future wide scale unlimited energy use. As Steinbrenner, Heavyside, and Tesla theoretically and arguably proved with evidence so long ago before the limiters took over. And, 2 years ago Saffire expiment proved this. <br><br>Heres best and most important channels are SuspiciousObservers, SkyScholar, See The Pattern, Thunderboltsproject, Magnetic Reversal News, Diehold Foundation, Adapt2030p", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T15:09:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shekhar Suman", "comment_text": "Here for my periodic dose of nihilism.", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T15:09:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AR", "comment_text": "Trending 5, I was here.", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T15:08:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tsjuun Tze", "comment_text": ":-)", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T15:06:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tsjuun Tze", "comment_text": "And a &quot;big bang&quot; is born", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T15:06:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tayto man", "comment_text": "Kurzgesagt r34?", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T15:05:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Made Nita", "comment_text": "WHERE IS THE ENGLISH SUBTITLE PLEASEEE :(((((", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T15:05:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simon", "comment_text": "Can someone explain to me what is wrong with my theory that black holes could be like an exothermic reaction where chemical energy gets transformed to another form of energy so the remaining chemical energy is lower and the molecule becomes more stable because the overal energy is more evenly distrubuted..

I&#39;ve heard it explained numerous times before, but I cannot seem to grasp the concept of HOW black holes evaporate when at least one of the pairs of particles created fall into the black hole. How does contributing mass (particle falling in) lead to the loss of mass (evaporation)? <br><br>This is how I understand it...just outside the event horizon contains enough energy to apparently create matter, this matter is always formed in matter/anti-matter pairs. One part of the pair falls in while other part flies out. The fact that only half of the whole matter/anti-matter particle remained after this event must mean that every particle&#39;s mass is measured by it matter/anti-matter pair as a whole or as a single particle and not measured as two separate particles containing one of matter and one of anti-matter. Do I have this somewhat accurate? <br><br>If not, does this mean that this matter that is being created is actually forming from the energy OF the black hole itself within the event horizon? And since nothing can escape not even light, a particle may form from within the event horizon, but one lucky part of a pair of particles created does somehow pop into existence just a hair outside the event horizon escaping the black hole and half the originally created mass now escaped and was not reabsorbed back into the singularity causing this degradation to occur little by little over time?<br><br>\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T05:20:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Banas", "comment_text": "Hey black hole vs white hole make the video", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T05:20:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Navaneeth V Sagar", "comment_text": "Black Hole is not a cause for Information Paradox....

That\u2019s pretty weird to think about. Nearly 14 billion years and some black holes are still just a baby.

But for that to work, we would need to figure out if dark matter/dark energy/exotic matter (I don\u2019t know the difference between the 3, I think they\u2019re basically negative mass that\u2019s responsible for the universe\u2019s expansion rate) is unaffected by the black hole. Maybe wormholes won\u2019t be needed at all and we just dumb a HUGE amount of negative mass in the black hole. It would have to be enough to be equal to the black hole\u2019s mass, or more than the black hole\u2019s mass. But then would a white hole be made?

Let&#39;s see how the birds handle it.<br><br>I&#39;ve now seen. Basically the same description, with extra stuff about singularities. <br><br>We keep hearing how the universe kind of restarts every eternity or so, and if thats true, I think black holes are the beginning and end of that cycle.<br> Stars bleed energy in the form of heat over time, and the same is true for planets. Stars are supported on their radiation, pushing against gravity. We are pretty certain that gravity always ends up winning in the end. <br> Black holes consume anything that passes too close, and their field of influence grows whenever that happens. Everything is focused to a single point inside. <br> Planets like earth orbit the sun, but its really a stupidly slow spiral. Earth will eventually fall into the sun if left alone. If planets do this with regular stars, then galaxies are kind of just massive systems, all spinning and spiraling to their center, where there are damn near always Black holes (if not always. I dont know for sure). <br> This video mentions how anything within a certain range of a Black hole is forced to orbit it, a cascading spiral. It also mentions how a you get closer to a Black hole, any motion you make in any direction will always lead to the center. Consider that, but scale it up. Dramatically. <br><br>If orbits are cascading spirals, and galaxies are huge clusters of celestial bodies orbiting around Black holes, then eventually everything will be consumed. Galaxies are moving away from each other, but how large would the influence of a galaxy sized Black hole be? And galaxies do occasionally collide, but giant black holes would just consume each other, instead of galaxies shedding apart. And if their fields gets big enough, then the motion of moving apart may draw them together. <br> These multi galaxy sized singularities will have unimaginably large egregious spheres, yanking everything around them into their orbit, including other galaxy sized Black holes. Rinse and repeat, and after an eternity or so, you would end up with only a few Black holes containing all the mass of the known universe. Eventually only one will remain, having consumed everything else. <br><br>A single point, but now containing all matter, with properties similar to that of fundamental particles, like quarks, acting more like many electrons. That sounds pretty similar what the beginning of our universe looked like, and we don&#39;t know how it got that way, and we don&#39;t really know what happened in the very beginning. Physics can&#39;t explain it. Physics also can&#39;t explain what is happening in Black holes. <br><br>I guess this is my YouTube thesis?

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago He left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, Your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do these things, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife  . <br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make. <br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 )  ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019  .", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:31:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheEddyRice", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=3m21s\">3:21</a> amogus", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:31:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikelchannel", "comment_text": "It will be cool to die in a black hole, to see what is inside it, the experience, a place where the rules are broken", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:30:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Humam Eid", "comment_text": "who also went to a black hole like me?", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:30:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Person", "comment_text": "Its not accurate whatsoever but I remember Mr. Arrow falling into a black hole in Treasure Planet scared the crap out of me as a kid, that entire scene is intense.", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:30:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Machinery", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a><br>Yo its red from amogus", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:30:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KILO993", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=6m00s\">6:00</a> - thumbs up if you&#39;ve done a big enough dose of psychs to start seeing the alien language lol", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:29:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Qwertz", "comment_text": "we finally found something that can fit your mom", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:29:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guilherme Alves Lopes", "comment_text": "This is just some fancy and jumbo musing. <br>But, <br>Imagine black holes are both the Egg and the Carrions of the universe. <br>and they someday converge into one extra super massive blackhole that after an unbelievably long time collapses and releases a motherfricking big bang. <br>Now imagine that has happened an infinite amount of times, and what we call our universe is just a tiny little bitsy little small slice of a really, absolutely, infinitely big universe filled with extra super massive blackholes so unbelievably far apart, and each of these almost collapsing or in the process of reduction by hawking radiation, and with each collapse another &quot;universe&quot; comes to existence.", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:28:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paradoxs", "comment_text": "Yay E D U C A T I O N", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:27:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LxpyZ", "comment_text": "This makes me question, that if we can possibly make black holes", "comment_date": "2021-04-28T00:26:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anon", "comment_text": "lol another video about black holes.

To the best of my understanding, gravity works like pressure, where it is applied on all your molecules and cells individually, rather than treating you as a single rigid body. You&#39;d be just one supermassive molecule. Either you&#39;d be crushed, or ripped piece by piece even without the radius being small, just because of the gravity gradient.<br><br>Second, what is the stuff that comes out the top and bottom of the ergosphere?  The ergosphere wasn&#39;t an actual sphere, it was a ring, and one image in the video showed beams coming out from the top and bottom. I&#39;ve seen those images before, is that supposed to be the hawking radiation, or something else? Because it&#39;s pictured like a spotlight.<br><br>Third, what is the material at the center of a black hole? We know that stars merge stuff until it becomes lead, but wouldn&#39;t black holes fuse lead too, from the extreme gravity? I&#39;m curious what material it would be at the center of a black hole. Do we have materials big enough on the periodic chart to be likely suspects?<br><br>Finally, I though some specific things can escape a black hole, just prior to the event horizon.

What a black hole does to spacetime is catastrophic to these fields, pinching them off and disconnecting two previously continuous points on that field. That changes the way the field can behave, and that change is a kind of work that the black hole does on the fields.  <br><br>A big problem with the virtual-particle explanation of a black hole is that we would expect the absolute energy loss of a black hole to be proportional to its surface area. This is not the case. The black hole actually releases a much much much greater amount of energy right at the end of its life, when its surface area is very very very very small, and there&#39;s a straightforward reason for this when we think of the quantum fields. A smaller surface with more apparent curvature will cause more problems for the field than a really really really big surface that operates on those fields the way electric field lines operate in a parallel plate capacitor.", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T21:06:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Delborne", "comment_text": "kurzgesagt is like that one really awesome and smart teacher<br>once he releases all his knowledge, you don&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about but damn its interesting", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T21:05:44Z", "likes_count": 155}, {"comment_by": "Tcstancil", "comment_text": "Thank you!!", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T21:04:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Major Melon", "comment_text": "Love everything you do, especially the space stuff.

Especially right at the beginning at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=0m43s\">0:43</a>. I get it that this is an often used way of simplifying gravity. The problem is, that it&#39;s wrong while feeling intuitively correct. It leaves you thinking you got the gist of it, but you really didn&#39;t understand it at all.  At least that&#39;s how I felt for a decade before someone explained it to me properly.<br><br>You see, this way of explaining it is like explaining the word &quot;connecting&quot; as &quot;establishing a connection&quot;. <br>You&#39;re explaining gravity by saying spacetime &quot;sags UNDERNEATH&quot; planets and stars. But what is &quot;underneath&quot; or &quot;down&quot; or &quot;under&quot; without the definition of gravity in the first place? Looking at this problem another way is just watching the video at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsLTNkzvaY&amp;t=0m43s\">0:43</a>. The well forms UNDERNEATH the objects, and when things are pulled &quot;DOWN&quot; as if there was gravity acting, the planets would intuitively move around each other along the surface of spacetime right? See the problem? This does not explain gravity at all because we&#39;re using a gravity force that pulls downwards and the curved surface redirects that &quot;downwards force&quot;.<br><br>The fundamental issue is that gravity - according to Einstein - is NOT A FORCE. It&#39;s a result of the geometry of spacetime and the forced movement of everything inside spacetime along the time axis. Newton&#39;s first law states that if no force is acting on a body it will move on a straight line. But a straight line on a curved surface(or 3D space or any multidimensional space) is actually not as straight as people think. These lines are called geodesics. One quick example to showcase this is looking at the path an airplane takes when it flies straight over the curved surface of earth. But when you show that path on a flattened map, it seems curved. Now let two planes start parallel to each other flying straight, on their respective geodesics, and they will fly toward each other. There was no force that pulled them together, just curved geometry. This is exactly what happens in spacetime, we move along spacetime on geodesics even when we&#39;re standing still because we are always moving along the time axis. That&#39;s why masses are &quot;pulled&quot; together and will end up colliding if you DON&#39;T apply a force to keep their centers of mass at a constant distance to each other.

If it were made of small pairs of elementary particles right at the event horizon, that raises so many questions. Does the pair come from the quantum field, or from the black hole? If it comes from the field, shouldn&#39;t the infalling particle add to the mass of the black hole? If it comes from the black hole, why does the outgoing particle have enough energy to escape? If it can, shouldn&#39;t that be so much energy that it would be detectable to us? In a rotating black hole, wouldn&#39;t the outgoing particle be confined into orbit by the ergosphere and collisions with everything in it? <br><br>This analogy wasn&#39;t devised as a particularly accurate way of explaining hawking radiation, but rather as something that was intuitable by a public audience more easily. But once you look past the surface, there are too many holes in that explanation. So let&#39;s go through these questions and see if it takes us to a more accurate explanation.<br><br><br>Does the pair come from the quantum field, or from the black hole?<br>Both. See, normally a quantum field is sort of &quot;bubbling&quot; in every little spot, described by a wave state equation, and each little spot hovers around, but is never quite 0. You can imagine this as a bunch of sine waves in a tube phase shifted randomly from each other. Sometimes they combine to form a loud sound, but mostly just cancel out. However, in the presence of a black hole, there is a border past which the peak of that combined wave is the same energy or higher than the energy of a photon. You can think of this like being in a wave pool with a giant wall in the middle. On the outside of that wall, everything is normal and the water is mostly still. On the inside though, all the waves travel out to the wall, where they collide with it, and can even bounce back and affect all the incoming waves. If the waves splash high enough, they can even get over the wall. In the same way, if the wave functions interfere with each other in an extreme enough manor, the combined wave manifests as a photon, and can leave if it goes off in the right direction. Hawking radiation is basically all photons, though there are some incredibly rare outliers.<br>The quantum field provides the wave functions. The black hole provides the intense gravitational energy density to affect those wave functions. When a photon escapes, it&#39;s the black hole&#39;s gravity that is the source of energy, and that gravity comes from its mass. So whenever that energy manifests as a photon, that mass is the ultimate source of that photon, and it decreases very slightly.<br><br>If it comes from the field, shouldn&#39;t the infalling particle add to the mass of the black hole?<br>If the photon falls back into the black hole, since it manifested using the black hole as energy, it would simply reclaim what it lost.<br><br>If it comes from the black hole, why does the outgoing particle have enough energy to escape?<br>This depends on where it actually appeared. If, like in the previous explanation, it happened at the border of the event horizon, then it&#39;s super unlikely that it would escape. But most of the photons don&#39;t actually come from there. They come from the border we talked about, which is a few times further out than the event horizon. That is the furthest point at which they can manifest, and it&#39;s there best chance to escape because there are more possible paths they can take from that point that lead outward.<br><br>If it can, shouldn&#39;t that be so much energy that it would be detectable to us?<br>A lot of the photons actually do escape. But on their way out, they&#39;re fighting some very extreme gravity, and so undergo what we call gravitational redshifting. The redshifting in this case is so much that they turn into extreme radio waves. So low energy that current technology can&#39;t detect them.<br><br>In a rotating black hole, wouldn&#39;t the outgoing particle be confined into orbit by the ergosphere and collisions with everything in it?<br>There are actually many paths that take the outgoing photon into an orbit around a region called the photon sphere, and those paths are more accessible if your path is skewed by the ergosphere. However, these orbits aren&#39;t very stable. Just a tad too far out, and it escapes. A tad too far in, and it falls back to the black hole. The chances of landing in a metastable orbit are ultimately no different whether or black hole is spinning or not.", "comment_date": "2021-04-27T19:09:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crest", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s say you could live near a black hole, your whole life.

I think it would make sense, although that would mean we would have to reconsider how hawking radiation works, since our big bang created these black holes in the first place. So what if matter was actually created instead of being stolen from the black hole itself. Maybe there is actually a limit to how much matter a black hole can hold, and it creates a big bang because it could not withhold all the matter, instead of being deprived of it.\r<br><br>\r<br>That would also be plausible because if the universe(s) keep expanding there will always be more space for the new matter, and because they keep expanding, they make this theory more plausible since once the black holes get far enough away from eachother, they lose all gravitational pull towards eachother, therefore making it seem that they dont exist. This sounds just like our universe: we only know of ONE big bang, but we cant guarantee that there were no other ones, since the light they emit would probably never reach us, making this theory possible.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Also, before the big bang, it was speculated that neither time, space or light existed, yet there are contradictions such as HD 140283 Methuselah. This means that spacetime could have existed before the big bang. Also, the concentrated mass of the big bangs dormant state before the actual explosion kinda fits the description of a singularity. Another thing i found is that there is no known trigger for the big bang, which makes no sense. How could there be a START to time if there was no time before that? Time would just never start, would it? There is no POINT in time without TIME. But with my theory, time could have never started, and it&#39;s quite possible that the trigger for the big bang was Hawking radiation.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>This would mean that we would lose all grip on the concept of time and space, meaning we severely underestimated them by a long shot. This would also halfway justify (but still not explain) HD 140283 Methuselah&#39;s age, since it is thought to be older than our universe. So our universe is possibly only one of many of which were created by a black hole in the previous universe after it went through heat death, which was also created by a black hole after heat death. This could prove that even our universe is just an ever-expanding cycle which always increases exponentially in size and mass. If this theory were true, we wouldnt be able to correctly assume the start of time, or the size of space.<br><br>I hope my eighteen paragraphs of text were enough to get kurzgesagts attention.

In an ideal black hole, you can&#39;t stay at the photon sphere to look at infinite copies of yourself, since matter cannot remain in a stable orbit at this point. Yer goin&#39; in no matter what. The faster the black hole is rotating, the closer the photon sphere gets to the ISCO.<br>2. The &quot;virtual particle&quot; model of Hawking radiation is incorrect. Hawking himself put it out as a simplification that makes the concept easier to understand. The more accurate representation is that the event horizon cuts off vibrational modes in the quantum vacuum, which manifest as particles: mostly photons. This gives them a heat glow whose wavelength is proportional to the diameter of the event horizon.<br>3. There are hypotheses that infalling quantum information is preserved on the event horizon, smeared out like jam, and that it may emerge again in Hawking radiation, hopelessly scrambled. This would solve the black hole information paradox.

If you were to gather a black hole&#39;s hawking radiation, and crush it into it&#39;s own black hole, the two black holes would be connected as a wormhole. Halfway through the black hole&#39;s lifetime, when that switch happens, you can actually think of the hawking radiation as being wormholes tied to the center of the black hole, releasing the information within. As more of the black hole evaporates, it becomes more tied to its hawking radiation, eventually releasing all the information we thought was lost.

At the event horizon, spacetime would be infinitely dilated.  That is, time doesn&#39;t pass, and distance wouldn&#39;t exactly... exist.  That means that... there is no space inside the event horizon.  So, in our frame outside the black hole there appears to be a volume of space, but gravity has warped it such that... that volume would actually be zero.  I think that &quot;within&quot; the accelerated frame of the black hole, singularity should absolutely fill that... volume?  Lack of volume?  However, there would be no &quot;naked singularity&quot; problem due to time dilation.  You can&#39;t actually get to the event horizon, as time slows down so much that, well, eternity may not pass, but the black hole would evaporate due to hawking radiation before you touch the horizon.

In fact Black Holes still follows the rules, except at an extreme level. You can actually get out of a Black Hole, all you have to do is go faster than light and that happens almost every day. The thing about Black Holes is the fact that they have two Event Horizons, on for the moment that their gravitational pull equals the speed of light causing the apparent lack of ability of to see within and the second event horizon is the actual surface of the object within below the first event horizon. The only thing you need to know to about why Black Holes do not break the rules and still follow them is that even Black Holes die, the more energy you have the longer you last and black Holes have a lot of energy. The curvature of Black Holes cannot be infinite, and the density cannot be infinite: However the curvature can have any number of values that result from the gravitational acceleration of it&#39;s own mass to exceed the Speed of Light which may as well have an infinite number of values and the density can have any number of values that cause the fundamental forces to exceed their ability to remain separate and again the which may as well be infinite, both results give you what a Black Hole looks like but you can go even further beyond. A black Hole cannot be causally disconnect from the rest of the universe because that would mean you are no longer dealing with an object, but an intermediary phenomenon such as a Wormhole where two distinct coordinate within the universe or without the universe are connected and those two coordinated cannot interact with each other any differently than their numerical value dictates I.E. a Wormhole from Earth to the Sun won&#39;t cause the Orbit of the Earth to act like it is right next to the sun. There is a lot of things I could over with Black Holes and details I could describe to you, but I currently do not have the material at hand to create an animated slideshow to teach even the most basic of minds. A Ringularity is when the Singularity of a Black Hole is off-set from it&#39;s own center, so the Black Hole actually orbits itself: The closer the rotation is to the Speed of Light the more off-set the rotation will be, at the Speed of Light the off-sett rotation will be tangent to the Singularity I.E. surface of the second Event Horizon within the First Event Horizon, then if you exceed the Speed of Light (which can happen) the off-set rotation would be further than the surface of the second Event Horizon. Quantum Fluctuations are like the zeros and ones to a computer code: If the value equals zero because a particles has been spawned with an anti-particle that matches it then both particles annihilate each other which creates raw energy, however if the value equals one then the particle that spawns without an anti-particle that matches it goes out into space and does stuff. Black Holes are intermediary generators for these particles, or you could see them as regulators: Either way Black Holes have a ton of energy, and are very efficient with using it. Everything in the universe goes towards entropy, hence why the closer you are to total entropy the more efficient you become. That is why dead stars last longer than live stars.

Light knows nothing of direction or speed and will always go straight with no mass to cause a lag on speed, so the medium it travels through is the only way to affect either of those features. Since gravity is just what we interpret spacial bending as, the idea of black holes affecting light any differently than any other massive space-bending object might be a little disingenuous. Even our planet&#39;s mass can affect light through the pull it has on the fabric of spacetime, it&#39;s just incredibly small and almost insignificant in comparison.<br><br>Anyway, apart from that slight clarification that gravity itself isn&#39;t a force that acts on anything and is just an effect of warped spacetime (again, I totally understand the need to limit things like this or it would be a very long and boring video), I approve.
