Now, I am saddened by the fact that economists always seem the autistic kid within the Social Sciences.

And hence economists keep asking research questions with a sense of wonder and ingenuity as if no one had ever asked them before. The field of happiness is a painful example of it.

Not that that&#39;s a hidden factor on this channel but it does make some of these videos very one-sided and the counter arguments are very often forgotten and ignored. There are some bad psychology mixed into some of these videos and both of these teachers seemed to just adore using psychology to explain economics. While themselves not really understanding psychology or how studies in psychology are done and what they imply. Their points from psychology were mostly wishful thinking and left leaning biased indoctrination. Too often a final point was started by &quot;You should not...&quot;, &quot;You should...&quot;, &quot;But I feel...&quot;.<br><br>Again, it&#39;s very much worth a watch for people who don&#39;t already study economics but please don&#39;t take this as gospel. Economics is not supposed to be left or right leaning. And a lecture series where all slightly right leaning study results are apologized for is not really a fantastic lecture series unless you are super critical while you watch it or watch another series that is more neutral right afterwards. While this one was a series with a left leaning view on economics. Milton Friedman has a series with a libertarian view on economics. The same principles are talked about but the conclusions are not completely the same. I would probably suggest people to watch that series to see what I mean. Both this one and the Milton Friedman series are very much biased but very informative if you start to understand when they stop talking about science and start talking about their personal ideas of the world.", "comment_date": "2018-02-21T00:26:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mohammad Reza", "comment_text": "In 6 hours I learnt what it took my school 2 years to teach!", "comment_date": "2018-02-17T14:13:09Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Austin Gharib", "comment_text": "Happiness = gratification / gratitude", "comment_date": "2018-02-05T02:26:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robinson Marquez", "comment_text": "Amazing series but it would be better if you add some chapters about savings which is also an important part of economics.", "comment_date": "2018-01-30T14:34:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sonam", "comment_text": "I&#39;m from Bhutan!(not that anyone cares.)", "comment_date": "2018-01-25T16:23:21Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Debbey Lukas", "comment_text": "Thank you so much for this series.

Contrary to this, if the majority of one&#39;s time is spent on a job that has no meaning to your life, say working in a packaging facility for objects that you don&#39;t actually get to enjoy, your time is spent making somebody else&#39;s life richer, most often your boss, executives and investors, who perceptively do less work yet reap more rewards for their time.<br>This dynamic means that it is <b>servitude</b> that is the measure of happiness, not any indicator of raw wealth and becomes more prevalent when *status is derived from the ability to acquire the services of others, i.e. items denoting monetary wealth.<br>This is why the true measure of the success of an economy should be a reduction of income inequality.
