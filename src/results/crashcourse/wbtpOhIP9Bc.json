I work for a hospital system and at the beginning of COVID I was in central scheduling, but then I was trained in Urgent Care and ER registration. Then because of a PPE shortage, they asked for volunteers to come and do mask sterilization in the early mornings, which I did. Then I was sent to work onsite at the primary care offices to help them with scheduling and reception. Then once vaccines became available, I would work on my day off as check in for our vaccine clinic, where I\u2019d help get up to 1000 people through our vaccine clinic.<br><br>I did get burnt out, I began having panic attacks at work, and it took my manager calling me out on how I WASN\u2019T taking regular breaks that made me decide to take a step back and put myself first.<br><br>My hope with this series and especially this episode is that it will help people understand how much we actually do and perhaps show much more compassion and patience with us.", "comment_date": "2021-10-23T04:07:47Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "J.P.", "comment_text": "This series is very interesting!!", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T06:14:13Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "uncle bobo", "comment_text": "Hi how&#39;s it going", "comment_date": "2021-10-20T17:06:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amelie Florelle", "comment_text": "I continued to be amazed by the perseverance of health care workers during this time.
