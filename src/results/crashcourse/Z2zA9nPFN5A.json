Not quite.  True they come about from black holes as they form, but a large black hole, perhaps a supermassive one, like those at the hearts of galaxies, consume matter so rapidly that they can (at the height of activity) produce beams of gamma radiation from the poles.  This is what quasars are, I think.  Black holes consuming matter at a phenomenal rate; enough to generate gamma rays.
