They are harder to find than one would think. Not to mention that, &quot;neutral&quot; history, is in the ear of the beholder. When a Conservative tells the stories, it&#39;s more on the accomplishments of the US in all her glory. With that, you&#39;ll hear the history in a more bias way that no faults are usually highlighted even though the faults are just as, if not more important than the victories. It&#39;s a noble attempt, but we must learn from the mistakes or we&#39;re destined to repeat them. On the other hand, (being the &quot;left&quot; if you will), you can spot a Liberal rather easy. The focus is more on the mistakes of US, along with personal opinion commentary on how horrible the Americans were at every turn and put in a matter of fact kind of way. Like the Conservative way, the Liberls history may be accurate in many ways, but it&#39;s mixed in with so much personal negative banter, after the lesson, one would almost seem embarrassed by by it. The history lesson should be taught with only facts. Everyone must know that every single place on earth has a dark history. Some worse than others and some still committing the worst kind today. The important part is the changes made over time that has moved towards changing and making things better from the things our ancestors committed against others. Something we as a civilized nation today, can&#39;t erase from time. It&#39;s embedded in our history forever. If these things can&#39;t be forgiven, then what chance do we have as people to move forward through time and grow. Until history can be told in completely unbiased manner, one side will just highlight the positive while the other side can&#39;t let go of the negative. That in of itself keeps the division alive and well in America and the more each side pushes, the farther the division becomes. America has faults most definitely, however, until one side admits them and the other side stops dwelling on them, it will continue to grow. We can only control today. Yesterday has gone and anyone that&#39;s actually guilty of those atrocities of our past are long gone. What&#39;s left is many good people stuck in the past that continues to haunt us all, from all walks of life, when we should be coming together to work towards a better future with real honest compromises in order to move forward.", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T22:58:32Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Jenkel Gutierrez", "comment_text": "Well that means that if any of you become politicians take this advice long speeches? fatal!", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T13:19:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Heinrich Kraus", "comment_text": "No one saw that Bioshock Infinite reference of the vending machine, and no one will see this comment since I&#39;m 7 years late (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMXqg2PKJZU&amp;t=7m27s\">7:27</a>)", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T11:03:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "outofthebiz", "comment_text": "And people wonder if historians are liberal.", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T17:53:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erin", "comment_text": "This would be a great lesson if half of it wasn&#39;t a white-guilt rant.", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T13:19:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tobi Cipher", "comment_text": "Americans treated Indians bad but the Idians also did the same to other Indians, just in a primitive way lol", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T00:50:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moose Gang", "comment_text": "WHY DEOS HE HAVE MERGE WHO BUYS IT", "comment_date": "2020-03-06T13:21:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Olivia Gibb", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve never heard Tecumseh pronounced like that", "comment_date": "2020-03-06T06:00:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raj Reddy", "comment_text": "this helped my homework", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T01:49:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Valen", "comment_text": "Canada is garbage", "comment_date": "2020-03-04T15:16:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snake", "comment_text": "This comments section is so cringe.

The British found his dinner had been served being still hot. They ate his meal and burned the White House down. The war effectively ended on that point.

The British proposed a line was drawn between Canada and the US, with the USA given everything south of that line, even territory the British had previously claimed. The Americans agreed with the British not to cross north of the line. <br><br>The USA shows no shame or embarrassment about abandoning the American capital, allowing the White House to be burned down.

The definition of winning a war is dependent on the specific war goals and objectives of each nation. Keeping the status quo can even be APART of those goals. That&#39;s what defence is.<br><br><br>Britain achieved most of its goals and to my knowledge the US achieved none of theirs, you could possibly argue they achieved the killing of Tecumseh. <br><br><br>But the USA is the aggressor and as your video clearly showed, the truth of the matter was that that the USA DID indeed intend to invade the entirety of Canada and annex the lands and people.<br><br><br>Surely if the militias of Canada and the armies of the British empire are able to defend Canada, they would have won the war?<br><br><br>I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say that your American nationality is giving you a bias. But let me give you an example that would perhaps open your eyes to how double standard this is.<br><br><br>America invades Canada, Britain and Canada throw America out of Canada. Most Americans believe they win the war, you more accurately believe it was a draw.<br><br><br><br>Iraq invades Kuwait, NATO throw Iraq out of Kuwait. Draw?<br><br><br>Did Saddam Hussein DRAW with the United States and NATO in the First Gulf war? No he lost. He invaded a land and was pushed out of that land by its own people and the allies of its people.<br><br><br>The situation is exactly the same as in Canada.<br><br><br>Just because the UK literally didn&#39;t annex the entirety of America and tell America to give it war reparations doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s entirely possible for America to have &#39;Lost&#39; the war in every sense of the word.<br><br><br>It&#39;s really simple to me. You get invaded and you push them back, in no other country in the world would that be considered a draw or no one winning. That&#39;s just an insane concept to me.

I encourage my students to listen to your commentaries. Still, I have some thoughts. First,  I thought the Iroquois federation (five tribes) who won against the Algonquin federation (9 tribes) in what I think it was called the Great Beaver Wars won the land west of the colonies. If I remember correctly, it was negotiated by the French in the Great Peace Treaty. After they settled that war with the Great Peace Treaty, the Iroquois sold this conquered land/Indian territory west of the colonies to the British Empire in which American Colonists were a part of at that time and so making it British/Colonist lands since that was purchased land. Is that correct?  When the British and the French returned to war, the allies of the French (Algonquin Federation) called the Great Peace treaty null and void and decided to take back the land they had already lost to the Iroquois.  The British (and their allies including Indian allies the Iroquois) again won that land in the French Indian war and made treaties,  but the British (and their Indian allies) then lost it this land to the American Colonists with their loss in the American Revolution.<br><br>The idea that people cannot purchase land is interesting since Native Americans and their federations at that time did sell land to both British and French Colonist.  But the idea that to sell land the same &quot; as air&quot; which cannot be sold is something that is mentioned as a quote by Indians of that time. However,  land was actually sold by Indians of that time. Iroquois sold land to Britain, I believe New Hampshire purchased land as well from the Native Americans.  French documents also show the same kind of purchases. Native Americans selling land and saying that cant be done causes a huge discrepancy in the validity of such an argument.  Not many people can be taken seriously if on one hand they say it is not for sale, but on the other hand they sell it and take money for it.  The morality of in can obviously argued, but the history report should address that such acts happened or it creates a bias instead of a presentation of historical facts. <br><br>Also, why toss in a comment that stated that the slaves were counted as 3/5th of a human?  The clause is actually interpreted as 3 out of 5 slaves which would count as a vote,  and it was a compromise to limit Southern domination in the numbers of representatives in Congress. For a person of that time to say that a slave is only 3/5th of a person, goes against other claims of that time that slaves were not people but property as the Southern elites defined them as well as opposes the beliefs of the Northern abolitionists which protested that slaves were people.  I believe too that in the argument for slaves actually having a count in Congress was also due in part because some were free men and owned land.  <br><br>You are right on the failures of our country in some ways as men are not perfect and we can learn from this and should, but some of this appears to have a bias against history itself. It is good to point out truths, but it seems all sides of truth should be noted.", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T23:56:47Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "daniel halachev", "comment_text": "I like when American confidence is crushed.", "comment_date": "2018-09-14T05:35:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Notch From minecraft", "comment_text": "Nah, America won.

Here are just a few:<br><br>1. Canada does NOT have &quot;excellent healthcare.&quot;  Government healthcare has proven to be a terrible system just about everywhere it&#39;s been tried (i.e. nearly every Western country other than the US).  People have to wait months or even years to get the care they need, even if it is a medical emergency.  <br><br>2. &quot;Why isn&#39;t there more to celebrate&quot; about American history?  As a matter of fact sir, there is much to celebrate about American history.  Granted, not everything in our history is worth celebrating, but that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s nothing either.<br><br>3. The British Invasion began in 1964, not 1961.  Few Americans had ever heard of the Beatles or any other British rock band until some time around mid- to late 1963, and it wasn&#39;t until early 1964 that British musicians really began to take off in the States (and even then, plenty of Americans continued to chart alongside them).<br><br>4. Under the Constitution, slaves were not &quot;counted as three fifths of a human.&quot;  Rather, three fifths of the slave population was to be counted in the Census, in addition to free persons, to determine taxation and apportionment of the House.  This provision had nothing to do with the value of people or races, and was a compromise that actually minimized the influence of Southern slave states.  While it&#39;s true that they got more representation than they would&#39;ve had if slaves hadn&#39;t been included, counting only three fifths of the slaves gave them less than counting all the slaves would have.  Ironically, it was this provision that allowed slavery to eventually be abolished, as it gave the Southern states less political clout than they would&#39;ve had if the entire slave population had been included.  (Nor were the Federalists necessarily anti-slavery either; Roger Taney, the Chief Justice who issued what is widely considered the majority opinion in the Dred Scott case, began his political career as a Federalist; Charles Pinckney, whom the Federalists nominated for president in 1804 and 1808, hailed from South Carolina and took an indifferent stance toward slavery.)", "comment_date": "2018-03-13T21:33:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Oliver", "comment_text": "So basically the Indians got screwed and has been getting screwed for 200 year&#39;s and this trend is still on going with the XL pipeline.", "comment_date": "2018-03-13T00:01:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RobertoCharlie", "comment_text": "So America has only declared war five times?

This is why the result wasn&#39;t really a decisive &quot;win&quot; for Canadians.  The after math of the war began the Canadian tradition of trying to get the Americans to see them as friends, because they understood that round two would likely not be as kind to them as round one was, should Washington ever refocus it&#39;s attention on North America.   It was a bungled war, but not a decisive defeat for the US or its interests.

Before the War of 1812, the United States was in no condition to wage a full fledged war; much less, land an invasion for a mass number of reasons. First of all, the United States suffered horrendous debt resulting from previous wars and restricted trade issues with France. This meant that the US military was drastically underfunded, badly lead, ill-equipped, and ill-trained. The US Navy was very low on ships and moral; most of America&#39;s war vessels were merchant vessels fitted with cannons and artillery, which paled in comparison to the military might of Great Britain&#39;s Royal Navy. Not to mention, the majority of America&#39;s public did not support the US military, and protested any such war with Great Britain, including America&#39;s invasion of Upper/Lower Canada. However, it was the US who first waged war on the British Empire. This declaration of war was influenced by prominent British transgressions against US trade with France, Impressment, and Native American induced proxy wars. Furthermore, The British Empire made several alliances to help aid their military offensives against the US in the War of 1812. The U S. found themselves fighting against - Spain, the United Kingdom, The Canadas, Tecumseh&#39;s Confederacy, Shawnee, Creek, Red Sticks, Ojibway, Chickamauga, Fox, Iroquois, Miami, Mingo, OttawaKickapoo, Delaware (Lenape), Mascouten, Potawatomi, Sauk, Wyandot ...etc.<br><br>A long summary of the War of 1812: begins with US suppression of multiple Indian rebellions, until British and Native Americans join forces; resulting in multiple US defeats; including - US naval defeats, settlements massacred by Indians, American retreat from Upper Canada, then capture of Detroit Michigan(<i>early</i> <i>1812</i>) In 1813, the US military sought it&#39;s opportunity to recapture Detroit; as well as destroying Canada&#39;s capital of York and torching much of Ontario(<i>Upper</i> <i>Canada</i>) The US also managed to repress the Royal Navy until April 1814, As large numbers of British troops arrived, raiding Chesapeake Bay and eventually capturing Washington, D.C. ... After a severe Royal Navy defeat at Craney Island, On September 13(<i>A</i> <i>major</i> <i>turning</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>war</i>) Fort McHenry withstood 25 hours of bombardment by the British Navy, causing British forces to leave the Chesapeake Bay and focus on capturing New Orleans. Towards the end of the war, the US military had strengthened to a degree which shifted Britain&#39;s military offensive towards a downward spiral; eventually, causing them to call for the peace treaty at Ghent, in direct response to America&#39;s victory at Plattsburgh New York. After the war&#39;s end, the British Empire failed in it&#39;s attempts to capture Louisiana at the Battle of New Orleans. Finally, the US Navy dispatched Britain&#39;s Royal Navy from America&#39;s national waters.<br><br>&quot;it was the final action between British and American forces. The American gunnery was far more effective than the British, despite the two being virtually identical in strength. After exchanging both broadsides and musket fire, the British commander was killed and the British brig was too badly damaged to be salvaged and was set ablaze by the victors after the removal of its stores.&quot;<br><br>The unprovoked American attack on East India Company ship, &#39;Nautilus&#39; was the last military action of the War of 1812, and resulted in a final American Naval victory over the British Empire ...", "comment_date": "2015-10-07T20:52:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anna Shrader", "comment_text": "What I learned today:<br><br>Historians suck at naming things.", "comment_date": "2015-10-07T02:14:31Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Robbie Lessly", "comment_text": "I love this channel.

Protect Canada for the Empire<br>USObjective2. End impressment of US sailors \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 BritishObjective 2. Protect and maintain trade.<br>USObjective3. Stop incursions or attacks by Native Americans<br><br>US OBJECTIVES<br><br>First and foremost, the US invasion of Canada. This was an abject failure, As we all know Canada is a separate country today with strong British ties. If that isn&#39;t already obvious then in brief, the US had various unsuccessful incursions into Canada that were repulsed, or so god awful they barley happened at all. For example Hull&#39;s retreat and subsequent loss at Fort Detroit (taken by Isaac Brock), the US defeat at Queenston Heights, and Dearborn&#39;s attempt further East. Other incursions occurred also. And all were repulsed were forced to withdraw. FAILURE\u00a0<br><br>Then the end of impressment. This reason is usually prioritized by some as an attempt to take attention off America&#39;s failure in Canada. Even Madison used it to counteract the US public eye landing on the US army&#39;s failure in Canada. \u00a0As the Napoleonic wars were drawing to a close the Admiralty ended impressment to sailors of ALL nationalities as the demand for sea-goers wasn&#39;t as high. The French threat was gone and The British Royal navy resumed business as usual as part of a wind down process after the victory of the coalition. The hundred days and then subsequent final defeat of Napoleon did not see a sudden surge or revival in the practice. It was ended due to strictly non American efforts and at a time of the ADMIRALTY&#39;S choosing. No one else. So while it was beneficial to the US, it was no a victory for them as the end of it had nothing to do with them. FAILURE<br><br>As for the end of Native raids this was an issue that predated the war. Following minor battles and confrontations in the past, the US and the likes of Tecumseh&#39;s confederacy were more than willing to fight one another. This is understandable that the native Americans would be irritated by US expansionism. For example the dodgy Treaty of Fort Wayne exceeded disrespect for Tecumseh as about 3 million acres of Native ground was given to the US, without the consent of the US President and therefore US government. To say nothing of the bribery and legal loopholes that riddled not only this deal but previous ones. It also became evident that Tecumseh was being armed by the British following the discovery of British firearms following such a fore mentioned engagements. However, with that in mind, remember this quote,<br>&quot;However, according to the U.S Army Center of Military History, the &quot;land-hungry frontiersmen&quot;, with &quot;no doubt that their troubles with the Indians were the result of British intrigue&quot;, exacerbated the problem by &quot;[ circulating stories] after every Indian raid of British Army muskets and equipment being found on the field&quot;. Thus, &quot;the westerners were convinced that their problems could best be solved by forcing the British out of Canada&quot;.&quot;<br><br>The natives went to the British for protection. And the British saw an opportunity to create a Native American buffer state. However, it it worth remembering this certainly wasn&#39;t a huge priority for the British government. What was a secondary objective for the British was a primary one for the Natives. Unfortunately for Tecumseh&#39;s followers, their leader was killed early October 1813 and as a result his confederacy soon fell apart. The British, while not intending to take any part of the US for themselves, still considered putting forth a native American Confederacy nation at Ghent. This quote sums up some key points, but has some misconceptions such as &quot;long standing goal&quot; and how much interest the British showed in it.<br>&quot;The British had the long-standing goal of creating a large &quot;neutral&quot; Indian state that would cover much of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. They made the demand as late as the fall of 1814 at the peace conference, but lost control of western Ontario in 1813 at key battles on and around Lake Erie. These battles destroyed the Indian confederacy which had been the main ally of the British in the region, and which would make up the proposed neutral state. Although the area remained under British or British-allied Indians&#39; control until the end of the war, it became a less practicable idea. At American insistence, and with higher priorities, the British dropped the demands&quot;. SUCCESS<br>However this is often VASTLY over inflated, along with the intentions and desires the British had on the US. The story is ALTOGETHER less simple, as demonstrated in the knowledgeable side note below. ..<br><b>Side note</b>: Courtesy of E Richardson:<br><br><b>The French had a peaceful relationship with natives because of their generosity. Yearly gifts (Beads, iron goods, Guns ammunition Blankets) \u00a0of &quot;tribute&quot; (For lack of a better word as these were obligations) became huge gatherings of many tribes as the promises of alliance &amp; peace were renewed</b>.<br><b>The French Indian war saw the French colonists submit to British rule as formalized by the treaty how ever Natives never accepted that France had the right to cede territory that belonged to them as they had never submitted to French rule &amp; saw the French colonies as more of a lease. So long as France continued paying tribute the colonies were unmolested</b>.<br><b>The British assuming they were clear title holders neglected the &quot;Gifts&quot; which resulted in Pontiac&#39;s Rebellion. This war was a nightmarishly horrible &amp; ended in a stalemate</b>. <b>Amherst was called back to Britain the gifts resumed, now with Britain being the giver &amp; the Royal Proclamation 1763 saw the limiting of colonial growth as Natives were acknowledged to have rights to their own lands</b>. <b>This was the first time any European power legally acknowledged this right. (Its also the reason these events are still a inflammatory topic to Natives as we are fighting in court battles right now for rights we had granted to us then</b><br><b>Supposedly this could be seen as the beginning of &quot;the long-standing goal of creating a large &quot;neutral&quot; Indian state&quot; but the American colonies had not even rebelled yet so this wasn&#39;t a buffer to anything, it was a compromise for peace</b>.<br><b>Part of the reason Britain didn&#39;t mind ceding the region to the Americans after their revolution was because Britain only had a precarious hold on it in the first place. When the Americans refused to honor the treaty of Paris 1783 article 5 about compensating Loyalist for property the rebels had stolen Britain used the relationship with Natives to back Little Turtle. It wasn&#39;t spite, it was because the USA wasn&#39;t honoring the treaty</b>. <b>It certainly wasn&#39;t because Britain cared about Natives</b>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War</a><br><b>Keep in mind this was where Tecumseh came in to the picture</b>.<br><b>When the USA finally paid the debt &amp; signed the Jay treaty 1793 fact is the newly formed British/USA relationship was vastly more profitable then the British/Native relationship... and the British abandoned their Native allies to their fate at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. Tecumseh was there. Didn&#39;t leave with warm fuzzy feelings about British</b>.<br><b>Britain continued to give gifts rather then have Natives attack British settlements in the west as the Napoleonic war heated up but also did everything in its power to avoid antagonizing their new trading partner who made no secret of their feelings towards sharing North America with Britain</b>. <b>While Tecumseh began building his confederation around his brother&#39;s Tenskwatawa teachings</b>.<br><b>Its very important to realize those teachings were hostile to all White Settlements not just American as they focused squarely upon Native dependence upon European tech</b>. <b>The Difference being the British continued honoring the treaties while the Americans not only ignored them but were actively hostile to Natives</b>.<br><b>Tecumseh didn&#39;t agree to an alliance with British till after Prophetstown was destroyed by Americans</b>. <b>The Americans attacked &amp; destroyed all food stores just as winter was coming. So Britain got its ally for little more then food &amp; iron pots so that they wouldn&#39;t stave</b>.<br><b>Mind you if the USA had not destroyed Prophetstown Natives could have fielded easily ten times the number they did at Detroit. The Success of Detroit quickly brought that number back up again</b>.<br><b>As Britain entered negotiations at Ghent they wanted to restore the situation before the war. They had to at least try to get recognition of a Native state by Americans as Natives were still helping with the defense of Canada &amp; ignoring the issue completely would likely have resulted in another war between Natives &amp; British settlements there</b>.<br><br>BRITISH OBJECTIVES<br><br>The British protection of Canada was obviously a success. I refer you to the comment addressing US aims of conquest. This was a British victory. OUTSTANDING SUCCESS.<br><br>British objective of maintaining trade and the seaways. As a matter of fact, US privateers did well. Far better than the US navy in fact. The US privateers took 1,300 to the USN&#39;s 254 in captures. And this is commendable in light of their relatively short relationship with the sea. However British trade was overall not greatly damaged and the British took 1400 US ships as prizes in the war. The British economy wasn&#39;t greatly damaged. The huge and powerful maritime economy made sure of that, only 7% being greatly affected. The same however can&#39;t be same for the US, with their maritime economy crippled as a result of the British blockade. &quot;The parlous American economy was thrown into chaos with prices soaring and unexpected shortages causing hardship&quot;. There were NO such issues in Britain. On top of this, various US naval ships were bottled up in port and when they tried to escape they were captured (the Chesapeake and President). SUCCESS<br><br>1/3 US Objectives achieved, beaten by 2/2 British Objectives achieved. Therefore, we must conclude that the British Empire won this conflict. \ufeff", "comment_date": "2015-01-19T20:21:34Z", "likes_count": 54}, {"comment_by": "Patricia Wang", "comment_text": "Did you guys see the TFIOS image pop up at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMXqg2PKJZU&amp;t=8m11s\">8:11</a>?? &quot;Okay, Okay&quot;", "comment_date": "2015-01-18T01:35:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Kelts", "comment_text": "I guess trying to have a little fun about funny videos about history is a crime on YouTube.

Did he know Jacquie was sick? Of course he did. A day later, the doctor called me and told me to come and pick my daughter up. He was releasing her.

Peace Treaty means the end of an armed conflict. And the terms of victory for Britain and America were different. The British goals were achieved but the terms of condition for Britain were to destroy America by completely conquering it. The American goals were to annex Canada. That of course was a complete failure that I admit. But the British goal of halting American expansion was failed even when america was still under their control. Americans were going across the Allegheny Mountains despite the pleas of the British not to. During the War of 1812 the Americans were still expanding against the Native Americans. So the British goal of halting American territory was a failure. Also the British also tried to take over the Great Lakes. That was a failure. But really if you look at the smaller goals,not just the bigger goals you realize that basically there was a even amount of failure and defeat. But again it comes back to if you make a Peace Treaty the side that ultimately wins is of course the one with the most successes but in this case it was pretty much an even battle.

You are calling him a moron? LOL Seriously? Do some fact checking on the propaganda you are choosing to believe.<br>Impressment continued until 1815 when Britain began reducing their Navy. Until that time the need for sailors made impressment essential no matter how unpopular the practice was.<br>But that had nothing to do with the war because Britain never had a policy of taking Americans in the first place, only reclaiming their own citizens. The issue was an overblown excuse for war not the reason.<br>We can prove this because the US Congressmen who voted for war had nothing to do with Merchant shipping. The War Hawks used the issue to try to convince the Federalist Congressmen who opposed the war not because they cared about it them selves.<br>Two weeks before the USA declared war Britain repealed the orders in Counsel 1807. Which had nothing to do with Impressment. The OiC 1807 had to do with trade restrictions upon Napoleon controlled Europe.<br>We can also prove this had nothing to do with why the USA declared war because the British leadership in Canada called for an armistice hoping to end the war when News arrived.<br>The USA chose to continue the war regardless. Ergo you can&#39;t use it as an excuse anymore.<br>Taking Canada was the only objective. Those who argue otherwise are ignoring the facts. We can read the war Hawks own words &amp; the USA invading army actually published its intent to liberate Canada.<br>All the facts point in one direction.

The attacks on washington, baltimore and New Orleans were not full blown invasions set on ending the US state. They were more &quot;raids&quot; launched as part of Admiral Cockburn&#39;s war against the US economy and privateer effort. The assault of Baltimore was an attempt to crush the privateer effort once and for all and at the same time inflict devastating losses on the US economy. The burning of Washington can be see as more an act of revenge for the US declaration of war rather that the beginning of an invasion.

One of the most important was the conquest of Canada, not the occupation of some northern territory. In dispatches the war in Canada was called a mission of emancipation. However things did not go well for the US and every single invasion failed. It did not matter how many battles in Canada the Us won the fact remains that the invasions were repelled and often decisively. Another mistake you made was classifying the Battle of Queenston heights as an American victory. It wasn&#39;t, American casualties were substantially higher and at the end of the battle the British controlled the heights while the Americans were in full retreat. I fail to see how you can insist that it was an American victory.<br><br>Further more the US navy also suffered major losses such as the USS Chesapeak and the USS President. Towards the end of the war the British imposed an effective blockade which restricted the movement of the US navy. In fact most US ships never left port due to fear of the overwhelming British strength. The privateer effort was also crushed and losses amongst British trade ships were minimal, less than 0.1% of all British merchantmen were captured by American privateers and a third of all the ships that were captured were recaptured before they reached port.<br><br>Another area where America suffered greatly was in the economy. US state revenue fell from 7 million at the start of the war to around 400,000 at the conclusion of hostilities. The British blockade was so effective that it cut off almost all American overseas trade leading to disastrous economic problems.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-01-05T12:35:30Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "anthony flores", "comment_text": "I watch at least 2 or 3 episodes of crash course history a day .
