China was simply too rich to have any reason to go looking for more land, where Europe, which had recently been cut off from the valuable trade-routes of the Middle East by the rise of islamic empires like the Ottomans in Anatolia and Mamluks in Egypt, was suddenly experiencing a limitation in their access to material wealth, which lead them to searching for other routes to the riches of the east.<br><br>This may seem like pointless nitpicking, but I think it&#39;s actually pretty important to understanding history.

Columbus didn&#39;t think the Americas were there -- and he also somehow got the circumference of the earth wrong (even though that had been known since classical times) and thought Asia would be a shorter trip than it would be if the Americas were NOT there -- and was trying to find the Spice Islands -- or the Indies, hence the West Indies which he incorrectly thought were the East Indies, which at the time were the ONLY Indies.

Like really proved it with skeletons of children who had congenital syphilis. It shows very clearly in both the bone matrix and leaves specific marks on the teeth. It is harder to definitively prove in adults who catch it, but congenital syphilis can only be contracted from the mother at a specific time in pregnancy if she is still infectious. This evidence has been around for years- including a monastery in Europe in the decade before Columbus went off (though those bones are of adults and it is harder to categorically say &#39;IT MUST BE SYPHILIS&#39; because other things can leave similar marks, but it is more likely to have been syphilis than everyone else had a cocktail of syphilis-like diseases). It occurs to me that despite the growing evidence (Mary BEARD.), there is a cultural bias towards thinking of syphilis as a scientific puzzle, which can be solved, rather than some ingrained truth like how Columbus wasn&#39;t a murderer and cruel guy who decimated the Taino people. I would super like it if you could look at some research and amend the syphilis phrasing, because until people who have a voice (like you do) in culture and society stand up and say &#39;this cultural bias is hurting actual attempts to prove the origin of syphilis&#39; there is still going to be a huge stigma for anyone saying &#39;hold on, there is contradicting evidence that Columbus introduced syphilis to Europe&#39;.<br><br>(Seriously, Mary Beard.)", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T03:15:47Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Connor -J- Evans", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UC5km6-o2oM&amp;t=5m09s\">5:09</a> tomato sauce?
