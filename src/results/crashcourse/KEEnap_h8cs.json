This divides the movie into three sections, not the commonly believed 4 sections. What&#39;s more important here is that Kubrick (and editor Ray Lovejoy) have told the audience that despite technological advances, the dawn of humanity and it&#39;s future self has not evolved as much as we think in those 4 million years of evolution.  That hard jump-cut between bone and spacecraft compresses the ancient with the future into one section.", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T19:14:45Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"KEEnap_h8cs": {"2001 - A Space Odyssey: Crash Course Film Criticism #15": {"channel_id": "UgwSp69J_TE3mPxleyN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Iguana93", "comment_text": "Interesting, yet the story is Clarke&#39;s and his novel has a very precise explanation of everything. For example the whole thing with HAL has almost nothing to do with the central story, it&#39;s just a malfunction due to conflicting programming, since the computer was supposed to be truthful, yet was given a secret mission which it could not disclose. The fact that this part of the story is given so much prominence in the movie actually shows they needed to give more space to something thriller-like. And the marketing department used it to attract viewers to the &quot;rogue computer&quot; story, even though it&#39;s the least thought provoking idea from the whole story. I think saying &quot;nothing here is an accident, everything was intentional&quot; might be overstating it. Saying that bad dialogue is intentional because of some deep reason is just alibism. I think the choice to display technology instead of developing characters was because they simply wanted to make a visually stunning movie and wanted to showcase technological visions. Besides, Clarke generally leaned more to world-building or &quot;technology-building&quot; in his books and his characters seemed to get somewhat less important and repetitive. Anyway, I have no doubt the story is predominantly Clarke&#39;s and I don&#39;t think Kubrick did it justice in the movie. I think that with some of the scenes being very protracted, there was enough space to give more attention to the story and its cohesion while still keeping the overall artistic impact. Lastly - if you say you think it&#39;s perfect and exactly as intended, I think you&#39;re wrong. I don&#39;t believe it happens often that a movie director says their movie came out exactly as they wanted. Or they may say that for publicity purposes, but think differently. I&#39;m not in film, but I&#39;m pretty sure compromises have to be made, shots don&#39;t work out the way they ideally should, something has to be edited out etc. etc..

They even developed the story together, and tried to coordinate the 2 so the book would come out slightly earlier. But then Kubrick changed his mind (back and forth) about some stuff and couldn&#39;t figure out how to do other stuff without making it look like sci-fi schlock.

They consider intelligence the one <i>truly</i> valuable commodity in the universe, so they set out to advance it in every place they thought they could, cultivating it like a crop.

The Sentinel was a very complex and self aware machine but in a sense, not completely conscious. It&#39;s job was to warn it&#39;s creators of danger. And if we posed a danger to the local galactic neighborhood, it was expected to destroy us, entirely. Dave Bowman and HAL became a sort of digital backup of what they once were, and in a sense, died and their minds were absorbed by the Sentinel, and given a sort of existence, plain and &#39;pre-recorded&#39; as it may have been. In the subsequent movies, Dave visits his former wife and explains this to her, remarking that he could not even explain his current form nor his &#39;type&#39; of consciousness, even if he wanted to. But he was aware enough to &#39;desire&#39; closure with her.<br><br><br>So, Kubrick&#39;s interpretation of Clarke&#39;s ideas were the best visual attempt at describing Dave Bowman being absorbed by the Sentinel but being allowed to see a possible future and what he would have been and done had he been able to return to earth and live out his life. It was almost an insult in a way, as the Sentinel gave him a glimpse, then killed him by absorption, then integrated his mind into itself so it could understand humanity, better.

The book by Nietzsche about making the primative into superman (ubermench or overman) . The Nietzschean concept that the NAZIs, and others today, misinterpreted. Nietzsche wrote that all human (primative) morals should be dispensed with in achieveing superman morals. The NAZIs overlooked the morals of the superman which are to make of the primative SELF superman that makes other primatives superman. Something wrong with all the eating in spite of all the technology. The perfection of the last meal except for the breaking glass. Possibly the most famous setup, and shock from a simple object, in movie history. Not perfect yet. The monolith symbolizing all technology which is mostly white,. The ending white room. Yet not all white. But the monolith is black. The dark side. Bowman reaches to embrace the dark side. to enter the dark side. To lose human morals.

It won&#39;t be like this. It would take way too much money and time to build all the things you see in the movie. I think they extrapolated from bus, to train, to plane, to space. The problem is, you run out of time and money between the last two. And many things aren&#39;t right. The crescent in the opening sequence is too thick. The sun would be absolutely blinding. The stars wouldn&#39;t be continuously moving up (or was it down?) when Frank was drifting out into space, unless the camera was orbiting him. Lots of things like this. I catch more every time I see it. And HAL. Who has a yellow light inside his eye? Eyes don&#39;t contain lights. His does. And why not two of them for stereoscopic vision? There are many more things like this. Oh, and the big cavern for the spaceship descending into the moon. Why do you need this huge cavern? It would take decades to build it. And what&#39;s the bit with no HAL 9000 ever making an error. Uh, it was humans who built and programmed the thing.

The issue isn&#39;t that the film isn&#39;t intellegent or that it didn&#39;t have interesting ideas, but that in comparison to the novel it&#39;s, well, kinda boring to me. The movie is so prone to long sequences that overstay there welcome just a bit too much, and the characters are so depthless that for me it lacks any element of humanity. You say in the video that this is part of the point of the movie, but unlike the book, the movie can&#39;t create a reaction out of me without these elements. The book has a very inviting narration style that gives the story some humanity, but the film just tries to compensate for this by adding in lots of beautiful shots, but these don&#39;t engage the audience. I know a lot of people love this movie, and good for you, I guess, but for me it&#39;s not even that I don&#39;t like it it&#39;s just that it provokes no reaction out of me, I don&#39;t feel anything or learn anything, so it fails as art to me, I&#39;d rather just read a boring intellectual essay written by Kubrick, because that might as well be what this movie is.
