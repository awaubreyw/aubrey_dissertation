I do.<br>   The universe is expanding but its expansion is accelerating the timeline also.

(geographical length) A hundred years ago sailors measured the length between landmarks using a fold-page which showed the length of measurements curving and not seable or whats around the corner and bringing it to view on a flat universe flat world. ( For instance, light (quanta) lurking around the corner changes into e/m waves) Albert Einstein used the mass of the length of light &#39;&#39; meaning the mass affected by gravity 93,000 m/s changed the length with billions of light years and called that the length of the flat universe. Erwin Hubble than proved Einstein was wrong when he discovered the universe was expanding at a speed greater than light. Though no scientist has recalculated that length over history from 19010 Hubble showed the universe was round like the Earth was not flat. Relativities debunk is just that - a debunk and it affects all his work even the age of the universe - but dont take my word for it)  Like your video you get a ten....<br>How can something so wrong be so right - in physics?
