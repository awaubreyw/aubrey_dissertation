It took another 70 years before a new, original colored copy in a Spanish archive was discovered (I believe after an anonymous gift), that included the ending. By 2010 (or so), and years of restoration work, the full length Moon film was finally shown at MoMa.

Like the Lumiere&#39;s were not the first to hold a public screening George was not the first to use the stop the camera, and make a substitution, and start the camera back up  trick. The first film I think to use it was called The Execution of Mary Queen of Scots from 1895. Still, George probably discovered on his own, like he described.  While he did use the double exposure trick ( a lot)  along with the substitution trick, and a quick edit to match them up, I do not believe he used the split screen effect, or the Matte effect you mentioned in the video. If you want to show me proof, I will look at it, but all the films I have seen from him are just Double Exposures, beautifully executed, but still not Splits or Mattes. That is why there is so much black on his stage, so that he can just run the unexposed film through the camera again, and place another image in the black area of the stage, no need for Mattes or Splits.  Many claim that Four Troublesome Heads used these Mattes, but they would never work in the real world scenario of that film, as George himself is moving around too much for his head to be cut off by a Matte.  Edwin S. Porter&#39;s The Great Train Robbery certainly used Mattes, but they did not use glass either, as that would cut off portions of the frame that are simply still there,  no digital roto-scoping to help them out.
