In fact want to take the initiative, meet with your congressman, local town council, call your state or U.S. Senator, write a letter to congress, start a petition, run for a local office (many run reelection unopposed), or anything else than complain about an educational channel clearly designed as a survey course video.

My experience with lobbyists is also more positive than the stereotype. The one I worked with focused mainly on keeping her clients updated on relevant legislation and informing the legislators about issues that most of them had no idea even existed. It&#39;s easy to form an opinion about people you&#39;ve never met. Go to your capitol and meet with your [state] representatives, they&#39;d be ecstatic to meet with you and talk to you about the issues you have.",

        "comment_text": "For the first time, I am disappointed in Crash Course. First, there are numerous examples of money affecting politicians&#39; decisions. Whether it is when a politician changes their stance on an issue and conveniently receiving campaign donations from a group representing that issue, or when it is discovered that a lobbying (special interest) group blatantly writes a bill which numerous politicians try to pass off as their own (recent incidents like ALEC, or even Citibank writing Wall Street bills), there are too many examples of money affecting politics to count- yet Crash Course would have us believe that there is no link? Or that, at best, they &quot;convince&quot; politicians to &quot;strike&quot; part of a bill indirectly? Downplaying the effects of money and special interests in politics is doing your viewers a disservice. If anything, you should have downplayed the role that satisfying their constituents plays in politicians&#39; decision-making (even though you label that reality as &quot;cynical&quot;). Which leads me to my second point, which is that politicians now often run unopposed, or in districts that are so gerrymandered that it is impossible for them to lose. You claim that politicians respond to the will of their voters, and that may have once been the case, but it is no longer the case. Politicians are constantly voting against their constituents&#39; interests, and often even against their explicitly expressed wishes. They are able to get away with this now, largely due to the facts I just mentioned- running unopposed, or in gerrymandered districts. This rose-colored spin of the real-world facts disappointed me severely.<br>P.S. I know many may want to point to the Tea Party as an example of politicians who don&#39;t respond to voters being ousted in their gerrymandered districts&#39; \u00a0primaries, but the lesson still holds for two reasons: 1) the Tea Party was financially backed by big money (again showing the influence of moneyed special interests), and 2) many of the those that were voted into office due to their promises to be different than establishment republicans ended up voting against those promises. (That said, I am not one of their supporters, so I wasn&#39;t disappointed when they broke those ridiculous promises, yet it still shows that money is more important in modern politics than the will of the voters).",
