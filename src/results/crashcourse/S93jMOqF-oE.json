We are broken in different ways, with or without religion, and many have used and will use religion as a way to hate or hurt others. But the existence of evil doesn&#39;t disprove God.

It isn&#39;t as if he&#39;s simply saying, &quot;Belief in God may be irrational but it cannot be disproven and it has wonderful benefits!&quot; He was saying something much more profound and subtle. But these distinctions are lost here. You cannot simply say, &quot;If you can leap to belief in God, you could just as well jump to belief in a flying teapot.&quot; That is no critique at all. Pascal had provided all kinds of evidences for faith. Again, that is what the Pensees is - a book of reasons for faith, reasons to believe faith is rational and warranted as constituting true knowledge.

As a matter of fact I&#39;m just now going through all your religion/philosophy videos. Mostly everything has been pretty good, not great but pretty good. This video is the first I&#39;ve had an actual full on whiff of bias. Indiana Jones did not use faith to guide him through the trails at the end of Last Crusade. It was science and rational thinking which got him safely past the traps. I know this is weird what with the thousand year old man and god using a box as a radio in an earlier adventure but it&#39;s true. 1) The Breath of God: Jones used evidence, his understanding of the word penitent, and his experience with ancient traps to survive.  Two men had already been decapitated, penitent means to kneel, and we all saw what happened at the beginning of Raiders with flying scythes. 2) The Word of God: &quot;Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed&quot;  and letters on the floor which spell God&#39;s name within the puzzle not once but twice with a different first letter can&#39;t be too hard to figure out for a well read history teacher who can read Latin. 3) The Path of God: its framed in the moment to look like Indie took a leap of religious faith. But was it faith in God or in his father&#39;s work? In his father&#39;s notebook this challenge is written in Latin as &quot;The Invisible Bridge&quot;. Jones, as a scientist, understands that some things are invisible to the human eye. And the bridge does not disappoint his trust as it turns out to not be the work of divinty but a very real optical illusion. He even tosses sand on it to rule out needing faith to find the bridge again when he truly needs it. As for the Holy Grail, reason saved the day here as well. Jones watches one men fail the riddle because &quot;I&#39;m not a historian, which one is it?&quot;. Indiana Jones is a historian, he used his knowledge to find the cup of a carpenter.

Should God exist, then the more you sin the harsher your punishment will be. And this is actually why people deny God&#39;s existence. Because they sin, and they know they are accountable to Him yet instead of admitting their mistakes and asking for forgiveness. They deny His existence because they find this easier than admitting they&#39;ve goofed.<br><br><b>Maybe you are one of those kids raised in a religious household who is just never feeling it...</b><br><br>   Truth isn&#39;t measured by subjective feelings that often change. For example, I could be on a plane flying to Japan. But if I <i>feel</i> we&#39;re flying towards Hong Kong then from those feelings I conclude it is true, does that change the truth? No, just because I felt like the plane was flying in the wrong direction didn&#39;t make it true. Just because you&#39;re not feeling a religion affect you doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s false.<br><br>   Now let&#39;s look at some evidence for God. Not the evidence discussed in this series about God.

Makes sense. I am not a fan of religion, but pragmatism works and so does Pascal&#39;s wager.<br><br>And Pascal&#39;s wager is not brainwash, it is faith. The fact is that the more you do something the more you increase the probability of it coming true. You shoot against a target enough times you will eventually hit it and increase your chance at improving in hitting the target. The placebo effect is proven to work, and Quantum Physics proves that everything influences. So Pascal is right and much smarter than men like Hawkins and Dawkins.<br><br>Indiana Jones practiced faith even if he did not believe in God, and it got him a lot further than a atheist who refuse to do anything until he/she has evidence that it will succeed or is true. Atheism makes no sense because evidence is gathered though action or by faith if you will, so you will never get evidence of anything if you don&#39;t try the experiment. And even if you can be right then in claiming that you can never hit the target, what do you gain by having hit no target at all or having accomplished nothing of value? Well nothing...and that fits perfectly with atheism which essentially says you come from nothing and return to nothing...the problem is just that betting on nothing wins you nothing, and makes everything you do pointless. So it is a bet against action and ability really. The practical agnostic at least has the potential of becoming a Indiana Jones or better. But the stubborn atheist would never become a true Indiana Jones or better unless they lie to themselves about practicing faith to get there.<br><br>Kirkegaard is also a very smart man. Pascal and Kirkegaard were both right. The problem with relying on evidence is that everything in the universe moves and changes all the time, so evidence is really just faith in motion. If you hold on to evidence without having faith in more, you essentially do what traditional religion do and hold on to something you think is true only to find that the truth is far better and better and will prove you wrong.<br><br>Both science and religion has failed because it relied on evidence rather than faith. For religion falsely assumed the earth was the center of the universe based on outdated evidence and was proven wrong, but scientists of faith who saw a bigger picture. But likewise some scientists has made similar mistakes in assuming and declaring God dead, and the evolution theory fact because they thought evidence pointed in that direction, when again quantum physics with more faith proved flaws with these assumptions and came up with the God particle.<br><br>You see faith, pragmatism, learning, growing, changing...following pascal&#39;s wager...etc...wins every time.<br>Those who rely on evidence, tradition, rituals and facts loose every time.<br><br>For evidence and fact is really just faith in motion.

If you look up the words fact, evidence, truth, reality etc...you will find that all these words really means is belief &quot;accepted&quot; as being true, and it is accepted as long as it is evident to work practically, once someone has enough faith to prove that it doesn&#39;t...then evidence points to a new evidence and the old evidence now becomes false.", "comment_date": "2017-08-24T16:27:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cathy Schneider", "comment_text": "What sort of second-rate god can&#39;t tell if I&#39;m faking my belief?

If its deterministic than everything happens due to causality. An example is how do you predict the weather perfectly? You can develop theory based on our understanding of pressure ect, and have instruments that measure temperature to build a model with practical usefullness. However the curve of accuracy decreases exponentially the father out into time you go. In order to predict the weather perfectly you would have to take everything into consideration, from how the sun effects our weather, to other stars effect on our sun, to galaxies effect out to infinity. The only way to predict the weather perfectly (or anything) is to know everything perfectly. I call this view of knowing everything perfectly as &quot;a God&#39;s eye view&quot;. When anything happens its in accordance with &quot;God&#39;s will&quot; or causality. The opposite view to this is the universe is ultimately random (ie there is no ultimate rules that dictate how the universe has to work). Randomness is a difficult thing to quantify, in maths there is no such thing (discovered anyways)as &quot;true or absolute&quot; randomness. When you try to program a random number generator what your really doing is making something that is so complex its effectually random. The bottom line is (in my view anyways) that we are doomed to the approximate due to our limited perspective. The universe is effectually random in that we will never be able to understand it perfectly. Our limited understanding of the rules of nature allows us to make useful approximations, but no matter how accurate we try to become we will never achieve absolute certainty. I mean it may be possible to understand the fundamental rules (of the universe) and model it in some sort of computer, then it would just be a matter of finding ourselves in it. But who knows, I think the idea that people understand &quot;God&quot; absolutely perfectly, is inconsistent with human history, and our fundamental limitations. However the definition of what &quot;God is&quot; is an interesting concept, all religions have been arguing it throughout human history. I dont think its useless to consider the viewpoints that have developed over time, but of course everything has to be viewed through the lens of our limited perspective.

It seems like you&#39;re just setting us upon this cliche, western descent into the abyss.  So many other things you could have mentioned like Essence and Attribute?  Even Heidegger wrote about this...<br>anyway - the wager just works for the singular aspect of acknowledging the existence of a Creator, not for beliefs in general and certainly not for religions as wholes - and one of the biggest problems here is the confusion between the terms and realities of &#39;belief&#39; and &#39;faith&#39; and &#39;religion.&#39;  And before all that, something grossly misunderstood is that requiring &#39;faith in god&#39; as opposed to &#39;knowledge of god&#39; is implicitly atheistic.  If there is an All-Powerful Creator and Sustainer of all existence, then shouldn&#39;t there be sufficient and readily accessible evidence?  Of course!  But what do you reckon to be the evidence and how do you determine if it is sufficient?  What is the scale by which you determine the difference between obvious and skeptical?  Do you think it reasonable to posit your tiny rational-faculty and limited material experience against even the vastness of our current material world let alone the endlessness of eternity and immateriality?<br>You cant just start off with a word like GOD, and go from there...then you get what we have here, people going back and forth and gaining nothing.<br>The real question is the question of Identity.  First you have to understand something about the limits and capabilities of your own knowledge about yourself.  Then later you can start to understand some tiny drops of the knowledge of the Creator and Sustainer of Reality.  What here is often referred to as &#39;belief.&#39;<br>Whatever path a person chooses, belief or unbelief, an intelligent person should understand the necessity of guidance, and the &#39;faith&#39; required therein.  Guidance is not just sitting in a classroom listening to a teacher, it is all the means and manners by which a person adopts a worldview.  It is inescapable.  So how do you pick the right Guides?  Very important question!<br>The main purpose of &#39;religion&#39; is not to espouse belief, it is to provide guidance on how to live in this brief, material life.<br>And here again, the teapot religion is a perfect example of implicit atheism.  It is assumed that religion is man-made and that there isn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t possibly be a &#39;right-way&#39; or Supreme Guidance provided by the Creator of Guidance and Truth.  <br>Why is atheism the default?  Who do you think you are to claim that there isn&#39;t sufficient evidence of the Creator?  The food you eat and the clothes you wear...do you even know any details about where they came from and how they reached to you?  We are so ignorant about even the most basic facts of our material existence and yet make such far reaching claims and implications...yes THAT is dangerous!  Have you considered where the parts that make up your material being were 1000 years ago?  100 years ago?  Right before you ate them or breathed them in?<br>If we&#39;re not busy trying to understand ourselves, individually and commonly, no use for talking about &#39;god&#39; yet...<br><br>So crash course, maybe next time you can do one on &quot;when, between earth and man, does consciousness begin?&quot; - or maybe &quot;we shape clay into a pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want&quot; - or &quot;it is the curve in the bow that makes it straight&quot;<br><br>thanks", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T14:41:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vitamindubya", "comment_text": "Dunno why Indy was still agnostic after seeing so much first hand.

As a person of faith, I have never found Pascal&#39;s argument to be very compelling. The wager is primarily concerned with how your faith personally benefits you and less concerned with living according what is actually and factually true. As it&#39;s been stated in this series in the past, there are both good and bad reasons to accept a given premise as true, this would be a bad one. Kierkegaard, however, I&#39;ve been a fan of since my days in college and in seminary. Granted he was kind of a weirdo in his personal life, but his concept of fideism challenges a primary theme in these videos, that being the primacy of human reason. While Kierkegaard valued reason as a philosopher, he understood that it has its limits because human beings are imperfect creatures and, as a result, our own thinking is faulty. So he suggests that in order to apprehend God through the eyes of faith we must commit the cardinal sin of modern humanism and take a leap away from reason and logic (at least at first) and into what he calls the &quot;absurd&quot;.  Now, this doesn&#39;t mean we abandon reason and logic altogether, after all it is God who gave us our minds and expects us to use them to, say, to discuss and reason through things like morality, ethics, politics, etc. This initial surrendering of our reason isn&#39;t a sign of intellectual weakness or a lack of authenticity, but an acceptance that human reason isn&#39;t the ultimate justification for what is good, right, and true.", "comment_date": "2016-05-30T03:33:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Heba Ahmed", "comment_text": "This course was absolutely amazing !!

There are many things a little askew Pascal was a Christian , Christian theology doesn&#39;t teach God sends good people to heaven and bad people to hell, it teaches all people are imperfect and the only way a perfect God and imperfect man can have fellowship was for God to pay the price on the cross and redeem those who trust him in that. To divorce Pascal&#39;s wager from his world view distorts his position in my far from humble opinion. Star Trek the west&#39;s version of &quot;the Russian Brothers , Spock is emotionless logic, Bones is emotion unhampered by  logic and Kirk has to use both in balance to make sound judgments. So the distinction between blind faith and faith has to be made at least from a Christian world view. The thumbnail example we don&#39;t test every chair , every time we sit in it. We make choices in who and what to trust. Is the chair maker trustworthy can I put my faith in him? Once again in my full eight of an octave range I fall on Lewis again, a devout life long atheist who was bothered by the idea of God kept popping up. And he felt that logic kept pushing him towards a God he wanted no part in from emotional reasons. He read the verse in the Bible where God calls man &quot;come let us reason together&quot;. So he studied the arguments against God that he was taught were airtight and found them shoddy and ill-formed,  and he said &quot;logic brought me to the door , yet could not make me go in&quot;. So in human relationships there is a need for trust , If I say I will only trust you if I can put you under 24/7 surveillance, that is not trust, and I am stating you are untrustworthy, if God&#39;s goal is relationship, there has to be a level of trust that is somewhere between blind trust and 24/7 surveillance , and most of us struggle finding comfort where we land in all relationships. I like the analogy of a child on a diving board, with a parent swimming in the deep end the child knows with every fiber in his body the water will not support him, and he will sink like a rock, yet he trusts his Dad and in spite of what he feels is overwhelming evidence he leaps to his father&#39;s arms.

Dude, you are misinformed (and are, hence, a disseminator of misinformation).  Here are just three things from the first five minutes:<br><br>1.  You&#39;ve defined pragmatism incorrectly.  As a philosophical school, it isn&#39;t considered an alternative to finding truth; it is the belief that whatever works IS TRUE and is the principle means of locating it.  Pragmatism isn&#39;t some nifty device people use, it&#39;s an entire epistemological theory.<br><br>2.  William James&#39; version of &quot;pragmatism&quot; was extremely unique and varied.  And, while he did indeed promulgate a certain pragmatic theory of truth, he never considered himself a card-carrying member of the pragmatist school.  Charles Sanders Peirce was the father, and chief apologist, of pragmatism.<br><br>3.  Your understanding of Pascal&#39;s wager is the vulgar, populist one that treats it as a logical equation.  Typically, those who interpret Pascal in this manner . . . HAVEN&quot;T READ PASCAL.  The point of the Wager was always to underscore how &quot;monstrous&quot; (to use Pascal&#39;s word) it is to treat the question of God&#39;s existence as if it were mere parlour talk.  Pascal expends thousands of words on this matter in the lead up to the so-called &quot;wager&quot;.  As Pascal says right before laying it out, &quot;We condemn those who live without thought of the ultimate end of life, who let themselves be guided by their own inclinations and their own pleasures without reflection and without concern, and, as if they could annihilate eternity by turning away their thought from it, think only of making themselves happy for the moment.&quot;  If there&#39;s a &quot;wager&quot; at all, it was that the person who treats the matter of God as &quot;trifling&quot; (again, Pascal&#39;s word) is a person gambling with his life.

Hume also leads to a great jumping off point to analytic philosophy, which, connected to philosophy of religion, culminated in the logical positivist movement (though that was an argument against the intelligibility of religious language more than anything). I recognize that you have to drawn the line somewhere, but my concern is that far too often people engage with existentialism as though they came out of no where with some radical new idea previously unaddressed (though this would doubtless make Sartre very happy). The fact is that in response to idealism, and in particular the idealism of Hegel, there was an initial negative response (via Nietzsche) and then a more positive response following Nietzsche in the twentieth century existentialists. The connect between Sartre, Camus and (yes really) even Woody Allen, on the one hand, to Kierkegaard on the other is their common response to idealism and analytic philosophy. Indeed they have little else in common considering the religious/spiritual tone of Kierkegaard compared to the &quot;radical freedom&quot; of atheism found in Sartre, Camus, Heidegger, and the like.

Because when you think about it, if God&#39;s existence can&#39;t be reasoned, as Pascal assumed, then neither can that of the afterlife. <br><br>That being said, it may be that we are going at belief in God all backwards. Most people tend to think of God as the starting point for the religious life. You believe in God, and from that belief derives all other beliefs and practices associated with the religion. That therefore creates the need to justify that initial belief. If you can&#39;t give a reasonable explanation for why you believe in God, then everything that is a consequence of that belief becomes irrational.<br><br>However, if you start to analyse belief in God as I described above, in terms of whether it has any utility in the real world, then you have to concede that there are preceding developments in the religious life that account for why people believe in God; something is making it beneficial, or even inclining a person to believe. So rather than being something that needs to be justified, God becomes the rationale for those things in the religious life that preceded it. <br><br>This approach is made even more pragmatic by the fact there are many religions that are either primarily orthopraxic (correction action), not theocentric, or both.

By assigning some finite intrinsic value to truth, Pascal is not properly a pragmatist, even though this is a pragmatic argument. Rather, he calculates that the reward of belief and risk of disbelief are infinite, whereas the risk of belief and reward of disbelief are finite, <i>but still exist</i>. That means that, according to his judgment, we ought to believe in God as long as there is <i>any</i> finite chance of his existence.<br><br>He does also say that the probability of existence and nonexistence are equal, because by his definition, God is completely ineffable. By definition, if we cannot know anything about something, the naive probability of it having any property is exactly fifty percent. That&#39;s how we assign probabilities to two mutually exclusive options with no other information to go on. Of course, by the same token, since we know <i>nothing</i>, we also have no more reason to believe God would reward our faith than punish it. So the argument really falls apart. It implicitly assumes there is rational reason to prefer a Biblical God to other possible Gods even though it includes <i>as a premise</i> that there can be no such reason. This cannot be easily fixed, because there are infinitely many possible contradictory versions of God who would demand different things, and since we cannot know God, we have no idea if anything we do or believe will have any effect, or which effect it will have, on our life or afterlife.

Using Russell&#39;s tea pot makes the excellent point that abandoning reason and evidence to justify belief on faith leaves us with no way to determine which faith based belief is correct. To me, the main problem with Pascal&#39;s Wager is that it only assumes one particular (Christian) God concept. So, in a way, it commits the false dichotomy fallacy. If the only choices in the whole universe were Christian God or no God, then the argument might be a good one. But there have been thousands of theistic belief systems, many of which contradict one another. If we accept logic at all, we must accept that they cannot all be correct. And faith doesn&#39;t help us distinguish which is true or false. If faith is enough justification for the Christian God, it&#39;s also enough justification for the Great Cosmic Purple Ape of Andromeda who created us and wishes to save us from the evil Milky Way and lead us to paradise. As a more general critique, I would also say the wager is built entirely on unfounded assumptions. Even if we accept that a God exists, why are we to assume that this God even has a reward and punishment system? Even if we accept that, why are we to assume that <b>belief</b> is a criterion for reward in God&#39;s system? For me, the wager stopped being compelling when I realized that. It became clear to me that I only found the wager compelling because I already bought into the premises of the Christian belief system. When I was a Christian, if a Pagan made the same argument to me for a whole pantheon of gods, I would have instantly seen the flaw in the logic. Yet Pascal&#39;s wager is just as valid for both belief systems. They are both compatible with Pascal&#39;s Wager, but they are not compatible with one another, because one of Christianity&#39;s central tenants is that there is only one God.", "comment_date": "2016-05-23T21:52:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alwyn2112", "comment_text": "Aw, I was hoping for an episode on Descartes reasoning for why he thought God exists, which was actually a bit more complex  than his &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; philosophy", "comment_date": "2016-05-23T21:50:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tomshrader d", "comment_text": "I&#39;m surprised that Hank didn&#39;t mention that Pascal&#39;s Wager is fallacious.
