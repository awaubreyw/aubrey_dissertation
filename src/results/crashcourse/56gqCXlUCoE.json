As a White American who is a Republican, I am appalled, angry, furious, and at a loss for words. After learning about this atrocity, as well as so many others. Many of the issues I see occurring in todays world can easily be linked to atrocities like this. <br><br>We must never allow this to happen again, our people must be educated in schools about this, and we must take actions to ensure that things like this never occur again. It is my belief as of right now, that the NSA, CIA, FBI, ATF and the organization responsible for this be disbanded, destroyed, and rebuilt with safeguards and oversights in place to ensure that these things do not occur again. <br><br>Words can not express how sorry I am and feel for everyone affected by this. Even more so that Justice has not been done. Sure I believe they won a lawsuit with the help of the ACLU if I\u2019m not mistaken?  For 10 million dollars, but that doesn\u2019t do this justice, nor is it adequate enough to compensate those who were affected by this. There were 600 participants. So if you divide 10,000,000 by 600 you get 16,666.66\u2026. That\u2019s only $16,666.66 for each person affected by that atrocity. That is flat out RIDICULOUS!! <br><br>More MUST be done!", "comment_date": "2022-08-14T21:08:13Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"56gqCXlUCoE": {"The Tuskegee Experiment: Crash Course Black American History #29": {"channel_id": "UgxkrWzBOfYlP_O2a4t4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Gabe Hinman", "comment_text": "This should be in schools", "comment_date": "2022-08-12T04:18:50Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"56gqCXlUCoE": {"The Tuskegee Experiment: Crash Course Black American History #29": {"channel_id": "UgychcBdTEgAr_3JkCd4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Tanaka Chiriga", "comment_text": "This crash course is mad depressing but very nesessary", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T10:09:29Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"56gqCXlUCoE": {"The Tuskegee Experiment: Crash Course Black American History #29": {"channel_id": "Ugyq_kcdUSrzykFHNPp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Lady Rain", "comment_text": "The history of medical experimentation is so fucked up.", "comment_date": "2022-08-03T00:23:23Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"56gqCXlUCoE": {"The Tuskegee Experiment: Crash Course Black American History #29": {"channel_id": "UgxnOt8eTZJEUHo7cv94AaABAg", "comment_by": "TheChaz81", "comment_text": "This is just one of the experiments the US Govt. has conducted on its people, THAT WE KNOW ABOUT!
