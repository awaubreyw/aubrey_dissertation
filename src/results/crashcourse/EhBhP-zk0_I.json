Or, alternatively, why is pointing out the importance of non-white men in science and history problematic in the first place?<br><br><br>History, in all respects, scientifically, culturally, and politically, has always been a sausage fest of men stratifying others so that most accomplishments are either misattributed to those men or are simply always made claim to by men (because they were the only beings involved in the scientific process). This isn&#39;t an opinion, this is a fact. History is chauvinistic.<br><br>So, to those who disliked this video, why? Why is acknowledging the literally millennia-long neglected women-in-science deserving of a dislike? An entire half of the human species has historically been underrepresented, shunned, and removed from the scientific process via the long-held historical trend of misogyny, and somehow acknowledging this is problematic? This is half of the human species, capable of similar if not greater achievements in a field that they&#39;ve rarely had the opportunity to belong to in the first place!<br><br><br>Do you feel like acknowledging this is unnecessary? Why would you think that? Name five male scientists and then name five female ones, or just <b>one</b> trans scientist. That&#39;s my point, at least, that awareness of oppressed groups contributions to both history and science ought to be taught, because the deliberate trend of historians directly glossing or ignoring them necessitates recognizing them. Science has historically been associated with men, and so has history, which is <b>exactly why</b> it&#39;s important to highlight non-men (or non-straight non-white non-men) in those respective sausage-fests of academic fields, simply because they haven&#39;t been associated with it for the over two thousand years those fields have existed.<br><br><br>Systemic academic oppression is not only real, but suppresses the importance that other people aside from men have in science and in history, and especially since those people have consistently been denied the opportunity to operate in those fields on a level playing field, the recognition of those suppressed peoples in contemporary study is not only important, it&#39;s necessary.", "comment_date": "2019-06-27T20:01:48Z", "likes_count": 9}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "UgxpBM7GMFmmc6-USpB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Leonardo Oliveira", "comment_text": "Awesome Crash Course!", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T11:03:03Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "Ugy1wCTPSQcenRNtPGZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "KayLow", "comment_text": "Binge watched this series<br>Thanks for existing CC!", "comment_date": "2019-06-15T16:13:37Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "Ugw2GERQcVLmuhwdGm94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Nick B", "comment_text": "I hate we only focused on one pharo in school who was a woman instead of learning about others, others like the ones in the bible. also the fact that alexander was a pharo. a non royal family person from greece.", "comment_date": "2019-06-05T00:13:16Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "Ugyzs4B4fXeiL5AqFX14AaABAg", "comment_by": "Kristi Marie", "comment_text": "I love how CrashCourse includes women in their history, it makes me feel more confident about who I am and being who I am.", "comment_date": "2019-06-03T04:44:15Z", "likes_count": 17}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "Ugz2GNo7KrFdEkBooqd4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Intrograted", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sure someone&#39;s probably said it somewhere here, but one of the beauties of The Scientific Method is that anyone from anywhere at anytime can do it and, if done properly, the knowledge produced will be the same, regardless of standpoint.

I am a little disappointed that, in the history of science, we never seemed to discuss the place and relation of Science and Knowledge. Yes, this is more towards the philosophy of science which was covered in Crash Course Philosophy, but it still remains that as the so called paradigm of science changes, the nature of our understanding of the knowledge gained from that science is. For example, it is readily admitted by this video that the Newtonian Paradigm kept getting more and contradictions inside of itself and was at a point, changed by an Einsteinian Paradigm. But from this we get 2 things: 1) by simply using paradigm we are in a sense in reference to the dominant theory of Thomas Kuhn while ignoring other such theories (for example Slavoj Zizek in his work on Hegelianism poses it not as a paradigm shift but a <i>Ptolemization</i> of a paradigm, that in rejecting the old paradigm we keep its principle premises); and 2) as the scientific knowledge keeps expanding we seem to keep shifting to a technocracy, that is, we are forced to live unable to know but follow by example of experts on the technicalities of such things. For example on point 2), and in a sense it follows as well from point 1), we reject the Newtonian Paradigm for the Einsteinian Paradigm, but we still teach the Newtonian because it can function in these less complex matters. If I am traveling between my home (the Quad Cities of Illinois) and Chicago I know that the distance is such that with a constant velocity of 70 mph, I will reach the general area of Chicago in 2 hours. Thus, in such a case, an approximation of the distance is 140 miles.<br><br>So, all I mean to pose to crash course it that I have enjoyed the series, but with all the hope that was displayed in the metahistorical final episode, that we still face a problem that reaches deep into science itself and a problem of the philosophy of science.", "comment_date": "2019-04-29T22:22:24Z", "likes_count": 4}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "UgyihJ-yUUvY0VnHuiB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Khenric", "comment_text": "Me looking at the name of the course : &quot;I know what the like/dislike ratio will look like...&quot;<br>I wasn&#39;t wrong.", "comment_date": "2019-04-29T22:14:36Z", "likes_count": 170}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "Ugy9rLDaqAlhYSyS8mF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Gemini body shop Body and Paint", "comment_text": "stop with the white man hating dude", "comment_date": "2019-04-29T22:13:58Z", "likes_count": 23}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "UgyRi4OR6rOW69-1ZfJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ben Yamin", "comment_text": "Where&#39;re the feminist BS movement on all of this, click that bill,you&#39;ll never get bored,", "comment_date": "2019-04-29T22:13:46Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "UgzVuXAFdMB8VorEJYh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "The Jester In Yellow", "comment_text": "muh represemptation<br>muh wamman<br>muh blags<br>muh fembinism<br><br>why is everyone so obsessed with race and sex omfg it must be THE MAN&#39;S fault<br><b>snorts a marijuana</b>", "comment_date": "2019-04-29T22:12:52Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "Ugxn-48YPAl-iOxHFCF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Seph Schliemann", "comment_text": "Who cares if the majority of great scientists were &quot;white guys&quot;?<br>What a sad way to end this series, it was obvious enough your need to force a political agenda, but you hate your own race/gender so much that you can&#39;t stand speaking about it.<br>You wouldn&#39;t even mention the name of the scientist that created the  anti-birth control pill, simply referring him as &quot;some white guy&quot; but went all the way to find some random historian that did nothing but speak of the plants that HE USED to develop said pill.<br><br><br>I&#39;ve been following this channel videos for years, but if this is gonna have this kind of political tone from now on, I think it&#39;s better to just stop watching, too much bulls**t and less and less actual science.", "comment_date": "2019-04-29T22:10:15Z", "likes_count": 38}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "UgwRLDtLofEZxcrIJ_t4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Kieran Garland", "comment_text": "Great series, thank you so much!", "comment_date": "2019-04-29T22:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"EhBhP-zk0_I": {"The Limits of History: Crash Course History of Science #46": {"channel_id": "UgwP-az5fzKvnzAqOaB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "J.J.", "comment_text": "But...
