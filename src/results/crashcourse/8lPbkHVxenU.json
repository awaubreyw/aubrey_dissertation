Because of symbolic interaction if the employer focused on what college they went to and not actual experience and ability, Person A who is less experienced but has a degree from a more notable college is more likely to be hired for the position than Person B who has more experience and is better qualified for the position but has a degree from all not as well-known college.", "comment_date": "2019-02-01T21:23:03Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"8lPbkHVxenU": {"Economics of Education: Crash Course Economics #23": {"channel_id": "Ugwaj8JJNk0LPJEJK4h4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Vox atl", "comment_text": "this episode is biased and untrue", "comment_date": "2019-01-23T15:47:30Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"8lPbkHVxenU": {"Economics of Education: Crash Course Economics #23": {"channel_id": "Ugx5gCvZR5slrTZfYm14AaABAg", "comment_by": "PursuitofMeaning", "comment_text": "College is a scam.", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T19:53:40Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"8lPbkHVxenU": {"Economics of Education: Crash Course Economics #23": {"channel_id": "Ugyglx-1XkORfYYGTWZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "CBT & UIB ", "comment_text": "Hi. this was very educative, now i know thank you so much.", "comment_date": "2019-01-12T02:32:30Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"8lPbkHVxenU": {"Economics of Education: Crash Course Economics #23": {"channel_id": "Ugx0zXGDKojBgM2EMwV4AaABAg", "comment_by": "flexible riyah", "comment_text": "Well this episode was stereotypical  racist and annoying. p.s i hate you crash course.", "comment_date": "2019-01-10T17:06:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"8lPbkHVxenU": {"Economics of Education: Crash Course Economics #23": {"channel_id": "UgwxB8bEn6nhhSetyN94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Vanities", "comment_text": "Diversity baby!

Many argue that if education was entirely  privatized, it&#39;s likely that some children would be excluded (2) and  that would make society as a whole worse off. <br>Education is a positive externality(3)&quot;. <br><br>1. This &quot;why&quot; question has three interpretations: the historical &quot;why?&quot;(a), the welfare-economic &quot;why?&quot;(b), and the political science &quot;why?&quot;(c). <br>a) The US &quot;public&quot; (i.e., government-operated) school system originated in response to theocratic imperatives in the religious colonies of British North America [search &quot;that old deluder, Satan] and later in anti-Catholic bigotry [search &quot;bible riots]. <br>b) The &quot;public goods&quot; argument implies subsidy and regulation, at most, not State operation of an industry. See Steuerle, et. al., _Vouchers and the Provision of Public Services_. Furthermore, the conclusion, that taxpayers or &quot;society&quot; benefit from tax subsidization of public goods does  not follow from the definition and standard economic reasoning. Corporate oversight is a public good and the State is a corporation. Therefore, oversight of State functions is a public good which the State itself cannot provide [search &quot;regulatory capture&quot;]. State assumption of responsibility for the provision of public goods transforms the free rider argument at the root of public goods analysis but does not eliminate it. <br>c) The US K-12 school system has become an employment program for dues-paying members of the NEA/AFT/AFSCME cartel, a source of padded construction, consulting, and supply contracts for politically-connected insiders, and a venue for State-worshipful indoctrination. The current system survives on strident lobbying by current recipients of the taxpayers&#39; $640 billion+ per year K-12 school subsidy. <br>2.

In Australia you dont generally need to get a uni degree to get a decent job, you can leave high school get a job work your way up without a degree. Many successful people have done this.

To fund your university education you apply for Fee help - a government scheme to help you study. once you earn a specific income you have to pay a % of that income back to your education. its a very very cheap loan thats been around along time. The current government has just increase the % you pay back and the minimum when you should. Its also drop their subsidies to universities meaning a degree will cost more money than before. But not like USA and once again we dont need a university degree to get a high paying job in Australia.  TAFE has increase massively which has cause a large issue with people wanting to improve their skills - also the government allowed private business to offer &quot;tafe&quot; like courses and give them subsides as well - issues is now many are going broke and there a large number of students lost their money and no qualification. The previous government (Labor Party) introduce a education scheme known as Gonski which was to send fund to school they really needed it.

I like better the word LEARNING. How can we improve learning? Does learning need to be expensive? I don\u2019t think so.

We don&#39;t need to pay for those buildings!! A lecture is basically a guy or woman reading a text book!! Even MIT or Harvard, it\u2019s the same stupid format. But people&#39;s problem with learning is not about that, it is about encouragement. I very often see how successful people had fathers, uncles or someone close who turned them into something and they ended up falling in love with it, learning by themselves with books, getting wealthy and adding value to society. Today we have much more than books, which makes it much easier. The educational system is trash in my opinion, it&#39;s a joke.

More education means nothing for productivity unless the things that you learned are actually useful skills within the workplace which again thanks to shite public education they arent. Also any moron can get good grades or a degree if you lower the bar. Also college isnt free in Europe it is also funded through subsidies which come from ridiculous taxes. Teachers and their ridiculous special interest unions only hold the taxpayer hostage and have zero incentive to cut costs and improve the standard of teaching. In Europe they lobby to reduce the harshness of standards in tests. They also lobby against any potential inroads to reform the education system to make it more competitive and make teachers face competition over their jobs. <br><br>The signalling theory only became prominent recently. Before people didnt need to go to university to learn these skills. They could go straight into the workforce and gain much more valuable experiences from apprenticeship when the economy was deregulated these opportunities were available. Now government has created another barrier to entry for people by setting an even higher (not higher at all and pretty unjustified) benchmark for labour being you need a terrible degree and other useless qualifications to even be considered and even then it means nothing since the bar is so low.

I went to a private institution the first time around and my parents were consider to &#39;rich&#39; (both of them working they made ~50k/year) for me to get any real aid. In fact their burden was beyond their means and they took out parental loans, which they have held over my head for ages now. My first school I wracked up 80k in student loans and simply ran out of enough money to go in my senior year. With not enough money to finish I had to go home and try to get a &#39;real job&#39;. However I quickly found I was nearly unhireable for anything that would let me pay back my student loans without a degree and I was talked into getting my associates degree to be somewhat more employable. Which since I owed so much was part time and took nearly three times as long as usual while I worked for a electronics store. <br><br>I did get a fairly good job out of that, right up until the economic downturn and my position was removed. Out of work again I spent a year on unemployment without finding a new job, so I returned to school to finish my degree. However it had been 10 years and they didn&#39;t want to take my credits from my first college or my associates degree because of their age (what they did take became general education credits). So I had to go for another 4 years... And I&#39;d taken out so much in loans I ran out of money in my senior year. Again. <br><br>Which brings us to 14 months ago and I&#39;m yet again unhireable with employers telling me I&#39;m underqualified (anything out of my field), they only hire college grads,  overqualified in my field (because I have a decade of experience and end up applying for jobs which are more &#39;entry level&#39; because those are what have openings), and best of all &#39;to old&#39; (though they make sure to say I have &#39;to much time in your field&#39; to avoid legally saying I&#39;m to old).

The standards for courses have been drastically lowered, so that we can accommodate people who are not yet ready/prepared for college. They now have incentives attached to enrollment and graduation, so they are forced to lower the standards in order to enroll and graduate more students. My classmates post &quot;formal essays&quot; that read as if they are twitter posts- no capitalization, no punctuation, and all-around poor grammar/spelling. I have put out what should be C work, having never read the textbooks, but I usually receive an A, and even compliments from my instructors about my writing, merely because I use correct grammar, spelling, punctuation, etc. It is unfortunate, but those who had a poor primary/secondary education, and should struggle to keep up in college, will now do just fine; those of us who should be getting by with earning a B or C will now receive an A. No wonder other countries have better education outcomes- they merely have not yet lowered their standards.<br>P.S. Though I support removing the barrier of cost to higher education (socializing higher education), that does not mean that I support the idea that everyone deserves to go to college. We still need standards, and I have no problem with an intelligence/education barrier to higher education. Basically, if you have the education/grades needed to be accepted, then money should not prohibit you from attaining that higher education; however, just because the state will pay for you to receive a higher education, that does not mean that you automatically get one... you must still meet the enrollment requirements. I recognize that certain areas (usually poor, often black-populated) have poor primary/secondary education outcomes, but to me that means that we should address those poor outcomes, not lower the standards of colleges to accommodate the people who come from failing school system.

In Texas, the Texas Common Core Course Transfer Law requires that public colleges and universities (Texas A&amp;M, University of Texas, and many, many others) are required to take courses on the Common Core (which they have have to publicly advertise) from any other public college or university. Meaning: students can take those courses at a community college. 3) Community college students who stay enrolled past the first semester have a higher rate of success in completing a Bachelor&#39;s degrees than similarly situated students (adjusting for socio-economic status and other factors) who begin at 4-year institutions, often at a discount (in TX a local community college is usually around 1/5 the cost of a 4-year state school).
