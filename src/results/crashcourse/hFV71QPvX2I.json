Suppose your friend starts eating the pizza that&#39;s been in the fridge for the past week and you tell him &quot;week-old pizza cause psychedelic hallucinations&quot; but he eats it anyway and soon start to wig out. You&#39;d say &quot;Dude, I told you so&quot;. <br>But if you are wrong and he&#39;s totally fine, you probably won&#39;t even think about it ever again. This is known as &#39;Hindsight Bias&quot; or the &quot;I-Knew-It-All-Along&quot; phenomenon. This doesn&#39;t mean the common sense is wrong, it just means that our intuitive sense more easily describes what just happened, than what will happen in the future. <br>&quot;We also tend to perceive order in random events, which can lead to false assumptions.&quot; For example, if you flip a coin five times you have equal chances of getting all tails as you do getting alternating heads and tails. But we see the series of five tails as something unusual, as a streak, and thus giving that result some kind of meaning that it very definitely does not have. <br>That is why we have the methods and safe-guards of psychological research and experimentation which basically save the study of our minds from the stupidity of our minds like hindsight bias and perceiving order in random events. <br>Steps of Psychological Research:<br>Take for example we are researching &quot;Can week-old pizza cause psychedelic hallucinations? Does coffee make you smarter? Or does it just make you do dumb stuff faster?&quot;<br>-Operationalizing the Questions: Figuring out how to ask general question about your subject and turn them into mesurable &amp; testable propositions.<br>-Theory &amp; Hypothesis: Any Scientific method starts with a question and a theory is not a hunch like &quot;a quad-shot of espresso makes you think better&quot;). Theory is what explains and organizes lots of different observations and predicts outcomes. And when you come up with a testable prediction, that&#39;s your hypothesis. <br>-Replication is key:<br>Once your theory and hypothesis are in place, you need a clear and common language to report them with, so for example, defining exactly what you mean by &quot;thinking better&quot; with your espresso hypothesis will allow other researchers to replicate the experiment. <br>And replication is key. <br>You can watch a person exhibit a certain behavior once, and it won&#39;t prove very much, but if you keep getting consistent results, even as you change subjects or situations, you&#39;re probably on to something. <br><br>Describing behavior without manipulating it and making connections and predictions from those findings:<br>Describing Behavior:<br>    <br>    -Case Studies:<br>    Case studies take an in-depth look at one individual. They can be misleading because by their nature, they can&#39;t be replicated, so they run the risk of over-generalizing. <br>    However case studies are good at showing what can happen and end up framing questions for more extensive and generalizable studies. <br>    They&#39;re also often memorable and a great story telling device psychologists use to observe and describe behavior. <br>    For example, say the smell of coffee make someone anxious and irritable doesn&#39;t been that it has the same effect on everyone. In fact, the person may have terrible memories associated with that smell, and so his case is actually quite rare. <br>    But you would still have to look at lots of other cases to determine that conclusively. <br><br>    -Naturalistic Observation:<br>    In naturalistic observation, researchers simply watch behavior in a natural environment. The idea is to let the subjects just do their thing without trying to manipulate or control the situation. <br>    Like case studies, naturalistic observations are great at describing behavior, but they&#39;re very limited in explaining it. <br><br>    -Interviews &amp; Surveys:<br>    Psychologists can also collect behavioral data using surveys or interviews, asking people to report their opinions and behaviors. <br>    While carrying out a surveys it&#39;s important<br>        -How you ask:<br>    Surveys are a great way to access consciously held attitudes and beliefs, but how to ask the questions can be tricky; subtle word choices can influence results. <br>    For example more forceful words like &quot;ban&quot; or &quot;censor&quot; may elicit different reactions than &quot;limit&quot; or &quot;not allow&quot;.  <br>        -Who you ask:<br>    And if how you phrase surveys is important, so is who you ask. <br>    For example the result of asking a room full of students at a pacifist club meeting what they think about arms control, be a representative measure of where students stand, because there&#39;s a pretty clear &quot;sampling bias&quot; at work here. To fairly represent a population, a random sample is required where all members of the target group, in this case students, had an equal chance of being selected to answer the question. <br>So once you&#39;ve described behavior with surveys, case studies, or naturalistic observation, you can start making sense out of it, and even predict future behavior. <br><br>Correlation:<br>One way to do that is to look at one trait or behavior is related to another, or how they correlate. <br>Suppose a person thinks that his refrigerator is actually some kind of time machine that can preserve food indefinitely and because he was hungry he ate the leftover pizza that may have had a little bit of fungus on it. <br>Suddenly, he starts seeing things: green armadillos with laser beam eyes. <br>From here we could deduce that eating unknown fungus predicts hallucination, that&#39;s a correlation. <br>    -Correlation is different to Causation: Correlation is not causation though.<br>    Though it make sense that the hallucinations were result of the questionable fungus, the person may be already on the verge of a psychotic episode and those fuzzy leftovers were actually benign. There there could be an entirely different factor involved, like maybe he hadn&#39;t slept in 72 hours, or had an intense migraine coming on, and one of those factors caused his hallucinations. <br>It&#39;s quite tempting to draw conclusions from correlation but it&#39;s important to remember that correlations predict the possibility of a cause-and-effect<br>relationships; they cannot prove them. <br>So we&#39;ve talked about &quot;how to describe behavior without manipulating it and how to make connections and predictions from those findings&quot;. <br><br>Experimentation:<br>Experimentation really get to the bottom of cause-and-effect behaviors. Experiments allow investigators to isolate different effects by manipulating an independent variable, and keeping all other variables constant, or as constant as you can. <br>This means that they need at least two groups: <br>    -Experimental Group: which is gonna get messed with.<br>    -Control Group: which is not gonna get messed with. <br>Just as surveys use random samples, experimental researchers need to randomly assign participants to each group to minimize potential confounding variables, or outside factors that may skew the results. <br>    -Double blind procedure:<br>    Sometimes one or both groups are not informed about what&#39;s actually being tested. <br>    For example, researchers can test how substances effect people by comparing their effects to placebos, or inert substances. <br>    And often, the researchers themselves don&#39;t know which group is experimental and which is control, so they don&#39;t unintentionally influence the results through their own behavior, in which case it&#39;s called, you guessed it, a double blind procedure. <br><br>So let&#39;s put these ideas into practice in our own little experiment. <br>Let&#39;s me and my friend are debating Caffeine&#39;s effect on the brain. <br>Personally, my friend is convinced that coffee helps her focus and think better, but I get all jittery like a caged meerkat and can&#39;t focus on anything. <br>And because we know that overconfidence can lead you to believe things that are not true, we decided to use some critical thinking. <br>Question: So let&#39;s figure out our question: &quot;Do humans solve problems faster when given caffeine?&quot; <br>Testable prediction: &quot;Adult humans given caffeine will navigate a maze faster than humans not given caffeine.&quot; <br>Independent Variable: The caffeine dosage is your independent variable, the thing that you can change. <br>Dependent Variable: the thing that depends on the thing that you can change is going to be the speed at which the subject navigates through this giant corn maze. <br>Experimentation:<br>    Control Group: So the control group gets a placebo, in this case decaf. <br>    Experimental group one: Experimental group one gets a low dose of caffeine, which we&#39;ll define at a 100 milligrams; just an eye opener, like, a cup of coffee&#39;s worth. <br>    Experimental group two: Experimental group two gets 500 milligrams, more than a quad shot of espresso dunked in a Red Bull. <br>Once everyone is dosed, we turn them lose in the maze and wait at the other end with a stopwatch to measure the results from the three different groups and compare them to see if there were any conclusive results. <br>If the highly dosed folks got through it twice as fast as the low dose and the placebo groups, then our  hypothesis was correct, and she can rub my face in it saying she was right all along, but really that would just be the warm flush of hindsight bias telling her something she didn&#39;t really know until we tested it. <br>Then, because we&#39;ve used clear language and defined our parameters, other curious minds can easily replicate this experiment, and we can eventually pool all the data together and have something solid to say about what that americano  was doing to your cognition\u2013 or at least the speed at which you can run through a maze.", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T01:37:20Z", "likes_count": 2797}, {"comment_by": "Rebi Cimpean", "comment_text": "he&#39;s the only one i have to listen to 0.75x and it does sound normal, instead of the usual 1.5x i go with others (english is not my first language so i struggle to keep up)", "comment_date": "2020-06-12T16:42:19Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "CABARON, Gloria J.", "comment_text": "i actually drinking coffe and eating Hawaiian pizza rn \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T02:12:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wilson Narea", "comment_text": ":)", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T17:17:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charlotte Cady", "comment_text": "Why is he speaking so fast", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T18:14:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zeeya Lmao", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who thinks this is boring but my brain tells me to watch this?", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:35:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Free Lich", "comment_text": "&quot;Pizza won&#39;t make you trip.&quot;

Another popular method of psychological research is NATURALISTIC (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFV71QPvX2I&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a>) observation, where researchers simply watch behavior in a natural environment<br><br>4. Psychologists can also collect BEHAVIORAL (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFV71QPvX2I&amp;t=4m15s\">4:15</a>) data using surveys or interviews, asking people to report their opinions and behaviors.<br><br>5. To fairly represent a population I&#39;d need to get a random sample where all members of the TARGET (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFV71QPvX2I&amp;t=5m15s\">5:15</a>) group<br><br>6. So once you&#39;ve described behavior with surveys, case studies, or naturalistic observation, you can start making sense out of it, and even predict future BEHAVIOR (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFV71QPvX2I&amp;t=5m25s\">5:25</a>)<br><br>7. Experiments allow investigators to isolate different effects by manipulating an independent variable, and keeping all other variables constant, or as constant as you can. This means that they need at least two groups: the EXPERIMENTAL (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFV71QPvX2I&amp;t=6m49s\">6:49</a>) group, which is gonna be messed with, and the CONTROL (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFV71QPvX2I&amp;t=7m00s\">7:00</a>) group, which is gonna get messed with<br><br>8. American Psychological Association suggests that you acquire everyone&#39;s informed CONSENT(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFV71QPvX2I&amp;t=8m45s\">8:45</a>) to participate<br><br>9. What is a Placebo? INERT SUBSTANCES (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFV71QPvX2I&amp;t=7m30s\">7:30</a>)<br><br>10. What does the video say is probably the best tool that you have for understanding people?

Lots of ways, but today Hank talks about case studies, naturalistic observation, surveys and interviews, and experimentation. Also he covers different kinds of bias in experimentation and how research practices help us avoid them. <br><br>TOPICS COVERED IN THIS VIDEO:- <br><br>1. The Scientific Method <br><br>Scientific method is about how to ask general questions about your subject and turn them into measureable testable proposition. <br>The scientific theory works on a question and a theory, once a testable prediction is reached it is called the hypothesis. <br>After a suitable hypothesis is reached an experiment can be conducted for testing the hypothesis. <br>2. Case Studies <br><br>This is a type of research which take an in depth look in one individual. They can be sometimes misleading because by their nature they can\u2019t be replicated. They run the risk of over generalising. <br>3. Naturalistic Observation <br><br>This is a method where researchers watch behaviour in a natural environment. The idea is to let the subjects do whatever they want without manipulating or control the situation. <br><br>4. Surveys and Interviews <br><br>In this process the people are asked to report their behaviours and reports. Surveys are a great way of getting access to peoples consciously held attitudes and beliefs. There is a sample bias and sample data which is collected and then the results are generated. <br>5. Experimentation <br><br>By this method it allows the investigators to isolate different effects by manipulating an independent variable and keeping other variables constant. It contains 2 groups namely the experimental group(which is to be messed with) and control group(which is not going to be messed with). <br>6. Proper Research Practices <br><br>Consent of others and proper practices like testing, analysing, predicting and result generation codes are followed for proper prediction of psychological behaviour.", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T11:04:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riseup", "comment_text": "Love this channel but wish you would &quot;SLow&quot; down!", "comment_date": "2019-04-03T17:05:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cody Moutinho", "comment_text": "Lol loved the mars attacks reference", "comment_date": "2019-03-28T17:57:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Foriwill", "comment_text": "The real question is would the brain function slower when not given caffeine?", "comment_date": "2019-03-28T13:41:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "moonlight", "comment_text": "THIS IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION FOR ME TO DIGEST IN 2 DAYS OK MY EXAM IS EFFED", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T10:24:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lola LittleFeather", "comment_text": "If anyone is interested you should look up &#39;Alfred Kinsey with Green&#39; in his findings...I love this narrator but he is wrong when he said that Kinsey researchers got the results respectively...there&#39;s a lot more gruesome tales to those findings...Its an interesting find to say the least.

Are we immune to backward thinking?<br><br>I think, overall this is a great video, and entertaining! But, I&#39;m concerned about his take on the scientific method. He states theory comes before hypothesis.  I understand this is how it is being taught right now, and I believe it&#39;s turning psychology into a cool kids club. Meaning, if you have the correct hypothesis, the one that is cool right now, you&#39;ll interpret you&#39;re data the acceptable way. Not necessarily, the accurate way. All data must be interpreted. And it&#39;s so easy to unknowingly infuse our biases into the interpretation. How do we humbly keep ourselves from doing that?<br><br>When I was a kid, science teachers always said hypothesis comes before theory. I think in hard science type texts, this is still taught. This way, you were starting with no <b>presumptions</b> that colored the data. I&#39;m concerned if you put an unproven theory first, that theory will color the gathered data. Basically, you&#39;re using an unproven theory as the foundation to build the facts upon. <br><br>Example: Theory: I believe the lightening god will strike the bad people. <br>(Lightening storm comes and strikes several people.)<br>Gather data: I found bad things about these people. Because of my underlying theory bias, I expected to find bad things, therefore I did. If you look hard enough, you&#39;ll find what you are looking for.<br>Conclusion: We have proven, through factual data, and longitudinal studies conducted through dozens of storms, that  the  lightening god strikes bad people. <br><br>Silly? Not really. Take our postmodern myth we&#39;ve clung to, hoping to explain our existence. <br><br>Theory: Evolution wants us to procreate, giving us an underlying compulsion toward sex, which must be fulfilled or we will suppress  our id, causing imbalance in our person. (Keep in mind, none of this is scientifically proven. Just speculation.)<br>Hypothesis: Men sleep around and look at porn because evolution has given them a compulsion, which if suppressed, will cause unhealthy balance in their person.<br>Gather data: Men <b>do</b> sleep around and look at porn. We can do study after study. This is what we expected, based on our theory bias. Therefore we don&#39;t really have to think of many different explanations. We don&#39;t need an open mind. We just jump closemindedly to our conclusion. <br>Conclusion: Men need to express themselves sexually, because evolution, and women who ask their men to not look at porn are oppressing and suppressing them in an unhealthy way. Because science. Do you see how the underlying evolutionary bias colored the way the data was interpreted?  I didn&#39;t make this up.<br>This was an article recently published in Psychology Today. <br><br><br>This sounds legitimate to someone with a secular evolutionary bias just like the lightening god sounds legitimate to someone believing in the lightening god. Neither are science. Science starts with hypothesis, not theory.<br><br>Or an example from Thomas Jefferson:<br><br>Theory: White people are superior to black people in reasoning and work ethic. (Sadly, he actually believed this.)<br><br>Gathered data: On the plantations the black people do the bare minimum in reasoning and work. (Well, duh, it was free! They were kidnapped! Why the heck would they go out of their way to do their best?  But because of his bias, he was blind to this option. Starting with a theory makes a person biased.)<br><br>Conclusion: We shouldn&#39;t let black people vote.  (Wha?!)<br>This is what happens when we put the theory before the hypothesis. It causes us to see our data through biased eyes. It encourages us to filter the data through the biases of our own time period. Our time period is platonic, individualistic, and steeped in Naturalism. When we start with theory we allow all these biases in. In order to remain a powerful tool, science was stay objective. <br><br>I&#39;m afraid putting theory before hypothesis often leads to circular thinking.  It turns science into a tool to prove what we sort of believed anyway. Yet, it is what psychology sometimes falls into.

Let me quickly begin with a little praise, you guys are doing a phenomenal job and should be recognized with an award, unfortunately they still don&#39;t give Nobel prizes in education, if they would I&#39;m sure you&#39;d get nominated at least 35 times ;) hard luck, but seriously fantastic series not just on psychology but pretty much all your content is top notch. <br>Now to my issue, which is with your maths: probability of tossing heads or tails 5 times in a row is not equal to a probability of getting mixed results, 5 tails would be 1(total number of desired outcomes) divided by all possible outcomes in this case 32 as in 2(number of possible outcomes in a single throw) to the power of 5(number of repetitions). Even if you consider both heads or tails to be a desired outcome that brings our chances from 1/32 to 2/32 = 1/16. Since all probabilities in a system have to add up to 1 we can easily calculate that all other outcomes have a probability of 15/16 (1-1/16) so as you can see you have a 15 time higher chance of getting a mixed result than to get 5 heads or tails in a row, although on each throw chances of throwing head or tails are still 1/2 which can lead to an awful lot of confusion, often, so please don&#39;t encourage it ;) <br>...just had a second look at this fragment and I&#39;m the dummy here, you were right, probability of getting alternating results is in fact same as getting a streak, I&#39;ll post this anyway for all other dummies like myself, who saw alternating results as mixed results and as a lesson for future me to always double check your data before throwing a tantrum ;)<br>best wishes,<br>Kris Szczurowski", "comment_date": "2017-03-27T19:18:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "peauxwet", "comment_text": "I hated this channel until I found my passion for psychology, and saw this on this channel.", "comment_date": "2017-03-24T02:59:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caroline Ramos", "comment_text": "I appreciate all you do!

I think this was slightly mistated but can be easily forgiven since this is not a video on maths.<br><br>If you are going to flip 5 coins and your GOAL is to achieve all heads... then getting all heads is significant. It is not true that getting all heads is the same as getting any other specific combination unless by that you mean also getting that combination in order. For instance specifically getting H H T T T vs two H and three T.<br><br>The odds of getting H vs T is 1/2 (presuming a perfectly balanced coin). 1 in 2 chance. Same with getting T. If at the outset your goal is to achieve 5 H, your chances are 1 in 2^5 or 1 in 32 OR 1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2*1/2. <br><br>However, if you flip 4 coins and get H H H H then before the 5th flip you say.. My goal is to get H making H H H H H... the chances are not 1 in 32 that you will get a H but rather it is 1 in 2.<br><br>I think the above is what you were trying to describe as briefly as possible?<br><br>My explanation to help people understand why this is true is to look at all past events are completed. So after I flip H H H H... the chances that my last flip was a head is 1 in 1 (1/1) not 1 in 2 because there is one possible outcome (bottom number).

We can say that there&#39;s a correlation between getting bitten by a radioactive spider and developing spider powers. But one might not lead to the other. There may be other components involved. Perhaps Peter is a mutant and developed spider powers with no help or hinderance from the spider, its bite being just a coincidence. Before we can say for sure that getting bitten by a radioactive spider gives you spider powers, we&#39;d have to subject many randomly selected students (and others maybe) to radioactive spider bites. If we see a consistent development of spider powers, then we can finally say that O-1 causes E-A. Is that right?

First thing is a minor correction which, at 7 minutes the claim is made there there must be at least 2 groups however, this is only if your experiment is a between subjects design (comparing subjects scores to other subjects) there is experiments which are within subjects design wherein subjects are tested twice under both variables thus leaving only one test group. In your example of maze running a within subjects design would have the subjects run a maze under no caffeine stimulation then run another maze with minor stimulation then a third maze with with heavy stimulation. Within subject designs are important for setting up certain experiments. The second point is very minor about your experiment. I know it&#39;s an example however, my experimental design professor would not be happy with me if I did not make mention to the fact that your experiment doesn&#39;t test solely cognition. There is the confound of caffeine&#39;s effect on athletic performance which may effect the results of your study. Cognition as your dependent variable was not properly isolated.
