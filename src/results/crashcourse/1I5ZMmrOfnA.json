Buuuuut, i guess your &quot;wish of move to the next column&quot; comes from the wish of move in the numbers that going to be added, instead of &quot;wish of move to next column&quot; in the result.

So..... I think I&#39;ll get back to the Binary Exploitation course, finish these first 3 years of univerisity (before the 2 of Master Degree), and then I come back here hahaha. I&#39;m thinking this might go too advanced for me and I don&#39;t want to get demotivated or something like that.

Though, if people here are not getting in any course, I think I&#39;d suggest to get external help to understand why she says the things you do not understand.

If you just going to mention something to give the facts without going into any level of detail about it and how am I have change from previous subject matter you just explain. Do not give it its own new heading and title and presentation screen. Just simply mention it and say you won&#39;t go into detail about that, but it is a advanced very end of the previous mentioned subject.<br>Or, dont mention it all.<br>Anyways... I&#39;m not complaining because I don&#39;t like to show or not a fan of crash course in general.
