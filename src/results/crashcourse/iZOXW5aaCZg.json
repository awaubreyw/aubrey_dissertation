As being a mechanical engineer we are aware of these things . Its basically about pressure and temperature . Everybody knows water boils at 100 Degrees but not everyone is aware that boiling point of liquid changes with the change in pressure . If pressure increases boiling point increases and if the pressure decreases the boiling point decreases . For example at an altitude of 20000 feet water boils at near 40 or 44 degrees celsius because the pressure is less at that altitude . The same happens in a refrigerator . When the compressor compresses the gaseous refrigerant its pressure increases so does its boiling and condensation temperature . And the heat because of compression of the gas is rejected to the atmosphere in the condenser and the refrigerant condenses . The expansion valve then reduces the pressure of that liquid refrigerant thus reducing its boiling point and temperature .  this low temperature refrigerant is the passed on to the evaporator to absorb the heat and cool the surroundings .", "comment_date": "2018-08-12T10:57:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Extraneus", "comment_text": "Solar power is more damaging to the environment.

I now understand <br>why I have to teach refrigeration basics to the cadets who come out of school. Sorry again I know you <br>mean well and I love your site.  For those who were confused  <br>Pretend you put a pot of water on the stove  turned the flame on high and went out for a beer. <br>Water boils at 100 C  the water will heat up to 100 C  and stay there. Not getting any hotter, the <br>pot will stay near that temp and be fine , until the water boils away. After the water is gone  the pot <br>melts and your wife is pissed. The water was keeping the pot cool   I know 100 C seems hot  but <br>its way colder then fire. It takes energy to make something boil  or even evaporate. Thats why <br>your hand feels cool when you poor rubbing alcohol on it and blow. We make freon  it boils <br>at what ever temp we want   say at a nice 5 C to keep that beer cold. <br>Second   water does not always boil at 100 C   think of a pressure cooker  higher pressure <br>means that it boils at over 100 C  or a persons blood boiling in outer space  It boils there <br>because the pressure was 0 so low that it boils at your body temp. <br>( I know not exactly correct  but easy to picture) <br>Third  steam turns back into water at 100 C   same temp.  same temp  I know sounds wrong <br>but its true. <br>So you have 2 radiators   1 inside  1 out. A compressor that is sucking on the radiator inside <br>and pushing into the radiator outside. Just before the radiator inside your home there is a <br>blank  with a tiny hole in it  so only a small bit of freon can get through. There is a fan on <br>both radiators.  You turn of the compressor  the press in the inside radiator goes down <br>while the outside radiator press goes up. Remember there is that blank only letting a small <br>amount of freon to flow. the pressure outside goes up while the fan on the radiator keeps <br>it at outside temp. ( compressing any gas makes it hot. More you compress it the more <br>the temp goes up) Remember boiling temp goes up when pressure goes up  and the boiling <br>temp is also the temp it condences at. the pressure goes up enough  with the temp staying <br>the same that it turns back into a liquid. It puts out a lot of heat when this happens. <br>That liquid freon  now flows to your inside radiator  ( through the small hole in the blank <br>that maintains the pressure difference) where it now boils at a nice 10 C . The fan <br>inside blows air over the radiator  keeping it warm enough to boil the freon  and cooling <br>your home. The compressor now starts it all over again. A cycle. <br>sounds complicated but really easy when you go over it a few times.  <br>Sorry for the super long post.
