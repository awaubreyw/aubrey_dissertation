Maybe it could be like what happened with the Film series: just like how one presenter came in for Film History, and another for Film Production, someone could talk about the 2D &amp; 3D process, and maybe even how they can be used together, &amp; another person or pair talk about, Stop motion, or the history of animation (like Walt Disney &amp; the 9 old men, etc.), or about the studios around the world (like in Japan, the US, etc.) that run the industry today. Sorry about the idea rants, I&#39;m just really passionate about this stuff. I myself I&#39;m working to become a professional 3D animator, and it would really help me, and other up-and-coming creators in the journey.
