I wrote this earlier today: The ghettos &amp; hoods were made intentionally, by decades of systemic racist policies &amp; their consequences. Considering Redlining, for-profit prisons (Raegan loved those), defunding mental health funding, racial covenants, \u201cwhite flight\u201d (the origin of the suburbs), home equity discrimination, police militarization, The destruction of black farmers by banks, highway community displacement, mass incarceration, false home appraisals, \u201cfood deserts\u201d (or \u201cgreasy spoons\u201d as my parents used to call them), the war on drugs, &amp; (other policies that skyrocketed in the 80s after the assassination &amp; arrest of civil rights leaders). Whether it\u2019s America or any other country, it\u2019s not enough to legally \u201cend\u201d a policy, the consequences of those negative policies must be addressed. And the United States does not do that. Nobody here knows about the \u201cred summer\u201d, when African-Americans managed to create prosperous communities in spite of institutional racism, such as Tulsa (with the Zulu lounge), and Greenwood (etc). White mobs destroyed those thriving ebony communities with guns, artificial lakes, &amp; sometimes with bombs dropped from planes across hundreds of prosperous negroe communities in the 20th century. With that being said, allot of my family comes from the South Side of Chicago. \u201cThe Black Belt\u201d, Redlining and other segregationist policies that were employed throughout every city in the United States, including Chicago. Don\u2019t forget about Robert Moses and to a lesser extent Walt Disney. The South Side is dangerous as heck, not proud of that. I don\u2019t care what white people think or \u201cmodel minorities\u201d, It\u2019s just I want my people especially my women, to be safe, they deserve that. Although, inspite of the violence with those areas, AfricanAmerican businesses (&amp; other African descent businesses), churches, etc thrive. Uncle Remus, Heralds, Mic Arthur\u2019s, Jay &amp; Jay Fish, Churches, Djenne Collection, Kayra Imports, DuSable Museum of African American History, etc. Don\u2019t even get me started on the groundbreaking talent, that pioneers American culture, that has come out of these areas, with a lot of love in spite of the violence. The high violence in ghettos, projects &amp; hoods, tends to give America\u2019s corrupted criminal justice system an excuse to further generalize and discriminate against black Americans. When Covid broke out, it predictably negatively impacted African-American and Native American communities the worst, because high-poverty tends to follow racial lines. The same thing happened with Zika and Covid in Brazil &amp; other Latino counties, the most poor populations tend to be African and indigenous descent populations.", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T18:11:46Z", "likes_count": 9}}}, {"iFPokf8mwPk": {"What is Urban Planning?

Firstly, to be clear, &quot;Latin America&quot; is too broad an area: The civilizations of Mesoamerica (the Aztec, Maya, etc in the bottom half of Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, etc) developed independently from and with little contact with the ones of the Andes (in Peru, Bolivia, etc), for examples, so they had different urban traditions. As stated in the video, Mesoamerican cities tended to have a central, dense urban core monumental architecture and planned layouts: You&#39;d have palaces, temples, ball courts, noble housing, and other civic, ceremonial, and communal structures., which were richly painted and decorated: when you see ruins today, you&#39;re seeing the inner fill of rough stones and mortar or the brickwork over them, usually not the clean stucco and then painted frescos and intricate reliefs, sculptural facades, friezes, and other accents, which are only preserved occasionally: Look up the frescos found at the residences of Teotihuacan, or the Rosalila temple at Copan, or the paintings made by Scott and Stuart Gentling of Aztec cityscapes to get a feel for how they would have looked in their heyday. \r<br>\r<br>These were generally organized around open plazas, with their arrangement aligned to maximize things like public viewing or human traffic for ceremonies and gatherings, or for ritualistic alignments: For example, the Maya E Group, for example, is a common arrangement of 3 structures that when viewed from another location, align with astronomic phenomena at certain times of year. Or how at Teotihuacan, the San Juan river was recoursed through the city&#39;s grid layout (which is unusual, I&#39;ll get back to that) to appear perpendicular to the Temple of the Feathered Serpent and the Ciudadela complex/plaza it&#39;s located inside, as those structures were heavily associated with water (the plaza even capable of being flooded like the Roman Colosseum), so when viewed from specific angles it would appear the river is coming forth from those structures. Speaking of, complex water management systems were also quite common: At Tikal, for example, there were a series of massive reservoirs connected to one another, with dams and channels which allowed them to flow into one another if needed to prevent flooding; with structures and plazas in the surrounding area having drains to similarly redirect rainwater or water from floods into the reservoir network. Some of these reservoirs even had advanced filtration systems, and some of the connections between them even had switching stations to choose how the water flowed. Lastly, much like how the structures themselves in sites today are misleading with only the inner grey masonry being visible, modern archeological sites and their maps are often misleading as they exclude many structures which are either still buried or destroyed. Compare tourist site maps of sites like Teotihuacan or Palenque which only show major structures for visitors, with the archeological surveys of those sites from Millon and Barnhart, respectively: those both show hundreds of additional structures! \r<br>\r<br>Significantly, tourist maps also exclude the suburbs around the urban core, which is the other key half of Mesoamerican urban layouts: While the urban core has a high density of planned structures foe elites, ceremonies, or groups, which are built of stone and have fancy accents and decorations, the suburbs that surrond the cores are low density, are commoner residences interspersed with agricultural land (sort of giving a similar mental image to suburbs today, with homes spaced out between greenery), and are less planned:  Commoner residences would have been built out of wood, straw, or adobe brick, usually on a stone foundation, with homes in so called &quot;patio groups&quot;, with 2 to 4 homes built facing one another around a sort of mini-plaza. These homes and patio groups would radiate out from the site core, gradually decreasing in density, as the area became more rural, without a clear end point, which makes defining the limits and populations of Mesoamerican cities quite iffy. Also, while these were &quot;less planned&quot;, then the urban cores, much of the area the suburbs covered would still be landscaped (not necessarily, deforested, though sometimes: When tree cover was kept, it was in managed groves with a cleared underbrush for agroforestry and shade), and some would have &quot;mini cores&quot; with temples and some elite residences. Some large Mesoamerican cities, particularly Maya ones, had absolutely massive suburban sprawls covering dozens or even hundreds of square kilometers, like at Tikal, El Mirador, Copan, and Caracol, to the point where in the former two examples, you literally had multiple different city centers connected via the sprawls into Megalopoli. Tikal&#39;s in particular had a significant amount of infrastructure across it&#39;s sprawls, with palisades and more hooked up water management systems for agriculture and flood prevention and drinking water. \r<br>\r<br>What i&#39;ve described is the &quot;typical&quot; large Mesoamerican city, but obviously there were exceptions, some examples being Tenochtitlan, Teotihuacan, and Palenque: Tenochtitan was located on an island (and technically made up of many islands: the chinampas labeled in the video at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFPokf8mwPk&amp;t=3m05s\">3:05</a> are artificial islands with canals between them, so the city was like venice, and the chinampas could act as hyperefficient hydrponic farms), so it had a clear limit, though there&#39;s still a identifiable more urban core and surrounding suburbs around it. Tenochtitlan also unusually had some of it&#39;s structures on a grid layout, contrary to the plaza based ritualistic planning I described. This is attributed to a specific urban revival of Teotihuacan&#39;s city planning, which was even more unusual: Almost the whole city layout was one giant urban sprawl on a planned grid, which covered 22 square kilometers, entirely composed of palaces and temples, organized around a central road, rather then pazas. The city did have suburbs, but they covered a much, much smaller amount of space compared to the urban area and most of the city&#39;s denizens lived in fancy palaces. For Palenque, the city was founded on a relatively small flat area of an othertwise steep hill, so it has it&#39;s commoner residences on acropoli (which themselves weren&#39;t uncommon, moreso for palaces and temple complexes though) packed tightly next to/alongside it&#39;s elite and ceremonial structures. \r<br>\r<br>I wish I was able to link images of all of this, but youtube tends to act iffy when I do that.
