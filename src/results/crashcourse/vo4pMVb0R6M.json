I love psychology. I often think about how I ended up here....being 50, never married, no kids , and struggling financially when all I ever wanted was to be married with a awesome family and be a great provider. Being raised by a single parent who basically had no joy in life. To my mother, life was more like a harsh sentence she had to serve until the end. Despite my best efforts, it seems like that is the role I have been programmed to play out. No , it was not my mother&#39;s intentions but it&#39;s what I seen, what I lived,all I knew....so no matter my attempts, how great I try....my inner program is always pulling..drawing...luring me in.....

        "comment_text": "So basically,<br><br>Human minds are one of the most complicated things and the rules that govern it are mysterious &amp; elusive.\r<br>\r<br>While the term &quot;psychology&quot; was coined around 16th Century, the practice of science around it was no established until the 1800. The formal definition of psychology has evolved over the last several decades, today we can safely call it the science of behavior and mental processes.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Psychology is one of the most extremely diverse in terms of the questions it proposes, the method it applies and the school of though it contains.\r<br>\r<br>For instance, right around Freud&#39;s(1900-1939) time, there were a lot of different schools of thought of about how the study of the human mind should be tackled. Mainly, there were the ideas of structuralism, functionalism and psychoanalysis. \r<br>\r<br>    -&quot;Structuralism&quot; in 1879 by Wilhelm Wundt &amp; Edward Bradford Titchener:\r<br>&quot;Structuralism&quot; focusses on how patient feel when they do something like watched the sun set, or smell a coffee, or licked a kitten, or whatever. \r<br>This relied heavily on introspection and it became too subjective and since it&#39;s not possible observe a patient&#39;s inner thoughts or feelings, so ultimately, the structuralist school of thought was fairly short-lived. \r<br>\r<br>    -&quot;Functionalism&quot; in 1890 by William James:\r<br>Focuses on the &quot;function of behavior&quot;, why we think and feel and smell and lick, or whatever. This approach of &#39;functionalism&#39;, was based on Charles Darwin&#39;s idea that adaptive behaviors are conserved throughout the evolutionary process. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>    -&quot;Psychoanalysis&quot; in 1900 by Freud:\r<br>A radical kernel of Psychoanalysis suggests that &quot;our personalities are shaped by unconscious motives&quot; which mean we are all profoundly affected by mental processes that we are not aware of. Another important part of the &quot;Psychoanalysis&quot; is that &quot;unconscious, the thing below consciousness&quot; is still discover-able. An even though we are not aware of it, we can come to understand it through a therapeutic technique using dreams, projections and free association to root out repressed feelings and gain self insight.\r<br>So what Freud was really saying was that &quot;mental disorders could be healed through talk therapy and self-discovery&quot;. And this was a really big breakthrough. After &quot;The Interpretations of Dreams&quot;, Freud went on to publish over 20 more books and countless papers with an iconic cigar in hand all the while. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>    -&quot;Behaviorism&quot; by Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner:\r<br>Behaviorism focuses on the study of observable behavior.\r<br>The first half of the 20th Century was dominated by &quot;behaviorism&quot; promoted by Ivan Pavlov, John B. Watson, and B. F. Skinner.\r<br> \r<br>    -&quot;Psychodynamic Theories&quot; descendant of Freud&#39;s Psychoanalysis:\r<br>Psychodynamic Theories focuses on importance of early experiences in shaping the unconscious and how that process affects out though, feelings, behavior and personalities.\r<br> \r<br>By the mid-20th century, there were other major forces in psychology like &quot;Humanist Psychology&quot;, which focuses on nurturing personal growth; &quot;Cognitive Science&quot; and &quot;Neuroscience&quot;, all of which contributed their own unique takes on the study of mind. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Psychology:\r<br>Modern day definition of psychology &quot;the study of behavior and mental processes&quot;, is a nice amalgamation that pulls from all these different schools of thought. \r<br>It recognizes the need for observing and recording behavior, but it also gives credit to our mental processes, what we think and feel and believe.\r<br>Psychology is an integrative science and while there are different school of thoughts &amp; theories, the essence of the discipline has everything to do with creating different ways of asking interesting questions and attempting to answer them through all kinds of data-gathering methods. \r<br>The human mind is complicated. \r<br>There is no single way to effectively crack it open; it must be pried at from all sides. \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Harvard astronomer Owen Gingerich has gazed into the distant horizon of space, and even he has acknowledged that the human brain is by far the most complex physical object known to us in the entire cosmos, and we all get to have one!",

As in Plate Tectonics is the basis of Geology. Germ theory for disease. Laws of motion for physics etc. There seems no functional alignment between consciousness, life force, bio-mechanics and the nature of living matter. For all the neuroscience and brain chemistry saying irrational behavior is a chemical imbalance, pumping a person full of drugs is not a viable long term solution and. Freud was on to something with a &quot;talking cure&quot; but Wundt and Adler took a left turn to nowhere. Until the nature, laws and structure of living matter get codified, we will be just drug dealers to mental illness. Not easy as once you talk &quot;life force&quot; it fringes on the territory of religion and that seems a no go zone by serious science. Pity, because laws of life will remain unknown.",

The heart is formed first in a fetus then all other parts of the amazing human body develop.  Now tell me again how an explosion started all things to form.  If so why are wolves not dogs natural selection dogs would not exist. God Created the Heavens and Earth.  He created us in his image.  Giving us domain over all things.  Then sin entered the world.  It became so evil he had to destroy all things except 8 people who had not been infected with the genetic deformity of the day.  He gave us another chance.  Then we go and do it again.  Then he gave us the ultimate a saviour to abolish our sins if we believe he sent his only son as a sacrifice to cleanse us of our sins we will be welcomed in heaven for all of eternity.  Even Satan cant tell you that Jesus Christ was put to death and rose from the grave.  That is pretty powerful being dead for three days then showing up on the road to Emaus talking to 2 of his friends.  Explain that one.  The Ten Commandments if followed would create perfect harmony.   When Jesus went to Heaven he released the Holy Spirit his 12 desciples were given a huge dose so they could spread the truth.  It still exists in Christians examine a bunch of them and one can see their calm before I asked for it I could tell them from those who didnt have it.  Now I share it so its much harder to discern.  The reason for that is due to my love for all people even my enemies.  I\u2019m a big guy 6\u20191\u201d. Body builder benching 400 pounds squatting 1000 pounds.  Grew up in Alaska and hung out with Hells Angels I actually thought I was a good guy until God convicted me.  I was a single dad and the girls said I was handsome.  Earned a lot of money I was a gold miner.  Many people thought my life was good.  Now my life is great he convicted me showing me my own dirty heart thought me how to have pure thoughts and most of all to love others.   Please folks give it read 66 books penned by 44 authors written over 4000 years yet it reads like a master writer put it together.  It is free and does not hurt it may just be the best thing you ever will do.  God Bless you all especially the smart little guy with the glasses who charges $500.00 an hour.",

For example if a person under covert hypnosis is asked, &quot;tell me all your secrets&quot;, they will comply with little to no resistance. If a person under voluntary hypnosis is asked the same thing, they will refuse to answer.\r<br>Every year in America and Canada thousands of people are victims of illegal covert hypnosis, and 99.9% will never know that they were covertly hypnotized.\r<br>The &quot;official&quot; reason for illegal covert hypnosis is to find out if people with antisocial behavior are a threat or have committed a crime. But most instances of illegal covert hypnosis are done to steal private knowledge from the victims mind. Once hypnotized the victim can be asked any question, or given any command, then the victim is programmed with a word or phrase that will put him instantly in a hypnotic state, finally he is told to forget what happened, and wake up. He will not remember being hypnotized  for the rest of his life.",

I personally do not believe it has evolved; rather it lost the roots and foundations. At least all the philosophers believed that humanity constitutes of body and soul. If in the past the church has gone to one extreme addressing to the Soul, now we make another error thinking that humanity&#39;s essence resumes in body and materialism which fundamentally is diluting the core of who we are. So we are confined to think or being put into a box (like Skinner did in his experiments) to believe that the constitution of humanity\u00a0is only a behaviour caused by our machine &quot;brain&quot;, this assumes that we are just another machine with data processing. Have we become just a hardware which is faulty and needs fixing?",

I like the one on personality disorders. I have seen it a few times. That was so helpful to give a variety of theories for the mind. My favorite famous psychologist is Sigmund Freud. His study in psychoanalysis is a bit less like science and a bit more like mysticism and mythology. It is fascinating. This helps to show how varied psychology can be. I hope Freud will be talked about in the videos.",

Today with the advent of AI, machines are able to mimic human cognition. Just as human learning machine learning involves induction through cognition. Given the correct data set and processing capabilities, machines carry out any task with much less error and in much less time. Recently Google reversed engineered a neural network (trained to detect birds in an image) to draw a picture of an image, therefore, emulating creativity. With such great strides being made in the field of AI how important it is to introduce a dedicated field in psychology to study the behavior and cognitive process of intelligent machines? More importantly, do you think it is time to rethink the definition of psychology factoring in these intelligent machines?",

For example I may have 10 years of traveling the world, partying, family activity\u2019s as well, but how much of that will I actually remember and sustain in my brain? And is it possible to keep it all inside , how much more can  my mind hold is there a limit? Etc..<br><br>Therefore do not waste time on watching a lecture on famous people in history who spoke about psychology.  Because you need to master within yourself to make it come to life. Otherwise your wasting your time on a history lesson. Plain and simple . <br><br>I would tell you how to start your journey.<br><br>It starts with yourself, monitoring your daily behavior not conscious but unconscious, meaning go thru your day with your normal activities. By the end of the day when you are in bed in silence and ready to shut down for the night. Begin the process of observation and reasoning in your mind. Why did I do this ceremony thing today? , what did I gain out of it?, could I have done without?, was it good or bad?, etc..  study yourself .  After this which should take some time till you gain wisdom. Then you can move on to people comparing them to you and comparing the differences etc..  <br><br>Again there is so much to be said and done. <br><br>But do not waste your time here in these type of videos.",

I&#39;ve always been curious about how our mind functions and this was a great start to this journey of discovery about the science of psychology. A truly commendable aspect of this field is that all people practicing psychology did not confine themselves within any rigid schools of thoughts and came forward with vastly differing theories which all attempted to unlock parts of our brain and how it functions. The amazing part is that all these theories are still extant today and have been the building block of modern psychological practices. <br>Another interesting aspect of this video was the in-depth analysis of how Sigmund Freud came up with his theories. All of his theories had always seemed a tad bit shocking but he was definitely a great thinker and truly revolutionized this field as he didn&#39;t allow his ideas to be circumscribed by the general thinking of people around him.",

Make sure to remember the flavor (try to use something you eat normally, or something that&#39;s memorable because it&#39;s unusual to you). Then, chew the same flavor at your exam or whenever you need it. <br><br>Because brains associate memories to several things (A feeling of disorientation when sick, pain after falling, or perhaps just something you saw while learning.), it will translate the memory to that particular flavor. Chewing gum will also help with stress, since your brain says &quot;Oh, you&#39;re eating? Well, we must not be in danger.&quot; and calms the nerves.<br><br>At least, create a brain map which makes u remember one thing which leads to an other.<br>eg- white-black<br>      day-night.",

I&#39;m looking at University of a Oregon as of now. My sister went there and my Uncle thought there for a few years. I am also talking AP Computer Science However, I started coding for fun around summer 2015 so I&#39;m pretty confident I&#39;ll be ok in that class. Can someone walk me through what taking AP Psych is like? A lot of people at my school and even teachers tell me it&#39;s one of the easier AP courses. I typically am a A/B student and right now I have a 3.6 GPA. I took the ACT once and I managed to garner a 23 without studying that much.",

        "comment_text": "List of things that tick me off about your teachings. <br><br>1. Out of date. BIG TIME!!!<br>2. Hand me down info that has become irrelivent to the studdies of the human brain today. Not NEARLY as accurate as it could be.<br>3. If your going to studdy positive psycology you must studdy its negitive counterpart BRAIN WASH as well. Why? Everything has an oposite. Why? Everything is governed by a world built on positive and negitive forces by positive and negitive forces; well fancy that; theres God and Satan right there. Fact is we spend our lives looking too closely at details that we cant see the forest for the trees. <br>4. Beverly Engle: her studdies on ptsd will BLOW YOUR MIND. I combined her research with my research and development and concluded from the book &quot;It wasnt your fault; the 5 step path to healing through self compassion&quot; and debunking her slight miscalculation...<br><br>In her book she clearly states dibilitating shame is the cause of misconception. I have reason to beleive admiration is the culprret and Shame is the effect of admiration. Admiration is the aproval of someone or something based on how that someone or something made you feel. This HOLDING of things above you is what causes shame. For example; I love my Dad regardless of his alcohaul adiction drug adiction his sexual permiscuous life style and all the emotional and physical abuse he extends to me; so long as I keep loving him eventually he will change. Its all my fault because I dont love him enough. This comes from conditioning through religion and dicipline. People dont stand up for rightiousness anymore because its spiritually, politically, and socially incorrect to do so... So theres your reason people wind up continuing the cycle and they do it to escape reality because the reality their living in is so cold and dense that they have only 1 option.<br><br>5. Desperation + Deprevation = Control. Why? It creates leverage. 1 thing about conspiracy is; its easier than doing the right thing. Its easier than being self sufficiant and independent. Their Gole is to have us all depend on eachother. GUESS WHAT? IT HASNT WORKED A MILLION YEARS AGO SO WHY SHOULD IT BEGIN TO NOW?<br><br>6. There are things happening in this world you dont want to know. Trust me.<br><br>7. Self control, independance, anything that makes you stable on your own without anyone else? Were did it go? If we lost all the things we depend on right now; everything that makes our lives easier, more &quot;Modern Day&quot; we would plummet into a world of death and distruction. The world is not progressing, its degressing. Sure; technology is progressing, but look around. Were slaves to social media, we dont make or prepare our own food from scratch anymore, we litterally have become sitting ducks. Our lives are LITTERALLY what they say it is at this point.<br><br>How do I know.<br><br>Deprivation + Desperation = Control. Weve been deprived of the following:<br>Freedom.<br>Self Control.<br>Dignity<br>Safety<br>Independance<br>Questioning<br>Our human rights.<br>Everything.<br>Were desperate because:<br>The country is in debt.<br>The impressionable dont question anything.<br>Hoodlems run ramped in the streets.<br>Racism from ALL SIDES!!!! <br>Radicalism EVERYWERE!!!<br>our ability to defend ourselves and make a differance is GONE!!!<br><br>SOOOOO, with this desperation, and this deprivation what do you think their going to do?<br><br>Their going to keep everyone happy with the fact that things are getting worse by giving them MORE MORE MORE MORE MORE..... Just like they do to the stars in Hollywood that sell their souls. This EMPIRE, THIS EUTOPIA ON EARTH, THIS THING AND IDEA RIGHT HERE. is exactly the carrot on a stick. And life just keeps getting more materialistic for those willing to give up God and strip themselves of everything that makes them truly loving and kind people. Their going to get us all to the point were we will be stupid enough to sign our souls away. Just like they did with every Hollywood pop star. Only by that time, the world will be its fully realised Eutopia state with the BARCODE TATTOO easily available to register you to be apart of the new world. Anyone who disagrees; will DIE. Their preparing for a war beyond your wildest dreams. Were all being set up.<br><br>Why else would they try this hard to kill the idea that mans true nature is to love him/herself; and extend that love to eachother, and give thanks to LIFE ITS SELF FOR PUTTING US HERE AND GIVING US THE 1 THING SATAN CANT GIVE US!!!! LOVE!!!! WERE DID ALL THE DAMN LOVE GO!!!!! <br><br>all I see is : a side vs a side vs a side vs a side vs a side. They all think their right, they all have their pros and cons, they all have their obsessive details and worries, they all think that somehow their Hollier than eachother... Fact is THEIR ALL WRONG!!!! EVERY SINGLE LITTLE LAST PERCEPTION OR SIDE THIS WORLD HAS TO OFFER YOU IS A LIE!!!! <br><br>and you all still think the truth is so easy to come by. If the truth were powerful enough to set you free, why on earth would power hungry men and weman just hand it to you?<br><br>You have to learn what it takes to go as dark as you can go, before you can truly turn around and see the light. You want heaven, you have to be willing to go through hell to get there. <br><br>Why? Its easy to find lies, deceivers, and satanist; its hard as hell to find the absolute truth. Oposits attract for a reason. That reason is because everyones truth is deluded 1 way or another. The only pure truth IS THE LIE, AND THE OPOSIT OF THAT IS THE REAL TRUTH. COMMON FLIPPING SINCE.",

So you start by defining psychology and you say that Aristotle said it all happened in the heart then you say it&#39;s wrong... But I read about and also heard about the fact that we have discovered there were neurons in many other places than the brain including the heart and stomach. I also read an article a while ago that spoke of the heart being actually what sends out electrical signals to the brain so it then carries out the tasks. The article concluded that the heart actually controlled the brain. So have you ever heard of any of that ? Can you give me more information about that ? Is it something new we have discovered ? Can you please enlighten me over that?",

When I&#39;m walking in the street I should begin to think in English without translating my thoughts in Russian. How can I achieve that? Well, I must start with a simple sentence like that: &quot;I want to think in English&quot;. Then, if nothing comes to my head, I must repeat the sentence. I must repeat the sentence while some other sentence will come to my head It may be something like that: &quot;I want to think in English but how can I do it? I know some words and I can connect the words to each other. What words do I know..?<br><br>2. <br>Every day I can begin with the sentence: I want to think in English. I have to imagine a way of the thinking process in which I could go in different possible directions for some minutes. Every good step that I will make will be noted as a new level in the game. For example, the first point is: I want to think in English. The second may be: everything, what I need for thinking, is time. How much time can I spend for this kind of thinking per day? It&#39;s a good question. If I want to get a good result it must be one or two hours at least. How can i organize it? How much time do I spend for the internet every day? If I could use half of this time for thinking, I would get enough.<br><br>3.<br>I want to think in English. Where would I come today? Where would I come in a month? In a year? If I think every day trying to write down the process of thinking and focusing on some issue within a month, I will be able to figure out what thinking in English is like. If I concentrate on the issue during a year, I will be able to use English in the process of thinking without efforts. What prospects does it offer? I will be able to listen to everything that I can find on the internet in English. It is the same with reading. Also I will be able to write. It gives me an opportunity to communicate with everyone I want. I can master thinking everywhere. Every free five minutes I can get to it.",

I know you get into the details later and I truly don&#39;t like John B. Watson as a person (from this remove ...) but I feel a little bad for him that the beginning of behaviorism was laid into Skinner&#39;s lab. Anyhow, it still stands up, this series.

But when it comes down to it we can never fully understand that which we cannot see, hear, feel, or experience for ourselves, people lie when asked certain questions, people themselves sometimes don&#39;t understand what they want for example there are many students in colleges and universities who are taking majors they are unsure of they do not know what they want out of life so if they don&#39;t know with exclusive access to their own minds how could someone outside that space possibly hope to figure it out see what i mean? this applies to a multitude of other factors that affect human behaviors, speech, reasoning, etc. even Freud&#39;s method is pure conjecture unable to truly be proven although his methodology for studying the human mind may seem like it explains how humans behaive almost perfectly, its still just a theory and just because something fits does not mean its this full proof method, we can make any theory fit our needs to rationalize what we want but in the end as i said it cannot be proven.  however i&#39;m not a psychologist so there maybe a perfectly reasonable explanation as to how someone can accomplish such things, if you have one please  i am simply looking for an explanation that is all.",

Actually, a few minutes later, I started to find the talk unsettling, I became nervous because of this, you&#39;re talking so fast, moving around, animations are sliding fast...

I don&#39;t know if I would call Freud monumental; maybe for his time, but he quickly went out of style. To go the way of the lobotomy as it were xD<br>For example most psych profs I talk with wish his ideas would stay forgotten, as we are now able  to quantify and actually measure/replicate aspects of the psyche thanks to tech and non-Freudian ways of thinking.<br>It&#39;s like how Astronomers/Physicists treat Aristotle but to a much greater degree, b/c at least Aristotle pioneered some fields still in use.<br><br>That said, thanks for all of CrashCourse.

The key to all psychological states is the reason and not the means which lead to an observable end. For example a person who pursues acknowledgement, fame, money etc in reality only\u00a0seeks a continuous feeling which emerges\u00a0through his participation with spiritual principalities. Some of\u00a0us only need a little boost to overcome the psychological barriers and freely participate like an increase in our salary or the seduction of a person who we perceive to be out of our league... Drug users\u00a0overcome those barriers\u00a0just by the artificial production of several compounds. We just want &#39;&#39;permission&#39;&#39; to participate because we fancy the spiritual state. If that state could be achieved through being\u00a0fat we would wish to be fat and so on and so forth",

Having high knowledge of psychology has many benefits. This doesn&#39;t really prove any points, but I have the psychoanalytical gift of correctly being able to tell what people are &#39;thinking&#39; (it is more complex than that) but this only works from time to time, and it probably works due to an abnormality of my own brain. Even if you excel at a certain science, to demean another science (more for its focus than its methods) is unwise as you should realise that all sciences strongly connect to and explain each other, although I believe that physics is the biggest field of them all. To disregard any science - in this society, at least - completely reduces our chances in expanding knowledge and innovation. I&#39;m seventeen years old, and I excel very highly in all scientific areas, which is actually a rare ability. I am able to realise exactly how important each science is, and that it is very unwise to disregard any science as unworthy of studying. I can understand why many people do not like psychology, as it is very inaccurate. However, without it, society would not have been as highly developed as it is today.<br>",

        "comment_text": "He mentioned so many great thinkers but not the Buddha, who had taught (in my view) the most well-grounded &quot;theory&quot; of the workings of the mind, because he saw how the mind worked himself \u2014 not through divine intervention or thinking, but through conscious observation of the mind and its phenomena which arise due to causes and effects. The questions asked at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo4pMVb0R6M&amp;t=1m36s\">1:36</a> can easily be answered by somebody who knows the basic workings of the mind... For example humans commit genocide for a number of (specific) reasons but it these boil down to the mind (due its lack of wisdom) giving rise to the unwholesome qualities of greed, hatred, and delusion. These things arise due to the mind&#39;s ignorance of the truth of reality: all things are changing, suffering arises when we attach to things, and everything is empty of self or inherent existence (because everything is conditioned by causes). Ignorance also translates to us not seeing the harm which is inherent in unwholesome actions. If we want to stop behaving badly, we should start reflecting on our actions and contemplating the pleasant and unpleasant results of engaging in them \u2014 that&#39;s wisdom, the pure awareness which lies in the heart of all of us and (for the ignorant) is obscured like the moon behind clouds. Unconscious mental phenomena are simply that: unconscious. In layman&#39;s terms, we&#39;re just unaware of these mental phenomena. But the Buddha and all of his disciples were able to train the mind to be mindful of mental phenomena \u2014 which is proof that these phenomena are totally observable in the here and now, which means that anybody can do it if they just start dedicating themselves to knowing things as they are.",

Also i agree with enviroment the condition of this earth and finally our weight and diet, as we know our diets are not that good these days due to increasing prices and lack of money to buy both other food and enough vegetables, currently to get enough veg in your diet you would probably have to go full vegetarian in order to actually be able to afford it.<br><br>Today the majority of people are very negative, vain, shallow, self-righteous and just generally not very nice people so because we are always surrounded by that as it&#39;s the majority it is no doubt going to effect us all, the influence is too great to even try to entirely fight it off, i see people very depressed these days but that is only because of the people who control this world that choose to do bad things to us and take all of our money. I believe it&#39;s 4 things Sub-conscious, conscious, enviroment and diet, of course we sadly can&#39;t always control our sub-conscious mind and our hormones is also something we are very much driven by, even if we try to control it at a certain point in life our body nags at us to mate with someone and to start having babies, you just can&#39;t ignore it ever, i&#39;ve tried myself but i can&#39;t, it&#39;s just a losing battle.",

It gives possible Explanations and Implications about Flow for example and combines a bunch of other schools into one big theory!!! Call it the unified field theory of psychology if you want ;) It has also good application in the Counseling and Therapist corner and roots in Psychobiology as well as in Psychoanalisis :) there is so much more wonderful to tell about this theory I trust you find the best parts to mention..

Wundt was no structuralist (and you mispronounced Leipzig).Titchener created Structuralism out a small sliver of Wundt&#39;s approach. Titchener&#39;s formal introspection was nothing like lying on a couch delivering up impressions to a nearby therapist (as in your illustration). William James was influential upon Functionalism, to be sure, but wasn&#39;t really a member of the &quot;school&quot; himself, and had moved on to other things by the time it really arose. Skinner&#39;s <i>Behavior of Organisms</i> was a fairly late event in the development of Behaviorism, which had begun more than 20 years earlier (Watson, Hull, Tolman). And there is way too much emphasis on Freud, who was highly influential on American psychiatry, but not so much on psychology. In any case, ideas about unconscious mentality hardly originated with Freud. They were floating around lots of German philosophy at the time, and had already been a formal part of both Helmholtz&#39;s and Wundt&#39;s scientific theories.\u00a0",

Freud came up with the idea of having patients lie down on a couch while he sat behind them ... to induce anxiety, which he thought was the result of unresolved conflict between the id, ego, and superego (by the way, that is what ALL Psy 101 students learn about Freud/his basis for treatment, so that would&#39;ve been useful to throw in). Freud&#39;s counterpart developed the &quot;talking cure&quot; ... Freud took it. \u00a0Freud&#39;s delve into the &quot;talking cure&quot; was a matter of attempting to figure out why those with hysteria had it. Hint: he got it right; it was that these women had been sexually abused as children. So, what does Freud do with this information? He refuses to believe that it could be going on in such a pandemic fashion that he, instead, decides to view all of these cases of rape as the patient putting forth their innermost sexual desires. Thus began that practice with Freud. Yes, he came up with some good things. His theory on defense mechanisms is spot on and widely accepted. But, most other things are utter crock. If you are going to talk about Freud, please discuss him in a manner in which people can imagine him complexly, opposed to simply glorifying him. Also, psychoanalysis is still not widely practiced; it is still practiced in some small sects on the east coast and in San Francisco. Also also, lumping neuroscience and cognitive psychology together doesn&#39;t make sense due to their being completely different schools of thought.\u00a0",

I&#39;ll admit, as a Clinical and Abnormal MSc student I was a little scared to watch this - so many people try to give overviews on the evolution of Psychology and it comes out inaccurate and dry. You, however, did fantastically. ^^<br><br>There are a hundred things I could ask you included in this course, but in terms of impact, I&#39;d really like to advocate for two topics in particular: Eating disorders and Schizophrenia (including hallucinations in the sane). The former a lot of people know about, but often just assume things like anorexia happen because of vanity. When you get into the science, that&#39;s mostly not the case - there are genetics, physical triggers (see: the Minnesota Starvation Study) and mental adaptations to a new average body shape through exposure to photoshoped images. With Schizophrenia... this is one of the things that really crushes me. Especially in Western societies, Hollywood&#39;s stereotype of psychotic killers with multiple personalities is really all people know of Schizophrenia. It&#39;s so inaccurate, and considering how common this condition is (1/100), it really needs addressing. I&#39;d love to see some focus on the spectrum from low schizotypy to diagnosis of psychosis and an illustration of how sometimes these things aren&#39;t as clean cut as &#39;this person is well and this one is insane&#39;.<br><br>Wow, this was long. I apologise, and hope you made it through! If you&#39;re ever looking for suggestions (I realise mine are completely unsolicited, sorry ^^;) or a hand with any research, I&#39;d love to lend a hand.<br><br>Thank you again for this!",

When you begin to study chemistry, you start by learning the atom, as it is the fundamental building block of everything we see around us. Similarly, if one is studying biology, one must learn the cell, as it is the building block of all life. The same concept applies to psychology. To truly understand the brain, we must endeavour to understand how neurons interact with each other to create intelligent behaviour, consciousness and the illusion of free will..<br><br>That&#39;s just my two cents.

Then he started to use introspection to come up with ideas about how everyone&#39;s minds work and that isn&#39;t scientific and isn&#39;t an effective way to really understand all minds.<br><br>On a different note, Wundt did not use introspection with other people. His main method of study was the same as Freud&#39;s, self-introspection. He created the first school of thought and taught all his students to study the mind by having people simply think about things and write down their thoughts and revelations on their own. One of his students then moved to America and started his slightly different school of thought using Guided introspection where the introspection was led by an observer who also took notes. The use of proper scientific techniques did not develop for a while and was very controversial with the first psychologists.",
