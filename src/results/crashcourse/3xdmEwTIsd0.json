I was taught that the hypothesis deals with functions: any function that can be &quot;solved&quot; or &quot;computed&quot; by a human can also be computed by a machine with sufficient power. (The Turing-Machine is such a machine)<br>So this would not have anything to do with a machine simulating the human brain.
