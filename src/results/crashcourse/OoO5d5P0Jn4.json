I thought that is also why they did Astronomy instead. Once Hank announced Physics would be taught in a post a few weeks back, I thought maybe they were going to find a way to teach physics in lay person terms, like documentaries but in more detail ... General ideas in particle physics, relativity, physical chemistry and physics applications in real life etc... But it seems they really are going down the route of teaching the traditional physics course which is mainly maths. I am skeptical the crash course format is suited for this type of learning. Especially when there are other YouTube channel so which go into the nitty gritty more suitably... Just can&#39;t imagine thought cafe animating a course based mainly on calculations on a white nor are.
