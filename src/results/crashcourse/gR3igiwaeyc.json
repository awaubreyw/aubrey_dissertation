As someone who has read the Communist Manifesto she was spot on and did it in a way she didn&#39;t sugar coat or over exaggerate anything <br>However, <br>she did not get into it in this video but the causes for revolution and how rich keep there power is Marx biggest misconceptions <br>1) going to advanced communism Marx wants us to live together, in one state (no countries) and everyone does what they love, get equal pay, housing provided by gov&#39;t and we vote (democracy). yet, if you have read other philosophers you would know this would not work. Same working class Marx calls for revolution is same Plato would call as the ones shouldn&#39;t be in power because they do not know anything, are dumb, and easily corrupted which is what we see with a lot of people in congress and same people who rioted for toilet paper during covid outbreak. The poor always want the power but they do not know what to do with it, let alone how to keep and redistribute it. <br>2) redistribution of wealth. After you kill the rich you give the money back to others. Yet, Machiavelli would say that would not happen. People are selfish, evil, and only good when they are forced to be (even Nozick and other philosophers back this up, I bring up Nozick bec he encouraged to be selfish). Look at what happen during covid or any crisis, everyone for themselves. Or china after the workers revolted. Mao kept all the power for him and his party and convinced the people it is only a matter of time before we give it back to the people an same propaganda to keep power.  While Marx says this must happen in a capitalist state, it does beg the question that when workers take over, power is quickly stole by one or a group. <br>3) Lets look at the free market. bailing out the banks, air line, cruise ships is not capitalism. The free market would let them fail because they did not prepare for struggle, but that is not the case. Govt bailed them out, govt involvement is socialism. In addition, profit is not bad. If I sell one of  you guys a phone that I made and took time, I should keep the reward for making and selling. If i then take out a loan and start a business and somehow survive (even tho most business fail 85-90 percent) than I should be able to pay the workers for me a price floor wage/living wage/ min. wage depending on that state im in and reap the benefits bec it was my hard work, risk, and business moves to get to where it went. Unless you think it is okay to steal and what i mean is, you get a pay check, pay your bills and whatever you have left over after uncle sam comes, i take and give it to myself because I need it more, most would say that isnt right. <br>I would love to live in a advanced communist state but Marx was very much optimistic of people (working class) and targeted the poor to rise up and take what is not theres. theres many ways to get rich in a capitalist state and many ways to get poor. educate your self <br>because I can see why many college kids and poor people fall for Marx ideas.

It&#39;s &#39;validity&#39; is brought about as to whether or not it offers a credible way of explaining how the world works. I&#39;m a Marxist because I think it does offer this. Would you believe that Marxism has been to not only understand how capitalism works but also how &#39;really existing socalism&#39; functioned or has been used to understand the development of China after Mao? I don&#39;t think you can divorce Marxism from the politics of socialism (and, for me, why would you want to?) but my point is that the politics of socialist countries arise because of political and economic questions they had to try answer and whether or not you agree with them, they in no way negate the fundamental aspect of what Marxism is. Indeed, some Marxists readings of say China or the Soviet Union are so critical that they&#39;ve spawned entirely new political tendencies within the left itself.", "comment_date": "2020-05-14T17:36:35Z", "likes_count": 22}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "Ugwd95dXWeLNFKiyrAB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Trung Nguyen", "comment_text": "thanks for good information, the Marx is the root of more equal in the labor and benefit for all workers, his theory is the reason evil old capitalism change to democracy and becomes more perfected mercy capitalism.", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T12:31:39Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UgxpQMj8uym-mynbx-14AaABAg", "comment_by": "Carlos Rodrigo", "comment_text": "I think that, even a capitalist republican would agree with this.

As a very broad thought (another way of saying philosophy) Marxism brought central and radically &quot;the real world&quot; to the people. This was not the case in his time with thinkers. There was the idea of Truth (something very platonic. That is to say, if we pursue language (and therefore truth) we will end up with wisdom.) Truth overcomes all forces despite how the real world looks. But then Marx comes along and make this grand narrative and argues that: the real world is indeed what it looks like.

But let me expose my views first.<br><br><br>  So, firstly, <br>In the &quot;primitive communism... people were strongly bound by natural constraints, but socially very equal&quot;. I don&#39;t get that. Virtually every social group (be it animal or human) had and will have a social hierarchy, as long as there will be the (for lack of a better word) &quot;drive&quot; to improve <b>life</b> . There is &quot;the dominant lion&quot; in a pack, as well as there&#39;s a dominant chimpanzee, and &quot;man&quot;. Now I can see why that difference could be seen as less evident <b>back then</b> (&quot;they were socially equal&quot;), but they were also suffering from a <b>way</b> lower life quality. Comparing the two time frames, what I can see is that people will get the benefits from &quot;life improvements&quot; in different ways, according to their social position. The poor will get better, and also that will be nothing compared to the exponential growth in wealth of the rich. But also that&#39;s how value works. If someone/something had or represented higher value back then (well it became a symbol), its value will exponentially grow over time.<br><br><br><br>  Secondly,<br> What is all about &quot;defining classes&quot;? <br> Look, this is how I see it. If (human) life wants to improve, it&#39;s at competition. Something will come off better than other things, which we regard as &quot;higher value&quot;. Looking into it, I understand that Marx was concerned (mainly) about the <b>poor</b> - the working class - &quot;getting poorer&quot; by being exploited by <b>the rich</b> - the bourgeoisie. He is right to be concerned about that. We do not need to let the system become (too) corrupt (all systems are corrupt in one way or another). <br> But what&#39;s the point of calling the rich &quot;the exploiters&quot; and the working class &quot;the exploited&quot;? Isn&#39;t that in itself an act of exploitation? Apart from that, let&#39;s say that indeed the tables will turn and everyone will be equal. Then what? It&#39;s not like people will suddenly become saints. The ones who will get the chance will still want more, and the ones that are not capable of keeping themselves on the right track will blame the ones who can, for not helping them - and surprise-surprise we are back at where we are now. <br> If the answer to that is &quot;well, you can regulate the way in which people will be granted more&quot;, that&#39;s basically what the law is supposed to be for. And if &quot;educating&quot; people is the solution, why not just start from that? <br><br><br> Thirdly, if the premise is that &quot;economic history&quot; is about the poor battling with the rich, then Marx says that... the solution is to have... another battle? What is that supposed to lead to? Because as far as I see it, that violence will cause nothing else than violence, which is what the last century showed.<br><br><br> I&#39;ve never been in a debate about this before and I am posting this comment because I believe that there is more that I need to know in order to understand, so please try to explain to me what Marx&#39;s theory is (actually) trying to say.<br><br><br>Edit1: I don&#39;t know why the bold is so weird.

There is a great difference between marxism theories and marxism-based theories. The intergrated theory of conflict emerged after the Second World War and opposed marxism on many levels. (see to the first video of this course and my comments on it). All other theories such as modern racial-conflict theory and modern gender-conflict theory can be even viewed from the marxist perspective as an attempt of the ruling capitalist class to destroy and disrupt marxism.<br>2. &#39;The economy&#39; is not the foundation (or basis) of superstructure. The foundation of superstructure is the answer to 3 questions: 1) &#39;What kind of level of scientific and technological development did the society reach?&#39; 2) Who has the right of property in the means of production? 3) What is the class structure of society and is there a class struggle between the oppressor and the oppressed classes?&#39; What lies beyond the 3 question does not influence the superstructure but is a part of the superstructure. <br>3. The contradiction between the forces of production and the relation of production is the inner conflict inside the basis and it leads to the so-called &#39;revolution in the basis&#39; and the major societal change.<br>4. Marx described the 3 historical stages of development as formations and the lesser stages inside one of them - the modes of production,. Thus the 3 stages are: primitive communism, the class society and the future communism and the modes of production are within the class society as - slave-owning mode, asiatic (stage-based mode), feudal mode and capitalist mode. Later, however, Marx followers called all modes of production - &#39;formations&#39;.", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T20:35:06Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UgxJazacVDiww5CvnBx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Diego Schmidt Fernandes", "comment_text": "Girl  take some break to breath....Way too fast", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T15:55:24Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UgzMldWqp6kn1SMe5PZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "K T", "comment_text": "Random Question: how were kings, priests, religions, etc even first introduced?

That kind of puts a logical background to why a guy from central Europe\u2019s 19th century Prussian monarchy would seem to have thought a lot about \u2018conflict theory\u2019 as he was always itching to startup a revolution to depose the king.  His theories about materialism based conflict seem to ignore that \u2018society\u2019 is a tool set up by individuals to meet their personal needs as the self always is of greater value than the collective.  When the \u2018society\u2019 becomes burdensome people abandon it, in smaller societies this is easier to see.

Unglaublich!! Nevertheless some important common mistakes:<br><br>1. The setup, as if Marx wrote a continual philosophical setup, which he didn&#39;t because there is a definable split between the early Hegelian and the later Materialist Marx, the theory that is relevant is what we find in Capital and important sideworks from the same era (see &#39;Grundrisse&#39;; Theories of Surplus Value&#39;; political works such as &#39;The Civil War in France&#39;, etc.), in Capital only Vol. 1 has a finished setup and form, as he died before finishing vol. 2 and 3, whose manuscripts were edited, complemented and put together rather badly by Engels, this is primarily a problem because Marx&#39;s theory is such that you can not properly understand the topic of Vol. 1 (the production process of capital) without vol. 2 (the circulation of capital) and their mashup in 3. So no there is no such philosophical narrative as an original philosophical principle from which the rest is established like there is in say  Descartes, there is no central principle of freedom running through the narrative.<br><br>2. Marx-for-himself vs. Marx as conceptual persona; Marx is the most misread and misunderstood of all philosophers barring possibly Nietzsche, this is because one heres several concepts continually in the Marxist discourse, many of which originate with Engels, most notable here are the Historicist concepts talked about thoroughly in this video. Dialectical materialism/historical materialism were concepts created by Engels and the second international, caught up in a Hegelian confusion. Historical materialism is actually an absurd concept when read as it was created by Engels, with metaphysical claims towards the whole universe, notably Engels didn&#39;t have the slightest bit of philosophical character. Historicism has reigned wild in Marxist authors including Gramsci who sociologists love (because his revolutionary elements are easier to ignore compared to most others), but nevertheless it is not actually found in Marx&#39;s late works. For a theoretical dismissal of Historicism through a reading of Capital, see &#39;&#39;Marxism is not a Historicism&#39;&#39; by Louis Althusser in &#39;&#39;Reading Capital&#39;&#39;. Furthermore a critique of Dialectics in a Marxist modality I would advise anyone who isn&#39;t afraid of a grand challenge to read Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari: &#39;A Thousand Plateaux&#39; where I think we find a more suitable metaphysical system.", "comment_date": "2017-08-06T18:34:16Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UgzJ_3I_Qoj4NEB1RGp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Jacques Celliers", "comment_text": "Marx &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3", "comment_date": "2017-08-02T22:40:03Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UgimOgMUNAo0FXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Winter Andromeda", "comment_text": "So a bit of extra information, Marx was Jew.

If it is a huge worker co-op with thousands of workers, then they will elect officials (similar to the government \u2013 there have to be time limits, division of power, and ways to removed them in case of wrong doing). We are already doing all of this, but only at the State level. We need to do this at the workplace.<br><br>\u201cAnd what about innovation and intellectual property is that to be distributed equally as well?\u201d<br><br>A suggestion I have heard on this issue is paying a lump sum amount similar to the Nobel price to the inventor. What you don\u2019t want is someone abusing intellectual property. You have to think about the entire society. As long as the investor gets his/her just compensation, then we are cool. After, for the production of that innovation, you need workers, and the workers ought to be paid justly for the surplus value they produced with their labor, and this can only be achieved if they make decisions democratically. <br><br>\u201cIs there any room for personal growth or individual wealth or do we all just work for the sole purpose to support the masses whether or not they work or contribute?\u201d<br><br>You can work for yourself, but a system of taxation will be in place in order to support people who are disabled, the elderly, the sick, pregnant, and more. Supporting the \u201clazy\u201d is a myth. Experiment after experiment proves that if you give help to the poor, they will get an education, become entrepreneurs, and get out of poverty. This proves that most people don\u2019t want to be lazy, they want to succeed; so if you give them the opportunity, they will take it.<br><br>\u201cWhat kind of a society do you think that would produce?<br>Not a fair or equal one I would predict.\u201d<br><br>This would not produce a completely fair and equal society, but a MORE fair and equal one. What would you rather have, democracy or totalitarianism? If you think that democracy is better than totalitarianism at the State level, why not at the workplace? What we have right now is a system in which the have-nots have to lend themselves for slave wages. The difference between this and slavery, is that you can \u201cfreely\u201d chose your slave master. This is a grotesque system. I think we will evolve out of it eventually with more social awareness, and in the future, just like no one is defending slavery anymore, no one will defend capitalism. No reasonable person can defend private dictators like Trump and the Koch brothers.", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T23:55:03Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UgjpSNszGuNGSXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "J0cked", "comment_text": "FULLY", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T22:39:14Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "Ugiepk6WXKoITXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Knugen", "comment_text": "It&#39;s funny how the entire theory can be debunked by the single fact that if workers don&#39;t get enough wages to increase their living standard, a free market will provide cheaper alternatives to living costs and thus gaining all the customers meanwhile increasing their living standard.", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T21:01:35Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UggHbUn8GsfHjHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Ron Walsh", "comment_text": "we need a video on anarchy-syndicalism and how businesses in which the workers own the means of their own production function.", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T04:32:48Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UgiW06_18ZgVOngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Fokaveli GG", "comment_text": "her teeth a mess bruh", "comment_date": "2017-04-25T22:29:39Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UgiNhdn9-_IrungCoAEC", "comment_by": "\u03c0 \u03c6", "comment_text": "Any explanation of Marx&#39;s work that never uses the word dialectic isn&#39;t an explanation of Marx&#39;s ideas at all.", "comment_date": "2017-04-25T21:58:28Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "Ugj5rKbpojcuc3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Ernest Baum", "comment_text": "Still waiting on CrashCourse Political Thought &lt;3", "comment_date": "2017-04-25T16:53:38Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "Ugg53eMVb5ke33gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Alfonso Paredes", "comment_text": "Falling in love with the hostess!", "comment_date": "2017-04-25T15:46:27Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UghqL4y5F-8UzHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "JudahTalks", "comment_text": "i like where this series is going.

The workmen desire to get as much, the masters to give as little as possible. The former are disposed to combine in order to raise, the latter in order to lower the wages of labour.<br><br>\u00a0We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labour above their actual rate. To violate this combination is everywhere a most unpopular action, and a sort of reproach to a master among his neighbours and equals. We seldom, indeed, hear of this combination, because it is the usual, and one may say, the natural state of things, which nobody ever hears of. Masters, too, sometimes enter into particular combinations to sink the wages of labour even below this rate. These are always conducted with the utmost silence and secrecy, till the moment of execution, and when the workmen yield, as they sometimes do, without resistance, though severely felt by them, they are never heard of by other people. Such combinations, however, are frequently resisted by a contrary defensive combination of the workmen; who sometimes too, without any provocation of this kind, combine of their own accord to raise the price of their labour. Their usual pretences are, sometimes the high price of provisions; sometimes the great profit which their masters make by their work. But whether their combinations be offensive or defensive, they are always abundantly heard of. In order to bring the point to a speedy decision, they have always recourse to the loudest clamour, and sometimes to the most shocking violence and outrage. They are desperate, and act with the folly and extravagance of desperate men, who must either starve, or frighten their masters into an immediate compliance with their demands. The masters upon these occasions are just as clamorous upon the other side, and never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combinations of servants, labourers, and journeymen.<br><br>\u00a0Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and their workmen, its counsellors are always the masters.", "comment_date": "2017-04-17T22:55:08Z", "likes_count": 15}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UghdgrEInj6CjHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Andrew Dockrill", "comment_text": "she is simply not as fun as the other guy who usually does this :/..", "comment_date": "2017-04-17T22:54:31Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UggO6xJtnHx5l3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0438\u043d \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "SEIZE THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION", "comment_date": "2017-04-17T22:53:15Z", "likes_count": 11}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "Ugj_5B15nOkrJ3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Lord Norden", "comment_text": "10% dislikes... stupid americans.", "comment_date": "2017-04-17T22:51:46Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UghvrtJIXR3WvHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Nate O", "comment_text": "I now understand that Sociology IS a politically spun subject.", "comment_date": "2017-04-17T22:51:38Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"gR3igiwaeyc": {"Karl Marx & Conflict Theory: Crash Course Sociology #6": {"channel_id": "UghXDpJnjNUvK3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jake is a Snake", "comment_text": "I love how whenever someone mentions an aspect of government that the USSR had people snap the gun to shut it down talking about the deaths by the the USSR.
