As a professor of biochemistry at a university, here is my explanation taken from my own course materials!<br><br>&quot;So, why doesn\u2019t the body store up lots of ATP for use when needed? While some make an argument of stability, the issue is actually efficiency.  The molecule of ATP is actually quite stable, if left on its own to degrade without the help of an enzyme, it would remain intact for about three years! However, there is only so much phosphate available to the cell and the molecule of ATP requires a considerable carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen structure to support those high energy phosphate bonds. Further, your body can store the energy of over 30 ATP in one molecule of glucose, so it is space saving.  Therefore, we pack our liver with about a 24 hour supply of glycogen (a polymer of glucose and our molecular fast food) and oxidize that in order to make more ATP when needed. In order to store the same amount of energy as ATP, it would take 60 livers worth of space!&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-07-26T16:39:29Z", "likes_count": 85}}}, {"fR3NxCR9z2U": {"Metabolism & Nutrition, Part 1: Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology #36": {"channel_id": "UghmVpA3lnpa4XgCoAEC", "comment_by": "IntelligentMrToad", "comment_text": "This is very informative, but this guy talks too fast, and the way the video has been edited, removing the natural pauses between sentences, makes it worse.

I haven&#39;t worked out in years which explains a little bit of the mass loss but I don&#39;t have the spare calories to even be able to workout. Im alreadt burning far more than I use to working out seems pointless. Any explanation for why this is happening would be greatly appreciated. Also I do have a testosterone imballance, my testosterone levels are a little above 2000ng/dL which I&#39;m told is unusually high. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s relevant though. I just want to gain my weight back.
