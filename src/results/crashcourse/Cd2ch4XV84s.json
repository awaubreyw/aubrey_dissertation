Seriously? OK, I get that he was the heir to the throne. So, that tells me Austria-Hungary and Serbia have some issues needing resolution. But, then you get Russia, Germany, France, and England involved?<br><br>Germany - 2.7 million dead; Austrio-Hungarian Empire - 1.86 million<br>Russia - ~2.5 million dead; France - 1.9 million; Britain - 1.35 million<br>These are some of the higher numbers amongst belligerents.<br>But, seriously! Millions dead over this? Maybe my flaw is just thinking logically, but if you&#39;re going to have a war, I&#39;d think it should be for a lot better reasons.<br><br>WWII occurred as the allies decided to put a stop to axis territorial conquests. It took over 2,400 dead before the U.S. even entered. It took the invasion of Poland, after plenty of other invasions by Nazi Germany for France and England to finally get involved.<br><br>Back to WWI, it&#39;s not even like Serbia tried invading Austria-Hungary, or vice versa.

Things had been smoldering in Europe for quite a while (a General European war had been narrowly averted in 1905).  The assassination, which anecdotally I have confirmed to be the work of the Serbian head of intelligence at the time, Dragutin Dimitrijevi\u0107, also known as The Apis (The Bee), having spoken with a few Serbians who were impressed I not only heard of this person but even came close to correctly pronouncing his name.  He pretty much did what he wanted and no one in the Serbian government wanted to cross him.  The assassination was a culmination point that caused things to spiral out of control.  When I explained to my wife how Serbia killed the heir to the throne who wanted to make the Slavs co-equal to the Austrians and Hungarians in order to preserve the empire, which is why the Slavs liked him, and the Slavs in the Empire didn\u2019t buy into the Pan-Slavism because they knew it really meant Russian domination and not self-determination.  The Archduke actually was offering that, in a way.  So when Serbia killed the heir to the throne, the Empire decided to make a list of demands so ridiculous that they would be rejected and the Empire would have its excuse for a war.  However, Russia had guaranteed Serbia\u2019s security, which meant war between the Empire and Russia.  This meant Germany would have to come to the aid of the Empire because of an alliance and the guarantee, meaning war between Germany and Russia as well.  This meant also war between France and Germany because of an alliance between France and Germany and France had actually been moving things along for a war so it could regain Alsace-Lorraine,.

If they won, they would not have flee. Italian and Ragusan merchants wrote about a Serbian victory, also a French cathedral of Notre-Dame rang its bells for 24 hours non stop, after the battle, celebrating the &quot;Christian victory over the Muslim invaders&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>Second - Saint Vitus day is not a holiday for &quot;Serbian nationalists&quot; or &quot;Slavic nationalists&quot;. Serbs celebrate Saint Vitus day as a Day of Heroes fallen for the Serbian Homeland and the Fatherland. Celebration of Saint Vitus day does not have any kind of nationalistic ring to it, it is something like a Memorial day in USA. \r<br>\r<br>Third - Princip was not a member of a Black Hand, he was a member of Young Bosnia, also, he was not a Serbian nationalist (although a Serb), but a Yugoslav nationalist. His words, on his trial were: &quot;I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be freed from Austria.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Fourth - Black Hand didn&#39;t want to create &quot;Greater Serbia&quot;, its wishes were to unite Serbia with Bosnia, which had the majority of Serbian population at that time in the history. \r<br>\r<br>Fifth - Ferdinand was not a moderate. He was an antisemite, he also despised Hungarians so much that he wanted, when became an emperor, to shrink Hungarian influence and the territory within the empire, and also planned to use a military force against the Hungarians, if Hungarians disagreed with his view of Empire&#39;s internal organization. He wanted a centralized empire with German dominance, with an illusion of decentralization, with a plan to create a third entity within the empire, which would be Southern Slavic or Yugoslav, so empire would be Austro - Hungaro - Yugoslav. All that maybe sounds sweet, but bad thing for the Serbs is that he planned a conquest and annexation of Serbia, into the Empire and again, in full control and dominance of German nation and Vienna. \r<br>\r<br>Sixth - Assassination of Ferdinand was not an act of terrorism, the concept and explanation of terrorism, as we know today, did not exist in 1914. Assassinations of rulers and politicians were very common thing in 19th and, in first half, of the 20th century.

The long answer is this:<br>Sometimes, too much allies against too much enemies equals lots of men dying. France and Germany had a logical reason for an alliance, for extra protection, but if there is too much protection, the lives of the protectors will go along with the lives of the country that is protected. In this case if Austria-Hungary declares war on Russia, the members of the alliance will declare war on Germany, which is a logical reason because alliances are alliances, what are they to not declare war on the enemy? They should only declare war if they were invaded without declaration and if the enemy already declares war on the country, in this case, France.

First, I would say many knew what was coming, and where more than enthusiastic about it. Most of the powers who participated in the conflict had reasons to want to be at war with each other and where looking foward to it.<br>First, the british and the german. Long story short, germany wanted his own colonial empire. The UK didnt want to; it was already annoying for them to have to share the &quot;colonial gameboard&quot; with other big players like france, to accept another annoying european competitor in the game. So germany decided to invest lots of money in its navy, in hopes to one day have a navy that could rivalize with the british navy, and as such force the british to stop bothering Germany and letting them have their-so-wanted colonial empire. The first morocan crisis is an example of all of this. So, UK and Germany wanted to go to war to settle this dispute once and for all.<br>Germany and the austria-hungarians wanted to go to war with russia cause Russia was becoming a serious big deal. Back untill something like 1910, russia was considered a wasteland by europeans. A land of farmers and barbarians, completely drawback and filled of ignorant peasants. But since then, Russia was industrializing... fast. Like, really really fast. And its military was growing with it. In fact, german analist assured the kaiser that by 1918 Russia&#39;s military would be more powerfull than Germany. So, the solution: strike them while they are still weak, before they industrialize to that threathening level. Also, there was another issue: the austria hungarian empire was dying. It was inevitable, and german&#39;s goveremnt knew it. Going to war with Russia quickly would allow Germany to squeeze just a little bit of military support from the AU before its inevitable collapse.<br>Russia wanted the war cause he wasnt gonna let AU expand on a slavic territory. Better to attack the AU while it was busy fighting another nation, and weakened, than wait and find out the AU was growing stronger and rebuilding thanks to its military conquest of Serbia!.<br>Germany and France went to war cause... honestly? it feels like the most chilidish of all the beligerants. They just hated each other, and France wanted Alsace and Lorena back.<br>And then comes the US, who wants to help France and the UK cause both of them owe the US lots of money and the US is concerned that if they loose in this war, the collapse this defeat would cause on those economies would mean they would never be able to re-pay the US their debts. Also, the US wanted to pretend they had a big groin by participating in such a big deal as the great war was. Japan jumped into the war for more or less the same thing, show they were a big deal. So did the Ottomans, to a degree, altrough it was also in high degree cause of Enver Pasha&#39;s stupidity.<br>Italy went into the war for... reasons. Dunno which reasons where, I bet even the italin high command wasnt sure why they were going to war, but I bet if you dig deep enough you will find some absurd reason.", "comment_date": "2017-03-25T23:50:42Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "GearandaltheFirst", "comment_text": "Is the thumbnail based off Leviathan?", "comment_date": "2017-03-23T03:39:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Faint Sherin", "comment_text": "Anyone recommend a book? 2 minutes in, this guy is still in his introduction.", "comment_date": "2017-03-22T12:42:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "phoebe rogala", "comment_text": "to vilint", "comment_date": "2017-03-21T02:56:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dul Nar", "comment_text": "There are no Mongols today?

He had grand plans for trialism in Austra-Hungary, which would effectively have made the empire a triple monarchy with the south slavs empowered as the Hungarians were. He drew a lot of suspicion in Vienna because of this, in particular in Hungary where the idea was seen as a potential dilution of Magyar power within the empire since the Emperor would have the deciding vote. And in Serbia the idea was regarded by nationalists (and you&#39;d have been hard pressed to find a non-nationalist Serb in 1914 Serbia) as a threat to their dream of a Yugoslavia, and that was one of the driving motives behind the Black Hand&#39;s desire to kill Franz-Ferdinand - as a symbol of Habsburg power, but also for what he stood for if he did inherit the crown.<br><br>SO F-F survives - does Austria still decide to go after Serbia? What is F-F&#39;s moderating influence (if any) on his uncle and the Austrian general staff in the July Crisis? What of Germany&#39;s blank cheque, or the other powers&#39; responses, how might they change - the guy did survive, after all. Perhaps it also comes down to how seriously he&#39;s wounded - couple of cuts and bruises and he walks away, everybody&#39;s pissed but everybody is still alive and well; have him lying in hospital between life and death for a month and he may as well be dead for all the difference it would probably make on the world scene. <br><br>So let&#39;s say he escapes unscathed enough from Princip&#39;s attack that his life is never in danger from his wounds (and I would almost have to go with a foiled attempt, something a bit more drastic than the first car that was bombed earlier that day but not enough to injure Sophie, his wife, in any way. If Sophie had even a scratch on her, I think F-F would have ridden into Belgrade on horseback himself to avenge her - his honour and his devotion to her would have commanded it). Let&#39;s go further and say that WWI, though probably inevitable, is averted long enough for Franz-Josef to die and for FF to take the reins of power in Vienna - would his views on Serbia and the greater south slav issue have been very different? A-goes ahead with trialism - how does that dynamic play out both in the Empire and in the Balkan capitals? B-takes on a harder line with the Serbs than before, revigorates the Austrian army and navy in opposition to the growing threat from the south. On one hand this just brings them closer to war; on the other, an A-H Empire run by a younger, more dynamic ruler might have helped to reduce that growing sense of inferiority, of having been overtaken by events, that most Austrians felt at the start of the 20th century, a feeling that the world as they knew it was slowly dying around them, like their 84-year-old emperor. It was that sense of impending doom, of not knowing what to do but knowing they had to do <b>something</b>, that drove the Austrians to war in 1914 as surely as F-F&#39;s assassination. Remove that, or revigorate it, with a forward-looking ruler like F-F on the throne... Would history have been much different? Would Germany have felt Austria could handle its own affairs well enough not to need a blank cheque in a later dispute with its neighours? Because Germany, too, felt insecure about Austria&#39;s slow but steady decline - many in Berlin felt that it was better to wage a war now (1914) while Austria was still an ally worthy of the name.

Germany and Austro-Hungary were new empires and therefore lacked colonies to boost their economy. They found the old Ottoman territories on the Balkan to be convenient for serving the purpose, giving them more resources and expanding their influence if they manage to seize them. The assassination was just an excuse, Germany and Austro-Hungary already wanted to conquer Serbia, Bosnia ets.<br><br>Bulgaria (which you totally forgot to mention) was already mad at Serbia and Greece for getting only scraps from the division of Macedonia*, which happened between the three of them in the First Balkan War, and the refusal to redivide it which resulted in the Second Balkan War (in which not only Bulgaria failed to get more territory, but also lost some). So Bulgaria also participated in the WW1 on the side of Austro-Hungary in hopes of getting most of Macedonia and some payback. <br>The territory of Macedonia was the most &quot;ripe&quot; one for grabbing, it was decimated first by by Turkey/Ottoman Empire and then by the Balkan Wars. The Turkish grasp on it was so strong that not only they used upwards of 100 000 soldiers + irregulars in a single city (Krushevo) to suppress the last Macedonian attempt of freedom in 1903, but also a decade later in the First Balkan War they fought against Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece at the same time to try to keep control over it, even though the three themselves were individually able to gain freedom from the Ottoman Empire not too long ago.<br><br>*To avoid confusion let me clarify that by Macedonia I am talking about the actual one (all of it), as it was before the First Balkan War, not about the Republic of Macedonia (~32% of Macedonia which was claimed by Serbia, got freed and became part of Yugoslavia and after its fall became an independent republic) or the region in Greece (~51% of Macedonia claimed by Greece in the division, which is confusingly also just called Macedonia).", "comment_date": "2016-11-07T17:11:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tinywampa", "comment_text": "Is this the fourth video on ww1 they have made?", "comment_date": "2016-11-07T01:20:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brooklyn Van Rooyen", "comment_text": "I&#39;m still confused.... describe the events which led to the outbreak of world war one in august 1914.

Consequently, this led to the rise of conflicts between European powers. Austrian and Russian rivalry for the control of the Balkans is a perfect example that illustrates how imperialism contributed to the formation of a competitive and anarchic international environment. As a result, this prompted the formation of the Alliance system and Militarism which only worsened the building tensions in Europe. This chaotic environment was what allowed for World War 1 to happen. Each crisis in Europe, one by one, increased the chance for war. It was becoming inevitable, and it was only a matter of time. By 1914, countries could no longer refrain themselves and thus initiated the first world war.

This made it much easier for the police to catch the assassins. Gavrillo wasn&#39;t caught, and he was hungry so he went to a sandwich shop to go get something to eat. By mere coincidence, the driver for Franz Ferdinand&#39;s car took a few wrong turns and just happened to pass by the sandwich shop Gavrillo was in. Gavrillo killed Franz Ferdinand.

Second, Bosnia was for centuries ruled by kings of Serbian origins, half of Bosnia are Orthodox Serbs, others are Serbs who accepted islam during Ottoman rule and forgot their heritage called the Bosniaks, other little minority are Croats, who btw are also Serbs who accepted Catholic faith. Gavrlo just wanted to all Slavic people live in single state. Serbia whooped Austra&#39;s ass in the war multiple times, and after that biggest mistake of Serbs in history, creating the Yugoslavia. That was our doom. To resume, Serbia had nothing to do with assasination, as Gavrilo himself said. Serbia was just a victim of colonial hunger of the great powers.  On the end I just wanted to say one more thing, Serbs were actuall defenders of Europe and its Christian population, we were in the first line of defence against Ottoman Turks, because of us Turks never succeded to conquer Austria, many of our people fled there and continued fighting the Turks and succeded later to take back our land, then in Balkan wars continued campaign to expell Turks from the Balkans and Europe, with no help of any other European country. While everyone enjoyed and builded their countries, we used to fight through all history and going backwards. But still here we are, alive and have our own state, survived everything.

I mean sure, playing with words always causes anger, same as missinterpetations, but i have to notice a few huge gaps here.<br>One, the reason why Russia was ready to mobilize was not explained very good, it&#39;s a bit more complicated than what was presented here.<br>Second, well mistakes related to Ferdinand being &quot;moderate&quot; and how he would change something if he was alive. Even if we assume that&#39;s true, austria had many non-austrians under it&#39;s control, and they&#39;d all want their own freedom when the Empire was weak.<br>Third, the assasination itself. I have to note that i&#39;m very pleasently surprised they payed attention to the date on which Ferdinand came to Sarajevo, which won&#39;t be found in almost all western &quot;explanations&quot; of this war.<br>Fourth, the role of Germany was a bit minimized.<br><br>-Yes, Russia was angry that they lost the war with Japan( which was by the way silently supported by GB, and they knew about it about a year before it started ), but they mostly lost the war because they weren&#39;t expecting it. They fixed that here, they were ready before everyone else, so victory was assured.<br>Second, Russia and Serbia had a very, very close partnership especialy at those times. Mobilization was also a way for Russia to warn Austria that they won&#39;t sit and watch while they overrun Serbia. \u00a0Serbia most certainly shared the cnditions of Austrian ultimatum shortly after they recieved it. Supported by Russia, Serbia rejected one condition which would basicaly deny their sovereginity( and therefore would be unacceptable to everyone ) at the same day Russia started rattling with weapons. That was done at the same time for a reason.<br><br>-Ferdinand was seen as a tyrant by the Serbs( i won&#39;t use the term &quot;Bosnian Serbs&quot; because the majority were Muslim and Orthodox Christian Serbs, dig into the matter and see for yourself if you dissagree ). Serbian government didn&#39;t support destabilization of the region. Serbia just had two balkan wars, it was exausted and didn&#39;t need another one, especialy with a country as big as Austria.<br>Black Hand was an organisation that could have possibly had ties with the &quot;Young Bosnia&quot; movement( which Gavrilo Princip who killed Ferdinand was part of ), but they were just an unofficial organisation that were fighting for unification of all Serbs. Note that i didn&#39;t use the term &quot;expansion&quot;, because it wasn&#39;t expansion, it was liberation.<br><br>-There were two assasination attempts on Ferdinand, and the second one was a success. Remember that he was next in line for the Austriah crown. Killing a successor of the throne would usualy spark an internal conflict, especialy in the Austrian empire which had a lot of non-austrians and non-hungarians within it&#39;s borders. Black Hand was possibly expecting Austrian empire to fall apart after Ferdinand, as the life of the current Austrian king was nearing it&#39;s end.<br><br>-Germany had a much bigger role in the war. Not only because it gave a &quot;blank check&quot; to Austria and was the first to declare war to one empire, but also because Vilhem wasn&#39;t very skilled. He fired Bismarck, which tried to keep the three big empires ( Germany, Austria and Russia ) on the same side to prevent major wars. Soon after, there was no one to take Bismarck&#39;s role and his effort was all for nothing. That was probably the most important factor and a reason why the war went global and why it even started.<br><br><br>There are much more interasting details, but i tried to concentrate on the important ones.", "comment_date": "2015-03-03T10:57:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mon", "comment_text": "laik de coment if u thinck dat im stupid... \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHA NOW U HAVE TO GIVE ME THE LIKE!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2015-03-02T11:57:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Theo Frot", "comment_text": "The map at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cd2ch4XV84s&amp;t=7m22s\">7:22</a> has an error: France still includes Alsace-Lorraine.

The Austro-Hungarians and Germans were the ones who started the war, not Russia, not France and definitely not Great Britain. Great Britain got caught up in the conflict because it had sworn to uphold Belgium&#39;s neutrality.<br>In fact, there was debate in the British parliament since an important part of British society didn&#39;t want to get involved in a &quot;continental conflict&quot;. But when Germany invaded Belgium, ignoring its neutrality, Great Britain had to answer, it had to make good on its word, just like Russia had to make good on its promise to defend Serbia.<br>Germany&#39;s move to invade Belgium (in defiance of Britain) was rather shocking, since the Kaiser Wilhelm II was Queen Victoria&#39;s grandson, in fact, the Kaiser wanted to avoid a conflict with Britain (his grandma&#39;s country) at first, but then he became paranoid, thinking that Britain, Russia and France were planning the invasion of Germany.<br><br>PS: It&#39;s not surprising that Russia started making preparations for war before any other nation. Russia was (and still is) the largest country in the world. Back then it wasn&#39;t even properly industrialized, there was lack of roads, logistics, materials, food, etc. In a country like Russia you had to start making preparations many months ahead, it wasn&#39;t like Germany (the most industrialized country back then) or the Austro-Hungarian Empire (with the powerful industry of Czechoslovakia), in Russia things went slow. Also, that was a particularly hard time in Russia. There had been a rather recent revolution attempt in response to decades of tyrannical rule, famine, poverty and backwardness. Most farmers in Russia were starving (and a lot of people in Russia were farmers back then), food production was pretty low. Russian agriculture was agonizing, not only because productivity was low and Russian exports had fallen, but because Russian farmers were put in a pretty untenable position. A lot of Russian landlords had abandoned/sold/mortgaged their lands during the industrial revolution due to low profits/debt, etc. As always, the farmers would have to pay the nasty consequences. The Tsar and his government decided that the farmers would &quot;inherit&quot; the responsibilities of their former landlords. They encouraged farmers to buy those abandoned/mortgaged lands and to pay for those &quot;allotment lands&quot; in redemption dues over decades.<br>The problem is that those lands were not profitable and weren&#39;t sold to individual farmers but to entire farming communities, which then divided those lands among individual farmers.<br>So whenever individual farmers couldn&#39;t make ends meet with their meagre harvests (which was usually the case), they couldn&#39;t sell, renounce or mortgage their patches of land, they were basically forced to stay there and starve.<br>Bottom line, Russia had a deep agricultural crisis that was entering a downward spiral towards total collapse.\u00a0 \u00a0<br>Obviously, a large country with that kind of agricultural problems is bound to collapse, as it happened, finally, in 1917.<br>Russia was already in deep crisis by 1914, I&#39;m surprised it could mobilize for war at all.", "comment_date": "2015-01-31T01:46:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Martinez", "comment_text": "aka the cluster fuck war", "comment_date": "2015-01-30T14:18:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chaotix", "comment_text": "I LOVE Crash Course, and I think it&#39;s really great that you offer this to the public\u00a0at no cost.", "comment_date": "2015-01-29T06:50:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nmethyltransferase", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who thinks those Thought Bubble Mobile Suits are cute?

If you read the letters transpiring between the three cousins leading the war, you will all understand how Russia and Britain truly had to stop Germany, Austria and the Ottomans were childsplay, with conscript armies, Germany had professional soldiers, veterans, so did Britain and Russia, which is why they are the most talked about countries involved in the Great War.", "comment_date": "2014-12-29T00:17:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ken Kobayashi", "comment_text": "Nice shirt!", "comment_date": "2014-12-28T22:34:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "destructoidjm", "comment_text": "In the ending, I was expecting another Mongoltage.", "comment_date": "2014-12-24T18:08:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke", "comment_text": "The Austrians were to blame!

But if you are USA, GB or France, its ok to brake that law...<br><br>You dissapoint me John, the colonial wars, and the subject of colonies was a major factor in why sides was chosen, and promises made to declare war to help eachother on both sides, should a war (wich it did) start.

Did you forget about the Descos Affair, upon which France pushed the Serbs to have a war with the Austrians so that they would have an excuse to attack Germany if they so wanted. Leon Descos, a French ambassador to the Serbian Kingdom, was dismissed when word leaked out that Poincare&#39;s government was discussing Austrian and German plans of war and told them how futile the Hoyos Mission was. Paris was forced to dismiss Descos for his actions and he was replaced by a new minister and Descos was transferred to Romania secretly to discuss a possible alliance there to weaken German resolve. And I don&#39;t see how Serbian freedom fighting is controversial because there is historiographical proof that the Black Hand supplied Princip and other officers in Macedonia with weapons and intel and that speaks for itself. But Germany also pushed for war because Austria would never have declared war without Imperial German backing, which they so chose. And even if France did not get involved the Serbs would never have agreed to Austrian demands for a settlement. The &quot;schoolhouse bullying&quot; diplomacy you mentioned was pulled by German and French diplomats and the Serbs and Austrians never mattered, they were just tools for German and French plans for continental conquest and global power.", "comment_date": "2014-09-17T18:19:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Duncan", "comment_text": "It&#39;s hard out here for a moderate \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2014-09-17T13:00:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rajatj61191", "comment_text": "Your videos are awesome.

Russia&#39;s western border was guarded by only a few corps in sparse locations. Even though the Russian Army was much larger than the Austro-Hungarian or German Armies, mobilisation would take nearly three times as long to invade either nation than it would for Germany or Austria-Hungary to invade Russia. When Austria-Hungary shows signs of mobilising over 10 corps to defeat the Serbijan 3 corps for invasion, Russia (which supports Serbija) can only assume that such force is a potential measure against itself by Austria-Hungary. The Tsarj fumbles around with partial mobilisation knowing this by means of the Russian intelligence apparatus revamped after the Russo-Japanese War to buy time to move corps from the Kjev and Moskva districts to the west to defend against a possible attack from Austria-Hungary. After Germany states it will aid, Russia can either mobilise to defend itself or it can pull back and cede the Polish and Ukrainian territories to a quick Austro-Hungarian or German offensive. Simply put, Russia was provoked into partial mobilisation by Austria-Hungary and Germany as a means of defending itself, probably so that Germany could fabricate a valid casvs belli against Russia (and France, largely out of the Kaiser&#39;s frustration with Germany&#39;s poor imperial performance). If anything, Germany is then the primary motivating factor for the War at its World reputation, because Austria-Hungary had no reasonable intention of fighting Russia.", "comment_date": "2014-09-15T19:26:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Kunert", "comment_text": "The big question is would there be a war at a later point if event x would not happened.

Much of the runnup in Bosnia and Serbia happened due to both Empires trying to retain their Balkan territories. On top of that, the breakdown of the Ottoman Empire is probably one of the most important factors in today&#39;s Balkan, Middle East, North African region. Seems pretty important considering not only current events, but many events outside of Europe since 1914.<br><br>This misgiving leads us to feel like where when John talks about Eurocentrism as a somewhat negative concept, the leaving out of the Ottomans clearly shows that Crash Course&#39;s script writing is indeed a script that is still telling the same story about Europe.

Peace broke down, and thus war.<br>Imperialism is increasing wealth, power, and fame by grabbing more territory. Everyone wanted raw materials and land. Competition over land in Africa, Asia, and the Balkans and pride of countries increased confrontation between countries and helped catalyze the war. Imperialism is also what made the Great War a World War. Territories either stayed loyal to their empire (and aided later in the war effort) or\u00a0split off from their empire.<br>Militarism was interest in advancing war technology. The arms race was on, with the evil noise of artillery, tanks, and planes booming in the background of the front line infantry. Guns like machine guns, assault/support rifles (the BAR, although usually not classified as an assault weapon, is an example), and submachine guns were also developed.

Secondly, unintentionally, but still painfully insulting: there is no such thing as Austro-Hungarian, as a nationality. The Kaiser was the Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, King of Croatia, and ruled over their portion of Poland as well. Therefore, they were officially Austrian, Czech (Slovaks were not recognized as a nationality), Croatian, Hungarian, so I implore, in the next video, use Austro-Hungarian as it was, names for institutions. Thirdly, I know, it&#39;s a running gag, but denouncing France is not funny, the Great War was different, the country managed not being occupied.<br><br>The assassination of the Archduke was the casus belli, international history knows more than that, the conflict almost broke out in 1912 in Tangiers already. It was driven by colonial greed, and laid the groundwork for the second worldwide conflict, since instead modernizing, and expanding self-governing rights, in both conflicts the most developed belligerents were interested in keeping up the culture of oppression, both toward the non-white subjects, and their Caucasian low earning class, which in turn inspired brutal answers from those long oppressed, and became blind followers or orchestrators of communism.", "comment_date": "2014-09-13T18:26:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RemnantTheCheese", "comment_text": "Wait, the Serbian nationalist group was called the Black Hand? \u00a0And there wasn&#39;t an Elder Scrolls joke?<br>John, I won&#39;t say that I&#39;m angry, but I am disappointed.", "comment_date": "2014-09-13T18:14:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Innar Ko\u00eft Chtofenbeurg", "comment_text": "Why does english speaking people hate french?

Yes, getting an assurance from Germany was one reason, but the &quot;Blank Check&quot; meeting between the Habsburg ambassador and the Kaiser happened on July 5.  He still left that 20 day gap.<br><br>The second reason for the delay was the need to convince the Hungarian prime minister that war was necessary.  The Austro-Hungarian Empire was a dual monarchy, with an Austrian government, a Hungarian government, and a small council of ministers (and an emperor) tying the two governments together.  The Hungarian prime minister was not a moderate, but he was deeply concerned about the effect of war on his half of the empire, principally from a Romanian invasion of Hungarian Transylvania.  So the small council had to convince him that diplomatic overtures were being made to some of the other Balkan countries to prevent that.  I think the Habsburg foreign minister also assured Tizsa that Russian intervention was very unlikely.  He was convinced by the middle of the month.<br><br>The last part of the delay resulted from the Habsburg monarchy deciding to have the ultimatum coincide with the end of a visit by the French president and prime minister to Russia.  They wanted to release when they were just about on their way out to prevent to the two leaderships from coordinating a response to the ultimatum.  They didn&#39;t want their little war interfered with.  So they released it on July 25 when Poincare and Viviani were just about to get on the boat back to France (and they would be largely incommunicado for the duration of the trip, allowing the French ambassador in Russia to conduct his own foreign policy which all but assured the Russians that France had their back no matter what and that they should mobilize).", "comment_date": "2014-09-13T17:48:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Hamblin", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t love architecture, I love Monguls", "comment_date": "2014-09-13T17:40:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abz", "comment_text": "What is really pathetic to me as a bystander in this whole issue is, Serbia wanted Bosnia and 85 years after WW1 they massacred the people of Bosnia.

Crash Course is simply amazing! It&#39;s FUN to know why things are what they are today, it&#39;s FUN to gather knowledge you can apply throughout your life, it&#39;s FUN to begin to develop your own views and opinions instead of going off what others biased information imposes on you, it&#39;s FUN to feel like part of a community of people who want to make themselves better by being able to comprehend others, it&#39;s FUN to be EXCITED. Not only all is that giant not very eloquent run on sentence talk about the super fun things Crash Course gives us great, but it&#39;s honestly the very best thing to procrastinate from learning by learning. That sounds like a super strange sentence (probably because it is) but when I&#39;m too lazy to put effort into homework I watch Crash Course and vlogsbrothers and my brain feels like a flowy mix of happiness because its always eating new knowledge. AND the new things I know conveyed by the incredibly hilarious and amazingness of Crash Course, leads me to other great things! I can watch The News with a fuller understanding, and The Colbert Report, and The Daily Show (which makes me super crazy happy!!!)
