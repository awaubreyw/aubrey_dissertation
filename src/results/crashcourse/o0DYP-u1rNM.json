Each cone has a small receptive field (on centre off surround); conversely there&#39;s more rods scattered throughout the periphery with larger receptive fields <br>- due to the small receptive field, each cone can pick up information in their reference in great detail (high visual acuity) because each is focused on a small part of the visual field. Vice versa for Rods which is why they are better suited for movement and black and white imagery <br>- our visual field is represented as an image on the back of our retina due to retinotopic organization; this information is not altered <br>- cones attach to parvocellular retinal ganglion cells while rods attach to magnocellular retinal ganglion cells<br>- the optic nerve leaves the retina and travels to the thalamus which is responsible for relaying all incoming sensory information aside from olfaction. Visual information is relayed through the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus of the thalamus to PVC (primary visual cortex) of the occipital lobe<br>- magnocellular pathways in the LGN are relayed through layers 1&amp;2 of the LGN while parvocellular pathways through 3,4,5&amp;6<br>- when this information reaches the occipital lobe, magnocellular pathways are sent through the thick stripes of the striated cortex (through indirect and direct pathways) <br>- parvocellular pathways are sent through interstripes and thin stripes (visual acuity) of the striated cortex of the occipital lobe <br>- when we see an object we are familiar with, two general things are happening: the occipital lobe sends information through the dorsal and ventral streams to go to the parietal and temporal lobes respectively <br>- once the dorsal pathway reaches the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) this is where spatial recognition happens (exactly where in the visual field the object of focus is) <br>- when the ventral pathway reaches the Inferior temporal gurus (IT) it&#39;s responsible for object recognition- what exactly it is what we are looking at <br>- there&#39;s more to this than just what I&#39;ve wrote but it&#39;s an extremely interesting sense to study; also easier to study in contrast to cognition because vision is localized to select discrete areas of the brain", "comment_date": "2017-10-03T04:10:30Z", "likes_count": 120}, {"comment_by": "Joanne", "comment_text": "It&#39;d be cool if there was a part on focusing of light rays!", "comment_date": "2017-10-02T12:08:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Subhicsha s", "comment_text": "You guys provide an amazing service !!tq", "comment_date": "2017-10-01T15:27:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chanbaektrasheu", "comment_text": "why did i FRICKIN GOOGLED IT UGH", "comment_date": "2017-09-27T00:28:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jenny Rojas", "comment_text": "I wish you would slow down.

This places the nuclei of the cells (the only non-transparent part) at the periphery of the lens, where they don&#39;t block the light. Furthermore, as more lens fibres are packed on the outside, the nuclei of the inner fibres dissolve away (the only cells in the body that do this, I believe), and the pressure of the outer fibres drivers moisture out of the inner fibres, causing the middle of the lens to be denser and therefore have a higher refractive index.
