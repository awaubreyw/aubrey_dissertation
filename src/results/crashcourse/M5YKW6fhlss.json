Yet we fail to accept that there are things that can destroy us in a blink of an eye. Disease, for as long as we have existed it has claimed more lives than any other thing. \u201cDiseases include a large part of all causes of death worldwide\u201d. (The Statistics Portal) These diseases can be painful and last as long as a few days, months, years and even lead to death. There are four types of diseases:  Pathogenic disease, deficiency disease, hereditary disease, and physiological disease. It is important to know about each one of them in order to prevent contamination and spreading if possible.<br> <br>The pathogenic diseases are those caused by a bacteria, virus, fungi, and parasites. These types of diseases are infectious, spread quickly, and among them are the most deadly. An infectious disease is transmitted from one organism to another, from person to person, animals and insects. Direct contact between infected people is one of the fasts ways of contamination. Touching hands after someone sneezes, kissing and sexual intercourse are the most common. These are the most infectious diseases of this type. HIV virus disease that effects the immune system, Herpes virus, a skin condition that causes pimple like painful sores on the skin, Dengue a flu like illness caused by a mosquito bite and can get severe without treatment. Meningitis disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, Flesh-Eating Disease a bacterium that feeds on the skin, Tuberculosis infection that attacks the lungs.<br>Deficiency disease is a condition caused by a lack of nutrient, specific vitamin, mineral or protein. We all live fast pace hectic lives. Always on the move. Many of us skip important meals or wind up eating unhealthy choices. This way of living in the end not only changes our physical appearance it also makes us vulnerable to diseases. When we do not eat the adequate foods, we do not get adequate nutrients either.  This lack of nutrients results in a deficiency disease. Nutrients are essential to life. Our bodies need them in order to function and keep us alive. \u201cThe most widespread nutritional deficiency worldwide is iron deficiency. This is a blood disorder that causes fatigue and weakness. Over 30 percent of the world\u2019s population is anemic\u201d (Healthline). Vitamin A is another deficiency nutrient many people suffer especially woman. Lack of important nutrients can lead to other illness like digestive disorders, depression, constipation, heart problems just to name a few.<br>Hereditary diseases are becoming more common in recent years. A hereditary disease is a condition passed down from a parent to a child during the infant\u2019s development through defective genes. Some of the most common diseases are Down syndrome, a condition that effect physical growth delays and mild intellectual disability. Usher syndrome, a condition that effects hearing and vision. Sickle cell anemia, an anemic condition that prevents adequate oxygen to circulate through the body. Muscular dystrophy, a disease that weakens the primary muscles over time. There is a lot of research to prevent and treat these types of diseases but early diagnosis of the condition is needed in order to assure the best outcome.<br> <br> <br>Physiological diseases is a malfunction of the body or organ causing other types of illness. You might want to go for a morning run and all of a sudden, you are short of breath. You start to cough your chest tightens. Common symptoms of asthma. This is an example of a physiological disease. Asthma is an illness caused by a malfunction of the lungs. Hypertension (high blood pressure) and diabetes (elevated levels of glucose in the blood) are also conditions of malfunctions of the body. These two can lead to other serious conditions that can affect the heart and other body parts. We might be the dominate species, but we have to be aware that the smallest things around us like diseases can make life not so great or even end it if we are not careful.", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T21:27:12Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"M5YKW6fhlss": {"Social Media: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #10": {"channel_id": "UgxvPtt1grPDHNQBRQt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Patrick Burden", "comment_text": "I got that Norm McDonald reference", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T21:27:03Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"M5YKW6fhlss": {"Social Media: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #10": {"channel_id": "UgwT1qPcbS1nFHC5gb54AaABAg", "comment_by": "RubyPower", "comment_text": "God, Jimmy Green really alt to watch this Crash Course series in future!", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T21:26:31Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"M5YKW6fhlss": {"Social Media: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #10": {"channel_id": "Ugxoq-TCFHWkPmX0iSh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Christopher NFP", "comment_text": "Under your definition (someone who tells you there is only one source of truth) islam is an ideology not a religion.<br><br>Do you agree? <br><br>If not why not? <br><br>If you do agree, what conququences should flow from that analyis?", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T21:25:16Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"M5YKW6fhlss": {"Social Media: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #10": {"channel_id": "UgzAylM1_m8LKUTb5qF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "sick000fight", "comment_text": "MOST SOCIAL MEDIA ARE NOT PUBLIC FORUMS", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T21:24:36Z", "likes_count": 4}}}, {"M5YKW6fhlss": {"Social Media: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #10": {"channel_id": "Ugw7ejAZnH9rqr_RkkV4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Sonja Johnson", "comment_text": "As a certain Lizzie once said: &quot;Talking to people on the Internet: not the same as talking to actual people in person.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T21:20:45Z", "likes_count": 10}}}, {"M5YKW6fhlss": {"Social Media: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #10": {"channel_id": "UgwhOSVtBrHcFplLxqJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Allovimo", "comment_text": "Hufflepuff pride. baby.", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T21:19:10Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"M5YKW6fhlss": {"Social Media: Crash Course Navigating Digital Information #10": {"channel_id": "UgwNs2hSgb0J05dZ9ot4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ross Betts", "comment_text": "I swear I&#39;m part Jack Russel, I&#39;m always diving down rabbit holes to find the juiciest details on a subject.

Ever since my brother passed away two years ago, I&#39;ve been depressed and I&#39;ve just been staying at home with my mom. I&#39;m having a lot of trouble finishing my degree (I have just two more courses left). I&#39;ve lost a lot of motivation and will-power to get up and find a job or volunteer or whatever. I just feel like it&#39;s all pointless in the end anyway. I&#39;ve gotten a little fatter, as I&#39;m always snacking at the computer.  I&#39;ve even let my addiction get in the way of my relationship with my fiancee. I spend so much time online, wasting 24 hours everyday, for years... And the thing that just spokes me about all this is that I&#39;m totally self-aware of what I&#39;m doing and it&#39;s negative affects on my personal life, relationships, and health. I know that I&#39;m slowly letting my life go. Yet, I can&#39;t seem to shake this feeling that I always need to be on the Internet. <b>edit</b> no joke, even with this post, I&#39;m constantly checking it again. I&#39;m refreshing the page.
