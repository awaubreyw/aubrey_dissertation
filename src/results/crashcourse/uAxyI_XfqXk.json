The NFL and NBA (and many other sports) have clearly changed their rules since the 1980s to please fans who love offense and increase television ratings and make more money. Many players from other decades would put up huge numbers against the helpless defenses of today. In addition, in the NBA (even up to the 1990s) players would often get called for &quot;palming&quot; if they put their hands to the side of the ball when dribbling. Thus, the crossover dribble which benefits the offense was pretty rare. In addition, the various balls for different sports and technology have improved over the years in sports. In golf, the balls are so round now the players rarely bogey anymore.

In basketball; every player has the chance to score in B-ball, but in football only the QB can throw a touchdown.

Being an analytics nerd i decided to do it based on more accurate measures of value/skill other than points/touchdowns per game as they are not really that useful. For Brady, I used Total QBR. This takes situational data from every play a given QB is involved in and effectively mixes a whole bunch of other advanced stats and spews out a rating between 0 and 100. The mean of TQBR scores is, by definition, 50 and the standard deviation is 12.2. Tom Brady;s best ever TQBR was 87 in 2007. His z-score is (87-50)/3.03 which is roughly 3.03.This is insane. putting him in the theoretical 99.88th percentile, meaning there will probably not be anyone better than him for quite a while to say the least. For LeBron I used Win Shares per 48 minutes (WS/48) which, as the name suggests, estimates how much extra wins a player gave his team for every 48 minutes he was on the floor. LeBron&#39;s best year was in 2012/13 when he had 0.332 WS/48, compared to the league average: 0.071 and standard deviation: 0.154. LeBron&#39;s z-score is (.332-.071)/.154 which works out to 1.63.
