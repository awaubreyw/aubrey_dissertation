Both you and your brother show a marked hostility toward Aristotle, primarily based on outdated notions of race and gender, even though the historical narrative you espouse skews toward an Aristotelian interpretation of history.  As your stated audience is AP high school students, and the commitment of this generation to social justice (however nebulous and subjective that concept is) is well known, it seems to me that you knee-jerk condemn Aristotle, and thus render his work suspect, as a sort of virtue signal to your audience.  In so doing, intentionally or otherwise, you cast doubt on Aristotelian thought through a politically motivated ad hominem attack simply for the sake of reinforcing this generation&#39;s echo chamber.  This only furthers the unfortunate tendency, all to common in these highly charged times, to render judgment on the validity of knowledge based on political affiliations.  This, to me, seems the very antithesis of your stated purpose and, indeed, the whole project of Western education.  I urge you to reconsider your editorial stance, or at least, declare it openly.

You evaluate deductive arguments in a vacuum to determine whether they are valid, and then you can use that instrument to inform whether or not the conclusion can be &quot;known.&quot;  In this case, you do not know whether or not the conclusion is true from the outset, which is why I have a problem with your non sequitur there.  Structurally, the argument is invalid.  It just is.  By definition.  You are, however, giving the impression that it isn&#39;t.  A valid argument has the form of:<br><br>If P, Then Q<br>P<br>Therefore Q<br><br>Whereas your example of a non-sequitur has the form:<br><br>If P, Then Q<br>P<br>Therefore Bear Riding a Hot Dog<br><br>That&#39;s why we identify that as a non-sequitur fallacy.  None of your premises speak to bears, hot dogs, or using them as conveyances.  That&#39;s invalid.  It&#39;s not an example of a valid argument failing to work - it&#39;s a specific example of a very easily identified fallacy of argument.<br><br>A purely deductive philosophic construct would work like...well, it IS mathematics.  Mathematics starts with a set of axiomatic assumptions that you conjecture and fully confess you cannot prove.  In Peano Arithmetic, for instance, we start with the assumptions that A = A and A = B =&gt; B = A, and from there an entire universe of mathematics tumbles into being.  The only root assumptions you have to make are those first two (and yes, I know there are more in real mathematics, but I&#39;m just giving a rough example here).  In that system, you could only possibly have an argument like your last example if your first premise happened to be axiomatic, which is why deductive systems go to great lengths to minimize the number of axiomatic premises they incorporate.<br><br>This just seems like kind of a bad way to start out on this topic.  Logic is actually pretty easy to handle (and as a horrible math and computer science person I find that symbolic logic makes it trivial to understand) if you approach it from the right direction, but this...this seems to be starting off in a somewhat confused place from the offing for the sake of answering some questions from much further down the line, instead of telling the unruly student to just sit on it for a minute and we&#39;ll get there.", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T22:34:25Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "UgytwSy6N78EphbZP-d4AaABAg", "comment_by": "guitar raccoon", "comment_text": "what&#39;s with the furry in the thumbnail lmao.", "comment_date": "2018-05-26T03:44:47Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "UgwJuuyOtNd84fgWTG94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Rob Hand", "comment_text": "Since when are women rational??", "comment_date": "2018-05-23T17:51:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "Ugw0iXEKBlV8RdYYCrh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Juan Gabriel", "comment_text": "K wen mofle", "comment_date": "2018-05-22T17:47:00Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "UgwEvmW0Jtwo9CKyhs94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Rino Levesque Jr", "comment_text": "I suppose i would first ask if a barber ever stops being a man.

This proves a general god, but it doesn&#39;t prove any particular one. Really, the only requirement is that it is supernatural (above the\u00a0natural, meaning not contained within the material universe). This argument could apply to a supernatural pink elephant as much as any traditional god (Yahweh, Allah, Zeus, etc.). So why the Judeo-Christian God, Yahweh? For that, I must turn to the religious text itself. The Bible gives many evidences for it&#39;s validity including scientific facts told long before scientists knew them, fulfilled prophecies, and archaeological/historical evidence for events recorded in Scripture. Though the most foundational event, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, is also one of the most well-documented and easily proven events in ancient history. That alone proves that Jesus Christ was a legitimate sacrifice for the penalty of the sins of mankind, it proves he was God-incarnate.

And in contrast with English, Greek and Latin both &quot;mark&quot; the male as well as the female in their vocabulary: an\u00e9r in Greek and vir in Latin both mean &quot;man=male&quot;; gyn\u00e9 in Greek and femina in Latin both mean &quot;woman&quot;; and \u00e1nthr\u00f4pos in Greek and homo in Latin both mean &quot;man=person.&quot; Aristotle said &quot;\u00e1nthr\u00f4pos,&quot; not &quot;an\u00e9r; and Classics scholars are usually happy to point out the inclusiveness of the former term. Curiously, Old English made distinctions like Greek and Latin. &quot;Man=male&quot; was wer (cognate of Latin vir and Irish fear, preserved in &quot;werewolf&quot;), while &quot;woman&quot; was wif (preserved as &quot;wife&quot; and in &quot;fishwife&quot; and &quot;midwife&quot; -- &quot;woman&quot; itself is from wifman). Old English man was &quot;one,&quot; &quot;someone,&quot; or &quot;man=person&quot; [...] However, \u00e1nthr\u00f4pos, homo, and man are all in the masculine gender. Since Greek and Latin are languages where every noun has gender, like French, Hebrew, etc., there is actually no grammatically &quot;gender neutral&quot; expression possible, as there is in Modern English. So was Aristotle sexist after all? If so, then we are still using a sexist expression in &quot;human beings&quot; because &quot;human&quot; is from homo, which had masculine gender to start with.<br><a href=\"http://www.friesian.com/language.htm\">http://www.friesian.com/language.htm</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/464oxm/crash_course_philosophy_2_philosophical_reasoning/d02jzoc?context=3\">https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/464oxm/crash_course_philosophy_2_philosophical_reasoning/d02jzoc?context=3</a>", "comment_date": "2016-02-17T12:47:26Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "UghWMJMrTeXoFngCoAEC", "comment_by": "J walking", "comment_text": "I saw philosophy and hank, i clicked", "comment_date": "2016-02-17T12:26:18Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "UggyLZCkhRVXEHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "stinknus", "comment_text": "My philosophy is that all philosophies utter crap, ergo I am a crappy philosopher.", "comment_date": "2016-02-17T12:19:30Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "UgiLUSEdWgYfm3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Not A Robot (Maybe)", "comment_text": "i&#39;m just going to throw in a dislike for the gratuitous &quot;SEXIST!!!!&quot; comment.    can we please talk philosophy without polluting it with SJW Virtue Signals against people from 2400 years ago?    you think if Aristotle were around today that he&#39;d be a raging misogynist?  <br><br>Would you be able to comment on the moon landing without calling Neil Armstrong a sexist shitlord because he said &quot;mankind&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-02-17T12:12:09Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "Ugj4I5W7UQq07HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Stevie Sean", "comment_text": "Thanks for the knowledge!", "comment_date": "2016-02-17T12:03:18Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "UggGZavlRTfj4HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "arjen miedema", "comment_text": "What if the barber was a woman :)", "comment_date": "2016-02-17T11:47:18Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "Ugi4vPmj_zGC5XgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Victor Grottil", "comment_text": "Wow, I immediately closed the video when you said that &quot;Man is the rational animal&quot; is sexist.

I would have perhaps presented it a little differently. Ethos doesn&#39;t appeal to emotion, it appeals to meaning and purpose (or teleology in the Greek). Pathos appeals to emotions, which for Aristotle, would have been the base desires.<br><br>The deduction section felt a tad rushed, but that&#39;s understandable. The word &quot;syllogism&quot; should have popped up at least once, though. The &quot;moving from a universal to a particular&quot; was a strange and not entirely accurate way to describe deduction (unless you&#39;re limited to arguments about ontologies). That could lead to confusion in the future, especially if you want to sink your teeth deeper into logic (such as explaining the interesting differences between ancient and modern logic).<br><br>I think I would have started with an episode on Plato and Socrates before Aristotle, but I understand there may not be enough episodes for that. It&#39;s just hard to jump straight to Aristotle without Plato considering that one is just an advancement of the other (don&#39;t be fooled by their apparent differences). If you want to &quot;sell&quot; philosophy to people, understanding how it was born from Socratic thought and why it was put to death is a great springboard. It&#39;s a story that has inspired people to take up the mantle of philosopher for almost 2500 years now.<br><br>I&#39;m interested to see how induction is handled in the next episode, especially considering that this is usually a series (when it&#39;s hosted by Hank) that is deeply in love with the sciences. Induction is really faulty, and the fact that our most effective means of knowing about the world is entirely dependent on it isn&#39;t a very popular notion amongst people who haven&#39;t really studied those issues.

He then argues that deduction can only give you &quot;deductive truths&quot; which are &quot;hard to come by&quot;, and that if you have less than certainty, you&#39;ll need another form of argument. However, the validity of an argument has nothing to do with your credence in the premises. Now, in order for an argument to be (justifiably) convincing, your justification in the premises must be greater than your justification for the negation of the conclusion, but this is a far cry from thinking deduction delivers only certain truths. For instance, consider this argument:<br><br>4  There is evil in the world<br>5  If there is evil in the world, then there is no God<br>6 Therefore, there is no God<br><br>Whether we are more justified in this argument&#39;s premises than we are in the negation of the conclusion is pretty contentious among philosophers. But even many of those who would advocate the above argument would admit they have less than certainty in the premises above. Nevertheless, they would say that we learned something of value from the argument, since though we are not certain of the premises&#39; truth, we are more justified in accepting the premises than in denying the conclusion.<br><br>Furthermore, even if you are not convinced by the argument above, the argument in question should be of philosophical interest to you, since denying the above argument commits you the the falsity of at least one of the premises, which might have been surprising to you before you encountered the argument, and which might have interesting philosophical consequences.", "comment_date": "2016-02-17T00:07:32Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "UggJq6N7hs2pfXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "___", "comment_text": "@CrashCourse to persuade (emotions) is not to convince (logic)", "comment_date": "2016-02-17T00:05:38Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"NKEhdsnKKHs": {"How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2": {"channel_id": "Ugj23QV_HQ6NIHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Holland Cluff", "comment_text": "I love this series already, and I&#39;m happy that Hank is hosting it; I can tell that it will be a massive help to my school&#39;s Philosophy Club this year!
