Though him and his brother for sure recognize the corruption that is part of the modern left wing establishment, they have also been convinced that Donald Trump is the next satan, so they have doubled down on talking points that they now know are political, but still would rather believe than the acknowledge complete corruption of the Democratic Party, and the radical leftism that is fighting for supremacy over the american political system. While many of us have recognized the corruption of the American establishment, and its necessary removal. John Green still believes Trump is some form of Fascist, or step in the direction of Fascism, and its no surprise that Republican Chinese forces get re-visioned into Nationalists; as if they were Nazis, which is a basic leftist talking point about any political opponent. Everyone who isn&#39;t left enough is always a Nazi, or someone who is closer to Nazism than the left. same also goes for racial tension and neocolonialism, it is always the fault of the colonizer that the nation is so corrupt, or experienced a race war post colonization. No responsibility can ever be placed at the feet of the country itself. These talking points are all political in nature, and John Green knows that, but for him he still sees change in the opposite direction as always bad, as always a step towards fascism; every single issue the left has ever taken up has ever been good and there sure isn&#39;t nearly enough corruption and suppression to justify a more radical change against that.", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T03:49:34Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "Ugy4K7DJ_kTVZMcOSu54AaABAg", "comment_by": "unrefusableoffer", "comment_text": "thank you for acknowledging that Indian pakistani rivalry was fueled by Brits to have better control over sub continent.", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T03:42:33Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "UgyYwvmBc-8CpY48XWJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Perry Widhalm", "comment_text": "C&#39;mon ... this is a Leftist narrative of history.

Firstly, using (not even always) violent colonial regimes to explain the fact that many former colonies entered an extremely violent time after gaining independence, because they supposedly have only known violent rule, is just plain stupid. This is  an excuse for nations, who obviously weren&#39;t ready to govern themselves, to engulf themselves in excessive violence. Just admit it, many former colonies were not up to the task of self-governance. An example for this case is Zimbabwe, today Africa&#39;s shithole, while it was its pearl 50 years ago. White only rule was wrong, no doubt about that. But the rapid transitions many countries made from colony to self-governance lead to the rise of military dictatorships and brutal civil wars. <br><br>Secondly, crediting that life expectancy rose dramatically after decolonisation to the gaining of independence by these countries, is a terribly false argument. There are dozens of reasons why life expectancy rose. Meanwhile, this completely disregards the  scientific progress and agricultural revolutions. However, you name decolonisation as a reason for such worldwide progress?! Mind you, developed countries in Europe enjoyed even further rise of life expectancy. <br><br>Kind of disappointed in you, Crash Course.

This episode has clearly tried to centre the experience of the former European colonies, which is admirable. However, in the process I think it has also over-simplified the story to one of &quot;Europe = bad&quot;. For example, former colonies being given loans could be seen as &quot;neo-colonialism&quot;, but it was also a system that benefited both parties. The low wages of immigrants undoubtedly helped receiving countries develop, but those immigrants were also (despite the challenges of racism) able enjoy a higher standard of living. For Nasser&#39;s Egypt, being able to play the West and the USSR off against each other was a boon, enabling the country to fund projects like the Aswan Dam, which would otherwise never have been possible. Increased post-war extraction of oil allowed quality of life to rise across the world (although this would of course lead to environmental consequences). The spread of communist insurgencies across former colonies arguably owed more to Mao&#39;s PR China than it did to the USSR, etc.<br><br>In short, the reality was complicated and involved a huge number of actors trying to make the choices they thought were best for them.

What did happen to those 3 million White Algerians after the war?  Many settled since the early 19th century? \ud83e\udd14 Did Algeria become a happy multicultural country afterwards? Why were so many African states failed states? What was the TRUE legacy of colonialism? Perhaps that the countries that emerged were so ethnically &amp; religiously diverse that they lacked cohesion and identities that European states had. But wait, that really undercuts the progressive philosophy of multiculturalism? The notion that immigration benefited European countries is highly contentious. There was a large manpower shortage after WW2, but migration also leads to a weakening of trade unions and workers&#39; bargaining power. It benefits employers and big business whilst the costs in terms of public services, housing are shouldered by the working class. As usual, this complex subject is reduced to a couple of Enoch Powell quotes and riotous Whites rather than viewing from other points of view, something that John bends over backwards to do in other instances. One other point: migration occurred in the first quarter-century after the WW2, at different times in different European countries e.g. 1947 in the UK, the Gastarbeiter in Germany in the late Fifties and Sixties in Germany ebtc., but this migration stopped in the early Seventies (often of social democratic governments) and remained low for the next quarter-century e.g. until the Mid Nineties.

This happened to more or less  everyone who was using the fact that the west and the east were in a deadlock to try and build something, with only China and India being huge enough to not end up demolished once the west &quot;won&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T22:31:34Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "Ugxj5QVLdygZHQVUVmh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Richard Renes", "comment_text": "Remember, it was the Indonesian expats who brought rock music to the Netherlands (Tielman brothers, Blue DIamonds, Masada)", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T22:05:38Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "Ugy7Ec-sokBQIj5RLoh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "burado", "comment_text": "why not mention middle east?", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T21:09:03Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "UgxYq8p_ryv-uhYOGgN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "ashante", "comment_text": "Sad that I didn&#39;t learn about &quot;The New Scramble for Africa&quot; and it&#39;s lasting impacts until I got to university.", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T20:55:32Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "UgweHEhJJVu4tXb3ptl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Benjamin Wilson", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t wait for perestroika.", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T20:35:34Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "Ugx3vYQ1GBlGDEzb4W94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ena Prokic", "comment_text": "How do you not mention the Non-Aligned Movement?", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T20:14:04Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "Ugx_bXd_Og8RzbTGsqZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ivan Sirko", "comment_text": "You wanted freedom, enjoy your freedom now...", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T19:48:10Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "UgwoVOLRFRptEEJFaGl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Liam Scherl", "comment_text": "&quot;Get rich and help people&quot; - the Green method", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T19:32:53Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "UgzA_D_uOhtEpMfJcYR4AaABAg", "comment_by": "jacob a", "comment_text": "It&#39;s refreshing to watch a video that realizes European history doesn&#39;t end once WWII is over", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T18:40:40Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"FlMKqRCNX9c": {"Decolonization: Crash Course European History #43": {"channel_id": "Ugwt1o5qYgS1TlWwwYN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Adriano Cerqueira", "comment_text": "So, you&#39;re just going to ignore Portugal and not talk about the fall of the fascists regimes in Portugal and in Spain?

I am bit disappointed because it is a far more complex issue than explained, at least from the view of the people at the time.<br><br>For example, the portuguese people were taught by the fascist regime that the colonies, weren&#39;t colonies, they were provinces, like the various regions of Portugal itself, so when they were called (obligated) to go to war, they believed that they were defending their own nation. Salazar convinced everyone that what they were doing was right, and sent thousands of young men to die in a meatgrinder. It was a conflict that could be avoided by diplomacy, thousands of portuguese, guinean, angolan and mozambican lives could have been saved. The Colonial Wars are seen in Portugal as Portugal&#39;s Vietnam, it completely defined the generation that fought in this war. Europe isn&#39;t just France and the UK. <br><br>I also feel that mentioning the problems faced by the europeans living the colonies after their independence could have been importante. Yes, there was imigration, but there also were millions of people returning to Europe, after losing everything they had in africa. These people also suffered discrimination when they arrived in Europe, their supposed homeland, they were basically refugees. But the video decides to go with the black and white thought of &quot;Europe Bad&quot;, by just focusing on the drama of the arriving africans, which i am not disregarding by no means. Although i believe their integration wasn&#39;t as well made as the video makes it out to be.<br><br>Finally, i think that mentioning that there were still fascist regimes in Europe during this time period was important, because in a way they were the reason that some of these wars happened the way they did.<br><br>TL:DR The video is very reductive in the morals of the wars fought, and doesn&#39;t show the drama these events also represented to europeans.

The governments the took over ran most of that stuff into the ground.   Most of these countries have had to rebuild it all, and still haven&#39;t caught up.<br>- Contrast that with other colonies that left peacefully or still technically exist and you can see they aren&#39;t perfect, but the native populations are much much better off (and happier) than the ones who left in rebellion.<br>- The African tribes were absolutely brutal to each other.  Insanely so.  The culture of fighting and war didn&#39;t come from colonization.  (That&#39;s not to excuse the violence of the colonizers, just to say it was far from one sided.)<br>- The most skilled members of decolonized countries often weren&#39;t recognized or even desired by their countries of origin.  In most cases, had they stayed they would have never gotten to the point they were at, nor even come close to the same contribution to the world (or their home countries.)<br>- Anti Immigration - Pretty much every country with a native population has had a similar racist reaction as seen in the 1950&#39;s, when the native population was in control.  You can see it right now in China and most Persian Countries.  It&#39;s really bad in South Africa and Zimbabwe.  Believe it or not western cultures, even back in the 1950s on average treated other races much better.<br>- Manipulation of Borrowed Resources for Dependence is a tactic as old as any warring nation.  It&#39;s happened everywhere unfortunately.  China is the worst at it currently followed by Critical Theory activists who not only work feverishly to do the same thing, it&#39;s taught openly. <br>- Average Life Expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa was 40 in 1953, 50 in 1980s - These are terrible cherry picked facts.  In 1940 the average life expectancy in the WORLD was 47.  In the 1980s (when freed) the average WORLD life expectancy was 63.  Of note, before colonization average life expectancy in that region was below 30.<br>- They (who did attend) attended schools for longer but literacy fell dramatically, malnutrition went down across the board, including western countries.<br>- Most of the rest is fairly accurate, the reasons for the war were horrible on all sides.  Super powers always tried to keep smaller powers smaller.  This is nothing new.  Even tribes in Africa did this.<br><br>Colonization was complex.  It wasn&#39;t great, but some parts were surprisingly good.  <br>Some of the western countries have incredibly &quot;nice&quot; colonization based on terms of the norms of any other invading forces.  The average for good treatment was absolutely higher on AVERAGE for western countries as well.<br>This doesn&#39;t make it all justified, but criticism is often one sided mentioning how horrible the Europeans were, but never mentioning pretty much every section of humanity was worse.  And in some cases a LOT worse.  <br><br>Finally, if you treat colonization as ALL bad, there should be an effort now to stop it from happening NOW.  Because it IS happening now.
