Although some questions remain concerning the effectiveness of the vaccine I think that it together with social distancing and hygiene will give us a chance to eradicate this virus!", "comment_date": "2020-10-19T19:56:06Z", "likes_count": 49}, {"comment_by": "Art Michelstetter", "comment_text": "2020 would require its own series of Crash Course \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-10-19T19:56:06Z", "likes_count": 1073}, {"comment_by": "Some Prsn", "comment_text": "15 Days to Slow the Spread \ud83d\ude44 Everyone seriously needs to calm down it\u2019s been cold in the upper east end of the US for 2 full months now and nothing\u2019s happened.
