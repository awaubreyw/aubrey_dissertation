It can&#39;t be the foreign language, and it can&#39;t be the slow pacing, because I loved In the Mood for Love. Some things I can pick out:<br><br>The first half of the film after the hospital scene was very directionless. There was no major tension and the action there went nowhere. I understand there&#39;s probably some metaphorical subtext to these little disconnected vignettes, but they test my personal patience. The music in this film was similar to how I feel about the film as a whole, maybe it sounds spectacular to someone, but none of the chords or motifs were very interesting to me (probably because they too lack tension). The second half of the film picked things back up with the discovery of the infidelity and Julie&#39;s reaction. The resolution is also quite nice, with Julie returning to the world of music which she had abandoned months ago. <br><br>However, the final scene is completely unnecessary. It reminds me of the finale of Donnie Darko, except where in Darko there was a reason to demonstrate where the characters are without Donnie&#39;s influence, there is no reason to show that, yes, all of the characters are exactly where you&#39;d expect them to be. There&#39;s no surprise, there&#39;s no intrigue, there&#39;s just bland melancholy. <br><br>And that pretty much sums up my views on the film as a whole. Melancholy is a great emotion to play with on film, but it is only effective when there is some sort of underlying tension. When there is little development of plot and the first half of the film wanders from place to place, hardly introducing one character before moving on to the next, the characters make little impact, and any potential sympathy is lost.", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T00:28:10Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"GVNy3x_PwFk": {"Three Colors - Blue: Crash Course Film Criticism #11": {"channel_id": "UgypF-yREgngiDVkUkp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "DuranManX", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t the 3 colors represent the 3 estates", "comment_date": "2018-03-30T23:58:45Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"GVNy3x_PwFk": {"Three Colors - Blue: Crash Course Film Criticism #11": {"channel_id": "UgyhwTg_774UWc9xDet4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Sean Murphy", "comment_text": "It bothers me that the music on-screen doesn&#39;t line up with the music being played.
