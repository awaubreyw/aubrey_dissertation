It&#39;s the focus on what man can achieve if he is okay with being, well, man. This is also echoed in Siduri&#39;s words to Gilgamesh, reminding him of the things that are human: falling in love, laughing, raising a child and living on forever through your work and offspring. <br><br><br>This is the first of your videos that I am watching, and besides for the few points up there, I really enjoyed it!

Mattfeld", "comment_text": "By 1898-1899 Professor Jastrow Morris Junior, of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, had proposed in academic journals of that time that Enkidu (his Eabani) had been recast as Adam and his seducer, Shamhat (his Ukhat), the temple prostitute of Uruk, had been recast as Eve (Scholars circa 1898 knew the Epic of Gilgamesh as the Epic of Izdubar). Morris was a trained reader of Sumerian and Akkadian (Babylonian ) cuneiform. His contemporary, Professor Archibald Henry Sayce, of Oxford University, England, who was also trained in reading Sumerian and Akkadian, argued in 1892 that Adapa of Adapa and the Southwind myth, had been recast as Adam in  the biblical book of Genesis. By 1881 a German Professor, who could read Sumerian and Akkadian, Friedrich Heinrich Delitzsh, of the University of Leipzig, had noted that Sumer&#39;s Edin (the uncultivated wilderness land surrounding Sumerian cities) was probably the pre-biblical source of Genesis&#39; &#39;Eden. I find myself in agreement with all of three of these professors. I have written two books on the subject and they are available ($25.00 each) at <a href=\"http://amazon.com/\">Amazon.com</a>, Walter R. Mattfeld, Eden&#39;s Serpent: Its Mesopotamian Origin (2010) and The Garden of Eden Myth: Its Pre-biblical Origin in Mesopotamian Myths (2010). The Hebrews apparently recast the Mesopotamian myths about events associated with polytheism&#39;s Edin into a monotheistic Eden. Professor George&#39;s hardback 2 volume work on Gilgamesh is expensive, costing almost $1,000.00. His much cheaper paperback version of the Epic can be had for under $20.00 (published by Penquin books in England). George&#39;s two volume work was useful to me in that George&#39;s translation of the Epic revealed that Enkidu meets Shamhat in a wilderness called Edin, at a watering hole frequented by him and his companions, wild bulls and antelope. He is naked like they are, and is accepted as their companion. Shamhat has been brought to Edin&#39;s watering-hole (note George renders edin in his paperback book by Penquin publishers as &quot;wilderness&quot; or &quot;field&quot;) to replace Enkidu&#39;s animal companions with herself as his new companion. She is instructed by the hunter to convince Enkidu to leave Edin (Edin is a Sumerian logogram substitute for Akkadian Seri/seru, &quot;wilderness&quot; or &quot;field&quot; according to Professor George) and take up residence in Uruk (rendered in Akkadian cuneiform by the Sumerian logogram Unug). She succeeds. Both have sex with each other for several days, when he attempts to rejoin his animal companions they flee from him, rejecting him, he thereupon returns to Shamhat who praises him for returning to her. He now accepts her as his new companion. She convinces him to leave Edin/Seru. Before leaving they clothe their nakedness with her clothes. In route to Uruk (Unug) they encounter a shepherd&#39;s camp. They offer him bread and beer. He refuses to consume these items for he knows only to eat grass and drink water with his animal companions in Edin. Shamhat, realizing the problem, intercedes and urges him to consume these products and he obeys her. Edin&#39;s shepherds whereupon announce Enkidu is no longer a naked wild animal, he has become like a god, consuming food set aside for the gods, bread and beer, they give him a fine robe fit for a king to wear, to cover his nakedness, the woman&#39;s garb not being suitable for a man to wear.  The bread and beer Enkidu refused to consume became in Genesis Adam&#39;s fruit of death from Eden&#39;s tree. Shamhat&#39;s being brought to Edin by the hunter to ensnare Enkidu and remove him from Edin and its animals, was recast as God bringing Eve to Adam as a more fit companion than Eden&#39;s beasts. The hunter brought Shamhat to Edin&#39;s watering hole to remove Enkidu who was setting free Edin&#39;s wild animals from the hunter&#39;s traps.
