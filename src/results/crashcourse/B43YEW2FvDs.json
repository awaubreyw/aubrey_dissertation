You know the part where the random majority doesnt matter but is instead organized in ethnic provinces who are in favor of Mr./Mrs. Red or Mr./Mrs. Blue to be president or just to be part of the legislative body. This way provinces wont get ignored instead of only focusing development in the capital city. Development needs to be spread out. I also want to strip away the rights to vote of the population involved in tax evasion, squatters and anyone who breaks the law.<br>Our government is so weak that it cant even take initiative. People could stop paying taxes or,  build and reside on abandoned railway stations without paying a single tax in their life. This way we could truly achieved the so called intellectual democracy socrates once described.<br>I also want the government to be able the regulate media as it is a major part of our lives.... not completely but just a corporation between the two bodies. I wanna avoid the same biased informarion  liberals show on television. It must be law that in election day the media must be forced to rigorously study the backgrounds of each candidates, and if the one of the election candidates see&#39;s that some information about them are lacking or is half told, that may damaged the fairness of the election, he may report this error and failure to comply by the media will result in some sort of punishment. In this method the citizens can rationaly think observed the stature of the man and make an intellectual decision in voting.

There are basic things we all can almost unanimously agree upon that are needed in order to maximize individual economic potential  (eg food, health, education). The government is best placed to provide for these needs  and can provide for them in a cost effective manner, because human needs are generally not diverse whereas human desires/preferences are. However past the point of providing this foundation for human thriving, the market and individuals that constitute it are best suited to catering for human desires and provide a better system for maximising economic productivity.", "comment_date": "2016-11-05T13:30:37Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "UghGqjt0XZZ0s3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Bulls on Parade", "comment_text": "the communism talks about the abolition of the private property IN THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION, not all the private property!", "comment_date": "2016-11-05T08:02:02Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "Ugh9VxZDwOTyJHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "El Psy", "comment_text": "I kinda like these two.

However, all else is beyond the legitimate role of government. Education, infrastructure, etc. should be left to a free market. Education should be chosen by individuals based on the educational institution&#39;s quality and price. Competition between different providers leads to lower prices and higher quality. Government schools are notoriously poor quality and extremely inefficient. Infrastructure is already built by private businesses. The government just acts as a middle-man. We should remove the middle-man and allow infrastructure to be paid for by those who use it. For example, businesses need customers to be able to get to their locations. They can pay for the infrastructure around those physical locations. There are also private roads, tolls, and plenty of other private options to pay for infrastructure. And there should be no regulation of production. Workers are paid what they are worth to the business. If they want more they can ask for a raise, gain experience/education to be worth more, or work elsewhere. If they don&#39;t like the working conditions, they can work elsewhere. Regarding environmental issues, government should again not be involved. If a business is harming your person/property, then you may use the justice system to seek legal action against them. You can also boycott a business that behaves in a way you don&#39;t like and you can encourage others to do the same.\u00a0Also, the government shouldn&#39;t provide subsidies to anyone. Subsidizing clean energy has lead to a massive waste of billions as these businesses have failed due to no demand. The government shouldn&#39;t be stealing from some (through taxes) to give to others (through social welfare). People should be free to succeed or fail on their own without government support. If you do truly need a little extra help to pick yourself up out of poverty, then there are voluntary organizations where you can seek such help. There should be no government safety net. Voluntary assistance from organizations like charities is fine, and far more efficient and effective at reducing poverty The government has spent billions on fighting a war on poverty and poverty has only increased.

From all of the countries I have lived in, not a single one of them has been more of a FREE MARKET ECONOMY than China; No public funds for assistance, no socialised housing. Socially, the government is bordering on dictatorship, but economically, people are wheeling-and-dealing constantly, with little regulation. We are largely misinformed in the West about how China is run, and I hope this comment helps.<br><br>For reference, I have lived in the following countries as a comparison:<br><br>China (Shanghai, Guangzhou)<br>Hong Kong<br>Canada (Edmonton)<br>United States (Los Angeles)<br>United Kingdom (London, Northampton, Exeter)<br>Italy (Milan)<br>South Korea (Seoul)<br>Singapore<br>Thailand (Bangkok)<br>France (Paris)<br><br>Now let me re-iterate: Not a single country I&#39;ve listed has been more of a FREE MARKET ECONOMY than China has been. Sure, they have governmental businesses which operate large corporations, such as the tobacco industry, but in general, no place I&#39;ve lived in has had more people in business for themselves, pushing to make an extra dollar, close an extra sale, or gain a higher margin than China. They&#39;re fighting for every Yuan, and it&#39;s clearly because they have no safety net. There&#39;s far less regulation when it comes to pollution, and workplace standards.<br><br>From there, let me just say: IT&#39;S HORRIBLE!<br>They&#39;re obsessed with money, more than anywhere else I&#39;ve lived. If they get sick, and can&#39;t pay for the hospital, they&#39;re fucked. If they lose their job and can&#39;t pay the rent? They&#39;re fucked. They are controlled by what they can say, do, watch, hear, and read by their glourious government which is keeping them stupid to ensure they continue to work as slaves and hand over their money in the form of taxes, but there&#39;s clearly a disconnect between what the Government say they&#39;re doing, and what they&#39;re actually doing. The environment is absolutely ruined, the air is poison, the ground water is undrinkable, and that&#39;s directly a result of the obsession over growth due to the free market economy, and people scrambling after a starvation crisis which killed off 50 million Chinese people (thanks, Mao).<br><br>This hellhole is worse than the propaganda surrounding the &quot;Red&quot; countries which Americans are so obsessed with hating (still?).<br><br>Out of the places, I&#39;ve lived, the best places to live for normal every-day people, to ensure a high level of education, good healthcare, proper wages, and a good quality of life overall?<br>Canada and the United Kingdom.. Both are Democratic Socialist.<br><br>Singapore was quite nice as well, but that has to do with a tiny tiny tiny area of regulation, tiny population, and a great position on the globe to be a trade hub. Hong Kong could fall into that as well.<br><br>The question asked in this video was: Should the people who do things to harm themselves (such as gambling or smoking) be helped by the Governmental safety net?<br>Yes. They should. Many smokers were alive during a time in which the government allowed advertisements to be aired which claim smoking is GOOD FOR YOU. Those people are just facing the reality of that now. Gambling is a disorder, and mental weakness which should be treated the same way alcoholism should be treated; with respect and a plan to get the people out of the obsession.<br><br>The first step is prevention, through education, and the more educated a population is, the less it smokes and gambles. <br><br>Austerity, as promoted by many governments currently (such as, sadly, the UK) is a farce to cut the social benefits currently offered from the working and middle class and filter them into buying weapons, padding the pockets of the politician&#39;s Eaton buddies, and spying on their own citizens to be able to control them. How do we get higher quality educations? By encouraging the people who might decide to be Doctors and Engineers to consider working as a teacher, through high wages, and good working environments. I&#39;m certain every country has enough bombs and drones to last through the entire of World War III once it comes along, and still have some left over for when intelligent lifeforms climb out of the slime after another few hundred million years... so why are we cutting school funding to pay for more of those things? Why are we cutting benefits for Pensioners, and cancelling the pension program all together for those currently under 40, in order to pay for things like the GCHQ spy program (or the NSA in the USA)? Because those things help the people in control stay in control, and pad the pockets of their buddies (or themselves, via lobbyists).<br><br>Just my 2 cents.", "comment_date": "2016-05-19T08:52:55Z", "likes_count": 103}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "Ugg1-1GwtpQsingCoAEC", "comment_by": "Sonny Zheng", "comment_text": "all hail AI overload when singularity arrives!!", "comment_date": "2016-05-18T16:35:17Z", "likes_count": 10}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "Ughfpq_ejZVrS3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "JayyCeee", "comment_text": "what does dftba mean?", "comment_date": "2016-05-17T20:09:54Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "Ugip9SZrZT5FoXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Mink", "comment_text": "My teacher is showing us this.", "comment_date": "2016-05-14T01:38:34Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "UgiERNuOh5CjvHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "buckeyebickle", "comment_text": "AP test tomorrow <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23RIP\">#RIP</a>", "comment_date": "2016-05-11T02:41:31Z", "likes_count": 4}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "UgjRCEFn2BnzjXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Padraig Moloney", "comment_text": "We don&#39;t think much about who produced the car?, that is so inaccurate that it call&#39;s into question your ability to perceive reality correctly.

Also poverty causes loss of potential: talented people who struggle in poverty usually can&#39;t use their talents and so the whole society loses that talent. Also income inequality has been linked with increased crime. And the lack of social safety net also discourages risk taking which can also cause stagnation if people don&#39;t want to try new things.

Then you sell a good phone for 600 dollars, or a crappy for 400, then good phones win out. But then what about buyers? Only so many people will buy good phones, and so many people will buy crap phones. What if, per unit of time used before, you could sell 3 crappy phones, or one good phone, same prices as earlier. Making crappy phones has just become the more lucrative option, but you only need to make as many as you can sell. So you can make your three crappy phones, plus one good one, and maybe a good tablet, all in the time it takes to sell those things, and that will turn the beat profit for your only resource, money.

You were going strong until you started saying that we need government to pave roads, build bridges, provide law enforcement.

Private companies already do the work of building the roads and bridges, and while law enforcement is monopolized by the government, a free market solution would be a lot like security guards and private detectives.

Laws are simply opinions at the point of a gun. Before we had states and governments we had something akin to Common Law which consisted of rules like: don&#39;t murder, don&#39;t steal, don&#39;t rape, etc. In a free society we&#39;d all have social norms (common law) that we&#39;d all agree to live by or risk being ostracized. If you don&#39;t like the way things are done in one community you can easily pickup and move to another that better suited your viewpoint.

This is important as free competition is NOT an essential element of capitalism. This comes into play with frequent government intervention into a capitalist market in order to enforce competition.

Eg the USA spends more in taxes per person for healthcare than the UK (with its universal, free at point of use healthcare system) and that cost from taxes gets most US citizens nothing. The rest is made up by private spending in the USA (very little in the UK) to bring the cost from the USA&#39;s GDP to double what the UK does and for the same or worse outcomes in most cases.\u00a0<br><br>So what I would have liked is a more nuanced approach. Some effort to separate out when the &#39;market&#39; is bad. This is left down to personal preference, and in some cases it will be but there must be some studies able to objectively find sectors where the &#39;free hand of the market&#39; really fails. I think this is the case for healthcare almost certainly. What I really want to know is, what is the opportunity cost to state-run healthcare like in the UK or Canada as I cannot see one. Lower taxes, a lot less private spending, potentially improved health outcomes and less time wasted dealing with bureaucrats.\u00a0<br><br>(I&#39;m from the UK but been living in the USA for over a year and find the healthcare system far more wasteful and time consuming that in the UK for no benefits at all, just pain, hassle and thinking about money which is a really strange concept to me).", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T20:23:05Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "UghxmIz3xpzeRngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jan Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski", "comment_text": "nothing about work supply and demand... dislike", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T20:05:25Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "UggRnVS49AeUYHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Larry F", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t see how you can talk about consumer demand without talking about the advertising industry which largely drives consumer demand in the US.", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T19:18:10Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "Ugg1B-EKdSlSE3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Robert A Dorrough", "comment_text": "Hate admitting economists ever being right about anything, but Adrienne was correct: the green shirt better brought out the green color of her hair.

However I think that some points were glossed over a bit too quickly.

I think this is a bit misleading since the free market will provide merit goods, but it will not be the ideal amount. One example is education. Market forces will not provide enough education, but it will still provide some of it (such as private universities).<br><br>Another point is Denmark.

Just to keep things simple, Denmark for instance is very socialist when it comes to the video&#39;s question number 3, who gets the resources with it&#39;s extensive transfer payments. However, Denmark is notably much more free market when it comes to who produces goods and how they produce them. China actually is still rather socialist when it comes to production and how production is done (government owned companies are still a very large, though decreasing, sector of the economy), but fairly laissez-faire when it comes to who gets resources (thus China&#39;s high and growing inequality).<br><br>In addition, there are different ways for governments to control the means of production that lead to different outcomes. Both France and Egypt tend to intervene fairly frequently in how businesses are run. However in France those interventions tend to be less biased in favor of particular companies, more open to international competition, and not focused on ensuring particular individuals take over the company. In Egypt, these regulations tend to be a way for the government to reward cronies and punish dissenters. As such France is still able to maintain a rich first world economy (if less rich than less business-operations-intervening countries like Switzerland, Canada, or the United States) while Egpyt is mired in economic stagnation and poverty.<br><br>To the extent that there seems to be consensus among economists in the modern world, most agree that having primarily free market attitudes towards who produces most goods and services is good, heavy debate exists on the extent of how much planing should go into how goods and services are produced though with some tendency to say at least partially free market methods are good, and more debate surrounds the question of how planned versus free market the final distribution good and services is, though most are OK with at least some intervention.<br><br>I know that it&#39;s a 10 minute video that&#39;s just an introduction and as such it&#39;s rather good. But I just wanted to add on top of that to show just how complex real world economic systems can be. A nation that nationalizes an industry may not provide universal health care. A country that has no minimum wage can still have a generous basic income and etc. The first step to understanding the world complexly in economics is to understand that just because political groups in a country tend towards supporting a given set of policies does not mean that those policies necessarily must all go together.", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T01:37:37Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "UgiJGkSnsEO0uXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Who is John Galt?", "comment_text": "Boyoyoyoyoing, my Economy is rising", "comment_date": "2015-07-31T01:31:11Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"B43YEW2FvDs": {"Economic Systems and Macroeconomics: Crash Course Economics #3": {"channel_id": "UgixPsaBWtf3R3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Lex Lindfield", "comment_text": "That thing in the background (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B43YEW2FvDs&amp;t=5m38s\">5:38</a>) of the wall street bull attacking the bear is awesome.
