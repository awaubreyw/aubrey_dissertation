The study of society ? If you want to study society as sociologist then you need to see society through sociological perspective . Sociological perspective consists of seeing general in particular and strange in familiar . General in particular means what you are doing will be as a recurrent pattern present in society . Example : You are no marrying , then sociolgist we see it as a general trend in society to no marry and if you are listening to a music , sociologist will get to know about your age , region , eductaion . It just means tumhare habits se society ko genralize kar paa rhe hae . ANd other one strange in familiar is like see all things that happens to you as if it is happening for first time and strange to you . then you wil able to see trends and recurring patterns .<br>4.

I have no objective awnser, but as with morality, there is a grey area and black area (and white), then there is also another area. The place where it does not really matters. We could be living in a Matrix and this could be a simulation and non of our friends are &quot;real&quot;. <br>When it comes to reality. If the cave that we have left feels as real as the real world, then how can we know that the real world is just another cave? [Platos Aligory of the Cave]. In the end it does not really matter, it feels real and although the only thing that we can ever know, is that we exist. The fact that it feels real, forces us to act as if it where real. To put it bluntly. You cannot go around and killing people or doing whatever you want to do (not implying that you want to kill people) because these actions have consequensens, and you may dislike them. <br><br>Now, as previously mentioned. There is a black area, where things are not okey. What use is it, if I have 5 possibilities and  there is no certain way of knowing or falsify any possiblity. <br><br>This next part is regarding morality, Science and my personal feelings towards both. I se Science as a source of information that aplies to the &quot;real&quot; world. Science displays the relationship of cause and effect, it must be falsifiable and documented. If Science is not capable of doing those things, then it is of no use, because the accuracy of such information cannot be tested. Morality is hard, and Science should not be concerned with it, because it would not be what Science is about. I am an determinist, who finds morality absolute and non existant. Call it faith, but what happend, could not have happened any other way, to me free will is an illusion. That being said, I still have my conscience and try to do what I think is moral. At the end of the day, determinism can help people to se things more clearly and maybe be calm, when terrible things happen, to detach yourself, without being apathetic. <br><br>Now, I still have my illusion, and because they are always going to be there. I might aswell act as if they where real. <br><br>I want to give you a piece of wisdom and maybe it can help you.

Sociology is like the big umbrella for most studies, and in some ways it catches elements of each social science, but it also gets at behavior, and motivations behind that behavior in a broader manner that some social sciences cannot. Briefly, Sociology is the study of human behavior as it is influenced by (mostly) external environmental (natural and constructed) factors. Psychology is also the study of human behavior, but with a heavier focus (though not exclusively) on individual human behavior as influenced by internal factors. Economics is an examination of individual or societal behavior in relation to currency and goods. Cultural anthropology is the study of what the different cultures or societies actually are, while genetic anthropology includes an analysis of human migration and genetic connection between societies. History is the study of past human behavior from a particular societal perspective. Religion (as a social science) is the study of human responses to unexplained phenomenon and attempts to make sense of the world through non-scientific means as they developed historically. Political science is the study of specific political actions, their development and current implementation. These lines are all fluid, but the general idea is that social sciences attempt to examine societal factors and the influence these factors have or have had upon human behavior and that same society.", "comment_date": "2017-03-15T19:39:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"YnCJU6PaCio": {"What Is Sociology?: Crash Course Sociology #1": {"channel_id": "UgjSl6iy3ZXcl3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "mkb", "comment_text": "Sociology is a science?

Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to\u00a0social policy\u00a0and\u00a0welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the\u00a0micro-sociology\u00a0level of individual\u00a0agency\u00a0and interaction to the\u00a0macro\u00a0level of systems and the\u00a0social structure.[8]<br><br>The traditional focuses of sociology include\u00a0social stratification,\u00a0social class,\u00a0social mobility,\u00a0religion,\u00a0secularization,\u00a0law,\u00a0sexuality\u00a0and\u00a0deviance. As all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between\u00a0social structure and individual agency, sociology has gradually expanded its focus to further subjects, such as\u00a0health,\u00a0medical,\u00a0military\u00a0and\u00a0penalinstitutions,\u00a0the Internet,\u00a0education,\u00a0social capital\u00a0and the role of social activity in the development of\u00a0scientific knowledge.<br><br>The range of social scientific methods has also expanded.\u00a0Social researchers\u00a0draw upon a variety of\u00a0qualitative\u00a0and\u00a0quantitative\u00a0techniques.

As this video primarily enforces the ideas that sociology is scientific and the idea that the knowledge acquired from it may be used to better society, I think this may be the right place to voice this concern.<br>The idea that sociological knowledge can and should be used to better society is a strange one. Because it is necessarily false. I am tempted to shout freedom at the top of my lungs here (or in all caps), but the point comes across when one critically scrutinizes the use of language used, both in this video and in sociology papers in general. Let&#39;s take an example: the freedom to express affection in public for heterosexual desire vs homosexual desire. This is a subject that is in the spotlight in Norway, where a person, among other reasons, sees a problem with polls of people feeling disgusted at public displays of homosexual affection.<br>This, despite our gut feelings to the contrary, is not an inhibition of the liberties of gay people. The video, to show the relevance of my little digression, implies a similar flaw in sociological reasoning in general: when you go from the observation (gay people show less affection in public) to the theory (gay people are prevented from showing affection by their social location) you invariably miss out on the complexity and the principle. It might be said that actually the sociological theory is about WHY homosexual affection is limited by social location, but then you have simply said &quot;I am not going to explain my first step, it makes sense to me&quot;.<br>This is a recurring problem in sociology. The observations that sociology makes are generalized in such a way that it will naturally give rise to theories that have little to no bearing on reality. The very subtle shift from &quot;X is happening&quot; to &quot;Y is happening&quot; seems intuitive, but is not justified. I would like to see this series make a genuine effort to demonstrate these leaps in logic, and perhaps it soften my harsh opinions of sociology.<br>Other than, there were a few quibbles which continue on the whole idea of phrasing something technically correct vs self-explained (such as the distinction between marginalized groups and power), but these are on the whole lesser.
