August had B\u00f6ttger locked up in the castle of Mei\u00dfen for long enough that he figured out how to make porcellain instead, which was probably even more valuable at the time. Because only the Chinese knew how to make it prior to that, they kept it a well guarded secret and importing it to Europe cost a fortune. <br>If you&#39;ve ever been to the region (Mei\u00dfen, Dresden etc.), porcellain is still a huge part of its history and identity. Its invention and production was basically the foundation of Saxony&#39;s wealth in the early modern era and also paid for all the nice palaces and cathedrals in Dresden.
