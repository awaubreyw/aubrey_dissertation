You are insightful and lucid. Since sociology seems to be a relatively new academic discipline when compared with something like physics or maths,  and contains so many different innterrelated areas of research. One in particular that comes to mind that may not have much research involvement, is that of the key features of a post-scarcity society.  Many questions can be asked if we employ what is known as systems theory (developed in the late 60s) coupled with and abundance of energy (or power) and other renewable resources such as food etc, and applying this to society &#39;s structures directly.  What kind of economic mode would exist? Would there be lower levels of mental illness? With such an abundance of energy, what kinds of projects are possible that couldn&#39;t be done under capitalism? If this kind of post-scarcity society is viable, what values would most likely prevail?

Also, our bodies, minds and behaviors were shaped by natural selection, to a world similar to that of our ancestors 50 thousand years ago. Without these assumptions, we have no foundations on which we can build sociology. The same for any other science. Biology find its foundations in chemistry. Beyond this point it is not a problem for biology anymore, but without these molecular foundations, biology would be floating on on quicksand, without a ground to build their theories. The same to sociology. If it does not find its foundations on Darwinian evolution, and also on psychology and neuroscience, it will be hard to evolve and change the world.

I think Max Weber said that, because he was dealing with symbolism and mental stuff, sociology could not be unified with biology. This is not science, it is philosophy.", "comment_date": "2018-07-03T05:39:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anibal Jesus Delgadillo", "comment_text": "Interesting how conflict theory was broken up into sub-divisions.\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2018-07-03T04:46:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raiseflag Surrender", "comment_text": "There are following macro-sociological paradigms (in the order of chronological appearance):<br>1) Structural functionalism, a paradigm that divides society into social institutes which are a set of norms defining social interactions. Norms control the behaviour of human individuals and individuals themselves have two natures inside them (personal nature and social nature, the second one is always defeating and engulfing the first one). Therefore societal changes happen because the functions of some social institutes begin to fail to satisfy the needs of society. Structural functionalism believes in determinism, or that society through the net of social institutes manipulates and controls individuals and personal freedom is an illusion of ignorance.<br>2) Marxism. Marxism is a paradigm which believes any society to be an ever-moving historical organism of two levels (the basis and the superstructure). The basis contains the level of technological and scientific development (means of production) and the interaction between large groups of people (classes). Classes are constantly in a struggle or conflict and the struggle of classes result in a sort of stability, a set of mutual norms that helps different people to coexist without killing each other. The superstructure is established upon the basis like the building&#39;s roof is based upon the foundation ot the building. The superstructure contains cultural, social, juridical and economic life of the society. The basis+the superstructure are called formation. The formations emerge, develop and die during historical development of humankind. There are 6 formations in marxism - primitive-communal formation, &#39;asiatic&#39;(or state-based) formation, slave-owning formation, feudal formation, capitalist formation and communist formation. Each formation has its own peculiar types of culture. economics, class struggle and etc. The periods of domination of each formation in history last for centuries and even thousands of years. Is there a place for human freedom in marxism? There is and isn&#39;t at the same time. An individual can&#39;t be free from the laws of historical development (marxist call &#39;laws&#39; all theory I described above) but he or she can be perfectly free to choose any side of the class struggle. So there is no major freedom of will (in the sense that humans do not control the major outcome of the class struggle or the future of the society as a whole) but there is minor freedom of choice (one can embrace of reject marxism, one can embrace or reject the laws of societal development and thus to hasten or postpone the coming of the next formation).<br>3) Weberian sociology or comprehensive sociology. Max Weber believed the society to be the aggregation of individuals. Each individual has its goals and participates in four kinds of social interactions (sorry I don&#39;t know their proper scientific names in English so I will name them myself): ritualistic or traditional interaction, affective or emotional interaction, rational goal interaction and rational value interaction. Each kind of social interaction changes the structure of society creating tendencies and values which emerge and disappear in time. So for Max Weber there are no social laws, any such laws are fictional because human freedom is real (freedom of will and freedom of choice). <br>4) Conflict theory, or &#39;conflictology&#39; (in some languages) is a marxism-based paradigm which also believes society to be ever-developing organism but differs greatly from marxism in the views upon its structure. Conflict theorists think that they is no strict division between basis and superstructure and that technological development ot the industrial society sets a frame of interpersonal and intergroup conflicts which are the result of human need of domination and the human craving towards appreciation. Class structure does not cause (or so conflict theorists believe) the conflict but provides the frame for it. Thus both the freedom of will and the freedom of choice are present here but the freedom of will has its limits (set by tech-development and the class structure) but the freedom of choice has no limit.", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T19:48:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joice Aguiar", "comment_text": "What does &quot;doesn&#39;t equal twenty cents&quot; means?", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T12:16:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "somy smy", "comment_text": "But wait a second, aren&#39;t there 4 major paradigms in sociololgy.

There is a tendency to blend structuralism with functionalism, perhaps because Weber&#39;s writings are insightful but tedious and Durkheim&#39;s focus on very ethereal matters such as the nature of faith, totems, and collective consciousness, or on more theoretical concepts, such as &#39;what function does this idea serve in society.&#39; While Weber was concerned with how people act and interact, on the basis of class, status, and party, or how power is organized in society.

What you aren&#39;t doing is taking into account the plethora of factors (human and environmental)\u00a0that go into it.\u00a0The contention is that typically in a hard science when you are testing a hypothesis you control or are aware of the variables whereas is sociology you cannot do anything more than generalize.

What people may not realize is that while it is true sociology does not operate like physics it is not for lack of trying.  When Comte first coined the term sociology in 1838 he originally wanted to call the discipline &quot;social physics&quot; which for him meant that the social world was believed to behave according to scientifically discernable natural laws.  He wanted sociology to mirror the natural sciences as closely as possible.  <br><br>However, after Comte, some of the later founders of sociology like Durkheim and Weber recognized that the social world does not operate according to universal principles that are true for all times and places.  Culture changes.  Social institutions change.  Individuals make choices that are influenced by a variety of social forces and norms, but our behavior is not robotically determined by one social force or another.  Human society is constantly changing and is simply too complex to come up with universal laws in the same way a discipline like physics determines its laws of motion.  <br><br>Despite the complexity, sociologists still try to produce knowledge about society using the best methods and theories available to them.  Most of the time, sociologists use rigorous quantitative data collection and statistical methods to produce knowledge about the social world.  If this is still not good enough to be called &quot;science&quot; then it seems to me that we would have to give up on making any scientific knowledge claims about the social world.", "comment_date": "2017-03-20T23:14:18Z", "likes_count": 88}, {"comment_by": "Vlogs Of Knowledge", "comment_text": "Hey guys!
