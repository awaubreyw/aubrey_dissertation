There are no other animals on this planet that are capable of all of these things in the same way a human being is. Suffering requires a conscious perceiver to be defined as suffering, not a functional reaction to a given input in the brain of an animal. For example, When you have surgery and the doctor cuts you open while you&#39;re unconscious, the pain neurons and receptors are still firing in the same functional way they do while you&#39;re conscious and in the same way an animal&#39;s would.

There are many examples of how human consumption of animals has had a morally positive impact in some form. First, let&#39;s talk about livestock. Animals such as cows and sheep are domesticated and would not likely survive (and definitely not survive at their current numbers) without human protection. These animals only are protected by humans because of their use to us, they are able to pass their genes onto their offspring without worry about their survival, which is an affordance most wild animals do not have. In this, human cultivation of livestock could be considered a mutually beneficial contract so long as the animals are treated humanly throughout their existence. What I am implying here is that while the consumption of animal products is not necessarily wrong, our current methods of mass-producing them are inexcusable. The second example I would like to bring up is animals such as deer, where humans have removed all of their natural predators and our hunting of them only serves to maintain balance in an ecosystem that we have a duty to maintain since we were the ones who sent it into imbalance into the first place.<br>Those are my two main arguments, I would love to hear any issues with them since I haven&#39;t found a good place to voice them and so they are likely somewhat flawed.", "comment_date": "2020-05-01T01:04:23Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgzwesPo_X7wOgvVRlh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "kimh samh", "comment_text": "Does anyone realize that if you are christian, catholic or any other bible-based religions you can&#39;t be against eating animals?

For example, would it be just as wrong to kill a cockroach as a dog? Or would it be wrong to set a trap for a rat that was tearing apart your house? If animals now have inherent value, then should they be weighted differently by animal? These are all important questions that weren&#39;t addressed, only questions used to tear down meat-eating arguments were addressed.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t believe that any animal has inherent value except for maybe some highly intelligent species of primates. Animals are simply too dumb and too different from that of a human for us to say that their suffering is just as bad or should be avoided. None of us will ever understand what an animal&#39;s thoughts truly are because their brains are fundamentally different. From an objective standpoint as well, most animals are pretty useless, will never create anything, and will never have an abstract thought. In addition, if we were to follow down the path that all animal suffering should be avoided if necessary, then it just spirals down an infinite path in which no one can harm any living creature. No killing insects or pests anymore. Even plants can recognize damage to themselves and respond accordingly, similar to pain.

Eventually an employee is going to have to put more drinks into the back of the vending machine to replace them.

In a world where everybody ate beef, farmers would raise a lot of cows. In a world where everybody were vegetarian, farmers wouldn&#39;t raise cows (or maybe they would just raise them for leather or something? anyway, it would be a lot fewer cows), because of the laws of supply and demand.

My Reason for this? The same reason I don&#39;t butt in line, or why I say please or thank you. Social Convention.<br><br> A combination of two significant factors contribute to my declaration of eating pets as unethical. One factor is a relational factor and the other are social factors. Social factors contributing to the unethical idea of eating pets are completely reinforced by social convention. Although it is not illegal to eat the meat from our pets, conventions within our society would suggest it to be morally wrong. In Canada, cats and dogs are the most commonly kept animals as pets. Approximately thirty five percent of Canadian households in 2011 own a dog and nearly thirty eight percent of households own a cat (Canadian Veterinary Medical Association, 2011). Relationships formed with these common pets lay the framework of social norms on how humans treat every pet regardless of species. Dogs have been thought to be domesticated for nearly 32,000 years (PHYS, 2017) and cats 10,000 years (TheNest, 2017). Given this information we can see how societal factors regarding treatment of pets and the very definition of what a pet is, have been developed over the last 32,000 years. For instance, societal convention has lead us to the idea that it is commonplace to consider our pets a member of our family and not just an animal. Once accepted into the family unit, one considers the animals interests to be equal to those of which the other family members have. Peter Singer, an Australian moral philosopher and prominent voice in animal rights, best illustrates animal interest equality in a line from his book Animal Liberation (1975) saying \u201cThe basic principle of equality does not require equal or identical treatment; it requires equal consideration\u201d. Surely one does not treat their loved ones the same as a cat or dog. We do not command our kids and wives to use the backyard as a bathroom, we cannot command our siblings to fetch or roll over but, the consideration we have for the interests are equal. One feeds and houses their pet as a parent would their child, in most cases of medical distress our pets are rushed to the doctor as we would for a human loved one. Considering these points, it would be preposterous to eat a member of the family thus giving a clear concrete answer to the question: under which circumstances, if any, is it wrong to eat animals?

It would explain why we continue to eat meat despite being able to live with out it, since we feel no emotional compulsion to stop, but it would also explain why we feel grief when certain animals die and why we don\u2019t when others pass as well. The same goes for humans. We hear about a random person dying across the ocean- so what? We don\u2019t know them, we never have and never will, why should their death impact us?

I see the moral between human and other species in a contractarianism manner.

With farm animals, the contract is a simple exchange, humans raise them, breed them then kill them and take their stuff as paybacks. It might seem like an &#39;unfair&#39; contract but it is the currently the contract. That also means that it is currently the right thing to do, although a shift in the future can happen.

This is why I oppose the killing and eating of work and companion animals such as cats, dogs, horses and others because socialisation and bonding are part of the contract, thus killing them becomes much more morally questionable. This immorality is agreed upon by a lot of people, even if they don&#39;t necessarily think in similar terms. <br><br>As for wild animals, the contract we have with them is less obvious; but I believe the recently established contract is just not to disturb them too much, as we have learnt that a decreased biodiversity sucks.

Lions, Tigers and bears also eat meat. Eating meat started off as the best way to grow big and strong, then became a market to cater to and then turned into an industry.Its a taste preference and a luxury but more importantly, its(in many ways) a staple diet passed on from generation to generation. <br><br>The way animals are treated (locked in cages,  with no space to move) is the fault of capitalism. Farming, however is a result of specialization. It is one of the few examples as to why we are a civilization in the first place. We manipulate the world around us to gather the resources we need so we can further advance our lifestyle. That being said, as we grow to be more intelligent we should learn to be aware of the extremes.<br><br> Eating chicken, for example, is not a problem as long as we can give them a decent size place to live in and let some of them die a natural death. Which is only possible by levying regulations on farms and meat producing factories(i don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called). This could work but is easier said than done.Food.inc shows how difficult that could be(especially without a large populations awareness) Nevertheless, more people are becoming aware of the obvious problems with capitalism and working towards a more ethical and intelligent future. <br><br><br>Domesticating other animals like dogs, cats and monkeys is a give and take relationship, we care for them and in return they provide a service to us. Its like employment for really stupid employees. <br>We don&#39;t eat them when they are dead either because we were never taught by our parents to eat dogs, or because we give them an identity and grow a bond with them(explains why farmers don&#39;t name their chicken or cows, and why we mostly don&#39;t care for its gender), so after their chicken lay all those eggs and cows produce all that milk, they can kill and sell or eat it.<br><br> Death is sad, but its nature. In a way, fruits are the children of trees, they contain the DNA of the parent in hope that it will one day grow and have its own fruits. The thing is, with (most) fruits, we can eat the fruit, then plant it seed(s) and have the species live on. Just as so, we kill the chicken but not before it lays some eggs and sees its children be born. The significant difference being chicken can suffer but plants cant.<br>But what about ants or cockroaches or rats or fly&#39;s, we don&#39;t even want to eat them, we kill them because they simply cause us an inconvenience, should we not kill them either. We know ants or rats are much more intelligent than chicken. <br><br>In addition, regarding animal testing, humans should use diligence and try to perform the least amounts of tests necessary to provide a safe chemical product to humans, but can not and should not avoid these tests. The alternatives to having chemical products tested on animals is testing on humans or not producing chemical products altogether. We could move to more organic based products reducing the risk of test subjects suffering but human life will always seem more valuable to humans than non-human life not because of some non-relevant difference but a very real natural difference of species.", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T22:34:14Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgzaAFI3zKeUFKb3Uy94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Marlon Moncrieffe", "comment_text": "Do all you moral relativists when it comes to animal rights hold the same standard with ALL species-including ugly, little bugs and other invertebrates?", "comment_date": "2017-12-04T15:59:31Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "Ugzo5Zta6hiHyxVjhFF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Himanshu Wilhelm", "comment_text": "My thoughts on this: If the entire human species went vegan, It would be better for the planet.", "comment_date": "2017-12-03T22:11:13Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgxPUDIGs5VZpVIUXWJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Teena Aniyan", "comment_text": "What about plants?", "comment_date": "2017-12-02T11:40:43Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "Ugy0-iZEc-Xdvpk19L94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Harry Soper", "comment_text": "bit bias no?", "comment_date": "2017-11-27T21:18:35Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgxWZlM8l1uCSx2DJOB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Louis Gedo", "comment_text": "Excellent presentation....LIVING VEGAN is the only way out of internal inconsistency and hypocrisy for virtually everyone reading this comment since there&#39;s no biological requirement in the human body for animal products and since animals other than the human variety are sentient.", "comment_date": "2017-11-27T17:13:41Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgxLBW7oCQi_QKBIr994AaABAg", "comment_by": "Extraneus", "comment_text": "My daughter told me I&#39;m not able to eat my cat when she dies :( I don&#39;t want to waste her meat nor her beautiful, soft fur.", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T10:47:55Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgxlQ0Unieu3KSLn3oF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Nicolas Guglielmi", "comment_text": "I wish people wouldn&#39;t get angry when discussing important stuff... too bad humans will never change this because we are so emotional, but some of us can manage to tslk about this stuff in a civilized way", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T20:31:11Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgxXYpKZPylM4PdL3gR4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Sammy", "comment_text": "Yeah sure but if you hold humans to the standards of not eating animals then why is it okay for animals to eat other animals?", "comment_date": "2017-11-22T20:48:48Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgzkFd0lEqwOcoMnWfV4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Sammy", "comment_text": "Survival of the fittest?", "comment_date": "2017-11-22T20:40:49Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgzGGfehbkFnTPFlUNl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Reginald Finley", "comment_text": "Beautifully done.

Intellect. Sure even mid level retardation might make you duller than a chimp or elephant but most people don&#39;t kill and eat those animals, mostly because they are smart we see that in their actions and interactions, but if your slower than a cow then until very recently ( even still) you&#39;d be locked in a little cage ( assilum) and fed and watered until you die at probably a very young age and at a low enough level even consider killing ( pulling the plug) perfectly legal and acceptable. So that point does hold up.<br>Next the comparison between slaves and sexism compared with animals, well humans are one species as a dog a coyote and a wolf are one species.and We even created most eaten animals ie cows chickens are more or less created. Furthermore We don&#39;t eat a dog as such we dont eat coyote or a wolf. So the comparison of speciesism to racism seems like a tug a thread, <br>Argument of need. yes cosmetic is wrong but almost all dietitians will tell you a balanced diet is best and in some cases stopping eating of meat might kill or severely sicken someone. Also practicality of getting enough protein into the diet of someone who works heavy labour would be extremely hard to achieve. Not to mention the massive price and detriment of moving a vegan diet to people like me in the north would probably lead to starvation in one form or another. As such the need exists. <br>Avoiding pain. Any animal I kill and eat dies extremely fast much more than anything they can hope for otherwise, as such is it not utilitarian to stop the animal from dying of starvation or being ripped apart and eaten alive by a predator? <br>As for fluffy. We don&#39;t eat some animals again the dog wolf coyote thing, further humans tend not to consume the meat of predators or scavengers for both health and taste reasons meaning it&#39;s not in the least speciesist , we also don&#39;t eat 14 year old cows that we find dead in the paddock. So not speciesist. And about the &#39; respect but some people eat dead relatives thing &#39; I don&#39;t think even needs an argument but some people sacrifice babies so now we can&#39;t argue killing babies is wrong ? The majority of human civilization has as far back as we can tell known cannibalism to be wrong. And as such eating a member of the family even of a different species. We value attachments as well as familiarity, as such many small farms don&#39;t kill and eat bottle fed lamb or a trusted horse or cow that has been good to them for years. It&#39;s not based on species but rather a feelling of friendship, a soldier can kill an enemy and die for a friend as humans can bond with one species or even a individual of a species and eat another. I have to kill dogs and yotes but unless completely necisary could never kill my hounds as I find to be the case with most men where I&#39;m from. <br>To conclude. speciesism isn&#39;t a thing at least not like sexism or racism which uses unfounded bias we judge different species based off observation and familiarity and interaction as well as intelligence and grasp of the world around them, not that of baseless beliefs. The killing of animals can be utilitarian as the death of the animal is less painful and more beneficial then not. And the devide between pets and foods is logical as pets provide friendship and comradery and food provides a practical source of nutrition both things required for humans.

Therefore, members of non-human animal species do not have rights. Though they have many very serious privileges which humans bestow upon them; but humans are not accountable to those animals for providing those privileges - humans are instead accountable to other humans for providing non-human animals with the agreed-upon privileges, and this is further evidence that the privileges that animals have cannot be described as rights.

The difference, is that we keep Guinea pigs as pets. Pets, for example cats, are considered by the society to be conscious. Thus, we do not eat pets because they are conscious beings.

The environment shapes the species, the different factors affects it in different ways. A domesticated animal is an animal that has evolved to what it is today not by the different &quot;natural factors&quot;, but by humans factors, the &quot;rules&quot; of evolution and adaption still applies, it&#39;s just that we choose who survives, breeds etc and so the species is adapted to us, &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. A sheep or a dog isn&#39;t a wild animal, they couldn&#39;t really survive in the wild, they&#39;re adapted to humans, a mutual beneficial &quot;agreeement&quot;. What&#39;s the difference between dying in nature because of disease, predators or malnutrition, or dying at the butchery? An animal isn&#39;t afraid of death, they don&#39;t have the abstract notion of death. A sheep, or a chicken &quot;wants&quot;/instinctually seeks food, shelter, companion. A chicken in a huge chicken coop has food, water, shelter and companionship with other chickens, they have notion about death, they don&#39;t care if we choose when they die, how is that different from the different factors of nature &quot;choosing&quot; when they die, the species that is chicken exists because we want it to, should we stop raising chickens? Then they wouldn&#39;t exist, is that &quot;fair&quot;. Now, the argument about pain is of course a legit one. Is it worth existing if you&#39;re in pain? No one is advocating for cruel treatment of animals just for the sake of it, putting chickens in cages so small they can&#39;t move etc, but animals feel pain/get hurt in nature too, can the benefits outweigh the disadvantages?. This is an economical decision and not about the principles of &quot;using&quot; animals in general. We should of course treat livestock and domesticated animals better if possible. I eat meat, i see no reason why not, I keep dogs as pets. We humans have a mutual beneficial relationships with the domesticated animals<br><br>When it comes to wild animals,  zoos and hunting etc. Zoos often does not treat animals as good as they should, but still, what is most important, to be alive, or to have it as good as possible? A lion wants a huge area to roam free, well, there isn&#39;t enough nature left for that many lions, live in a zoo or don&#39;t live at all, what would you choose?. Secondly a zoo educates and show people the fantastic wildlife we have on earth, increasing awareness about the problems facing the species and nature in general, this is of course not saying that zoos couldnt improve the way they treat animals, trying to make their environments as natural as possible, but that zoos in general are not a bad thing. Rather a life in a cage that no life at all. <br>Hunting is multifaceted. We have hunted animals to extinction. In industrialised countries the top predators are often extinct or the population so small they&#39;re irrelevant. Animals like for example deer or moose no longer has any natural enemies and the hunting is often necessary to keep the ecosystem in balance. When it comes to trophy hunting like elephants and lions this of course can be viewed as a bad thing, the species are endangered or worse, but often this kind of trophy hunting provides important funding and awareness necessary to preserving a species as a whole, in contrast to the often much more harmfull poaching<br><br>I would personally have large difficulties directly hurting an animal (or a person for that matter), but I still eat meat, I still enjoy zoos and I&#39;m not against the idea of hunting, even though I myself would probably not enjoy it.", "comment_date": "2017-08-04T02:12:55Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgxS_aSJZ8vO5o6G4sd4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ronald Johnson", "comment_text": "vegans and vegetarian are extremely unhealthy we have", "comment_date": "2017-08-03T19:25:11Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgwQBtYegFAVn1ADB5V4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ronald Johnson", "comment_text": "bunny&#39;s are delicious", "comment_date": "2017-08-03T19:22:03Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgxQq_a0aU2PQG1iRoZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "F F", "comment_text": "The thing is that plants can suffer to and are alive so we can&#39;t stop eating meat cause it&#39;s the same with plants so it&#39;s impossible to survive without eating something that was alive", "comment_date": "2017-08-03T12:33:32Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgxMdLZEkIdxH-mM_Jx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "HLVR", "comment_text": "I think dogs should be able to vote!", "comment_date": "2017-08-02T18:08:09Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "Ugx76dE62QuctdmnCeh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ted Coombs", "comment_text": "Animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than the entire transport sector.

Why, then, should humans?<br><br>1. We tend to assume that our species is divorced from nature - that we somehow live in a separate dimension. This observation is evident in the way we arbitrarily distinguish the natural from the unnatural. The truth is everything we act upon is natural - yes, even industrial waste is natural by definition. We are just another animal, as implied in the title of this crash course. We could apply ecological analyses to human behavior as we do to every other species&#39;. <br><br>2. A distinguishing factor between our species and other sentient species is the degree of our cognition. Most of us can feel pain at a higher plane than all other animals because we are more aware of that pain, thus adding a layer of psychological and emotional torment that other species simply aren&#39;t equipped to process. This difference, however, is of degree, not kind.<br><br>3. We rarely meddle in the moral affairs of other species. We could subjugate all carnivores and feed them only unsentient products of nature. Surely those carnivores could survive on a vegetarian diet, or at least a diet consisting of flesh derived without inflicting pain to that flesh&#39;s owner (such as byvalves, which possess no central nervous system). Doing this would prevent other species, like lions, from engaging in the same seemingly barbaric and unnecessary diets most of us still practice.<br><br>4. Perhaps you believe that morality should not be normative, which means that one is justified in calling out and refraining from participating in the meat industry without imposing a moral requirement upon others. This would explain your inadvertent decision not to impose a moral diet upon other species and upon other human beings. But what good is morality if it is not normative? Morality dictates ethics, which deals with &quot;what one ought do.&quot; If you take the ought out of ethics, you have &quot;what one does.&quot; Therefore, saying that decisions are morally restricted to individuals pragmatically boils down to the statement that individuals chose what individuals chose, which is a meaningless tutelage. Thus, a non-normative morality is an admittance of universal (yes, applicable even to humans) amorality, meaning that no one has a moral duty to others. Such a conclusion certainly is congruent with our observations of nature acting upon its species, other species acting upon other species, and, (usually) with the exception of humans, species acting upon their own.<br><br>Based primarily on these four ideas, I propose that if one is to be philosophically consistent in adjusting his or her lifestyle to favor a moral diet, he or she must either accept moral anti-realism (which leaves no grounds with which to require others to act in a way you deem appropriate) or impose your moral diet upon all species.<br><br>How does my proposition follow from the above ideas? Here is my explanation: if we are as natural as nature&#39;s other species, then appealing to our membership in the human species is not a morally relevant factor that warrants our adherence to moral standards while simultaneously failing to apply those standards to other species. In other words, we need a reason to have special moral standards, and being of a certain species is not sufficient justification. Moreover, the main factor that distinguishes other species from us is the degree of cognition. Only a difference of kind (and not of degree) could justify our adherence to a separate moral standard. Therefore, from the first two ideas I concluded that whatever moral standard we adhere to must not be hypocritically applied exclusively to humans; if living on a diet without inflicting pain on other beings is morally preferable, then that moral standard applies to all species. The third idea was simply to expose that we currently don&#39;t apply this moral standard to other species. The only way this neglect could be justified is if we accept that our standards in choosing an ethical diet are not binding, which as shown in idea #4, would lead to an overall pragmatic equivalent of amorality. Thus, the only escape from the amorality that nature displays is to apply these moral standards to all species to prevent them from engaging in an immoral diet (if you do indeed believe there is such a thing).<br><br>Of course, if you don&#39;t accept my ideas, then my proposition won&#39;t follow. But if you do, the only other way to escape my proposition is if some other ideal holds priority over the ideals that could lead one to repudiate the meat diet.", "comment_date": "2017-06-14T21:18:08Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgjKxZSaiGCNzXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Tom Clarke", "comment_text": "Does anyone know what Singer text he&#39;s referring to?", "comment_date": "2017-06-14T01:09:51Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UggJXslkTyrt4XgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Janis L.", "comment_text": "Applying ethics to animals defeats their purpose, which is for a society to work.

The fact is if I condemn eating meat saying it&#39;s unfair to the animals life then I could also state the same reason for not eating plants or bacteria and just because I can&#39;t imagine what it is like being a plant doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t matter or they don&#39;t exist! If I was to condemn all meat eating aspects I would condemn all food for eating just vegetables is just as bad so to survive I have to eat something and rather condemn one set of species as better then another I justify eating all species besides my own saying they are all important and just as important as my own species but I need to eat something to live and so rather be a hypocrite and say eating a set of species is completely wrong and devour another species I say it&#39;s all ok in the sake of survival.<br><br>You see my belief is that it&#39;s the way of life, the circle of life to need to kill another life force to sustain your own but wether it feels pain or not is reviling, would you kill a sleeping man knowing he probably won&#39;t feel pain in any way? No? Then why do it to plants knowing the fact plants probably do feel pain yet you justify it because they are not of the animal kingdom?

Same logic, whether you&#39;re a vegan or not, you probably have different degrees of aversion when you hear 1) people eating pork 2)people eating their own pet piglet when it dies. A pet pig holds a significant social value to its human owners, hence they&#39;re more significant to the human society than just any random pigs. The death of Cecil, and not any random pouched lion (although their deaths should raise outrage too I think) raised such a degree of outrage, is because Cecil was a symbol in his home country and beyond, hence he &#39;s part of our society too.

Meanwhile, if I&#39;m served chicken that I know was from a living breathing suffering animal in the middle of buttfuck nowhere, yeah, thinking on it, I might feel a bit of remorse, but I mean, I don&#39;t know that chicken. It was never given a name. It&#39;s not much to me. That said, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s justification. I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t have justification, but stopping there would be a misstep. It&#39;s like saying that you&#39;re OK with thousands of people dying in a war because you don&#39;t know them. That&#39;s the thought process of the stereotypical evil politician on his big podium advocating for WWII. Which I mean, in that sense, there is a difference in kind, as wars are typically fought over ideals, but it&#39;s the thought that other creatures of relevant intelligence are expendable that I find deplorable. <br><br>Now, there are two main reasons I think I and most other people can justify eating meat. Well, kinda one, but it has two sides I guess. Basically, it&#39;s the idea of ignorance, which no, normally isn&#39;t at all justification, but hear me out on this one. Let&#39;s start with the one that is far less popular, and that I wouldn&#39;t advocate for. The idea that the animals exist on a different world, unalike our own entirely.<br><br>The average person, when they imagine a cow farm, or a pig farm,  picture this big open fenced off field for the cows to frolic in, and grass to eat, and space to move. And while that&#39;s not what happens a lot of the time, it perpetuates the idea that farm animals are living in an entirely different world, and when their time comes, we harvest what&#39;s left, and boom. It&#39;s on your plate. It views them as something entirely separate from humans that we just benefit from. Unfortunately, we all know this isn&#39;t true. But that&#39;s no reason to drop your steak knife and grab a sign to go protest your local farm. No, I still think there&#39;s a reason I am comfortable with eating meat. And that&#39;s the fact that the animals we eat do not have a certain drive that humans do. Hear me out on this one...<br><br>A cow likes open space. A cow likes to eat grass. A cows main goal in life is to reproduce. A cow however, does not want representation in congress. You see what I mean? A cow is, a cow. And its motivations and drives are less complicated than a humans. They may not necessarily be simple creatures, but they&#39;re not exactly planning rebellions. I draw your attention to near the beginning of the video where the treatment of livestock was compared to the treatment of slaves during the 1800s. I don&#39;t think this holds water. Because if you set a slave free, they will grow and learn in their lifetime to have pursuits other than reproducing. If you gave a cow citizenship, and a house, and everything a normal citizen has, including putting it through school, yeah it may pick up some habits just from repeated exposure, I won&#39;t pretend like it won&#39;t, but it&#39;s not going to start working a 9 to 5. It will still continue it&#39;s simple and happy existence of eating grass, roaming around, and continuing it&#39;s species. It would be like if the slaves back when were freed, and upon having them be told that they just went &quot;Oh... alright.&quot; And just kept on working. No demand for better treatment, except obviously protesting violence, but for the most part, nothing much would change. Purely hypothetical, and yeah, some things don&#39;t exactly fit perfectly, but I think it&#39;s easy enough to pick up what I&#39;m putting down.", "comment_date": "2017-01-24T10:37:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgjQx1207_DR8ngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Rififi50", "comment_text": "You usually don&#39;t eat your dying cat because you did not raise it to be eaten.

The reason the cognitively disabled person fails to serve as a defeater for the argument is that such people still have the basic capacity for intelligence (or more specifically, for reason). The fact that they are hindered by some physical deformity from expressing that capacity doesn&#39;t change the fact that they have it by nature. In other words, to use the classical definition, a human is a rational animal. Kittens just aren&#39;t. Now, morality and moral obligations are directly connected to reason, to rationality. So that which is rational (by nature) is a moral agent. That which is arational is not a moral agent. Kittens, dogs, pigs, these are arational creatures. They are, then, not moral agents and therefore our use of them is not governed by morality. It is, rather, governed by prudence and general principles of stewardship. Moreover, since part of being rational is having a general respect for life (a disposition that favors life), we should have a general desire to reduce suffering even in non-rational entities (e.g., cows and chickens). So we can definitely say that the treatment of animals may well be &quot;inhumane&quot; and thus be immoral--not because the animal itself has any intrinsic rights being violated but because to cause unjustified suffering is irrational.

The second is: &quot;Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end&quot; (don&#39;t use people as tools without also considering their humanity). He said this because we humans are &quot;Rational Beings&quot;; that is, these rules apply because humans are self-determining agents, and must therefore be treated as free creatures with their liberty endorsed. <br><br>I was wondering how this would apply to animals; since simpler creatures such as fish or chicken are definitely not rational beings, is it perhaps okay to deny them the right of liberty, and hence use them as mere means? Of course, they still do feel pain, and hence I agree that slaughtering or hunting should be as painless as possible. Even better, synthetically produced protein can be used as an alternative to eating meat, once the technology has advanced. But on the basis that some animals may not have any agency or observable consciousness, could we not only treat humans as higher creatures than animals, but also treat more cognitively aware animals as above others?

Imagine there was a fire, and a firefighter had to run into a house and only had time to save either a canary in its cage or a human baby, it would not only be the right choice to take the baby, we would be morally appalled if the firefighter chose the canary.<br><br>The fact is, there are differences when it comes to the depth and complexity of the human experience. I know this sounds dangerously anthropocentric, but bear with me here. The reason the firefighter is morally obliged to save the baby is because of the difference on the experience that child can potentially achieve.<br><br>The thing is, this isn&#39;t an issue on which we should apply a has moral worth  / does not have moral worth tag on living beings, we should recognize that there are different subcategories of moral worth, each with its own guarantees to the proportion that that specific living thing deserves.<br><br>What this means is that animals that feel pain are automatically put on a relatively high rung of the moral ladder, and there are basic guarantees of treatment we should extend to them for the mere fact of them being able to feel pain. How we identify pain in animals is another debate alltogether, but there are some well known indicators.<br><br>Animals that not only feel pain but show signs of personality, and in some instances, a more rudimentary form of consciousness, are also assigned higher places in the list. Dolphins and primates are considered non-human animals for good reason, they have demonstrated enough individuallity and complexity that we recognize their increased moral worth.<br><br>This is also supported by the way we treat insects. Just think if why we pay no consideration to the ants we walk on. They are alive aren&#39;t they? Why were they not considered in the video? What separates an ant from us, and more importantly, from other animals? <br><br>They are placed in a lower rung in the moral worth scale because on the one hand they can&#39;t feel pain (as far as we know), and they resemble more biological machines than actual animals. The behaviour of an ant is completely indistinguishable from any other ant, they react in the most basic ways that hint at the stimulus - reaction dinamic at play here. There is no conscious experience anywhere in the chain, not that we know of at least, and that has a huge role in determining their moral worth.<br><br>There is a qualitative difference between being an ant or most insects, and being a pig. None of us would save an ant over a lion or a condor, or a blue whale. Well what I am arguing is that the reasons we would never choose the ant goes beyond the fact that one of them feels pain, but is also, as illustrated by the firefighter thought experiment, because we recognize the cognitive differences between living beings.<br><br>Just to be clear, I think animals deserve extremely better treatment than they are currently getting. No animal should have to be tortured in order for us to satisfy our needs. We could perfectly well treat animals with the amount of humanity that they deserve, and we are in fact morally obligated to do so.<br><br>This does not mean however that all animals are equal to us, because there are differences that exist beyond the fact of feeling pain that I believe Singer wrongly ignores.", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T04:54:27Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UgiD1OdflQ13kngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Eric Barnes", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t eat pigs anymore because of their level of intellect... except bacon. <br><br>Three factors to me are:<br>Quantity <br>Intelligence<br>Taste", "comment_date": "2017-01-19T04:53:29Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UghRp89Me1VVHHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Carson Barlow", "comment_text": "I&#39;m  a speciesist.

Non-human animals are not humans, I firmly believe that statement to be non-controversial, so why must we give the same regard to non-human animals as the human animal. Now I come from this as a pet owner myself, and I love my pets, I would visit John Wick levels of retribution on anyone who harmed my pets.

Treating non-human animals as though they are human and possess similar emotions and level of cognition to a human is called anthropomorphism and this is tantamount to animal abuse because you are ignoring the needs of your animals to fulfill your own self-centered sense of moral righteousness. It is still possible to treat non-human animals with respect and decency while fulfilling their needs as non-human animals, and our own as human animals, but pretending they are human is the same type of paternalist thinking that lead to us treating Africans as animals in the days of slavery; we think we know best when we know nothing at all.

You rightly pointed out that owning or eating a Human Being <i>[or Fluffy the cat, for that matter -- but I&#39;ll get back to her]</i> is seen as morally abhorrent, and thus owning or eating a non-Human Animal should be seen the same way according to the Principle of the Equal Consideration of Interests.<br>However, you neglected to consider the case which goes the other &#39;way round: if, say, the consumption for culinary or nutritional considerations (i.e. &quot;eating&quot;) of non-Human Animals by Humans is seen as morally abhorrent, shouldn&#39;t the eating of non-Human Animals by <b>other non-Human Animals</b> seen the same way? After all, isn&#39;t the point of Philosophy, in your words at least, that we should be internally consistent? Why should the catching (and often <b>torturing</b>, no less) and subsequent consumption of the flesh of a mouse by Fluffy the cat -- there she is again -- be OK when we view similar treatment of Humans and non-Human Animals alike by Humans as morally abhorrent? Or, alternatively, if we are OK with Fluffy doing what she does to the mouse, why shouldn&#39;t we be OK with what Humans do to non-Human Animals?<br>Speaking of that line of thought, the thing about <i>&quot;This is the way it&#39;s always been.&quot;</i>.... Not only has it been this way for the life-span of the Human Race, but it has been this way for the <b>entirety</b> of the existence of <b>Life on Earth</b>. You could say it&#39;s the &quot;natural order of <br>things&quot;, in a way, and that there is no reason to change something which has <b>literally</b> been the case <b>for as long as there WERE cases</b> to consider. I&#39;m not sure whether I&#39;d say this is a good argument myself, but it is certainly one to consider. And, most importantly, to not misrepresent by saying it only applies to the time Humans were on Earth, as supposed to the time Life Itself was on Earth.<br><br>My own, personal answer is that, just as I wouldn&#39;t want non-Human Animals to be tortured by Humans, I&#39;d stop Fluffy <i>[or Munky, for that matter, who was my cat who died a little under a year ago]</i> from torturing mice if I knew of a way to convince them. However, as I am perfectly OK with Fluffy, Munky or any other cat <b>eating</b> <i>[and catching, for that matter, if the kill would be instantaneous]</i> mice, I also have no trouble with Humans eating non-Human Animals.<br>I do, however, think that the use of non-Human Animals for needs <b>other</b> than consumption of the flesh for eating purposes -- say, testing Cosmetics -- should be moved away from with utmost haste as soon as humanly <i>[he he]</i> possible for the moral reasons discussed in this video and above in this post. I also think the ownership of Animals for the purposes of doing something with them that would kill them should be moved away from as much as possible as soon as possible, and not just for the Philosophical and Moral reasons that apply -- owning and feeding a cow, for example, to the point of raising it so that it&#39;s meat may be consumed or new cows can be born is equivalent to many, many miles of driving a really old and heavily CO2-emitting car. Not sure how many miles anymore, but I do remember it&#39;s a lot. On the other hand, we are perfectly OK with Humans working for other Humans, as long as the working conditions -- and, should they be housed by the Company, living conditions -- are of a high standard and they get payed for what they do. Similarly, it could be argued that, say, keeping a Cow for the purposes of extracting her milk is justifiable, as long as the &quot;working conditions&quot; and living conditions are of a high quality <i>[so the Factory Farms are, indeed, completely and utterly unacceptable and should be banned with utmost haste]</i> and they get rewarded in some way for their &quot;work&quot; of producing and giving milk.", "comment_date": "2017-01-18T05:09:15Z", "likes_count": 9}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UggK5ati1bIqvngCoAEC", "comment_by": "LZH1703", "comment_text": "i don&#39;t feel safe eating something that has already died of old age", "comment_date": "2017-01-18T05:02:26Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UghnfTioKzhN4ngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Shannon Horst", "comment_text": "This is a very factual video that does a good job of letting people come to their own conclusions.

Even those lowly bacteria are designed to reproduce and spread, harvesting them in some manner and killing them is obviously against what they would do if left alone and what is ideal for them. Plants, which vegans gulp down with much gusto also don&#39;t want to be eaten.

Placing a cat or dog on a high table of concern as apposed to a pig or cow is reasonable, because the emotional attachment we add to the pet generally increases the well being of the owner, whether it be by bringing happiness, or enforcing a domestic structure, and so on. Naturally any animal can fit the role of pet, generally speaking, so which animal gains such a position is culturally dictated.<br><br>The same can be applied to farm animals, who instead of serving as an developmental tool, serve as a resource. Animals that don&#39;t provide an effective economic boost don&#39;t become farm animals. Hence why we&#39;re not making farms for tigers, or polar bears. Sure we have zoos, but their value just doesn&#39;t compare, and thus these animals can be widely disregarded. <br><br>And in regards to suffering, I believe it unreasonable that we should make the assumed argument that less suffering is better. Suffering is ultimately the only blockade between progress and stagnation.

One of those you discussed: Need.<br>The other is to further differentiate the non-category of non-human animals. Every species has to be evaluated on its own, because we evaluate humans on their own. Humans cannot not be evaluated as a category of their own because of sentient agency giving them a choice in their treatment of other species, leading to the necessity of ethics in the first place. This of course establishes sentience as a relevant discriminator and when we consequentially use that on the whole of the animal kingdom (and on lifeforms as a group at large) species by species, what we get is a gradient.<br>Humans at the top, followed by a long line starting with primates, maybe octopuses, and some seemingly random groups of other mammals and birds and ending somewhere at the level of animals with no (jellyfish, corals) or very rudimentary (starfish, sea urchines) nervous systems, if not with plants and mushrooms.<br>The problem is, evolution being gradual, there is no logical cut-off point here. Plants are generally agreed to have no sentience while humans are agreed to have (to keep it brief) full sentience. Everything in between is a problem.<br>The approach does, however, comfortably save puppies and kittens, because their respective species are members of carnivora, one of the mammal groups rather high on the sentience gradient (though about as high as pigs, so, yeah, no bacon for me). The divisor is a tough line to draw, but luckily there is large gap filled with animals rarely considered edible in between chicken and salmon, so at least it is easy to draw a line somewhere in the vast realm between these points on the slider.

I also think its disrespectfull to say no to a piece of meat not just because it makes the animal&#39;s death pointless, but it also makes the work of the butcher, the seller, and the cook pointless.<br><br>What is a moral dilema is how we treat and kill these animals.

Well that comes from a utilitarian perspective. Cats and dogs are carnivores, so maintaining them for food sources would be much more expensive and difficult than keeping a cow for food. This practical aproach would later evolve in to a more traditional way of thinking with little reason to it. The difference betwen eating fluffles and eating a cat is that there is an emotional bond between fluffles and the owner, while there is no such bond between a cat and a human who dont know eachother. And this bond isnt exclusive to &quot;pet type&quot; animals. I think we all agree that if we raised a pig from birth by the end of its life we would have difficulty killing said pig to eat him.

If my pet dog failed to adequately provide me companionship (if it was just an angry disagreeable dog) can I have it taken to the pound?  What if it&#39;s eventual fate is that it&#39;s exterminated?

In that event, I think humanity should be morally obligated to help dolphins domesticate their preferred fish species, and ask them to help protect all other wild species.

It was the republicans that overturned that back in the day. <br><br>Exibit B: With abortion, the question is &quot;isn&#39;t the child/ fetus/ living pottential life in the womb considered &quot;life&quot; that is viable?  Does that life deserve the equal protection of our laws?&quot; And the answer to it right now is, No. The fetus isn&#39;t considered a human nor a &quot;person&quot; worthy of the protection of &quot;life&quot;  under the constitution. We have the technology to see the fetus through ultrasound, and yet we consider performing such gruesome procedures at 3 months as just a &quot;choice&quot;? Well it may be a &quot;choice&quot; but the choice to murder is never a moral choice. Those fetuses too are considered &quot;property&quot;, and in this case the mother, can &quot;choose&quot; (according to liberals) to kill it or keep it, at 2 weeks to 9 months. To liberal progressives a fetus in the womb is property, and because they are property, they have no &quot;rights&quot;. to progressives its just as good as an inanimate object like a rock, with which they can do whatever they please at their whims.

Some animals kill eachother in their own communities and do not suffer any moral dillemas about it. Why should humans have any problems with killing and subjugating animals then?<br><br>There are some scientific papers saying that at one point in time human population dropped very low. Even if this research is wrong, which it could be because its based on DNA tracking and it must be interpreted, lets imagine it true for a second. I really doubt any predator or nonpredator animal would give a second thought about human preservation in those circumstances. Yes, we humans use and kill animals for various reasons, but atleast today, as evolved dominant specie, we try to take care of endangered ones.  No animal would do that.<br><br>It seems to me that we antropomorhize animals and try to make them like us when they are not. Yes they feel, but they only feel for themselves. Even cats, our pets, would not really hesitate to eat us when dead like we might do. If we would really like to be philosophically consistent in our &quot;care&quot; about animal suffering etc, we would need to destroy our civilization. All of our buildings, foodfields(vegetables/fruits) and roads actually DESTROYED huge chunks of environment some animals lived in and it decreased their population. How much wildlife would flourish if my home(+garage, garden with fruit and vegetables) did not exist. I do not see vegetarians or vegans NOT using roads, not living in homes. Their food has to come from somewhere and acres of field need to be used to sustain them. Some animals suffered to get you your vegeterian and vegan food. <br><br>In my opinion, all this animal rights concern is transfixed from caring about other humans because the system we live in does not allow us to care for humans. Race for money, fame and success makes us do bad things to each other in a process and then we give a lot of that care to animals to feel more nice, symphatetic, emphatetic. To feel more human. Isn&#39;t it a weird coincidence that some of the cruelest people in our history had much love for animals? They needed to transfix some of the human empathy because they couldn&#39;t really be consistent with themselves and direct it towards the same humans they were doing wrong to.

It seems worth exploring the idea that it might be altogether impossible for a system of ethics to be  entirely consistent across all experience; in particular it seems to easily break down any time we try to generalize across intuitive (rather than explicit) boundaries. Some variation of Godel&#39;s Incompleteness Theorem for logic could be true - that there are things which are true or false within any system of ethical rules that those rules simply cannot prove one way or the other.<br><br>SMBC had an interesting thing to say about the idea of self-consistence in one comic, though in that strip it was in regard to political movements; your movement only really survives if it is flexible enough to modify its agenda as people come and go and the world evolves; if it is tied to a self-consistent ideal, it&#39;s destined to fail. It might be useful to consider that Ethics functions similarly - if you tie your ethics to a specific set of self-consistent rules, you can never remain ethical long-term; if what you call Ethical is ultimately arbitrary and can change with whatever authority or environment you need it to, you can always be Ethical (even though that term loses most of its implied meaning).<br><br>The Naturalist Philosophy of Science, that truth is objective, and discoverable via observation, evidence, and logic, works amazingly well for uncovering the behaviour of the universe around us.

These are people that basically have lost the ability to consent to the social contract. So we put them away. Now, unlike animals, we don&#39;t kill them or eat them or anything because there&#39;s the implicit assumption that insanity may somehow be temporary and at some point in the future they may regain their ability to join the social contract, either naturally or through medical means. The same goes for severely disabled people, although they usually integrate better with society than insane people so we&#39;re typically more lenient.<br><br>Now what&#39;s different with animals is there&#39;s absolutely no expectation that they may at some point in the future become capable of consenting to the social contract. So we remove those safeguards that we normally place on impaired humans. One of those safeguards is not being eaten by other humans.<br><br>However, it&#39;s entirely true that animals do suffer like humans, and that should change our behavior. For example, we shouldn&#39;t torture animals.

You win the right to not be harmed (conditionally), by participating in the social contract. And the &quot;conditionally&quot; part is the important part, it defines the rules of the contract.

We probably have some sort of minimum emotional connection to other humans simply because of the fact that we&#39;re both humans. There have been examples of humans killing other humans because of their needs though. At some point, the need surpasses the emotional connection. In a utilitarian way you could say that the hurt of me not killing the human is greater than the hurt of the human + the hurt of knowing what the human feels due to the emotional connection. <br><br>In animals we can be less sure of how it feels because we are not the same species. To take this a step further: We know even less about how plants feel, hence why we barely think about how they feel. For example this video, it only talks about animals, yet it has been proven that plants also react to negative stimuli like being eaten. We have less of a base emotional connection to plants compared to animals and less to animals as we have to humans. <br><br>To summarize: We have an emotional connection to other beings. The strength of this emotional connection depends on how similar it is to humans. The less human it is, the less empathy we have for it.

Humans treat non-sentient life the way they do out of economic convenience,  demand, and need. Sure there are other potential avenues for research, work, and food now but at one time there wasn&#39;t as much... and arguably in some cases that need is still rather strong. But supposing alternatives can be found humans are still going to be displacing, harming, and killing non-sentient life. Vegans do too. Their very existence in a modern civilization is an affront to nature and it is currently unavoidable (even in the most ideal green imagining of modern society)... humans have through the use of intelligence and technology far overstepped what would be otherwise humanity&#39;s lot. There was a constant mentioning of forced servitude, truly a terrible wrong and evil, and I would argue never truly a necessity but it existed and only stopped existing when humans developed the means to have superior alternatives such as machinery or because it was untenable like the constant fear of revolts with actual revolts which in some cases were successful (like the Haitian Revolution). It may be comforting to see the abolition of slavery as an ethical victory but mostly it was socioeconomic factors that brought it to an end. Is it any surprise that the more industrial/developed northern union States was anti-slavery while the confederate States that were far less industrial/developed were pro-slavery? Which is what I think will be the end of meat-eating... better synthetic meats that will likely cost lest, be easier to produce, and be higher in quality. The same thing is true about the terrible situation of pollution where humanity is literally killing itself and the world they inhabit... alternatives exist but they are not of the same quality or cost-efficiency so it isn&#39;t going to change much. Sure you could try to live a &#39;green lifestyle&#39; and be an environmental/climate advocate but that isn&#39;t going to change the ultimate trend. Technology however will.<br><br>So if someone feels uncomfortable or that it is against their conscience to eat meat, I can fully understand and support them in that. However if they think they are doing anything significant or that they are being noble while their very existence is the destruction of other non-human and human life as well as the planet... or that their efforts are somehow similar to past efforts... I think that is really absurd. I have no doubt someday humanity will not do to animals what is currently done in factory farming... but in the same way we may view George Washington who owned slaves (who in his will liberated them and gave them part of his estate) will likely be the way we see those of us today. A regretful arrangement caused by many different factors that we grew out of. Ethics evolves and is if you like it or not is largely situational and an afterthought of whatever the current arrangement is. If it wasn&#39;t humanity would of never developed and likely would of died out due to environmental and climate changes that were world-wide or regional. <br><br>Progress is progressive and accumulative. Someday I also think the existence of a labor class as currently constituted will be seen as unethical (likely again due to technology) and akin to a modern-slavery. So do you stop going to stores? Do you turn off the power and the internet? Or do you fight for a better today for that labor class and work for the hope to someday move past it? But if someone wanted to stop depending on human labor that is so poorly treated I could fully understand why. I choose the latter and the same for animals... better conditions for them today and try to reduce factory farming while working for a day where such things will no longer be. I choose the same thing for the environment, slowing and transitioning the economy away from pollution-generation, hoping that someday it can be stopped and perhaps undone. But ethically Veaganism I see as a kind of extremism so I am unsurprised by the kind of argumentation and emotionalism that is employed by more than a few Veagans I have seen. Kind of like how I see modern day communists as an extreme reaction to the situation of labor. Or like the retrogression to a more limited society.

I could almost guarantee you that in that parallel world, this video would instead be titled something like &quot;Non-Human, Non-Neanderthal Animals&quot; or something like that. The reality is that in the world we live in, even the most similar living species to humans still can&#39;t communicate with humans using the same languages we use. There are no other species that subscribe to any of the moral frameworks that we subscribe to. Even if we decide that all animals should be treated without pain, no other species is even capable of agreeing with us. Lions won&#39;t care what we think is wrong; they&#39;ll keep killing gazelles anyway. Perhaps the one contractarian principle that holds true throughout the entire planet is that, with the exception of symbiosis, organisms simply don&#39;t care about those that do not belong to their own species. A bear has personhood in a bear community, whereas a frog has none. Why shouldn&#39;t we follow every other species&#39; example? Why should we burden ourselves with the task of giving personhood to those who would never return the favour?<br><br><br><br>Of course, the same could be said about two humans who happen to be extremely different, only sharing a common genome and little else. Or of course, one could argue that my assumptions about the differences outweighing the similarities was simply wrong, that by focusing even deeper on the common details, one could perceive a unity that extends past our idea of &quot;species&quot;, beyond our individual definitions of &quot;life&quot;. Of course there are going to be a billion different perspectives on the issue, just like everything in philosophy. It all comes down to arbitrary boundaries. It&#39;s arbitrary because there are no standard measurements, only intuitions and vague notions. It&#39;s arbitrary because it&#39;s different to everyone. There are endless reasons behind every belief, endless levels of validity, but invalid ideas can exist just as well as valid ideas can. One specimen has personhood in one human&#39;s view and has none in another&#39;s view, while other humans might assign it varying degrees of personhood in between both extremes, and that&#39;s simply the way it is, without anyone having to be proven right or wrong over another. It&#39;s possible to live in a world where others hold beliefs we do not support, and we must simply tolerate them without intervening. Or maybe we do have a responsibility to intervene where we believe there is a position that should not be held.<br><br>Personally, I find it fascinating and beautiful that these dilemmas exist and perhaps can never be solved. I don&#39;t want us all to have to agree, and I don&#39;t want anyone&#39;s views to have to be silenced just because someone else thinks another view is more valid. But at the same time, I appreciate and endorse rationality just as much as the next guy. I&#39;m constantly torn between the aesthetic appeal of epistemic diversity and the intellectual appeal of moral uniformity. It&#39;s a wonderful sort of chaos that we all have these unsettled disputes that rage over generations while society simply continues anyway as if the lack of an answer is necessary to our survival. Philosophers strive for consistency, but maybe consistency is ultimately impossible. Perhaps hypocrisy is inevitable. And maybe it&#39;s not as bad as we might think. Or maybe it&#39;s exactly as bad as we think. What would even be the difference?<br><br>...This always seems to happen when I think about philosophical questions too hard.

However, there is a big difference between bears eating fish/ lions eating gazelles and humans eating chickens and cows; bears and lions don&#39;t keep their prey in tiny cages nor maim them to keep them from hurting each other, nor pump them full of artificial growth hormones and antibiotics. And on fish farms, people feed the fish cheap crud that they&#39;d never eat in their natural environment, not to mention they&#39;re kept in a tank and can&#39;t swim around getting the toning and exercise fish normally would in their natural environment (keep in mind salmon swim upstream, against the current, even UP waterfalls)- that inactivity actually negatively affects their taste; bears and lions don&#39;t do that with their prey either. What humans do to their prey is wrong because it&#39;s robbing them of their natural order/agency in addition to their lives. We give them incredibly shitty lives and then kill them. At least gazelles and fish get to roam around in their natural habitat eating their natural diet before they get eaten. The &quot;necessary to survive&quot; argument doesn&#39;t apply there, we can easily keep livestock without doing all those horrible things to them, we just do them because it&#39;s more convenient and less costly- but as Hank pointed out, the same was true of slavery, and it wasn&#39;t right then either. Free range chickens and the like help, but the public tends to ridicule those options as hippie nonsense and &quot;unnecessarily expensive&quot;. <br>As for the animal testing argument, using them for something important like medical testing is one thing, using them for something completely optional like cosmetics is another story. We can live without makeup, we need medicine. And in the case of Cecil the lion, did that hunter kill Cecil for food or self-defense, a necessity for survival? Or did he just kill Cecil for Sport, killed for no reason other than liking to kill things? Hunting for sport is a lot less philosophically defensible. <br>As for why not eat your pets upon their death... well... depending on how they died, they may not be safe to consume, and I imagine many of them would not taste very good assuming they even have much meat to begin with. I think the objection is based on personal connection, people tend to consider pets as part of the family. Some people have domestic pet chickens, not livestock. I imagine they wouldn&#39;t want to eat their pet chicken even if they aren&#39;t a vegetarian. There was even an episode of Simpsons where Homer got a lobster that he originally intended to eat, but then decided he liked it too much as a pet and backed out, only to eventually accidentally boil to death anyway when trying to give it a hot bath. He was sad about losing his pet, but he tearfully ate it anyway, saying that&#39;s what it would have wanted. If you claim pets are part of the family, then it&#39;s only fair to apply the same rule for to them as for humans: bury them upon their death so they can act as fertilizer for plants- which can then in turn be eaten. Livestock aren&#39;t pets, there&#39;s no personal connection with them, they are just part of the predator and prey equation of natural order- which is absent from a pet relationship. However, that then raises the question of cannibalism. Why shouldn&#39;t one eat other people they don&#39;t have personal connections with?

In an increasingly globalized works it is becoming more and more necessary to be able to distance ourselves from the moral implications of our choices.

How could I live in America and do anything, without feeling morally guilty?This relates to the &quot;trolley problem&quot; in which changing the circumstances of the thought experiment make it harder to phycologically distance the moral implications of the decision. This idea may suggest that there is no such thing as morality or ethics. Ethics is simply a pragmatic fiction that is developed to cover up something that is purely psychological. It is possible to distance ones mind from moral decisions too much. Hannah Arendt talks about &quot;functionalism&quot; in the Banality of Evil. A nazi officer can treat shipping people like shipping crates of chom choms. If he doesn&#39;t take the time to psychologically consider what he is doing, he can distance himself from the ethical considerations of it.

Cows and pigs (and similar animals.. deer sheep, etc) are next, as they require more resources to grow, but a single individual goes a lot further.

Here&#39;s the problem with that: first, Peter Singer is a utilitarian. Pure utilitarianism is lazy, bad ethics when compared to deontology or virtue ethics. Second, as Carl Cohen&#39;s essay points out, Peter Singer&#39;s utilitarian argument could be easily re-purposed to argue that the pleasure people (read humans) experience from eating meat outweighs the animal&#39;s pain because humans can experience higher/better pleasures than animals (see J.S. Mill). Third, Carl Cohen&#39;s arguments are much stronger than Singer, because Cohen correctly points out, &quot;A right, properly understood, is a claim, or potential claim, that one party may exercise against another. The target against whom such a claim may be registered can be a single person, a group, a community, or (perhaps) all humankind...Animals (that is, nonhuman animals, the ordinary sense of that word) lack this capacity for free moral judgment. They are not beings of a kind capable of exercising or responding to moral claims. Animals therefore have no rights, and they can have none&quot;.<br><br>This is not to say that the current system of food production is good. That system is inefficient, unnecessarily cruel, and reflects poorly on the society that allows it to continue to exist as it does. But, animals that are not capable of responding to moral claims do not have rights, so it seems that eating animals is morally acceptable. Animals may, in certain societies, have privileges that people bestow upon them, but under no circumstances do they have rights.<br><br>A better argument for moral considerations regarding non-human animals would be to argue that the current system of food production reflects poorly on our character as persons, states, organizations, etc. So, in order to reform our character, we should change how we treat animals, although I would still argue that eating meat is perfectly acceptable, especially when that meat is prepared/brought to market in a way that minimizes the suffering that the animals experience.<br><br>Link to Cohen&#39;s essay: <a href=\"http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/phil1200,Spr07/cohen.pdf\">http://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/phil1200,Spr07/cohen.pdf</a>", "comment_date": "2017-01-17T00:38:54Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"y3-BX-jN_Ac": {"Non-Human Animals: Crash Course Philosophy #42": {"channel_id": "UggVhdlaaV6G5ngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Pontus Welin", "comment_text": "I&#39;d say I&#39;m a speciesist, but this did make me think.

It is not rational or pragmatic to say that you won&#39;t eat meat because you find pigs are cute. Even if then you try and rationalize vegetarianism by the fact that you want to treat living things equally, that is incorrect. We tend to forget that plants too are alive, reproduce, and wish to continue doing both. So either you have to accept that in order to be truly equal then you simply can eat nothing, in which case I think Darwin might have a few words with you, or you have to admit that it is intrinsically hypocritical to criticize us for eating meat. Once we actually improve engineering to the point in which artificial meat is available to the masses, then we can start worrying about animals. For now, we should worry about our species first, and the countless who are going hungry. The same goes for GMOs. We can not both stop this progress and go vegetarian at the same time. Until then, excuse me for putting human beings first. If that is speciesist, then why do we save people from shark attacks? Sharks can feel pain, and they need the meat to survive. What about mosquitos? It&#39;s not there fault that they spread Malaria, West Nile, Zika, and many others that have killed countless of us. Why should we value a Human life over a mosquito? Not to mention all the other viruses that simply want to replicate and mistakenly kill humans because they think they ar in humans. They have nothing against us and we put our best minds to engineering ways ti have them brutally murdered so that We can live. I&#39;ll stop, I think you all get my point.

If the alternatives to eating animals are difficult or impractical compared to the supposed moral gain, then eating animals\u00a0with little other practical or emotional value is fine. <br><br>One could also note that similar arguments could have\u00a0been made for slavery in their time, since during the times when slavery was prevalent there wasn&#39;t really an alternative. Only lords and the wealthy owned land and a single owner could hardly be capable of working all the land they owned, and in many cases many\u00a0lower class people\u00a0could sign up willingly to become indentured servants since the alternative was starving on the streets; such is the case with ancient Rome, who made &quot;consensual slavery&quot; a path to citizenship. Nowadays slavery is impractical in most of the world, as the industrial revolution made the process exponentially easier, which is how Britton outlawed slavery without needing a war over it.<br><br>The reason we still use animals for meat is that largely speaking; its still difficult and impractical to find other methods of consuming large amounts of nutrients and calories, especially protein. Since Protein can only really be found in large quantities in meat, and we need it to retain our brain and muscle structures. So far the only alternatives to animal meat are something like Tofu, which you have to consume a ridiculous amount of to get your recommended intake of tofu, and &quot;synthetic meat&quot; which is currently still only in the &quot;proof of concept&quot; stage and requires a ridiculous amount of money to produce.<br><br>A side note: on the utilitarian side of things, there are some animals we can eat that do not have much if any capacity to suffer, such as the case of fish, who are incapable of feeling pain. However, pragmatically speaking, we&#39;re slowly ruining this source of meat in several ways, such as over fishing natural populations and focusing too much on fish that is popular for its taste to the exclusion of other perfectly edible ones. Its much more practical to utilize fisheries, especially if its an indoor fishery, since you can pack a lot of fish into a small area, and produce relatively\u00a0large amounts of meat; which unlike &quot;wild fish&quot; is unlikely to have as many contaminants that can lead to illness, such as mercury poisoning.

One may make the argument that animals can think and feel whereas a plant may not, but from a purely moral stance, it is still depriving a living creature of the one thing it &quot;wants,&quot; which is to continue to live.

Befriending humans (even indirectly your enemies) by making unspoken contracts to have some respect for their bodies can be good for the species as a whole. Similarly, a pet, by serving a human and making their lives better, can earn a similar contract. Why would we eat the dog when he can do other things for us?
