D-latch is a gated SR Latch. (Unoptimized for illustration purposes.) Most have edge detection in synchronous circuits which can be called flip flops, while asynchronous use latches. Asynchronous circuits are screaming fast, yet power hungry. Most computer circuits are synchronous. ASICs tend to be the ones that are asynchronous but can be either or. A lot of SRAM is build around gate based memory which is costly in terms of area due to gates not wires. These gates need metal layers (wires) to interconnect, so what they do is use lower levels to increase density. Then connect them into cells which reduces wires that would waste area  or density. So they use mid to upper layers for the wires of the cells. Better known as locality. SRAM is fast but expensive and power hungry. Slower DRAM uses more capacitor like mediums sometimes with a single transistor for driving versus whole gates which use multiple transistors. This allows an increase in density but lowers performance and possibly power. However power tends to increase with bit density, but increasing density may also lower power or normalize it out. One thing about wires is they tend to form low pass filters, which creates delays or limits performance. Architecture generally handles this which also tends to decide how the matrix is arranged. These factors also predict the tradeoff of wires to gates in said matrix.", "comment_date": "2020-05-06T01:20:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Demon Lord", "comment_text": "Guy at AMD: Hey write that down write that down!", "comment_date": "2020-05-05T04:07:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chun Ting Li", "comment_text": "How does the computer know which memory is &quot;freed up&quot; and can be used to write new data then?", "comment_date": "2020-05-04T13:23:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nostamine", "comment_text": "no way you can wire a gate output to its input and then it keeps its state ! i have tried it , IT DOES NOT WORK at the transistor level", "comment_date": "2020-05-03T18:33:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Egregor", "comment_text": "Maravillosa....ella ahora est\u00e1 en mi memoria.", "comment_date": "2020-05-03T15:04:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Covington Kua", "comment_text": "This is TOO CLEAR!", "comment_date": "2020-05-03T04:18:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oudom Chem", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpnE6UAfbtU&amp;t=6m44s\">6:44</a> how to get data out 0?", "comment_date": "2020-04-29T03:38:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "firerock277", "comment_text": "Learned the OR gate and AND gates from LBP2 haha", "comment_date": "2020-04-25T21:39:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cristian Luchian", "comment_text": "thank you for this tutorial easy for learning", "comment_date": "2020-04-25T14:35:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yigit Yildirim", "comment_text": "When building the 256-Bit Memory, wouldn\u2019t we be able to connect the grid so that each row connects to Write Enable and each column line connects to Data In/Out for that line of latches?
