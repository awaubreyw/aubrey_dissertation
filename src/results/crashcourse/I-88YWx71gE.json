Earth (you know, this thing with significantly higher gravity than Mars, and with an electromagnetic shield, shielding most of it&#39;s atmosphere from solar winds) is loosing tons of water every day into space (and has been doing so since it&#39;s formation a few billion years ago) because radiation splits Water into H and OH radicals in the upper atmosphere and Earth&#39;s gravity is simply not strong enough to hold H back from escaping Earth&#39;s gravity field. So Earth&#39;s water reserves (assuming no new one would be created chemically) are continuously decreasing and have been doing so for the past 4.5 bn years.<br>Given, Mars is located further away from the Sun so its a little bit colder (but not that much on a nice mars day at noon) and this will reduce the velocity of the H created and therefore the average percentage of particles to have escape velocity, but it also has a significantly weaker gravity field requiring less escape velocity from H, and it is (nearly) totally unprotected from radiation. Also recall, that the mars atmosphere is pretty thin and therefore the vapor pressure of any existing water (be it fluid or solid) will be significantly higher than on earth. How do you think all the Iron on Mars got oxidized to Fe2O3 without molecular O2 in the mars atmorphere ?\u00a0<br>So where is the &quot;mystery&quot; that there is no water anymore ? Absence is exactly what anyone would expect and it should be pretty obvious, where it went.<br>I mean, if i fill a bathtub in the Sahara desert with water, it will also be no mystery to most people where the water has gone, if i look again 3 days later.

The perspective of trying to get the tectonic plates moving is a doozy. But if we did could it possibly make it alot more reasonable to get gasses into the atmosphere to thicken it? But just how the hell could he shake things up enough to try to get mars churning again? The equipment required to dig deep down into the crust and detonate thermonuclear warheads would be huge and expensive. Maybe if we found some way to de-orbit Deimos that might have an affect. It&#39;s the size of a massive asteroid so It doesn&#39;t have too much of a tidal impact on Mars. But it could really deliver a whollop if it impacted. Deimos colliding with the planet could perhaps emulsify part of the surface and shake the surrounding crust pretty hard which might achieve the same affect.
