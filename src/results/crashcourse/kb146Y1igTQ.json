You mentioned that in the post-absorptive state, the body launches gluconeogenesis in order to restore the blood glucose levels by making glucose from amino acids. However, I assumed that in the post-absorptive state, your body would want to break down the storage glycogen to produce glucose through glycogenolysis. So my question is, why does the body prefer gluconeogenesis in this state over glycogenlolysis?
