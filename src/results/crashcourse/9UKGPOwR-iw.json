I love your videos around science. You have inspired me to make a youtube channel myself about nursing. Im a ER RN of almost 3yrs now. I have uploaded my first nursing video today on the 5 reasons I chose nursing. Hope you can come check it out and maybe subscribe for more videos to come! Thank you.

Britain was still using the Julian calendar (named for Caesar) when Newton was born. At the time of the introduction of the new calendar system (using a more accurate figure for the length of the year or how many days it takes the Earth to reach the same point in its orbit), the &#39;Precession of the Equinoxes&#39; had caused the date of the spring equinox to &#39;precess&#39; in the year to about the 10th of March. This was bothersome to the Church because the date of Easter which was tied to the equinox (actually due to Passover&#39;s tie to the equinox) was falling earlier and earlier in the year. It was also bothersome to farmers who needed an accurate calendar to help plan their yearly activities. Britain (and, hence, its colonies) finally capitulated and adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1750. So there are a handful of dates missing from the history of western nations; which year they are missing from depends on how fast that nation&#39;s rulers got off the schneid.

I know there&#39;s a lot to cover, and I might bet that those will be covered in next video, but one thing still ponders me in your sequence of events. Will you, with the topic of Newtonian Physics in regard to motion, light, gravity and much more mention his theory of Ether (Aether) with Newton or with Einstein? To be honest, when you get to Einstein, I do hope you cover the lesser known great debate with Henri Bergson, which was just recently covered in the book by Jimena <i>The Physicist and the Philosopher.</i> I have not read it, but the confrontation between the philosophy of Bergson and the physics of Einstein interests me greatly. I hope that if it is covered, the writers will be charitable with the interpretations of it. <br><br>P.S. This thought came to me as I finished this, but has an indirect relationship with the content of my curiousness.
