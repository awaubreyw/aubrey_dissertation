The syllabus for NEET exam is Indian CBSE class 11 and 12 science books that is physics chemistry botany and   Zoology books and most of the students they feel physics to be so hard so rather than I know using your image in the video please have a paper and a pen and I think you must have all learnt about various tricks at the college level and if you say any formula to reduce the physics tips like in NEET exam questions will be so tricky and you have to use nearly 2 to 3 concepts at a time when you use these concepts it will take  nearly  1to2 Page which is not possible because only three hours of time and 180 questions.  So one minute for one question but if you just take to page today I want to answer than your time will all be wasted and I am sure that you cannot Kranti exam and hence there is a need for tricks both for chemistry physics and biology and I think that this channel is really so good so please so please make tricks and tips from the college level or any other tricks of your own kind and please help us because I have subscribe your channel and I have shared all your videos to my friends and relatives because I felt that it is good and I also promise my friends and relatives that conformally the YouTube channel will make tricks for NEET exam thank you I hope that you will not ignore my request thank you so much", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T10:08:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Luc Zwiep", "comment_text": "Imagine if she wore hexagonal glasses as well xD", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T09:51:06Z", "likes_count": 41}, {"comment_by": "Vysakh Visweswaran", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t get the relationship between hexagon and Saturn \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T08:54:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammed Saquib khan", "comment_text": "The purpleish background is so cool in her videos", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T08:11:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N.
