The idea that THE PLANETS are &quot;falling&quot; in what is &quot;curved space&quot; in RELATION to what is THE SUN is PROVEN to be NONSENSE.

A record will turn at a set speed say 45 RPM.<br>how can the center or near center turn at the same speed as the outer perimeter and arrive back to the start at the same time as the outer?<br>Or let say if you walked around the inner circle of your town at 12 miles per hour<br>from a starting point and at the same time someone else walked around the outer circle of your town<br>at the exact speed 12 miles per hour who would have completed the walk first.<br>I think logic would say, well you would because you had less distance to walk as you were on<br>the inner circle. I hope you&#39;re still with me? So now if you place a record on a turntable<br>and drew a white line from the center to the outer edge then switch on the rotation at 45 RPM the inner circle will arrive back at the starting point the exact same time as the outer circle.? how can this be possible. <br>   Malc UK.", "comment_date": "2019-07-16T09:21:00Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"kKKM8Y-u7ds": {"Newton's Laws: Crash Course Physics #5": {"channel_id": "UgwxESb1wAK0KkLSDvV4AaABAg", "comment_by": "ManiacalShowz", "comment_text": "That rubik&#39;s cube is making me frustratingly happy", "comment_date": "2019-07-08T02:04:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"kKKM8Y-u7ds": {"Newton's Laws: Crash Course Physics #5": {"channel_id": "UgyhmCmY8fx5R-_xZyt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "yocky mohammad", "comment_text": "There is no third Newton&#39;s law when WTC 911 collapses", "comment_date": "2019-06-25T14:48:26Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"kKKM8Y-u7ds": {"Newton's Laws: Crash Course Physics #5": {"channel_id": "UgyekFL3-4_mGrbPPhZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Shriyan V", "comment_text": ".", "comment_date": "2019-06-25T13:50:30Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"kKKM8Y-u7ds": {"Newton's Laws: Crash Course Physics #5": {"channel_id": "UgyZJI85f_PRllt8VO94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Tyler Lauren", "comment_text": "The quality of your videos are amazing, and also interesting!

Buildings have much more than zero resistance even when they are on fire.

It&#39;s not two complicated equations in two unknowns! Just use F=ma. The net force on the elevator is 150 kg x g. The total mass we have to accelerate is 1850 kg. So we have 150 kg x g = 1850 kg x a. Then a = 150 x g/1850, same as her long-winded answer!
