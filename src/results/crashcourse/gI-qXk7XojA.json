Technically, there should be only 5 possible values there, but the overall concept is still the same.

As a CS major myself, this is actually finally a series where I can answer questions and stuff in the comment section! Just a pedantic note for people who want a little more info:<br><br>1) There are also not versions of all the gates. AND, OR, and XOR become NAND, NOR, XNOR, respectively. They are represented by adding a small circle to the end of the gate. While they can be formed just by adding a not gate at the end of the inputs, they are common enough that they get their own specialized parts. You often here people verbally NAND and XNOR when talking about logic, so I think it is interesting to note even though this isn&#39;t computer engineering.<br><br>2) While by convention in truth tables 1 is true and 0 is false, this is often not the case when we actually look at real components. Because of power usage, the opposite is often used. Generally, the more common output is set to 0.<br><br>3) 0 doesn&#39;t actually mean nothing is flowing through. For example, we may set our 1 to 5 volts, and our 0 to 2.3 volts. This allows for us to have an &quot;off&quot; state at 0 volts. We wouldn&#39;t want our computer to be calculating stuff with 0s when it is off!
