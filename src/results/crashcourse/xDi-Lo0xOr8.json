Certainly a nation-state has a single dominant nation and/or a state ideology that promotes one particular nation, but there needn&#39;t only be one nation present. For example, there are two major nations within the state called Israel, but I would not call Israel multinational, because the Israeli state actively seeks to remove and/or destroy the Palestinian nation. Thus, while the land/country is multinational and multiethnic, the ethnonationalist settler colonial state is a nation-state and an ethnostate. Most settler colonial states are conceived of as nation-states, ethnostates, or racial ethnostates. A multicultural state would be one that actively tries to promote the equality of several nations and seek harmony and consensus between them (albeit not necessarily successfully). So, for example, I would describe Nigeria as multinational in that it tries to maintain a balance of power between ethnic groups, but the U.S. as a nation-state practicing several varieties of domestic imperialism, in that the country is founded on white supremacist values and structures that have never been materially addressed.", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T05:15:37Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"xDi-Lo0xOr8": {"Tyranny of the Map: Crash Course Geography #35": {"channel_id": "UgyDO5p2cjvM3MC6C1B4AaABAg", "comment_by": "chacarilla", "comment_text": "Wow I had a class about maps and cartography just weeks ago, funny thing I&#39;m studying medicine", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T01:04:09Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"xDi-Lo0xOr8": {"Tyranny of the Map: Crash Course Geography #35": {"channel_id": "UgzRmg7T6aAdc9aXKmx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Francois Lacombe", "comment_text": "The ladybug moved! \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T00:20:10Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"xDi-Lo0xOr8": {"Tyranny of the Map: Crash Course Geography #35": {"channel_id": "UgzvumouQqPeOaPMC_Z4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Sweet Toother", "comment_text": "Aliz\u00e9 gets better with every video.
