Also, Crash Course economics talks about exclusions and non-exclusions in one of their videos, so the federal government will never exclude someone from a public good which to me is not fair because if someone does not want to support prevention of disease, I, the tax payer paying into, should not have to &quot;deal&quot; with disease because of its lack of treatment. The ones who don&#39;t want to pay for healthcare are actually damaging the ones who pay taxes for it. What would work in return to those who don&#39;t pay taxes for healthcare, or don&#39;t wish to pay, should be required to sign a wavering document stating that their health or protection  is not covered by federal government due to decision to not pay into the public service.

First, why do we call regressive and progressive taxes, regressive and progressive? There are connotations attached to those words that give an average individual not familiar with the definition feelings as to each word&#39;s relative &quot;goodness&quot;. Regressive sounds bad like something is going back to the stone age; whereas,\u00a0progressive sounds like progressing technology. These approaches are not inherently good or bad, only descriptions of two separate methods for the dispersion of taxes; therefore, we should refrain from using words with associated connotations to describe them. Second, I can understand income tax to an extent, the nation has to put in work maintaining it&#39;s economy so that all people can make a living; therefore, taxing the income you made out of that economy is somewhat justified. However, property taxes I do not see as just in any fashion. If I buy clothes, I own them. If I buy a bike, I own that bike. I do not have to keep paying anything to continue owning these items. So, why do I, or anybody, need to pay taxes on the houses and cars that we own? It is as if my house is being held for ransom each year, even after I have purchased it, or built it from scratch for that matter. Now, to put this is a really blunt fashion, let&#39;s examine a thought experiment. I purchase an amount of wood. I own that wood, and I don&#39;t pay any further taxes on that wood after purchasing. Then, I purchase an amount of concrete mix. Again, I own that concrete mix and pay no further taxes to maintain my ownership. Suddenly, I decide to build a house with that wood and concrete. Why is it that I suddenly have to pay in order to maintain my ownership of that wood and concrete? I am not against taxes, taxes are essentially us paying for a service that the government provides. Although, I pay on my car when I have a mechanic fix an issue. I pay on my house when I have an electrician wire up a new room or appliance. I pay the restaurant for food that it provides me. If I live in a house that is maintained by me and people I pay to fix it, why do I have to pay for my own home each year?", "comment_date": "2016-05-16T23:37:14Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"7Qtr_vA3Prw": {"Taxes: Crash Course Economics #31": {"channel_id": "UgjFXiMQc8-8ZXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "richard reeves", "comment_text": "i&#39;m curious as to what services the market would never provide (as opposed to providing in a different manner or level).", "comment_date": "2016-05-16T22:47:39Z", "likes_count": 6}}}, {"7Qtr_vA3Prw": {"Taxes: Crash Course Economics #31": {"channel_id": "Ughbnfe7pIHCB3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Cody Sukosky", "comment_text": "Taxes are necessary for roads, schools, defense. as if there were no taxes we wouldn&#39;t have any of that..
