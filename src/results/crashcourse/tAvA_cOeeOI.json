I wish there was a little more on what&#39;s broken in the aid system. what I mean is that charities are disincentivized to acknowledge failure, both to the public and themselves. They are always hunting donations and that can cause problems, like where an aid worker in Africa is measured on how quickly they deliver a donor soccer ball to the intended child and get a photo to send back to the sponsors in the states. A lot of charities focus on how many cents per dollar donated are spent &quot;on the ground&quot;, when in reality, a charity spending $0.45/$1 effectively is a lot more useful than a charity spending $0.95/$1 ineffectively. <br><br>Charities tend to focus on technological fixes, which are sexy to donors here, but are not all that great when they arrive in the intended country. An example I saw while living in Zambia: a wonderful solar stove was being promoted in villages to save the trees and time for women collecting firewood. It sounded like a great idea! It was a black pot in a large clear bag with a solar reflector. The problem was that the staple food, and by that I mean the food eaten at literally every meal of the week except breakfast, is a thick porridge that requires constant stirring.

For example, looking at historical trends with food aid, you will find that Food Aid often goes up when cost of food drops and aid will go down when food costs goes up. This is opposite from what would seem reasonable. Why would you decrease food aid when cost of food is up and people are having trouble buying food? It is because food aid is most often used as a method of economic regulation. When food costs are high, it is worth more to sell food on the market. While when food costs are low, giving food aid will lower supply for food and help bring back up cost. <br><br>Similarly, much of foreign aid is not money but in-kind services. The US doesn&#39;t give money for computers as foreign aid; it buys computers from Microsoft to donate. While this type of aid helps in building up infrastructure, it is vastly inferior to actually injecting money into developing economies. In fact, some humanitarian groups have started using a new measure of efficiency for their work: &quot;Is the money used for our programs more effective in our programs, or would it be more effective being thrown out a plane window?&quot; No it&#39;s not facetious. Direct cash injections have been shown to be far superior to most other forms of aid, but its use is almost non-existent. <br><br>Instead we get steady streams of Structural Adjustment Loans from the World Back and IMF, designed to change the recipient&#39;s domestic economy to get it ready for the international free market. They do this by making this development aid contingent on removing tariffs, deregulating industries, privatizing public goods and services But these plans have failed. In almost every single case, structural adjustment plans have failed with the exception of Singapore. There is very little statistical evidence that this form of aid has led to any significant economic growth above what would have happened regardless. And those studies that do show benefit usually crumbles under further scrutiny. <br><br>These plans have failed because they make the mistake of assuming recipient countries are the same as the experience of those countries doing the giving. Each country has its own set of cultural and political realities that must all be satisfied in the transition to the open market system. But our current model of foreign aid for promotion of economic growth assumes the same prescription of top down approaches will yield market results and they DO NOT. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there have been some fantastic developments that have occurred because of international aid work: The eradication of TB and small pox, or the success of the Grameen Bank are great examples. But speaking as someone who has worked in foreign aid for many years, the vast majority of foreign aid does very little to help development. And much of the good that DOES happen, happens because of aid workers at the bottom of the totem pole ignoring orders from above and doing just what needs to be done.<br><br>I&#39;ll give one final example.  I once met a Tanzanian nurse working in a Maasai community. She ran a maternal health clinic in the rural community funded by the national government. She was only in the community to provide maternity health services. But the Maasai did not come to her for maternal health. The Maasai have very private cultural rituals around birth and pregnancy, none of which can be satisfied by giving birth in a clinic. So for 3 years this clinic ran without a single client.  And so what did the nurse do? She started offering other services, unsanctioned by the funders. She fixed broken bones, dealt with alcohol poisonings, and whatever other issues arose.  And she forged reports outlining the maternal health cases she definitely was seeing to explain her use of supplies.  In so many cases I see front-line workers making up stories to cover up the work they were actually doing.  Lying about how many cases of Malaria was being seen to make sure flow of money and medications did not stop.", "comment_date": "2016-05-28T03:16:00Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"tAvA_cOeeOI": {"Foreign Aid and Remittance: Crash Course Econ #34": {"channel_id": "UgjpMCaF_Ik3D3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Nathan Cruz", "comment_text": "This is a pretty debated topic in the comment section, but did anyone else get massive amounts of goosebumps when they showed the footage of the parasites being pulled out of the child&#39;s leg?", "comment_date": "2016-05-28T02:43:42Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"tAvA_cOeeOI": {"Foreign Aid and Remittance: Crash Course Econ #34": {"channel_id": "Ugjo4Ck4589LYngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Alex Trofimov", "comment_text": "Thank you for another great unbiased video.", "comment_date": "2016-05-28T02:34:37Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"tAvA_cOeeOI": {"Foreign Aid and Remittance: Crash Course Econ #34": {"channel_id": "UghUSZgd5flIPngCoAEC", "comment_by": "KaliYuga", "comment_text": "Adriene missed her calling; she should have auditioned as the teacher in the movie Serenity.", "comment_date": "2016-05-28T02:22:14Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"tAvA_cOeeOI": {"Foreign Aid and Remittance: Crash Course Econ #34": {"channel_id": "UghgX8rlhd0UvHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "JunoNH", "comment_text": "another crashed corpse lie.<br><br>Israel doesn&#39;t receive &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars a year&quot;, it&#39;s closer to 3.5 billion dollars a year<br><br>only off by 3 billion or so crash corse, not bad for you.", "comment_date": "2016-05-28T01:51:04Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"tAvA_cOeeOI": {"Foreign Aid and Remittance: Crash Course Econ #34": {"channel_id": "UgjLJWrIjg_-OngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Joseph Harris", "comment_text": "Dollar for dollar, on aggregate, charities are more efficient than government in transferring goods and necessities to the poor.
