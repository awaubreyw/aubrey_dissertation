I vividly remember playing 1991&#39;s Hunter on Amiga 600, and that was a 3D polygon open sandbox world, in which you could do missions, use a huge variety of weapons, and drive a surprising number of vehicles, including cars, bikes, tanks, boats, helicopters, and more. That was a full decade before GTA 3, and I&#39;m fairly sure Hunter wasn&#39;t the first.<br><br> Even the developer of GTA 3 - DMA Design, had made a fully 3D open world sandbox type game in 1998. It was called Body Harvest, and it too had a number of weapons to use, and a ridiculous amount of vehicles, including boats and aircraft.

They got those ratings for a reason and even though the standards have shifted such that the bloodless running over of pedestrians in GTA 3 isn&#39;t shocking anymore - this is still a course aimed primarily at kids. The ability to run over pedestrians like that is part of what enabled GTA to gain that rating, and the fidelity of the graphics isn&#39;t supposed to be an excuse. It is supposed to be about the content&#39;s context.<br><br>We wouldn&#39;t show the scenes from a 1970&#39;s horror movie that earned it an R rating in a show for kids just because the fake blood and bad prosthetics are laughable by today&#39;s standards.<br><br>I almost said something about it with the Mortal Kombat footage as well. These games, even when released years later, still carry their original M ratings; for these ratings to be a value, they must be consistently applied and respected. The games industry is self regulated, if it wishes to remain self regulated those standards need to be followed by everyone involved, that&#39;s the threat that created the ESRB in the first place and while it can be argued that to discuss the ratings system it is important to show the context under which it was created and therefore it was valid to show Mortal Kombat, that excuse doesn&#39;t work for GTA.<br><br>I don&#39;t like the arbitrary nature of ratings systems at all, but if it is between them and having a government censorship body overseeing games - like radio has - I&#39;ll take the self regulation. If the powers that be wanted to, they could attack games again and threaten us with censorship like last time if they decide the ESRB isn&#39;t effective. We dance on that line every day.
