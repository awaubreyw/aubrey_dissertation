It is like stirring concrete. If you do not keep stirring it and adding water and new things to it, it hardens. And once it hardens, it can only be broken. People who are learning and living The Way of Knowledge are constantly being renewed and refreshed because they are close to life, and they are close to Knowledge. Their thoughts change, grow and evolve. Their ideas change, grow and evolve. Their conclusions change, grow and evolve. They can do this because there is something greater. There is Knowledge, the dynamic force of life within you, within the world and within the Greater Community as well. Knowledge brings you to the edge of life where you have to learn and adapt, communicate and contribute. This keeps you young, alive and close to the heart of life. Your mind, then, becomes constantly relevant to the present and is able to prepare for the future.&quot;<br><br>This is a quote from a book titled Living the Way of Knowledge. For those who wish to educate themselves about the human mind, about the deeper spiritual intelligence within each person, about the meaning and purpose of life, about the great changes happening in the world and even greater yet to come, about the Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe, you can read this book free online, among many others at <b>NewMessage org</b>", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T19:44:22Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "PC.
