I get that \u201cpsychopath/sociopath\u201d tends to make people think of twisted serial killers or something, but even that is more accurate than the term \u201cantisocial.\u201d They should have used a different term when renaming this disorder.

People with ASPD have a difficult time reading social cues, and instead will observe your behaviors and actions before deciding how to react to you. People with BPD, despite having lower responses to empathy, have a unique condition known as borderline empathy.

People with personality disorders know they have them and generally don&#39;t like the social isolation or psychological distress those symptoms bring them.<br><br>Empathy is NOT sympathy or compassion. All the absence of empathy entails is a disconnect between your emotions and someone else&#39;s. You don&#39;t necessarily understand why or what other people feel! But that has no relation in your compassion or morals. Most statistics relating to aspd are nonsence because so few people can keep their preconceptions in control... It even agree on what the diagnosis is.<br><br>Anyway criminality has no relation to the disorder. All violent criminals will learn to reduce empathy and such as part of their experience. Also most aspd patients don&#39;t have conduct disorder because most of them don&#39;t get caught or simply aren&#39;t diagnosed or even don&#39;t engage in illegal activities instead displaying their lack of ability to learn from consequences and lack of impulse control elsewhere.<br><br>The disorder is likely the least understood because there&#39;s so much psuedo science relating to it. If anything the real disorder is only tertiary to the mythos of the psuchopath, and it&#39;s pure coincidence that such a disorder exists at all, considering there was no real psychology involved with the proposed idea of a sociopath originally.<br><br>In truth neurotypicals are desperate to separate themselves categorically from violent criminals so they made up a disorder, and their made up disorder has little relationship with the real deal.<br><br>Some real info on aspd: they don&#39;t learn from consequences because they were raised in an environment where consequences were inconsistent and unavoidable. Their parents moods would change and with it so would the rules. One day something is encouraged, the next its punished without warning. As for impulse control, the chaos and instability they&#39;re raised in creates an environment where they can&#39;t predict the future or plan ahead. Anything they save for is liable to be taken away, and they&#39;re generally kept miserable at all times. This makes them want to focus entirely on the now, without planning ahead, because that isn&#39;t an option in their home life. Then these thoughts and behaviors become rooted deeply j to their psychy and are almost impossible to unlearn. <br><br>And above all else, the empathy. I cannot stress enough how unnecessary this is. We can&#39;t empathize because the people who raised us fakes emotions in order to manipulate and control us. There was no rhyme or reason to their feelings, so there was no way to understand. Then we were often punished for our own emotions, and exposed to extremely distressing situations and material often enough to desensitize us. Nonetheless, anyone with aspd can understand how you feel if you use your words. We&#39;re not masters of manipulation, we just have to learn the social ques and such consciously because it&#39;s not intuitive to us. We don&#39;t hide our disorder in order to manipulate people, we do it to avoid your prejudice towards us, because we&#39;re instantly dehumanized and assumed an enemy once it&#39;s known.", "comment_date": "2019-09-25T07:45:35Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"4E1JiDFxFGk": {"Personality Disorders: Crash Course Psychology #34": {"channel_id": "Ugw11xTA7P225tQhi6F4AaABAg", "comment_by": "eldor k", "comment_text": "Apperantly i have schizoid personality disorder.<br>I always felt like i was different from everyone i knew, but it is the only way i know i can feel, so i couldn&#39;t understand what normal means exacly....<br>Im in therapy", "comment_date": "2019-09-19T10:52:41Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"4E1JiDFxFGk": {"Personality Disorders: Crash Course Psychology #34": {"channel_id": "UgxRFzxVFhs3dEsSqyN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Awkwardly Silenced", "comment_text": "Tony Soprano killed Ralphie because he was a psychopath, after raphie burned down the stable, killing the horse....tony has compassion and empathy, he was just raised with twisted morals.

( NPD, sociopathy and psychopathy are normally people in positions of power within a group or organisation. These people abuse power. These are the only ones who deserve a label. ) <br><br>People on the lower spectrum have suffered at the hands of abuse of power. Narcissism and codependency is a POWER STRUGGLE within yourself. That means you struggle with BOTH. You are not one or the other. (So sometimes you&#39;re the bird and sometimes your the windscreen.) Their is a swinging of the pendulum dependent on the situation. Most people refuse to acknowledge their own dark side or flaws and pretend to only be on one side. Usually everyone else is the narcissist. They have issues with self empowerment because they have seen abuse of power. <br><br>Those that abuse power LOVE power more than they love LOVE. That&#39;s why they are incurable because their love of power (control (overt) /manipulation(covert) is what they need to feel alive. These people are destructive.  Standing your ground against these antagonists may look like control but is a necessity. The ones who are stuck in dysfunctional cycles, normally have had no support and have experienced abuse ( either mental, emotional, spiritual and physical or all ) most of their lives. These people just need healing and can transition back to a balanced state. They just don&#39;t have the right model which is what they are subconsciously searching for. But keep ending up in the same dynamics. Until they understand that the way that they grew up was wrong they probably will continue to form these same relationships. Over and over again. So they actually are the victim. And telling them they are playing the victim is REDUNDANT!<br><br>I also don&#39;t agree that emotional detachment is a sign of these labels. They are emotionally &quot;Disconnected&quot; from reality. Because of what happened to them. Most of them suffer from PTSD (whether they are on the narc or codependent side of the spectrum) Detachment is healthy. Staying connected to the emotional energy of unhealthy people IS unhealthy. Your mental and emotional health should always be first priority. Leaving or cutting people off does not make you the narcissist.

It\u2019s confusing because one person from my care team has said that it\u2019s just attention seeking and that\u2019s really terrible to hear. Especially when you have just come out of inpatient admission for attempts of your own life and have had more then several other admissions for mixed reasons. Borderline personality disorder (EUPD) is extremely hard to live with and it\u2019s hard to handle social aspects especially as I have Aspergers, additional learning difficulties and a lot of traits of PTSD and OCD though not enough to make that they would class as their own diagnoses (thank you brain, sorta). It takes a long time to diagnose someone with a personality disorder and I understand why but it\u2019s still difficult to deal with the change that happens when people think you have psychosis, anxiety and depression  and then later find out that it\u2019s actually this disorder. There is a noticeable change before you even get the new diagnosis. Which I suspect is down to them ~obviously~ having to discuss any changes in care or/medication before making them. I\u2019m just glad there is a video that makes it feel like I am not invalidated for being ill in a certain way. I know a lot of the trusted people will give off incorrect information about us.

Why do people get so angry and upset at murderers who kill people in cold blood and would do it thousands of times over of given the chance?

They dont care, they dont feel remorse, and they dont feel upset or regret. Why do people get so angry? Its not like it will do anything?? Whats the point?? Idk its just people with these disorders cant help themselves, so why do people act as if theyre human the same way we are human. It doesnt make sense?? Its like getting angry at a lion or tiger because it killed someone, u dont because u know its got different thoughts patterns from u. Idk its something thats always puzzled me. Also, is it ever the case that anyone ever truly cares about another person? Is it possible? Everything we do is for ourselves isnt it? We feel bad for people because it will make us feel as if we are having the right thoughts, we would fie for someone so we wont have to live the burden of not having them in our lives. If u would die for someone it just means ur so attached to them that u wouldnt want to deal with the mess of not having them in ur life. We never truly do good for anyone else ever?? All our anxieties about hurting someones feelings or whatever all come to the fact that that person might not like u anymore, or ur reputation will get ruined if others found out. We have get married and have children to place value next to ourselves as someone who finally has a family, and to reap the emotional benefits that comes with the satisfaction of raising a child or being cared for by ur significant other. I mean the reason we buy expensive gifts for people is to have a rush of endorphins when we see their happiness, a result of our satisfaction in ourselves because now someone thinks highly of us and our reputation is raised. The human brain simply doesn&#39;t function in a way to allow any self less act ever, everything humans do is selfish, antisocial personalities just dont care about consequences of their reputation being tarnished, which is why we call them disgusting.

There&#39;s just not much of an emotional connection. There&#39;s a little, like, I have felt shocked when someone told me she broke up with her boyfriend. I also have a strong shame and guilt reaction, even when it&#39;s not logical. In fact, when I empathize with others the most is when I&#39;ve hurt them in some way, even by accident. I think my high level of responsibility contributes to that, and I think there&#39;s a strong genetic component, because my mother was the same way.

Sometimes I wonder if maybe not having friends growing up kinda broke me as far as developing empathy. That&#39;s probably unrealistic, but... It bothers me, because I worry that I&#39;m missing out on the most wonderful thing in life.

I ended up brushing it off then and tried getting on with my life. 6 and a half years later and after a lot of social jettisoning and generally not pursuing relationships, ever, i was approached by someone who wanted to test the waters of a relationship with me. boom, it came right back to me and again, and looking back at the years between i had clearly and consistently displayed those symptoms.<br>so the setting is like, beginning of last year i was hospitalised after heavy drinking and deep cuts, my crisis team referral did nothing. i was discharged without assessment. mid last year, saw a private psychiatrist. he had his own ideas about what was wrong, picked up on my unwillingness to engage in casual sex for relationship building, and recommended psychosexual counselling. late last year, crisis team referral after heavy drinking and self harm again. this time i was &quot;assessed&quot; by psychiatrists... who did nothing.<br>I suspect personality disorders but i&#39;m not going to go in there and say &quot;hey, i think i have this and that or such and such&quot;. that skews the assessment and introduces human error. so when i saw the top consultant psychiatrist in the unit i handed her a list of 9 different tools available to psychiatrists for assessment... she hadn&#39;t heard of a <i>single</i> one. i was fucking shocked to say the least. here&#39;s the list.<br>Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI)<br>Coolidge Axis II Inventory + / Coolidge Assessment Battery (CATI+ / CAB)<br>Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)<br>Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)<br>International Diagnostic Checklists (IDCL / IDCL-P)<br>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID)<br>ICD-10 Symptom Checklist for Mental Disorders<br>International Personality Disorder Examination (IPDE)<br>Lists of Integrated Criteria for Evaluation and Taxonomy in Depression (LICET-D)<br>But no, see, psychiatrists are quacks who would rather engage in unscientific woo and fluff, and think that them taking a history and making a stab in the dark with their own opinions is more productive and patient-centered than using any of the above.<br>Meanwhile, I had downloaded the IPDE and decided to go through it myself for a laugh. Multiple times I found myself trying to explain away the positive scoring for Anankastic (Obsessive-Compulsive). But the further along I went, the more it dawned on me that that could actually be a thing for me, and then it all fell into place. It not only explained me, my excessive need to plan ahead, and my conduct in workplaces where I would shout up the chain of command if I didn&#39;t think my superiors were pulling their weight, or stole peoples&#39; jobs when I could do a better, more thorough and consistent job than them (My former manager still says after 2 and a half years that he still hasn&#39;t found anyone with my work ethic even though there were certain &quot;personality clashes&quot; that came with it). It also explains my parents. Both workaholics who need to do their job a certain way. My dad, who I once worked for, is a very astute businessman, who pulled together a <i>fantastic</i> team of people who gave me far too high an expectation for workplaces at the beginning of my working life. A man who takes measure twice cut once to extremes. A guy who uses jigs, frames, set squares, spirit levels and postcrete to construct industrial-duty raised beds in his own garden. And my mum, a GP who overstretches herself in working hours simply because she refuses to treat patients as if they&#39;re on a conveyor belt. They&#39;re also both neurotic and passive-aggressive to the hilt. But yeah, bottom line is the anankastic was so ego-syntonic for me that I didn&#39;t even notice it and honestly still feel justified in calling out every single incompetent fucking jobsworth I have to come in contact with on their bullshit, and for not working to MY exacting standards...

I have a friend who has many many traits common to quiet bpd that is not as negative towards others but instead turns a lot of that judgment inwards on themselves. After reading a lot of these comments she felt terrible like she was using the label of bpd and her own self diagnosis (which seems accurate to me) for her own gain and was hurting others by doing so. She has doubted having bpd before now and I tried to explain that the label doesn&#39;t matter and I think she realized that for a while. However she also tends to be forgetful sometimes and likely doesn&#39;t recall all that I said at this point. Instead i think she just sees how many of the people in these comments are frustrated with people who are on tumblr and have self diagnosed with bpd. She definitely has many issues stemming from her bpd traits and trying to explain that label or no label her issues are still valid because they cause her problems. She also has anxiety and depression as well. She has panic attacks and is easily scared by loud noises and struggles to maintain any form of happiness for longer than two to five hours at a time depending on her surroundings. Making it through each day of school without the intense urge to leave and escape from the stress of grades is also very difficult for her. I guess she&#39;s just always worried about being invalid and that she could be hurting others by saying she has bpd. if I am correct that seems to actually match how someone with quiet bpd would likely feel because that kind of self doubt and not wanting to hurt others seems to fit some descriptions of bpd rather accurately. at one point someone in these comments said that pds are defined in the fact that someone matches a large number of the traits from the pd and it causes them problems. She had been hospitalized once before. This was shortly before her breakup with her boyfriend and favorite person who used to encourage her to talk to him about anything but after she started getting clingy he started to drift away. he said he&#39;d never leave her but eventually did and she tried to tell him about how she thought she had bpd but he didn&#39;t seem to care or look into the possibility because it seemed like a plea for attention to him. Overall I think he was just inconsiderate however she often finds herself believing what he said them proceeds to feel invalid and worthless until I can convince her otherwise. I believe this is one of two people causing a large number of bpd related traits to surface. The second of those two people is her own mother who has always been very direct and says she causes more problems by not being okay and gets mad at her for being depressed and having anxiety issues. Her mom homeschooled her until freshman year of highschool and as a result feels like a lot of what she does isn&#39;t good enough or is insignificant compared to others. She is very good at both art and singing however her anxiety often keeps her from performing in front of a teacher who is supposed to judge and critique her or any form of crowd. she recently attended a drama performance in which she recognized a girl from school and assumed that the girl hated her because she had dropped out of her drama class because she couldn&#39;t handle the stress and thought she wasn&#39;t good enough and compared herself to the performer. however after the show the performer hugged her despite that they didn&#39;t really know each other and thanked her for coming to watch. So both her ex and her mom make her feel invalid and turns all of it into negativity and lack of self worth and an overall feeling of hopelessness that she won&#39;t get anywhere in life. I probably shouldn&#39;t be saying all of this personal stuff in the youtube comments but I guess I&#39;m just looking for someone with anything close to a similar experience and this is where I&#39;d most likely find it. it is very very difficult to help her get rid of any issues because anything that could possibly be considered a downside or an issue she caused will be taken as far worse than it is. how do you help someone who literally has trouble functioning because of the severity and combination of bpd anxiety and depression but still is unsure if she even has it. reading back through all of this I realize there is far more I could include because there are so many things that play into the explanation of how she feels. In my opinion I think she definitely had bpd or at least a large number of the traits and they do cause her issues but the label itself doesn&#39;t matter. but given enough time to herself she can convince herself of anything based on the smallest thought to start it all. So yeah I guess I&#39;m just looking for any advice on how to help her. (I should probably include some stuff about myself as well now that I think about it.

Or not.<br><br>This is going to be a long comment. It will probably sound like something straight out of a psychology publication but without any formal knowledge of psychology. These are just the things that I&#39;ve found out during my attempts to understand my &quot;condition.&quot; Regardless of the likely invalidity of everything that follows, all of this has helped me understand how to deal with my ASPD and possibly use it to better my life. To those who are still curious, read on.<br><br>Aside from those who devolve into common criminals, antisocial personality disorder creates as many opportunities in life as it destroys.<br><br>Oversimplified, people with ASPD lack two primary things: morality and empathy. From my admittedly limited understanding, morality is the ability to distinguish &quot;right&quot; from &quot;wrong&quot; in an emotional or empathic context whereas ethicality (if that term is correct) is the ability to comply with standards or rules of conduct - usually in a professional environment such as a school or hospital, but also in the sense of social conduct. Laws are an example of ethics - regardless of if they are &quot;moral,&quot; they must be obeyed or consequences can occur.<br><br>In an attempt to demonstrate the difference between morality and ethicality, imagine this scenario. You are a nurse. A terminally ill cancer patient is near the end of his or her life, and is in immense pain. He or she pleads for you to simply end it for them. Some may view doing so on his or her request to be the moral action to take, others may not. However, the undoubted ethical action to take would be to decline the patient&#39;s request.<br><br>Some people with ASPD, while incapable of morality (the term for this is &quot;amoral&quot; as in without morality - rather than &quot;immoral&quot; as in against morality) are still capable of ethicality. While I am by no means a professional, I suspect that the reason is because morality requires a conscious decision to me made using one&#39;s empathy as the criteria for judgement. Those with ASPD don&#39;t have empathy, or perhaps have a severely limited form of it if they are lucky.<br><br>Ethics, however, are often outlined in a code of conduct. In the case of socially ethical conduct, where a code of conduct is not really present, the conduct can be observed and learned through trial and error. Ethics can be learned whereas morals cannot. The presence of morality may greatly assist the development of ethicality, but it is not required.<br><br>So, those with ASPD lack morality and empathy. The lack of empathy is likely the cause for the lack of morality. Furthermore, it can be reasoned that the lack of morality can potentially hinder the growth of ethicality. A lack of ethicality leads to the disorderly, potentially dangerous behaviors associated with ASPD. Therefore, if this is correct, the lack of empathy is the cause of the disorder, or at least it is the primary cause.\u00a0<br><br>Everything to do with ASPD seems to revolve around lack of empathy. So what is empathy?<br><br>Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. That&#39;s what a quick Google search says. This is the part where my case of ASPD stops being a hindrance in my personal research/musing and starts becoming an information source that most don&#39;t have access to.<br><br>I&#39;d like to assert that there are two variations of empathy: natural and artificial.<br><br>Natural empathy is the ability that most people have to immediately and effortlessly recognize and respond to the emotions of others. It takes place subconsciously. This is the thing that nobody with ASPD has access to.<br><br>Artificial empathy is still the ability to recognize and respond to the emotions of others - but not automatically and not without effort. It takes place consciously. You can call it artificial empathy, pseudoempathy, emulated empathy, or anything to that effect.<br><br>Imagine that emotions are math problems and empathy is the set of operations needed to solve them.<br><br>Natural empathy is like a calculator; you punch in the numbers and get the result.<br><br>Artificial empathy is like solving the math problems by hand. The entire emotional equation has to be analyzed and variables - facial expression, body language, breathing patterns, tone of voice, perspiration levels, eye contact, and more - need to be accounted for. All of the operations have to be performed manually.<br><br>Both forms of empathy get the same result, but artificial empathy takes longer and has much more room for error.<br><br>Why is this important? Because with training, people with ASPD can learn to perform artificial empathy.<br><br>With this, those with ASPD can function in society. They can maintain personal relationships and such. However, it is incredibly difficult.<br><br>In my experience, just so much as having a simple conversation can be mentally exhausting - at least when it comes to talking to people I don&#39;t know well. You see, there are subtle differences in the way we all express emotion. Natural empathy isn&#39;t fooled by these subtle differences, but artificial empathy certainly is. The more you get to know somebody, the more familiar those differences become. There are some people who I know very well. With these people, I feel as if my artificial empathy can rival natural empathy. However, with absolute strangers, I&#39;m a train wreck. I once attended one of my college&#39;s social events. I ended up leaving within half an hour with an intense headache - induced by the mental stress caused by using artificial empathy constantly on multiple complete strangers.<br><br>As with the &quot;emotional calculator&quot; example I gave, solving difficult equations constantly while trying to participate in conversation is not the most pleasant of experiences.<br><br>While learning how to emulate empathy can allow a person with ASPD to function in society, there will always be limits.<br><br>But speaking of limits, empathy is not only a tool; it is also a limiter.<br><br>Often, empathy can cause one to overlook things. Morals are, by nature, subjective. They vary between societies, between people, and even between situations. As empathy - and by extension, morals - can have a massive effect on decision-making, there are some decision-making situations that may be better off without the subjectivity that morals introduce. Indeed, decisions that require objectivity are potentially best suited for somebody with ASPD. &quot;Needs of the Many vs Needs of the Few&quot; situations are often best handled without morality limiting the options that one considers. In fact, morals may prevent one from paying any attention to the solution that just may be best for everyone.<br><br>A lack of morality can potentially lead to a more objective worldview as well. Instead of getting caught up with &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong,&quot; people without empathy can focus more on looking at the world for what it really is. As for what the world really is, it isn&#39;t really my place to say here.<br><br>So yeah. Sorry for the wall of text.

No joke when I was in the 3rd grade this girl was my friend in the beginning of the year I was only friends with her for the wants of not wanting to feel unloved anymore but that is not the point of this sentence so moving on so we would try and twist each others arms to break them it was my idea by the way so she ended up spraining her arm her mother told her not to be friends with me anymore so towards the end of the year we were riding the bus home from school we were in the back and my ex-friend and a couple of girls that were her friends started making fun of me. I warned her that she should stop while she was ahead well to make a long story short she did not heed my warning and continued to make fun of me I so happened to have a pencil in my hand it had been newly sharpened and so when she did not stop I turned around really fast a stabbed her in the leg with the pencil and I stabbed her so hard it had gotten stuck in her leg. To say that I felt sorry for doing it would be a lie. I ended\u00a0up with a suspension and I could not ride the bus for the rest of the year. A more recent occurrence of my behavior is that about a month ago my little brother whom is 20 months younger than me with him being 14 and me being 16 was has little brothers do getting on my last nerve and lying to our mother about something so I grabbed my bow and arrow and went into the kitchen where we had all been gathered I drew the arrow and told him that if he had not told mom the truth in the next five seconds I was going to shoot him. Fear struck in my brother and he told mom the truth which made me happy and I resumed dinner as if nothing had happened. Also I&#39;m in the 10th grade at a new school after three years of being homeschooled and surprisingly have friends in my school life but I do not bring them to my outside of school life. One of my friends Koty is a consistent crier in which she will cry many times a day so one day I was going to class and she was telling me and some other people about something that made her cry. The others that were around us were confronting her while I stood and watched it made me quite uncomfortable and I did not have anything to say as far as what made her cry was concerned or I showed a lack of response to the situation. I feel nothing towards others the excepts are animals which I find to be helpless creatures who cannot defend themselves. I do however play and pet them rough or so I have been told but I do not mean to. I also have an over imagination where I see things in my head as clearly as if they were playing out right in front of me. This imagination can stretch from the idea of torture to me being a princess of a far away land. When I was 10 for 2 years I thought I was a vampire and would cut my fingers to get blood from them to drink I later dropped that belief and went into a depressed mood for a good year and half and was even to the point of cutting and sexually wanting\u00a0do things with classmates on a daily bases in which one time during gym class we had these speed stack cups and I processed to make the cups do the deed while making sexual noises in front of the class and teacher to which sent me to the principal. I later that year cut myself with a pair of art scalpels in front of classmates and I left my journal in that class to which someone read it landing me in going home and to getting one months worth of therapy recommended by the school. A more recent occurrence of an outburst of anger was when this boy was being rude so I took his bookbag at lunch and threw it away in the trash to show him not to mess with me so the next day at lunch he confronted me on it I told him yes it was me the farther we got into the lunch period he kept talking shut saying he was going to throw my bookbag in the trash so I stood up slammed my bookish on to the table a demanded he throw it away if he was so tough well then he said I was lucky I was a girl because if I wasn&#39;t he would have fought me to which I replied saying it doesn&#39;t matter if I was a girl hit me. This caught the attention of everyone in the cafeteria including the principal the boy and his gang of friends walked away with no further commentary on their part. I feel that my behavior is not normal but what am I to do about it. If anyone has anything the would like to say by shedding some light on my present issue of my life please feel free to leave a comment.

I can&#39;t tell you how many single mothers I&#39;ve spoken with whose ex-boyfriends have abused their children. When I inquired more about these boyfriends, they had all the traits of sociopathy (or psychopathy) BEFORE the mothers introduced them to their children. Had they known the traits- they could have prevented so much heartache. It is not their fault. This subject is so confusing- WHO CARES! Just know the traits, because they are similar. Do they blame everyone but themselves? Are they controlling? Do they sometimes mix lies with the truth? Does what they say congruent to what they do? Do they gossip behind closed doors? Are they charming, gorgeous, talented, sexy, intelligent, and/or funny? They will use their gifts to disarm you and get into your psyche. Learn the traits of the type 1 sociopath and you&#39;ll have a good idea about all of them. Type 1 sociopaths rarely desire to do anything illegal-just immoral.

I am an adult now and though I wasn&#39;t able to see a therapist or even the school counselor because my mother strongly disapproved at the time, I can now. I started seeing one a few months ago and it seems we agree the most likely diagnosis is BPD. My mother is mentally ill and I had a difficult childhood, my therapist told me it is common for children with mentally ill mothers to develop BPD. Though, I have known for a very long time something was wrong. I thought at first it was Bipolar disorder, because that is what my mother is diagnosed with, but I read that severe mood swings are more often caused by a trigger in BPD, but not in Bipolar disorder. My mood swings also can cycle very quickly which is another thing much more likely to be associated with BPD. The point is, I did know something was wrong. I find it hard to believe someone with severe symptoms such as mine wouldn&#39;t feel like there was indeed an issue. I have extremely self destructive behaviors that I am compelled to do. If I don&#39;t I will lash out angrily and I can&#39;t help it. I do get so angry, so sad, so anxious. I am rarely able to keep friends. I either am clinging to the point that I am suffocating or I can&#39;t feel a connection with them and drift away. It can all change too with just one word or comment. Living this way is difficult and is a major problem. My rage translates to destructive behaviors so I don&#39;t lash out at others, I try to channel it toward myself instead. I can&#39;t cope with normal situations and have had to go to the hospital for a panic attack. Please everyone out there who may be reading this, if you know someone with an issue like this, make an effort to understand. I know it&#39;s hard to be around me sometimes, but being abandoned is especially hard for me and it&#39;s happened before. Please treat others who may be suffering with care. There could never be enough understanding and kindness in the world. I&#39;m sharing for the sake of sharing some first hand knowledge and maybe if anyone has input about ways they know to handle what is going on with me. I would always be open to hearing that. :) Thank you for making this video.

She used my PTSD against me and made me like her servant, I had drop out of high school to work, take care of my little brother who had severe bipolar and ADHD as if I was his mom, but told me I wasn&#39;t allowed to act like his mom and grounded me if he told her I did anything at all wrong even if I didn&#39;t(needless to say I wasn&#39;t allowed to have friends or a social life) and she never got me help. Well she eventually sent me to a therapist who tried to tell her I needed a psychiatrist to really diagnose me and she took me once, didn&#39;t listen to anything they said except ADHD and barely let me try the Adderall they gave me before then deciding I didn&#39;t have any problems. I finally told her I didn&#39;t want to see her anymore a few years ago and have been trying to live on my own. It&#39;s hard to admit you need to leave your family but if you have abusive parents get out as soon as you can and try to find people to help you if you need it! I should have left the house and told her to leave me alone as soon as I was 18 and I recommend the same to any others in my position.", "comment_date": "2014-10-15T04:57:36Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"4E1JiDFxFGk": {"Personality Disorders: Crash Course Psychology #34": {"channel_id": "Ugg6WMLXDyH4YHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jayde S", "comment_text": "Yayayay!

I have been waiting for this episode. I&#39;m very pleased to see it.<br><br>I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and it&#39;s a tough diagnosis to carry due to its stigma among professionals and laymen alike. On the other hand, I&#39;ve been relieved to find many people rethinking how they view and approach it and creating new models of treatment. Personally, I&#39;ve found DBT most effective. The skills that model puts forth, combined with the strong emphasis on validation, seem to work very well with both myself and others I&#39;ve met. In my city, we have outpatient therapy options. I&#39;m not sure what magical sorting hat they use in the office, but there are two basic programs: Adult Outpatient (AOP) and Intensive Outpatient (IOP). I was placed in IOP, and noticed nearly every single person in the program was Borderline, with a rare Cluster A or Antisocial patient in the mix. IOP, at least, strictly followed the DBT model, with classes on self-esteem or art therapy tossed in to round it out. It was pretty effective. I still keep my DBT papers lying around to read through when I need a refresher or guidance.\u00a0<br><br>I&#39;m not going to paint a happy face on the disorder--Borderline patients can be manipulative and suicidal and angry and cruel and impulsive and extreme. They can also be some of the sweetest, most earnest, empathetic people you will ever meet. We operate in extremes, in black and white thinking, and frequently internalize and then project onto the nearest person who does wrong by us. Just being aware that we are doing this isn&#39;t enough, and finding a treatment model and team and sticking to it can be a challenge in an of itself. Luckily, I really believe there have \u00a0been huge strides in both understanding and treating BPD, and I&#39;m hopeful it will only get better. It heartens me to see a video talking about it and other personality disorders on such a prolific channel.
