For subversive advocacy (speech that advocates lawlessness) to fall outside the protections of the First Amendment the speech must satisfy a two-part test.  The speech must consist of (1) advocacy directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and (2) speech that is likely to incite or produce such action. This is known as the Brandenburg test. In applying prong one of the Brandenburg test, the Court engages in a literal interpretation of the speech to determine whether it advocates immediate lawless action as compared to speech that advocates lawlessness at some future time or only conditionally. In applying prong two, the best evidence of whether speech is likely to produce imminent lawless action is if there actually was lawless activity immediately following the speech.<br><br>2) Fighting Words. Fighting words are a narrow category of unprotected speech that are defined as words spoken in a face to face exchange such as personal insults or epithets which by their very utterance are likely to cause the person to whom they are addressed to respond with violence directed at the speaker. Fighting words must be insults personally directed at the person they are addressed to and not political statements that the hearer finds deeply offensive to his or her beliefs. Therefore, it is necessary to distinguish between provocative political speech that is fully protected and unprotected fighting words.<br><br>3) True Threats. True threats are defined as \u201cstatements where the speaker means to communicate a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence to a particular individual or group of individuals.\u201d To be a true threat, \u201cthe speaker need not actually intend to carry out the threat.\u201d True threats are distinguishable from political hyperbole, which is protected political expression. Intimidation \u201cis a type of true threat, where the speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death.\u201d <br><br>4) Obscenity. As defined by Miller v. California\u2019s three prong test, to be obscene material must (1) be a work that the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest and (2) the work must depict or describe, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable obscenity law, and (3) the work, taken as a whole, must lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.<br><br>5) Child Pornography. Under New York v. Ferber, child pornography is an unprotected category of expression and consists of visual depictions of actual children engaged in sexual activity or the lewd exhibition of the genitals. Unlike obscenity, it is not judged by the work taken as a whole and, therefore, can consist of isolated segments of an entire work. It also is unprotected even if it doesn&#39;t appeal to the prurient interest or portray child sexual activity in a patently offensive manner. In addition, in contrast to obscenity, the Court has, thus far, not carved out an exemption for child pornography with serious value. On the other hand, the reason for the Court\u2019s willingness to allow child pornography to be prohibited is to protect actual children. Thus, child pornography is limited to visual images of actual children. <br><br>6) Commercial speech that concerns illegal activity or commercial speech that is false or misleading. Under the Central Hudson test, commercial speech is only protected if it concerns legal activity and if the content is true and not misleading. This limit on the protection of commercial speech was used by the Supreme Court in the recent case of United States v. Williams. In that case, the Court upheld a federal law that criminalizes pandering of child pornography (advertising, promoting, presenting, distributing or soliciting) even if the defendant does not possess any actual child pornography because the advertising of an illegal product (child pornography) is not speech protected by the First Amendment.", "comment_date": "2018-02-15T00:16:46Z", "likes_count": 4}}}, {"Zeeq0qaEaLw": {"Freedom of Speech: Crash Course Government and Politics #25": {"channel_id": "UgxFf6PR-bKCRJx60Hx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Max Sainz", "comment_text": "It&#39;s pretty disgusting that you can buy politicians and get away with it...", "comment_date": "2018-02-03T11:37:14Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"Zeeq0qaEaLw": {"Freedom of Speech: Crash Course Government and Politics #25": {"channel_id": "Ugyt1EOD6MPcB54SLpt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "SRDF", "comment_text": "Hate speech doesn&#39;t exist.", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T17:24:38Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"Zeeq0qaEaLw": {"Freedom of Speech: Crash Course Government and Politics #25": {"channel_id": "UgyTDu4cEwl8LBku5f94AaABAg", "comment_by": "RUOWEI", "comment_text": "you aren&#39;t entitled to your own opinion. you&#39;re entitled to your <i>informed</i> opinion.", "comment_date": "2018-01-27T09:57:40Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"Zeeq0qaEaLw": {"Freedom of Speech: Crash Course Government and Politics #25": {"channel_id": "Ugya7gIUfoghVv1oXi14AaABAg", "comment_by": "Valley", "comment_text": "HATE SPEECH LAW - THE CURE THAT\u2019S FAR WORSE THAN THE DISEASE\r<br>In the debate between free speech supporters and advocates of hate speech law, free speech supporters argue that, yes unfortunately in society there is a terrible disease called hate speech. However, despite this, the ONLY speech that should be penalised legally is threatening speech and speech that incites violence. We do have to think about things that can be done to lessen hate speech in society, see later, but making hate speech laws is not the answer.  Why? - because the proposed cure for hate speech, hate speech law, IS FAR WORSE THAN THE DISEASE of hate speech. That old saying \u201cthe cure is worse than the disease\u201d is so true in this debate. Of course there is a price that we have to pay for this allowance of freedom of speech, and that price is the possibility of being badly offended or upset by what others say, but this is a far lesser evil and price to pay than the negative outcomes that hate speech laws produce in a society or have on an individual.\r<br>\r<br>    What are the negative outcomes of hate speech laws for a society or for an individual?\r<br>\r<br>\u2022\tHate speech laws stop people from saying what they really think, because everyone starts worrying that what they say will get them into serious legal trouble or make them lose their job. This means that totally free debate and the free flow of ideas are stopped. The positive outcomes that could have arisen from this free flowing debate and totally honest dialogue are all lost to society. Totalitarian states are always less creative and productive than free states.\r<br>\u2022\tThe fully free market place of ideas can flush out bad ideas. By exposing bad ideas to the disinfecting light of free speech we can improve society.\r<br>\u2022\tWith hate speech laws society becomes an Orwellian nightmare where everyone is afraid that other people will report on them. In addition some people will make false hate speech claims for revenge or other purposes. This would be a terrible society to live in.\r<br>\u2022\tHate speech laws can be used in a political way to further a political agenda by preventing political opponents from putting their case forward - a terrible outcome for society.\r<br>\u2022\tIn denying someone else\u2019s speech you are denying yourself (and society) the right to learn something that might change your life (or society) for the better.\r<br>\u2022\tThe person who says something outrageous, in your eyes, may have put a lot of thought into what they have said and, even if outrageous to you, there may be a grain of truth in what they have to say that both you and the rest of society may learn a lot from.\r<br>\u2022\tOther people\u2019s outrageous views, in your eyes, may force you to look again at what you believe and why you believe it, making you go back to first principles and improving your understanding of why you believe what you believe and your understanding of the issues involved. A very valuable outcome.\r<br>\u2022\tIf you and society in general are shielded from different ideas and perspectives you (and society) will not reach your maximum potential.\r<br>\u2022\tIf people can\u2019t say what they truly feel, they may become frustrated and take more aggressive or violent routes to vent the issues that they feel strongly about.\r<br>\u2022\tIt is particularly important to defend the speech of the person who thinks differently. That person may be you one day.\r<br>\u2022\tThe FIrst Amendment of the USA was particularly passed in order to allow a minority to say what the majority may find offensive. You may find yourself in that minority one day.\r<br>\u2022\tBy curtailing the free speech of others, you may in future find that you yourself are prevented from speaking, that is, you are in potentia creating a rod for your own back.\r<br>\u2022\tIn the USA you have no right to be free from being offended. If you don\u2019t like what you hear it is up to you to debate and counter what you disagree with.\r<br>\r<br>                                               In addition we have to ask these questions\r<br>\r<br>\u2022\tWho would you want to entrust to decide, for you, what hate speech is? \r<br>\u2022\tWhat individual on earth is uniquely qualified to make this critical decision for you? \r<br>\u2022\tWho is to decide, for you, where the line is to be drawn between speech and hate speech?\r<br>\u2022\tDo you want to be ruled by what is in effect a \u201cThought Police\u201d?\r<br>\u2022\tOnce we as a society lose critical thought and freedom of speech what is left between us and totalitarianism?\r<br>\r<br>                                                                     In Conclusion\r<br>\r<br>\u2022\tNobody should be in fear for their liberty for speech, unless it is threatening speech or speech inciting violence. Apart from these two exceptions it should never be \u201cyou can have free speech, BUT\u201d. There should be NO BUTS. \r<br>\u2022\tHate speech laws produce far more pernicious results for societies and for individuals than beneficial results. As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.   \r<br>\r<br>                                    What CAN be done to reduce hate speech in society?\r<br>\r<br>Of course some groups are more vulnerable to hate speech than others, so what CAN be done to protect these groups and reduce hate speech in a society?\r<br>\r<br>Civility and respect codes can be used in institutions such as universities, instead of implementing hate speech laws. Within an institution such as a university a very high burden of proof would be required for people making hate speech complaints. If the proof was deemed good enough, the person deemed as making hateful comments could be given a lot of warnings before they are temporarily suspended. There would never be any legal prosecution for hate speech. They would be allowed to return to their job after a reasonable period of time and given more chances to resolve the situation. A faculty member would only lose their a job for example or a student would only be expelled from a university after a lot of repeated transgressions of this code. That is, the people in institutions would be secure in knowing that they could speak freely. They would know that if anything they said was deemed as offensive by someone, the person complaining  would have to have a very well proven complaint. They would also know that they would not be in fear for their job except under extreme circumstances and would never face legal action. They would have plenty of time and chances to turn the situation around. \r<br>\r<br>Outside of institutions eg in public spaces, civility and respect rules could also be in place, again with high levels of evidence required for reporting to police. The police could be required to give for example four or more warnings to someone and only after this could they ban that person from a public space.

It is unfortunate that the self-regulating, self-legislating justice department declared that separation of authorities isn&#39;t necessary. Clerks of the court are supervised by Chief Judges and therefore judges stamp their own fraudulent arrest warrants. Transcribing Solutions, or the court transcriber is self-regulating and judges post reused fraudulent transcripts. A quiet judge is a bad sign of an unrecorded hearing with a fraudulent transcript. Attorneys don&#39;t have to represent anyone&#39;s interests and are free to prosecute innocent people for profit, bribe or any other reason. Judges are &quot;supervised&quot; by attorneys, who, they declared, have no liability associated with their practice and are entirely unregulated as a matter of trust. Most rulings are entirely ridiculous - simply because it increases incomes and facilitates bribes. People can get arbitrarily prosecuted for having a Facebook page in partially recorded hearings. They can declare that biting into your sandwich from the left side on the north side of a public park constitutes dangerous legal advice and put people in prison indefinitely as political prisoners. In Florida scores of people were incarcerated for decades over misdemeanors in private prisons. More likely, they put people in mental hospitals and drug them - the favorite choice by Putin, China &amp; North Korea. Judge Angela Arkin makes lay &quot;diagnosis&quot; all of the time. Sources: the LexisNexis Introduction to the Rules of Professional Conduct. This includes the latest rulings. The Rules themselves are corrupt and lend themselves to abuse easily. But they are no longer the rule at all. There are no rules. Judge Angela Arkin appoints state funded individuals and then doubles them up as unbundled representation for the entitled party, paid by the wealthy party a second time. She did drool when mentioning this second payment so I assume its for her. Other parties get removed from the court when the judge orders the wealthy party to pay this sum. But they warned me timely, so she did it right in front of me. Please vote NO to Judge Angela Arkin in 2016 - if you&#39;re still allowed to vote. We are likely a one-party country where leaders are appointed by the greedy justice department (ask Gore). Colorado Capitol wants to prevent voting for judges and they allow criminals into the police force, which comes in handy around the Supreme Court and anywhere where politicians are.

She offered the judiciary branch unlimited power to pursue greed. In return, she gets kickbacks on arms deals. Judges are immune. They declared that there is no liability associated with attorney conduct. A divorce in Colorado is a quarter million to judges and attorneys. No need to give the entitled party anything. If statutes were enforced no one would ever litigate. Colorado Constitution and statutes are enough to stop 99% of domestic assaults. So judges don&#39;t record hearings and prevent the victim from entering the courtroom when they seal the case. Expecting the domestic assailant to bring more money next time. Maybe a juicy domestic murder. The Clintons open endless private prisons, turning people into billionaires off of slave labor. The Sheriff&#39;s departments are paid per-head so they can&#39;t really stop crime and make sure to maintain it. Judges abuse their discretion in misapplying laws of Oral Agreements unto all other parts of the law, even criminal law. So the judge will say something. If the defendant answers they are in contempt of court and will go to prison. If the defendant doesn&#39;t instantly interrupt than he has entered an oral agreement with the DA and will go to prison. It helps keeping criminals out. Washington is the capitol of murders - if you figured out what politicians are about you&#39;ll get murdered. After several appeals, the judge will simply change the Register of Action on the case repeatedly, making it impossible to appeal in Colorado. The case is referred to the Federal Supreme Court, where the person is declared insane for not &quot;remembering&quot; his own pleadings and is put in incarceration where the drug companies can make more money on them. Innocent people are prosecuted for profit. Attorneys take advantage of confusion during foreclosures and simply file fraudulent QuitClaim Deeds in anyone&#39;s name for no reason. Judges endorse their own arbitrary rulings as the clerks are &quot;supervised&quot; by chief judges. Clinton has now renewed her kickbacks deals by opening more private prisons. People in the Middle East are pushed to violence in order to justify spending on arms. Australia is also on its way to become a tyranny centered around the judiciary. That would make most of the world a tyranny - and the leaders will always try to control all other countries. Three new amendments to the U.S. Constitution can change the course of history: 29 - state employee, DORA regulated judges. No appeals. No need to botch the case. Work from the constitution up. Simple. 30 - Clerks supervised by Sheriff&#39;s office &amp; DORA. No justice department. No chief judges. No justices. 31- No attorneys ever elected with the legislative branch. No legislators eligible for attorney license.", "comment_date": "2015-11-16T16:15:56Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"Zeeq0qaEaLw": {"Freedom of Speech: Crash Course Government and Politics #25": {"channel_id": "UgjWgj1t7D-f7HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "AbsolX Guardian", "comment_text": "So there was this kid at my school who rallying for same-sex marriage at a school rally in the corner.
