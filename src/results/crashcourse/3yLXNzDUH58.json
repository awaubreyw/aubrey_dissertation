The other side of the coin is prescriptivist linguistics: describing language and treating certain linguistic traits as better than others.\r<br>\r<br>Now, prescriptivism has lost popularity over the years because it\u2019s often discriminatory to say that a certain trait is better than another. Prescriptivism has driven many people to think certain dialects of standardized languages are somehow worse, or less deserving of respect, which is derogatory for speakers of the non-standard strains of a language.\r<br>\r<br>However, prescriptivism is still a thing nowadays because sometimes it does prove necessary. Take Spanish, for example. Spanish is one of the relatively few languages that have grammatical gender, which has proven insulting, discomforting and/or troubling for many people. Not only does the general use of grammatical gender in Spanish often deny females any visibility, but it also makes Spanish unable to represent non-binary people.  After realizing the social issues that grammatical gender poses, many movements lead by feminism, the LBTQ+ community and indigenous communities proposed changing the language ridding it from grammatical gender progressively, in the hopes of granting women and non-binary people more visibility and respect.\r<br>\r<br>Studying such phenomenon almost requires some degree of prescriptivism, because linguists are often required to align themselves with the political views of their sponsors or employers. Sometimes, it would seem you have to favour some linguistic traits over others.\r<br>\r<br>I myself prefer descriptivism over prescriptivism, but I think this is just too important of a debate to be ignored.
