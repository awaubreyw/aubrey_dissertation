Did Vesalius decided to look at a woman&#39;s mouth and counted how many teeth she has? He did!

Of course, the Roman Catholic Church has held at least since the Council of Paderborn in 785 that witchcraft is not a real thing, that those who participate in witch hunts or trials should be considered common murderers, and the belief in witches with supernatural powers is itself a heresy. Witch trials made a big comeback during the Protestant Reformation, with Lutherans and especially Calvinists executing hundreds. In Catholic countries, however, the only accused witches to be burned were those who refused to deny having magic powers.
