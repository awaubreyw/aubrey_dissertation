This means that the ability to taste the difference between milk first or tea first, Is not a statistical one at all, it&#39;s a chemical one, with no probability involved.<br><br>If you don&#39;t believe me, try it yourself. and if you don&#39;t believe that hot or cold tea couldn&#39;t taste different, again try it yourself. and if you don&#39;t understand why, Consider this-- with the same glass, you can tell the difference between hot and cold water by the sound of pouring it into the glass. this is because hot and cold water have their molecules different distances apart, with more or less movement, which results in hotter water having a longer wavelength of sound IE lower pitch. Then consider the consequences for taste. Molecules having different distribution. <br><br>Although this might have been the origin story for the use of statistics, it&#39;s a very bad origin story because it was unnecessary for the problem it tried to answer.
