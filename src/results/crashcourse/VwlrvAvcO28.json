Also, there were many distinct groups of Cossacks: there were Zaporizhian cossacks in Ukraine, and Don, Terek, Kuban and Yaik cossacks in Russia. In the conflict between Russia and Poland, Zaporizhian cossacks were the one who took part, and they were employed by both sides. There was also an institution of Registered Cossacks, which were formally acknowledged by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (and thus were acting not as mercenaries, but more as an actual part of their military). The Hetman State, in fact, was a separate entity from the Zaporizhian cossacks, and its military rulers (Hetmans) would at times align towards the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and at other times -- towards Russia (which means certain Hetmans were pro-Polish, and others were pro-Russian). In fact, in the latter days of its existence, the Hetman State split into the Left-Bank and Right-Bank parts, with regards to the river Dnipro. The left-bank (eastern) part was pro-Russian, and the right-bank (western) part was pro-Polish (obviously there were nuances on the &quot;pro-&quot; part, some Hetmans showed a lot more support to the corresponding countries than others, but the idea is that the Hetman State was kind of a fledgling entity with a decent army, but lacking the political power (and thus requiring strong allies).

Converting to Islam was also a way of escaping.<br>-Though the Janissaries were slaves, they were paid a regular salary and a pension after service.<br>-Eventually, the privileges enjoyed by the Janissary class led to free Muslims demanding access to their ranks. Due to manpower pressures, this and the inclusion of children of janissaries were eventually allowed, leading to the decline of the devshirme. The boy harvests became rare events after the reign of Suleyman the Magnificent and number of boys taken shrunk as other recruitment methods prevailed.<br>-By the time the devshirme was formally abolished in 1703 it had been defunct for decades.<br>Just wanted to inject some nuance into the discussion.
