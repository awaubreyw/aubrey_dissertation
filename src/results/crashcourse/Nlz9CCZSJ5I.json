I feel there were things missing that could&#39;ve helped - at least me anyway - connect to the film on an emotional level. I think what people liked about this movie is that they&#39;re so used to seeing and perceiving Black stereotypes that the image of Black boys being vulnerable is completely foreign. If seeing Black people as human and affectionate is this groundbreaking then I can&#39;t help but wonder how we were seen before this film. Glad it won an Oscar. I just wish it was worth the hype as far as story. I mean, hitting the bully with the chair got my attention and maybe the fight in the schoolyard too, but that was about it.

I can\u2019t personally relate to any of main topic the movie touches on as I\u2019m straight and Native American, but i still found it to be incredibly compelling as a piece of art and even made me think more about theses things as it presents it in a not obnoxious way.
