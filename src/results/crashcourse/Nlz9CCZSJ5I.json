I feel there were things missing that could&#39;ve helped - at least me anyway - connect to the film on an emotional level. I think what people liked about this movie is that they&#39;re so used to seeing and perceiving Black stereotypes that the image of Black boys being vulnerable is completely foreign. If seeing Black people as human and affectionate is this groundbreaking then I can&#39;t help but wonder how we were seen before this film. Glad it won an Oscar. I just wish it was worth the hype as far as story. I mean, hitting the bully with the chair got my attention and maybe the fight in the schoolyard too, but that was about it. Maybe I missed something else.

I think the cold is representative of him closing up and hardening while the beach represents the opposite for him as it\u2019s at the beach where he opens up and makes himself more vulnerable. I love how this movie simply for the amount of symbolism and metaphors and whatnot to pick apart. I can\u2019t personally relate to any of main topic the movie touches on as I\u2019m straight and Native American, but i still found it to be incredibly compelling as a piece of art and even made me think more about theses things as it presents it in a not obnoxious way.

Chyrone&#39;s theme when he&#39;s little is the basis of the score and then at each stage of his life the score is pitch shifted down to make it darker and more distorted, while still keeping the heart. It&#39;s a way of showing through sound that Chyrone might change on the outside, taking on signifiers in order to protect himself, but his core is unchanging.
