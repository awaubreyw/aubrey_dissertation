Prostitution and gambling can raise the economic fortunes of a place, but if you&#39;ve ever lived in a city like Vegas or Atlantic City...the cost is great.  Or for example, the financial crisis bundles or pyramid schemes or real estate speculation or making your country into a tax haven for wealthy corporations...all great economic decisions with regards to &quot;increasing productivity&quot; but net losses for humanity.  Also, wages are considered a net loss with regards to economic productivity.  How much of America&#39;s &quot;great productivity&quot; is the great corruption and inefficiency in the health care system or insurance industries?  <br><br>The problem with this productivity measure is that &quot;value&quot; is &quot;monetary value.&quot;   So an American pharmaceutical creates 400 times more value for one pill for pinworms because they charge 400 times as much as a company charges for the same pill anywhere in the world and in the US it&#39;s prescription (Albendazole, Wiki it) <br><br>12 other reasons countries are financially poor besides internal productivity:   <br>1)No control over their countries resources/capital due to outside intervention/colonialism<br>2)Foreign Interventions/War/Chaos that have less to do with Economics (DRC, Afghanistan)<br>3)Historical exclusion/institutionalized racism (Haiti being embargoed by the US, Trump trying to repeal NAFTA, Venezuela sanctions)<br>4)One-sided trade deals due to like...armed intervention/bullying.  (Gunboat diplomacy; Halliburton&#39;s and other US companies&#39; contracts to rebuild Iraq; USAid money that effects policy and politics in Latin America)<br>5)One-sided trade deals due to predatory lending from foreign banks or the IMF/World Bank and the &quot;spread your legs&quot; economic policies attached.<br>6)Wanting to have control over your resources against the will of your powerful colonizers/neighbors (China in the Opium Wars, Iran/Guatemala&#39;s CIA coups, Kuwait undercutting OPEC in 1990, Venezuela under Chavez(which was mismanagement but also US isolating them))<br>7)Economics of Scale (Big companies from established world powers have capital/power, so they can buy up, box out or change their governments&#39; policies to succeed and beat competition...I mean like the East India Company had its own army) <br>8)Foreign investment.   In Kyrgyzstan a lot of malls have been built recently.  These put the means of &quot;production&quot; in the hands of an inefficient wealthy elite, undermine freedom/democracy, and remove power from middle class producers/small businesses in the name of greater production, makes prices higher for everything, and most of the money goes to investors from other countries.  Also foreign investors (like Wal-Mart in Mexico) are a large cause of corruption.    <br>9)Lack of integration with the global economy:  (For example, Pacific Island paradises might have tons of food and a very high &quot;standard of living&quot; but no cash if they haven&#39;t turned their island into a plantation &quot;export economy&quot;) <br>10)Lack of stability:  Kyrgyzstan has had 2 revolutions, which scared money away, even though the revolutions were about taking corrupt officials who were mismanaging the country out of power and thus increased local economic efficiency, freedom, and quality of life.  <br>11)The deck is stacked:  90% of the countries in the world are former colonies.  Which means their infrastructure, their power structures, their means of production were structured at one point for wealth extraction rather than building.  It also means that most of the capital in the world has been consolidated in the hands of these global empires.  Let&#39;s face it:  MacDonald&#39;s may have had some innovative ideas and some good burgers 50 years ago.  But 95% of the kiosks in Mexico have better food.  But MacDonald&#39;s has capital and is from a country with capital and they have much less, so MacDonald&#39;s is everywhere.  <br>12)Global Aid which undercuts local food, clothing, banking, and infrastructure companies and their productivity.  <br><br>10 Other reasons countries are rich besides actual productivity:  <br>1)Extraction of Wealth from other Countries (Belgium, Netherlands, UK, US, Spain, Russia, France as empires):  <br>2)Tariffs that keep out competition (EU...ex:  free to send money into the EU, lots of fees to send money out) or Subsidies/Favoritism for Native industries (Airbus and Boeing scandals, US farmers) <br>3)A lack of morals (Pollution and corruption are productive and work to keep costs down...for a while!  Monopolies and extortion increase &quot;production&quot; as an economic number greatly, at least for a while; Singapore got rich on opium initially, just like Americans and Portuguese and the English and Arabs before them got rich off the slave trade)<br>4)Conquest of Productive Land/Resources<br>5)Ambition/Greed as Values.  American individualism is more suited to wealth creation than Guatemalan communal values or Native American respect for nature. (Per capita Ayn Rand fans)<br>6)The ability to reduce the world into numeric values and ignore all other values as a way of thinking (per capita economists).  <br>7)Outsourcing/Tax Havens/Lawyers Et al <br>8)How much financial capital you have to start with (How rich your daddy was) <br>9)Security/how likely you are to get invaded (Imagine if France didn&#39;t have to worry about building the Maginot Line what else they could have built instead)<br>10)Slavery/Low Wages/Low levels of workers&#39; rights/power.<br><br>Intellectual property laws/patent laws can also be mentioned on both sides here, as well as trade policies/agreements in general.  Spoilers:  They protect powerful companies and powerful countries, not small countries and little people.  If you live in SoCal, being a content creator is very lucrative and prestigious.  Not so much in Central Asia, and many sites block their sites entirely.  Why?  Because rich people in California are more interested in paying you to hear what you have to say.  And because of outdated international media laws that don&#39;t recognize the internet as a thing.      <br><br>These oversimplifications are more than just dangerous; they gloss over the real historical reasons for wealth accumulation and the way things are and actually how they continue to work today.

That is a very pessimistic, but understandable world view. Since I support limitless freedom of thoughts, I welcome you to have whatever opinion youd like to have, despite my disagreement. Domination and exploitation has undeniably been part of history, but its net influence to success has significantly decreased over time, let me explain why I believe so.<br><br>As far as I can see it, western society&#39;s standarts and developments were no secret, ever. Our markets, our law system, our technology and our political structures are the biggest contributors to our wealth. Take middle eastern countries for example. They could have easily adapted to all of what we figured out over the course of hundreds of years: Democracy, open markets, a secular state, our lawsystem. All of this worked observably well for us. Why did they not adapt?\r<br>\r<br>China used to isolate itself. Just few decades ago, they adapted to open trade markets and created a globally tolerable political stability and BOOM: From poverty to strongest market force and still developing upwards.\r<br>\r<br>I see cultural ignorance when it comes to the differences in wealth. The middle east, for example, has - out of tradition and religion - largely not agreed upon adapting to what we in the western world figured out to be most succesful and now they pay the price for it. It is not that they are poorer, we are just richer,  because we developed faster. They are where we were hundreds of years ago. \r<br>\r<br>Out of moral virtue we assign this circumstance to be our fault - as the developmental more successful culture, we are sceptical towards our own success, which is fundamentally a healthy thought. It is easy to find reasons, why we could consider ourselves oppressors, because there are some instances in form of examples, in which we did and still do indeed exploit these nations. As for my opinion though, those instances are rather rare and certainly not the main contribution factor to the situation we are in.\r<br>\r<br>Poverty has halved during the last 10 years, majorly because of westerners initiating global trade with underdeveloped regions. Almost all of the technology used all around the world comes from us and its knowledge is almost free to use for other countries. In my opinion, we do carry them to success more than we exploit and oppress them.\r<br>\r<br>When there is a winner, there must be a loser, but unlike in poker, it is not nessecarily the winners fault, that there is a loser. The loser can still develop, but if the winner develops just faster, it will on surface always appear like one is dragging the other down, despite this not being actually the case.<br><br>With growing success of our strategy, the influence of it has increased. With growing possibilities of communication, there is less and less excuse for ignoring it. With the consistent factor of ignorance towards a system that is being perfected more and more, the influence of such ignorant behavior becomes more and more the main factor of wether you succeed or not.", "comment_date": "2019-01-01T15:53:23Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"UHiUYj5EA0w": {"Productivity and Growth: Crash Course Economics #6": {"channel_id": "UgwaYXNuooPX4PckQx94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Samantha Delorme", "comment_text": "The word \u201ccountries\u201d is spelled incorrectly at ~<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHiUYj5EA0w&amp;t=3m35s\">3:35</a>...", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T20:22:13Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"UHiUYj5EA0w": {"Productivity and Growth: Crash Course Economics #6": {"channel_id": "UgzkpVwiEruSjTH6W8d4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Vukasin Spasic", "comment_text": "To increase productivity country needs resources.

I&#39;m no economist and I&#39;m just musing here, but I have to wonder what happens to GDP/standard of living when a country begins to produce MORE items (cheap plastic party favors, for instance) than anyone wants or more than the people can afford, or what will happen when the raw materials simply begin to run out. Obviously with the first you can currently try to expand your market into other countries or grow your population at home so that there will be more consumers, or use advertising (as we currently do) to create more artificial &quot;needs.&quot;  The second is a matter for a country&#39;s banks and financial officers.  Yet  what happens when we eventually hit a wall regarding overpopulation and/or lack of new raw ore synthesized materials?  I suppose we could eventually colonize other planets, but realistically shouldn&#39;t we admit that there may be a limit to how high our standard of living can go (at least if we measure &quot;standard of living&quot; in terms of how much &quot;stuff&quot; we produce per person?)  It just seems like there will eventually come a point when either we&#39;ve hit the wall of lack of resources OR we can efficiently produce all the necessary and even fun items we need to fulfill the lower levels in Maslow&#39;s Hierarchy of Needs: medical supplies, furniture, clothing, water pumps, food, transportation equipment, party favors, etc.  (And this is probably why GDP roughly equates to happiness; a person whose basic physical needs aren&#39;t met and who sees his children dying from illness or hunger is generally not too happy.)  Then what we&#39;ll need is not more &quot;stuff&quot; produced but more knowledge and more discovery/inventions to make humans happier and healthier.  Granted, however, we have a LONG way to go before we can even meet everyone on Earth&#39;s most basic needs, and we&#39;ll probably run out of raw materials before we do.

Productivity is the answer to the question &quot;what makes different countries have different GDP per capita?&quot;, but if the question is why some countries are poor you can&#39;t only point out to the GDPpC. You have to explain why historically they didn&#39;t develop so fast, what they produce, why they don&#39;t have same technology, why they have been exploited of their resources, colonization, and so son. Also you should explain the difference between absolute GDPpC or the one rearranged according to the buying power of each country. Incompetent governments also often have a reason why they are there. Free international trade is often very beneficial for the rich countries that can buy natural resources from poor countries, but the developmentalist economic theory suggests that protecting the economy of a developing country can make it change what is produced. What I mean is that if a poor country only sells their natural resources and low level products and buys what it doesn&#39;t have from rich countries it will never change what it produces. But it&#39;s clear that to get richer a country must develop industries and later services. A way to do it is to protect internal manufacture sector and subsidies and tax the import of certain goods. A country cannot have the productivity of a rich country, and cannot reach it, if it doesn&#39;t develop. Develop what? Develop more productive goods, &quot;higher level&quot; industry. For example Malawi produces almost only tobacco, the western tobacco industry buys it, and Malawi buys with the money the goods they do not produce, which is a lot of goods. Like this Malawi is not developing any other production, no industry, no services, no technology. The free international trade keeps this type of countries pinned to their undeveloped status. For developing countries it would often be useful to protect their manufacture sector with taxes on certain types of imported goods and subsidies on certain internally produced goods.", "comment_date": "2016-01-25T00:26:06Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"UHiUYj5EA0w": {"Productivity and Growth: Crash Course Economics #6": {"channel_id": "Ugj5Kv_lj6K4lngCoAEC", "comment_by": "roninofthemoon", "comment_text": "CURSE YOU OREGON TRAIL!!!!<br><del>shakes fist</del><br>(loved that bit.)", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T23:09:05Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"UHiUYj5EA0w": {"Productivity and Growth: Crash Course Economics #6": {"channel_id": "UgjQEyBUGZJyy3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "A", "comment_text": "Singapore yay!", "comment_date": "2016-01-20T09:16:02Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"UHiUYj5EA0w": {"Productivity and Growth: Crash Course Economics #6": {"channel_id": "UggeahS-6cCebXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "yahwehink", "comment_text": "Or, more accurately in America..

Where did that come from? Wouldn&#39;t they have gotten rid of the workers at that point... not increased their wages. The machine is making the donuts, not the workers. Also, what about the cost of maintaining the machine, and the market saturation that would result in a lower price for donuts? I can&#39;t eat thousands of donuts per day. <br><br>Also, the market price for labour in other countries might be lower, but that doesn&#39;t mean that their productivity is low. It&#39;s global labor arbitrage. Confusing this arbitrage with productivity is a little stupid in my opinion. Shouldn&#39;t labour productivity be measured in terms of intrinsic value of work, as opposed to say market value of the goods produced. Perhaps &quot;Productivity&quot; is a tragic historic nomenclature that economists used, and it&#39;s stuck.<br><br>The process of production has a set of inputs (labour, cash, machines, raw products etc.), and some output product. The efficiency with which the inputs are used to produce the outputs, or production efficiency, seems a more natural definition for what you guys seem to call &quot;productivity&quot;. It&#39;s like saying that someone using a pen and paper is not as productive as someone using a computer; the person is not the problem, it&#39;s the organisation of the production process that&#39;s inefficient; pen and paper vs computer. For the same level of labour input, one production process produces more output than a different production process. Example:<br><br>Shops A and B make donuts: A has the dough made by hand, and B has the dough made by machine. The basic point here is that shop A has invested it&#39;s available labour to make the dough, it might be an inefficient use of labour, where there are cheaper mechanical alternatives available. Perhaps shop A has a small market in a small town, and it cannot afford to buy the machine, whilst shop B is in a big city, and has a larger demand for donuts, and hence the cost of the investment is justified.  <br><br>What you call &quot;productivity&quot; has nothing to do with &quot;productivity&quot; of the labour force. It is more akin to production efficiency of the overall company. Yet you seem to keep pointing out that US workers are more &quot;productive&quot; than Bangladeshi workers, but the fact is more like: US companies use their labour input more efficiently than Bangladeshi companies. This is fine for Bangladeshi companies though, since their cost of labour is low, which allows them to stay in business whilst utilizing massive amounts of labour. <br><br>Not sure if I got this right.

The implication that an increase in productivity leads to an increase in wages is misleading and ridiculous, and not founded in fact/history. Where are these companies that willing pay their employees more? Productivity in the USA has steadily gone up over the last 4 decades, yet wages remain the same- the exact opposite of your example (which is why I&#39;m glad you took time to include that info-thanks). The reasons are myriad, but it largely has to do with corporations being legally required to maximize shareholder profits. If they can produce more, yet pay you the same amount, that increases their profits.<br>There are only two main reasons why companies increase wages- economic and social. Economic reasons involve competition over workers, in a situation in which there are more jobs than workers (which is rare), and in which companies must increase wages to attract labor. Social reasons involve things like protests and strikes, where the workers band together to demand fair treatment/pay. Otherwise, wages will stay the same, despite any increases in productivity.<br>Also, productivity is not necessarily tied to standard of living. It is true that countries with high GDP usually have high standards of living, but you mentioned several other factors (and left a few out) that have a dramatic impact on standard of living, even without taking into account GDP. Specialization seems to be a huge factor, and one that is overlooked. Countries with increased specialization also have higher standards of living, while those countries with narrowed specialization have poorer. A country who can afford to have doctors, lawyers, entertainers, massage therapists, etc. is going to offer a better standard of living than would a country that is mainly focused on procuring resources, or the mass-producing of gadgets. Basically, a well-rounded economy means a better standard of living.<br>Then you also have certain sectors of the economy that will have a much more dramatic impact on standard of living than would others. If you invest in your nation&#39;s health care system, it will likely have a greater impact on the standard of living than would an equal investment in the garment sector.

Many increases in productivity have come at the cost of human misery. Much of the capital that propelled increases in GDP among many of the richer countries historically came from colonized or otherwise exploited countries, for example. The cotton boom of the early nineteenth century, which enriched the U.S. as a country, came in large part from harrowing increases in the productivity of enslaved persons. In that case, the incredible rise in GDP had a sharply negative effect on many of the residents of the United States.<br><br>Are there stakes to this? Yes! A monomaniacal focus on productivity can lead to a trampling of the lives of the disadvantaged. If the state (pick a state) seized all of the antiquated small farms in its border, and successfully turned them into modern factory farms geared towards export, the GDP of that state would skyrocket, but the farmers (if unassisted) would be devastated. The Soviet Union massively increased its GDP and GDP per capita in the 1930s, but no one would want to live there. Part of that increase, in fact, was the poorest of the poor starving to death, another thing that boosts GDP numbers.<br><br> I know you folks said you&#39;d speak to income inequality in a future episode, and I&#39;m glad you mentioned it.
