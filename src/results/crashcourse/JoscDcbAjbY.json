In general, electrical phenomena like static was widely considered a &#39;fluid&#39; into the 19th century.<br>2) Many of the &#39;parlor tricks&#39;, like Stephen Gray&#39;s, served two purposes: to entertain, and to show something experimentally, i.e., that the human body is a good conductor.<br>3) Hauksbee didn&#39;t discover that spinning a glass sphere generated static. He built the device because he already knew it would work. People had been making tables of materials ordered by how much static they generated from friction since at least Gilbert&#39;s time. Glass was high on the list. It was actually a suggestion of Newton&#39;s to replace the sulphur sphere of von Guericke for better results. <br>4) The &#39;electrostatic generator&#39; was not known as an &#39;electrical generator&#39; because electricity itself was not a unified concept yet.<br>5) Benjamin Franklin and his circle were extremely prolific and DID CONTRIBUTE EPISTEMICALLY to the history of electricity. For one, he showed that both lightning and static could charge a leyden jar and perform the same experiments, meaning (to him and most others) that lightning and static had an underlying similarity. Joseph Priestley called this the greatest discovery since Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation.<br>6) Galvani did not himself demonstrate the existence of &#39;animal electricity&#39;, which was part of the controversy with Volta. His more convincing proof appeared in an appendix to his last work in which he showed that you could get the legs to twitch without using metal connections. These experiments were popularized by his nephew, Aldini, after his death.<br>7) Galvani did not &#39;inspire Volta to push his work on nerves furthur&#39;. Volta was not convinced of the existence of animal electricity. He thought the leg twitches were the result of using different metal connections. He invented the voltaic pile to prove this effect and disprove the existence of animal electricity. <br>8) Volta did not invent the first practical method of generating electricity. You already mentioned electrostatic generators. <br>9) The voltaic pile is not the first &#39;battery&#39;. The term &#39;battery&#39; was coined by Franklin to refer to a series of Leyden jars. They could store large quantities of charge. They just could not give you a continuous current.<br>10) Understanding the voltaic pile does not require knowledge that electricity and magnetism are related. It is a chemical effect. At Volta&#39;s time, it appeared that there were multiple kinds of electricity: static, lightning (though Franklin unified this), animal, and chemical. Magnetism and light were on the list, but only by remote analogy. <br>11) Faraday did not simply &#39;get to work inventing electromagnetic motors&#39;. In fact, his famous electromagnetic motor was actually an experimental setup to prove the convertibility of magnetism and chemical electricity. He performed many experiments with different kinds of electricity to show they all produced the same effects, thus &#39;unifying&#39; the pantheon. <br><br>I don&#39;t have the energy to go through the rest.

There&#39;s also Tesla&#39;s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of this science, to realise that they&#39;re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who ignore Nikola Tesla truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn&#39;t appreciate, for instance, the tragedy in Teslas invention &quot;The AC current,&quot; which itself is a cryptic reference to the work of Prior Greek Natural Philosophers.
