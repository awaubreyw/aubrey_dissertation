You know, while I was watching this video I was wondering why Hank Green was being so critical of the Roman Empire and conquerors in general.  Then I read the comment section, and clicked for me, and when it did it made realize just what a clever cookie Hank is.<br><br>Rome as been seen for generations as something to aspire to.  Politicians up to the 20th century have tried to style themselves as building a &quot;New Roman&quot; empire, and people went along with it because the popular perception was that the Roman Empire and its conquests were inherently &quot;good.&quot;  And if the Roman Empire was &quot;good,&quot; then you want to be like the Roman Empire as well.  And to a certain degree this attitude of &quot;Empire is good&quot; still persists to this day, and there are many people who want to return to a strong, centralized, military government.  This is as true of my country as it is of many others.<br><br>In this light, the actual idea put forth in this video then is not that &quot;the Roman empire was pure evil,&quot; but rather &quot;the Roman empire was not pure awesomeness.&quot;  The millions of people killed during the Roman conquests are often dismissed because &quot;Well that&#39;s just what everyone was doing back in the day&quot; and the self fulfilling political instability brought on by Rome&#39;s policy of rewarding land to veterans and thus requiring a constant cycle conquest that was ultimately doomed to fail given enough time is often glossed over entirely by Romaphiles.  The Roman empire had its flaws, just like any other society, but these flaws have always been overlooked by people who revere Rome as, in their minds, the epitome of a &quot;good&quot; empire.  <br><br> However, that does not mean Roman advances to the field of science should be overlooked either.  As Hank pointed out, Roman highways connected Europe and Western Asia in ways that had never even been dreamed of before, Roman aqueducts transported thousands of tons of fresh drinking water, and Roman coliseums provided feats of entertainment that had never been seen before.  And these accomplishments are not separate from Rome&#39;s negative traits but rather go hand in hand with them.<br><br>So for many people, the idea of &quot;Rome was good&quot; is entranced in their minds as subconscious fact.  However, by positing that &quot;Rome was bad AND good&quot; that shakes people up.  They stop just listening and they comment and engage and argue about whether or not Rome was bad or good.  And the key word of that last sentence &quot;engage.&quot;  Because Hand has always posited, as seen in Crash Philosophy, is that our knowledge of the world is fluid and should never be seen as set in stone.   Science and philosophy and history are all things that should be TALKED about and DISCUSSED.  And for that, you need to discuss different view points and to THINK about why we believe things about the way you are.<br><br>People in this comment section are up in arms because they feel Hank&#39;s &quot;attacking&quot; the integrity of the Roman empire or that his &quot;opinion&quot; is &quot;wrong.&quot;  But the fact people are getting so up in arms because someone decided to paint it in a somewhat negative light is, I suspect, precisely why Hank decided to go at this subject in the first place.  By getting people riled up, he gets people to defend their view, and thus he gets people engaged in discussion.  And you&#39;ll notice that by getting people engaged in discussion, he&#39;s also made us ask the three questions that you&#39;ll notice popping up throughout this series: &quot;Why is?&quot; &quot;How is?&quot; and &quot;What is?&quot;<br><br>And this ties into the thesis of the series as a whole: that science and the history of science is a living thing that we as race are all a part of.

Slaves were very much a thing. It&#39;s also much easier to build a long stretch of road because, again, your labor is free.<br><br>2: Roman engineering has withstood the test of time in their construction in large part due to the fact that Rome almost never dips below freezing. When we look at our own roads, with their significantly increased traffic numbers, and then we look at our weather patterns, it&#39;s very easy to start noticing why our roads look like the surface of the Moon. Water gets in the tarmac, turns to ice, expands, breaks up the tarmac, and suddenly you&#39;ve got potholes all over the place and have to repave after a year.<br><br>3: One of the most potent traps in the world of engineering is the rose tinted shades of looking at the past. Even when we look just thirty years into our own, we look at things like Bakelite telephones and that sort of thing and think &quot;Wow, they made everything so sturdy back then, these things are still in one piece&quot;. Well, you think that because all you&#39;re looking at is what survived. What kept working. What wasn&#39;t discarded or stripped down or destroyed. In the case of Rome, we&#39;re looking at all these arches and aqueducts and such that have the amazing perception of being nigh-on indestructible because they&#39;ve been around for almost 2000 years or so, but then we have to consider how much Else was built back then? What else would have been built with less care, such as houses, food storage buildings, and plenty else? What was the difference in frequency between an engineering project that we can still see the results of clearly to this day, and an engineering project that failed within a year of its construction? <br><br>And lastly...<br><br>4: The war between Science and Engineering in terms of theory versus doing is a longstanding one, and Rome provides a classic example of fantastic Doers failing to understand the materials they were working with.
