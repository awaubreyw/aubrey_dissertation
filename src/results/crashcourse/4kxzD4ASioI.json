What a weird thing to say, and how much stranger that it is clearly true. Our national disposition is one that is downright loathsome of all the humanities, going so far as to pit the social against the science (as if that makes any sense at all).<br><br><br>Further, we rig the game, and measure the winner in a way that leaves things like art, music, and even theater with a score of 0. &quot;It&#39;s not useful&quot; is the sentiment. Music theory doesn&#39;t build bridges, sculptures don&#39;t make electricity, and an actor&#39;s performance only ships goods across a continent if they are very deep in method acting a truck driver. <br><br>Find any post on social media about college grads not making enough money, and I guarantee you, there will be someone in the comments disparaging worthless &quot;art degrees&quot; or &quot;gender studies&quot; or whatever, implying, or sometimes just outright saying, that people who pursue certain fields deserve to be part of the demeaned working poor.<br><br>This series opened my eyes to just how much contempt we have for theater and how we are blatantly denying one of the most human endeavors of all time. My background here was absolutely pathetic. Usually with Crash Course series, I have something of a functioning framework to hang the new knowledge on, helping it make sense and making it easier to retain. In this series, it was basically all brand new from start to finish. I knew I was going to have to immediately rewatch the series less than half-way in.<br><br>Thanks Mike, for once again bringing a YouTube series that&#39;s eye opening, thought provoking, and intellectually nourishing.
