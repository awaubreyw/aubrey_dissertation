I thought it might interest people to have a practical example from that:<br><br>In order to keep a nuclear reaction steady, you want a set neutron flux in the reactor, one way to control that is with the control rods. These are materials that absorb neutrons (In a PWR you can also add boron to water, in the form of boric acid)<br><br>Whatever you do as an intervention, there is always going to be some lag between action and effect<br><br>Now, let&#39;s say you get a reading that&#39;s too high, so you lower the control rods/add more boric acid, you go for a linear approach, so your intervention is directly proportional to your intervention. With this approach, you&#39;ll typically overshoot and end up with too low a neutron flux, so you then raise your control rods/take some boric acid out<br><br>Well done, you now have set off an oscillation in your neutron flux, and with a proportional/linear response that can quite easily be one that grows with each iteration.  For obvious reasons, that is not a good thing to happen in a nuclear reactor.<br><br>So you use an integral response to that initial deviation. I find it easier to think of this next bit like it&#39;s a mechanical system, with a pendulum, with that initial deviation from your norm being analogous to someone pushing your pendulum. You want to dampen that oscillation so it goes back to being steady, which is where an integral response comes in. You want a response that perfectly dampens that oscillation in the minimum possible time, not one like the linear response which is almost like your pushing it as it comes to the end of its swing<br><br>(Note: It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve last done this, I might be a little off in places, and I certainly can&#39;t remember exactly how to explain how the integral response works in detail)", "comment_date": "2018-11-19T13:39:30Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "kimon114", "comment_text": "You bet you gorgeous dark eyes, Murphy&#39;s law rules!!", "comment_date": "2018-11-18T12:57:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pieter zeeuwen", "comment_text": "Murphy&#39;s Law: if something can go wrong, it will.<br>Murphy&#39;s Second Law: if more than one thing can go wrong, the thing that causes the greatest damage will go wrong.<br>Murphy&#39;s Third Law (also known as Sod&#39;s Law in Britain): Murphy was an optimist.<br>By limiting yourself to the first law, you kept it at a nice and basic level.
