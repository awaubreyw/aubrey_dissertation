It is wonderful, informative, caring, honest and powerful.  With all the horrible things going on in the world right now, the timing of this epidose (right after one of the most challenging Pride weekends in a long time) did wonders for my tired activist heart and soul!  Bravo, Crash Course and thank you!!!!",
