You say that the Wright brothers were the first to fly an heavier-than-air aircraft but this is a lie!

The Wright brothers were still not the first to fly a motorized aircraft as this title goes to Cl\u00e9ment Ader in 1897 even if he could not perfectly control his aircraft. This is only now that the Wright brothers arrive. They are the first to fly a motorized heavier-than-air aircraft that they could control (maybe it is Gustave Whitehead in 1901 but we are not 100% sure so I will give you a pass on that). They however did not took off alone (the 1903 Wright flyer did not have wheels). It was propulsed by a sort of catapult and a system of rails. The first to do a motorized and controled flight in a self-propulsed heavier-than-air aircraft is Traian Vuia in 1906. <br>Hope you are not going to make that mistake again (not a big one) but this is what happens when you don&#39;t detail enough) <br>Continue what you are doing though I love it!", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T23:09:27Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Jaime Nyx", "comment_text": "It&#39;s interesting that you guys did a combined aerospace history lesson instead of splitting air and space in two.
