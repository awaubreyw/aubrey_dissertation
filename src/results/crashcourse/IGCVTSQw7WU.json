Why didn\u2019t you mention that, in the beginning, there were about as many antimatter particles as matter particles and they constantly collided with each other, releasing a lot of energy, and that the reason the Universe today exists is that there was a wee bit more matter than antimatter. Very much, nearly most, of the original antimatter and matter of this Universe  got destroyed in these collisions and just a fraction remains to this day.

Well... Fuck you all who think you know better than the other side. Fuck radicalism in any form, be it catholic, islamist, atheist, buddizm, or a fucking pastafarianism. Radicalism in any form is a piece of shit.<br><br>I am a catholic. I love science. I approve the BBT and Darwin&#39;s theory. I don&#39;t approve it without thinking, but I find it the most convincing. They do have their flaws, and parts that either I am to dumb to understand, or are just shady, to say the least. But i approve most of them.<br>BUT. I still am catholic, and I believe in God. I also approve creationism, to some extent. In the Bible there is simplified, but mostly correct order of the begining of the world. IIRC, there was only one thing wrong about it, can&#39;t remember what it was, and I&#39;m to lazy to look it up. The Bible was written a good while back, when people didn&#39;t have as much knowledge as we do now. And they weren&#39;t educated, mostly. So it all had to be simple. It had to be symbolic.<br><br>But I better get to the point. God created the universe, the world. All of you shitheads askin &quot;Hurr, okay, but who created God, huh, durr?&quot;. Then please, tell me, what was before the Big Bang? You can&#39;t tell, as you don&#39;t know. We all agree, that with our current understanding of how things work, it was the begining of all. But it was begining of all we know of. God is... different. He is the allmighty. He is above all our human laws of physics. Yes, he can create the stone that he can&#39;t lift, but at the same time he can lift it. Why is it so hard for some people to believe, yet they take for granted that light is a wave and a particle at the same time (briefly talking).<br><br>So why some people are so dedicated to fight anyone who believes that it&#39;s the God that caused the BB? That he is the light the fuse of the universe bomb? <br><br>Now, let&#39;s go to the topic of creationism vs Darwin. I see no conflict here either. Some might say, that it&#39;s pure luck or coincidence that life on earth, and possibly other places, began. For me, it&#39;s how God designed it to work. Is that so different?<br>I don&#39;t say, that it was like God walking around with a magic wand and <b>poof</b> a shark <b>poof</b> a tree <b>poof</b> a human. I see it as a design feature. Like in a computer programing. We very slowly start to do similar stuff. So why try so hard to fight anyone who thinks that there might be some thing that did the same with everything we have now? <br><br>If you just don&#39;t believe in this, and are chill about it - it&#39;s k for me. If you believe in this and are chill if someone does not - it&#39;s k for me.<br>BUT I GET SO PISSED OFF when people are fighting to prove that they know better. They put their lives and souls into fighting a cause that they should not. As a catholic, you should be merciful, and spread the word, not try to pound it with a hammer to everybody. As an atheist why do you care what someone believes? <br>Everyone can defend themselves when attacked, I get that. But why so many people start fighting when there is no real reason for it? Why some atheists bitch about what others believe everywhere? Why some religious people try to force their believes into everybody with pure force?<br><br>Why can&#39;t we just get along, discuss things in a civilised manner, and sometimes agree to disagreee? <br><br><br>(by the way, I strongly prefere calm Satanist over bitching Catholic. And yes, I am Catholic and have a Satanist friend.)<br>P.S.: I&#39;m sorry for any possible bad grammar or hard to understand sentences.

If no energy flowed in the entire &quot;space&quot;, wouldn&#39;t we say that &quot;time&quot; stood still?<br>4. &quot;Space&quot; (pure energy itself), that does not flow (flow of energy being &quot;time&quot;), is basically useless.  An entity can&#39;t even think a thought without a flow of energy.  &quot;Time&quot; would still exist, it just wouldn&#39;t flow, it would be stopped.<br>5. Modern science recognizes a one to one relationship between &quot;space&quot; and &quot;time&quot;.  What if &quot;time&quot; were slowing down, would we perceive the same reality, (an expanding universe, &quot;space&quot; expanding)?<br>6. What if &quot;time&quot; were slowing down, (due to energy in the universe getting less and less dense, thereby decreasing the rate of flow of that energy), at a rate that was not a one to one relationship with &quot;space&quot;?  Maybe &quot;space&quot; is expanding AND &quot;time&quot; is slowing down, but at different rates?  Hence we perceive an universe expanding faster and faster?<br>7. Modern science says that &quot;time&quot; is relative.  How could we ever have really accurate physics formulas and physics constants, (especially the speed of light), if &quot;time&quot; varies?", "comment_date": "2016-01-08T16:02:30Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"IGCVTSQw7WU": {"A Brief History of the Universe: Crash Course Astronomy #44": {"channel_id": "Ugj1BtBtGCu4_XgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Erin Walsh", "comment_text": "Aaaahhh, I&#39;m late for work, but can&#39;t tear myself away from this, it&#39;s so interesting!
