Working in the 1920s and &#39;30s he wrote: <br>&quot;The human being, male or female is a herd animal. Man is fearful of solitude... He is more sensitive to the voice of the herd than to any other influence. That is from his 1923 book Crystallizing publice opinion, which became a classic in the public relations field. It detailed how humans can be persuaded to change their habits if it will help them to follow the crowd. <br>Advertisements love to play on this need, and that is how trends and fads happen in the first place.<br><br>In the 1940&#39;s psychologist Abraham Maslow added another piece to this puzzle. He identified a hierarchy of needs he said all humans had.<br> At the base, the foundation, <br>all humans need food and water, shelter, and sleep.<br> Above that, they need to be safe, too.<br>Then comes the need for love and feeling like you belong somewhere. <br>After that, we need to feel accomplished, like we matter.<br>At the tippy top of the pyramid is the need to fulfill our destiny, to be our best selves.<br><br>All of these needs, combined with our natural desire to follow the crowd, are like little buttoms on our hearts amd brains. Advertisements press different combinations of buttons in hopes that we will respond the right way. <br><br>The sales pitch of most modern ads is that product x will satisfy your need for y.<br>For example, security systems promise one of our most basic needs; safety.<br><br>Once an advertiser knows which need button to press, they need to persuade you that it will work. <br><br><br><br>There are a few things that persuade us:<br><br>1-  Authority: if we think the person talking is an expert, we are likely to believe them. <br><br>example: &quot;5 out of 5 dentists recommend&quot; toothpaste commercials<br><br>2- likeability: If we like them, are friends with them, or trust them, we are also likely to listen.<br> That is why brands use extremely popular and respected celebrities, like, say: Leonardo Dicaprio to sell watches or perfumes.<br><br>3- Consistency: If what is being said vibes with what we already believe, we will probably go along with it.<br> <br>example: If everything you have heard about this new true crime podcast says it is great and thrilling and awesome. You probably would not believe your coworker&#39;s negative review of it.<br><br>4- Consensus: If it is popular, we are easily swayed to think it is good, too.<br><br>5- Scarcity: If we think it is a scarce resource and we could have a piece of it, it is even more attractive.<br><br>example : If everyone else had an Iphone and you didn&#39;t, you would probably really want one. And if a limited edition version came out that was signed by a popular personality, you would want that one even more<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Advertisers also use logical fallacies to persuade us.<br>Logical fallacies like:<br><br>1- Appeal to emotions: This is when an ad convinces you to take action by tugging at your heartstrings.<br><br>example: these sad sick dogs commercials with the Sarah Mclachlan song.<br><br>2- False dilemma:<br>When an ad shows you a limited number of choices so you won&#39;t consider all the options.<br><br>example: Laundry detergent ads seem to always go head to head with another brand, but only one other brand,even though there are dozens.<br><br>3- Red herring: The presentation of something totally irrelevant to distract you from the issue at hand.<br><br>This happens in politics all the time.<br>example: A TV campaign ad during a local election that shouted somethkng totally unrelated at you? like &quot;Do not elect Dan, his daughter eats cereal!&quot; And suddenly you are wondering what is wrong with eating cereal<br><br><br>until you forget that cereal has nothing to do with politics.<br><br>4- Traditional wisdom(Appeal to tradition):<br>The idea that you should pick something because that is how your grandmom or old man used it", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T14:18:35Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"VXhLmkrN0-I": {"Influence & Persuasion: Crash Course Media Literacy #6": {"channel_id": "UgzRRUO7f8S2H6XPyMp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "AlcoholicNerd", "comment_text": "I recognized only McDonald&#39;s tune.
