If you focus on the character goals, then you will generally get the performance you wanted, even if you didn&#39;t know you wanted it.  This is true also for screenwriters.  Another bit I would touch on is the interaction and relationship between the director, the AD and producers/production.  Its a delicate balance of time, performance, and money and a good director will always attempt to balance these with a preference towards performance just as an AD has a preference towards time and a producer has a preference towards budget.  They all work together trying to make it all happen but each has their own focuses to help ensure that there is the best performances while remaining on schedule and therefore within the budget.  <br><br>I also wholesomely agree that it is beneficial for a director to understand other departments.  Ultimately you are the reason everything is happening, even if the producers like to get involved, and understanding the requests you make of your crew will help them to respect you and work harder to bring your vision to life.  It will also help to prevent you from asking something of your crew that is unreasonable or would be a strain on your time/budget.  If you still believe said idea is needed you at least have the ability to understand you are asking a lot and to ask with empathy.", "comment_date": "2018-11-21T14:37:12Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Invincible Rage", "comment_text": "This was a great video with great insight, and I&#39;m now subscribed. This is so exciting for me, I love directing. Some never take the challenge because they see it as difficult and tedious, but not me. Whether in class in film school or at home, I would be imagining stories and characters. When professors would asked who wants to be the director, I would always raise my hand. I already had a story, and characters. I also write my own scripts, do my own cinematography, and do my own editing. When you see yourself as an artist instead of a director doing a job, everything falls into place. The challenge becomes a joy, and the long hours, and many days are worth the reward. To see your imagination come to life. It feels like creating life. It&#39;s the purpose of bringing life to an idea, an expression. When you see it as an art, think as an artist, and have a story to tell that will connect with the audience. It is a great and enlightening journey that In the future I will share with the world in theaters around the world.
