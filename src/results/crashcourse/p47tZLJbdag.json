First of all New Amsterdam remained under control of the Netherlands governors, citizens kept their rights as they were under Netherland&#39;s rule, and even in 1667 the city still had not been formally turned over to the English. And there was little England could do about it as England had lost the 2nd war with Netherland.<br><br>Meanwhile New Amsterdam was in fact traded for Suriname, in South America. This would turn out to be more profitable in the long run.  It wasn&#39;t until 19 Feb 1674 that Netherland officially transferred all claim over New Amsterdam to England.

Serious attempts to curb the slave trade only started 50 years after the colony was founded and a successful attempt to curb it was 20 years behind that. Too many rich Quakers were making too much money off the trade and William Penn himself stated he&#39;d much prefer to own a slave that he would have forever than an indentured servant who would leave in 7 years. Being drunk in public was against the law, not drinking - the first place built and opened in Philadelphia was a pub, the Blue Anchor and the first brewery opened within a year of the first arrivals.
