independent folk communities worldwide.<br><br>I think that problems like drug addiction can be seen as part of consumer addiction which is a secular version of religious mind control.<br><br>If divide and conquer pig alien dialectical tactics are used by the ruling class purses the consumer slave class then we should grow up and learn how to address these issues without being hateful or blaming anybody.<br><br>my suggestion is that we refer to the existing corporate government system for what it is which it represents the will of the bankers and the royal families that own

propaganda from the media design to divide us but we are creating solutions.<br><br>The main scam that I see in all sectors of life is the difference between talking about a good idea versus actually executing it.<br><br>I still agree with the concept of a United States because even if I think that I understand things more correctly than a majority of people who I consider to be mind-controlled I know that it&#39;s not going to matter unless I can communicate and cooperate with the greater community.<br><br>We need more unity that is gained through the hard work encountering people with
