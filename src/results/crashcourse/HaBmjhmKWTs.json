But this Birth Of A Nation episode reveals the problems of Crash Course Film&#39;s approach as a series, and general academic narratives of film history overall.<br>If race enters into the conversation for the first time with BOAN, then the racism integral to U.S. film\u2019s development is obscured. This makes it harder to grapple with BOAN in context. If race enters the conversation for the first time here, then critiques of the film can only be shallow, can only be a \u201cit\u2019s good but it\u2019s racist, what are you going to do!\u201d level of engagement, or a misleading &quot;art vs the artist&quot;.<br>BOAN is not just an exceptionally racist work, but it is a film built on the existing form and technology that was marketed and developed through anti-blackness. Discussion of Porter &amp; Edison is purely formal \u2013 but their developments in form (technology and narrative as well) was built on anti-blackness. Early film narratives and jokes were developed through racist discourse. Cinematic technology was sold through film\u2019s ability to racialize and display racial difference and white supremacist ideologies. All of this leads into BOAN and Griffith - his &quot;emotionally effective&quot; melodrama and editing is built on lynching narratives present in the very beginnings of photography and cinema. His blackface caricatures, his eugenics and facism displayed in BOAN\u2019s \u201canti war\u201d melodramatic message, his formal achievements built on anti-black racism are not just a &quot;double edged sword&quot; through which to interpret him. Griffith is not a \u201cpioneer and hate group revivalist\u201d \u2013 his pioneering is inherently connected to this racism, his form and technology are a part of an anti-black discourse that is U.S. cinema, a cinema developed through this racism, this spectacle, this violence.
