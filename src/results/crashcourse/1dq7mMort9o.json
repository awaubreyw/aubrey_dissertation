Since 1980s, the Fed has lowered interest rates and since 2008 the Fed has done QE to reward the asset owner class by raising asset prices.  <b>These artificially low interest rates and QE have caused the year/generation you were born in to determine whether you are able to own a home and generate wealth</b> . The older generations bought homes for 1-2 times median income and bought stocks at 8 times PE ratios in the 1980s because asset prices were low because Volker set interest rates high. Then these people road the Greenspan, Bernanke, Yellen and Powell puts and became rich as their homes and stock portfolios increased +10% a year.  <b>They became rich because they were simply born at the right time</b> . But the asset non-owner underclass (millenials and poor boomers who didn&#39;t accumulate assets in 1980s) deal with housing at 8-10 times median income (because wages didn&#39;t increase since 1980s), a bubble stock market that only went up because of QE and low interest rates. It is a shame that 99% of people have no idea that monetary policy and not fiscal policy deserves most of the blame. Eventually the asset non-owner underclass will revolt by electing an MMT president, who will inflate away the asset bubbles and make housing affordable again (and cause a depression in the process). Please spread the word so people can understand this and we can have a change in monetary policy.

The Fed really can&#39;t use open market operations to increase or decrease the money supply ... because back in 2014, the Fed had just finished 6 years of Quantitative Easing (aka &quot;QE&quot;) which created a LOT money by buying a LOT of bonds with &quot;newly-printed money&quot; ... During these 6 years the Fed created $3.6 Trillion (in addition to the $900 Billion that the Fed had created by 2007) by buying medium-term bonds, rather than &quot;short-term&quot; bonds as (blatently) mis-mentioned in the video.  (This raised the &quot;average maturity&quot; of the Fed&#39;s bond portfolio from 2.5 years in 2008, to 5 or 6 years in 2014.)  <br><br><br>This $4.5 Trillion of &quot;Fed-created-money&quot; gives the Banking Industry the potential to create $45 Trillion (i.e., making Bank loans under the 10% reserve requirement) ... which would create a LOT of inflation, because most people don&#39;t want bank loans unless they have plans to spend it, or invest it (which ould produce an increase in aggregate demand in the economy.  So, there&#39;s an argument that the Fed screwed up by not allowing the economy to recover quickly, because wen interest rates are SO LOW, the banks approve few loans because the ever-present risk of default is a larger problem compared to the interest rate).   During the 6 years up to 2014, Banks made so few loans that they barely kept pace with the repayment of old loans in the normal course of business, so there was not much demand created by &quot;new&quot; bank loans.  (I&#39;ll skip the idea that bank loans for investment purposes create an increase in goods and services, which offset the increase in money from such loans, so not much impact on inflation).<br><br><br>So the banks had a lot of &quot;excess reserves&quot; (money in excess of the 10% required reserve, which can be loaned out).  The Fed would have crashed the economy if they had significantly reduced the money supply (i.e., reducing excess reserves) because that would have meant selling a LOT of bonds, which would have crashed the price of bonds (which raises the interest rate) as Uncle Sam (i.e., the Federal Gov&#39;t) was trying to raise money by selling more bonds to cover the huge budget deficit of roughly $1 Trillion, each year, for the next several years.  The Fed had to hold on to their bonds.  The money supply couldn&#39;t be reduced.  Low interest rates may have kept Banks from lending as much as they would have with higher rates.<br><br><br>So, surely (or &quot;probably&quot; or &quot;hopefully&quot;) having foreseen much of this. the Fed relied on the IOER (and then the IOR) to keep the interest rates from falling lower.  <br>IOER = Interest Rate on Excess Reserves ... and  .... IOR = Interest Rate on Reserves<br><br><br>I believe the IOER was originally conceived to keep banks from going bankrupt since the Fed may have foreseen that (in the near future) Banks would have so little revenue (interest income) from so few loans.  Later on, perhaps, the IOR was employed as a tool to encourage banks to keep excess reserves in accounts at the Fed, from which they are not loanable.  Sure, its voluntary, the amounts at the Fed can be retrieved &quot;at will&quot; by the Banks .... but there&#39;s way more money than the Banks can lend out, and the interest rates are (which depend on maturity and security) is so low that the ever-present danger of a loan default makes lending untenable to customers who expect a lower interest rate.", "comment_date": "2019-09-29T15:07:08Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1dq7mMort9o": {"What's all the Yellen About?

The law courts and various judgments have made very clear, if you give your money to a bank, even though, it\u2019s ca;;ed a deposit, this money is simply a loan to the bank\r<br>\r<br>So, there is no such a thing as deposit.\r<br>\r<br>Banks borrow from the public\r<br>\r<br>Banks don\u2019t lend money, banks are in the business of purchasing securities (the law is very clear about it)\r<br>\r<br>So when you want a loan, there\u2019s the loan contract and you sign, at law. It\u2019s very clear, you have issued a security, namely a promissory note and the bank is going to purchase that\r<br>\r<br>What the bank is doing is very different from what it presents to the public\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>The bank purchases my promissory note, but how do I get my money\u2026?\r<br>\r<br>The bank will say: you will find it in your account. That would be technically correct.\r<br>\r<br>If , they say, we will transfer to your account, that\u2019s wrong, because no money is transferred at all.\r<br>\r<br>Why\u2026? Because what we call a deposit is simply the bank\u2019s record of its debt to the public. \r<br>\r<br>The bank also owes you money and its record of the money it owes you, is what you think you\u2019re getting as money and that\u2019s how the banks create the money supply\r<br>\r<br>The money supply consists to 97% of bank deposits and these are created out of nothing by banks when they lend money, because they invent fictitious customer deposits.\r<br>\r<br>Why..?\r<br>\r<br>Because , they simply restate slightly incorrectly in accounting terms, what is an accounts payable liability arising from the loan contract, having purchased your promissory note as a customer deposit but nobody has deposited any money\r<br>\r<br>So the baks create the mobey supply by inventing tjese claims on themselves, the ficticious deposits, that can be actually positive for ythe economy, as long as there\u2019s money creation is in line with the cration of new goods and services, implementation of new technologies and therefore adding value in the economy is funded by this money creation if that happens, we \u2018re ralking about business investment, productive loans, you will have no inflation and low inequality\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Germany is a case in point with over 1500 community banks who do not lend for speculative ends\r<br>\r<br>Lending f for consumption, you suddenly have more money created and more demand for goods but it\u2019s the same amount of goods and services, so you are creating consumer price inflation\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>In many countries , 70%++ of all lending, money creation for financial transactions, for asset transactions for purchasing ownerships rights, this is problem. \r<br>\r<br>Why..?\r<br>\r<br>Because the new money is created but new goods and services are not created\r<br>\r<br>So the  are giving somebody new purchasing power over existing assets and therefore asset prices go up (property, land prices. This creates inequality\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Unproductive lending is dominant\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Where the money is going..? If for productive purposes, we will get a good economy. No inflation and financial stability and also no inequality problem\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Banks are not financial intermediaries, they are money creators\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>We need new regulation in order to prevent acid bubbles and banking crisis which are all driven by this bank credit for financial transactions, it releases acid boom and it\u2019s a game of musical chairs, you have to play it while the music is playing, which is how assets prices are driven ny evermore bank credit for financial transactions.\r<br>\r<br>The moment is stops, assets prices fall and bankruptcies happened, the whole thing goes bust\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Guidance of bank credit, simple rules are needed. Simply ban bank credit for financial transactions. That creates boom-bust cycles\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Let the speculators, speculate but not allow them to borrow money from banks\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>We need to create small banks to support SME.

Fed is the central bank of US<br> 2. Central banks<br>  a.  regulate and oversee the nation&#39;s commercial banks by making sure that banks have enough money in reserve to avoid bank runs.<br>  b. Conduct Monetary Policy which is increasing or decreasing the money supply to speed up or slow down the overall economy. <br> 3. Interest Rate - The price of borrowing money<br> 4. Loans depend on interest rates. <br> 5. When Interest Rates are low, borrowers will find it easier to pay back loans so they will borrow more and spend more. When Irates are high, borrowers borrow less and therefore spend less. <br> 6. Less money- higher interest rates<br> 7. More money- less interest rates<br> 8. Expansionary Monetary Policy- If the central bank wants to speed the economy, it increases the money supply which leads to decreased Irates and hence more borrowing and spending. <br> 9. Contractionary Monetary Policy- To slow down the economy , decrease the money supply. <br> 10. Recessionary Gap- Output low and unemployment is high. <br> 11. Contractionary monetary policy drives down inflation but increase unemployment. <br> 12. Two things keep the banking system healthy - Confidence (customers can get there money back) &amp; Liquidity<br> 13. Liquid Assets- an asset that can be converted into cash quickly and with minimal impact to the price received. <br> 14. How does central bank change the money supply occur (3 Ways):<br>  a. Changing the reserve requirement- decrease RR increase money supply and vice versa <br>  b. Change the interest rate (discount rate) to the banks that borrow from Central bank. Decrease Discount rate will allow the other banks to borrow and hence increase the money supply <br>  c. Open Market Operations- When the Fed buys or sells short term govt. bonds. <br> 15. Govt. Bond or treasury bill is an IOU which says &quot;I&#39;ll pay you later&quot;. If fed buys previously issued bonds from the local bank, it increases the money supply. <br> 16. Fed usually use Open Market Operations to increase or decrease the money supply. <br> 17. Quantitative Easing- When Central Banks buys long term assets from banks (like buying home loans). <br> 18. Banks have to keep around 10% of their reserves. <br> 19. Two ways in which we can speed up or slow down the economy:<br>  a. Fiscal Policy- Changing government spending or taxes- for severe downturn. <br>  b. Monetary Policy- Changing the money supply- for garden variety downturn", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T07:19:27Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"1dq7mMort9o": {"What's all the Yellen About?

As it is explained in the video fed is about to take this extra money out of economy just before the party gets started (banks are now more willing to lend and excess reserves are shrinking), which is now. Fed also raised federal funds rate in recent past to 1,25%. What is alarming is since interest rates are going to get higher, fed will be forced to take losses on the sale of mbs and treasuries (it doesn&#39;t take losses just now, because it&#39;s accounting practice is not marked to market), since these are going to fall in prices when interest rates get up.

Instead the bank would prefer you buy your house using your newly credited account. By doing so, the bank can settle the transaction with its account at the federal reserve. When banks settle transactions on behalf of their customers who make their payments, the net position of the banks are calculated and a net transfer of central banks reserves are made. For banks with a deficit, they can borrow from other banks or use the central banks standing facilities. For banks with a surplus of reserves, they can lend out the reserves or use the standing facilities for depositing excess reserves. In aggregate this means a redistribution of central bank reserves. Open market operations can also have a similar redistributing effect. <br><br>The money supply consists mainly of:<br>Central bank reserves = liabilities of the central bank and an asset for banks with an account at the Central Bank. Only banks with an account at the Central Bank can settle transactions in the manner I described above. Consequently central bank reserves circulate in a closed system. An increase in reserves does not necessarily mean an increase in the money supply. A genuine increase in the money supply would have to increase broad money, namely what the public holds, not some numbers in a closed off environment. <br><br>Bank deposits = bank liabilities, an IOU issued by banks which is basically a promise to repay the holder. In fact we shouldn&#39;t call it deposits because that implies you simply drop off cash at your bank. It ignores the fact that you can settle transactions with these deposits. Deposit is a euphemism. It&#39;s actually credit and its the banks who issue credit. By credit I mean a means of payment which is also a liability for the creditor. Banking is not about keeping some money and lending the rest, it&#39;s about substituting a commonly held means of payment by your own means of payment. <br><br>Cash = bank notes and coins, you all know what this one is. Technically they&#39;re also a liability of the central bank. <br><br>If you could only start off by defining the three main types of money in the money supply and elaborate on the payment system, you wouldn&#39;t get all this confusion and misunderstanding. <br><br>A further reading would be:<br>What is money - and easy introductory article on the ECB&#39;s website. Here some key terms are inside and outside money.

Governement protects against these things through law enforcement, a justice system, and a military. Everything else should be left to the people (or at least the states) to decide for themselves. This included anything to do with banks or money. Currency should be denationalized and subject to free market competition like everything else. People should be free to use whatever currency they deem fit (most stable, portable, divisible, etc.). There should be no central bank that has a monopoly on control of U.S. currency. Of course, private banks (like the federal reserve) can produce their own currency, but the people should be free to opt for another form and government should not be involved. If a bank screws up, they should be allowed to fail like any business to make room for a better one (like ones with more liquid assets). The government shouldn&#39;t be speeding up or slowing down the economy.", "comment_date": "2016-07-03T20:44:49Z", "likes_count": 5}}}, {"1dq7mMort9o": {"What's all the Yellen About?

Certainly there were policies from the fed that helped create a stock bubble but bubbles come and go, the great depression was much more than that.<br><br>Our government already had disastrous banking regulations in place which significantly weakened the banks ability to survive downturns which was a larger impact than fed policy and directly resulted in many bank failures which did not happen in Canada since they did not have our banking regulations and their economy recovered without the tragic consequences we had in the U.S.<br><br>Government policies like increasing taxes and debt and restricting foreign trade probably had the largest effect since it was not until the Smoot-Hawley Tariff act was passed that unemployment really skyrocketed. Before that unemployment had peaked at around 9% from the market crash and was heading back down but then suddenly shot up to 25% soon after this particular anti trade act was passed.<br><br>Not ten years previously there was another very significant stock market crash but we don&#39;t hear about the great depression of 1921 because (nor any other time period after a large stock crash), while the fed was in place at the time, the government did not react to that crash with dozens of horribly backward policies.<br><br>A central banker like the Ben Bernank will obviously see the central bank as central to all of the economic issues at the time but this is a myopic view which ignores dozens and dozens of government actions that also made things worse and it ignores the rest of the world which generally weathered this period much more easily because they did not enact the policies we did.<br><br>Another thing regarding the affects of high interest rates mentioned in this video. Yes it may reduce investment but this increases the quality of investment. Meaning they will hold out and only lend to the best possible candidates and only those with the most confidence will want to get a high interest rate loan. Obviously this results in a much much lower default rate on bank loans which is very good for the economy. You can see the results of very low interest rates in the crash of 2008 when a few years previously rates had gone down to an unheard of 1% resulting in very risky and careless loans which obviously had a high chance of default as well as encouraging more people to seek loans when their financial stability was less than ideal.", "comment_date": "2015-10-15T00:11:25Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1dq7mMort9o": {"What's all the Yellen About?

From what I understand (which isn&#39;t all that much tbh, which is why I&#39;d like a video to make sure I&#39;m not misunderstanding anything here) fractional reserve banking means that the main creation of new money is in banks instead of at the fed, as the money not in reserve is given out and so belongs to multiple people at once, meaning, in essence, new money is created, however, it is based on debt. If full reserve banking were to be used then all new money creation could be held at the level of the fed through quantitative easing. The same amount of new money can enter the system, however, due to the money being created from a single central point it can be easily regulated, reducing speculation - all banks feeding large amounts of the newly created money directly into areas that look like they&#39;re doing well, creating bubbles, which eventually pop, causing financial crises. Full reserve banking would take some time to get to, as you couldn&#39;t starve the economy of money all in one go while banks get to the 100% reserve point, but in the long run it could reduce the chances of financial crises, and the fed could still direct the newly created money towards entrepreneurs and parties whose goal is beneficial to society, as opposed to just the places that will make the most money in the short run.", "comment_date": "2015-10-09T17:19:54Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1dq7mMort9o": {"What's all the Yellen About?
