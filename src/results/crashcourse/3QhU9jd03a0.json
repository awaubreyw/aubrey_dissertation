Admittedly many PC motherboards, SoCs and even embedded systems nowadays come with an integrated Ethernet controller rather than a separate card attached to a bus (such as PCIe), but the MAC address is definitely a property of the interface and not of the host.  (Though some Field-Replaceable Unit (FRU) systems like &#39;SMASH CLP&#39; try to hide that by having the host (or a BMC) override the NIC&#39;s MAC address, this is IMHO a really bad design.)<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QhU9jd03a0&amp;t=3m03s\">3:03</a> Others have pointed out that radio waves aren&#39;t carried by the air, but Ethernet is not always over copper wire either.

This is necessary because without such an algorithm, increases in latency due to congestion lead to excessive retransmits, which multiplies the load and thus increases the congestion \u2014 a phenomenon known as _congestive collapse_.", "comment_date": "2017-09-14T23:48:11Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"3QhU9jd03a0": {"Computer Networks: Crash Course Computer Science #28": {"channel_id": "UgxYe2T7q5igJOQRy8h4AaABAg", "comment_by": "IkeOld", "comment_text": "Speed of light in air is 0.03% lower.
