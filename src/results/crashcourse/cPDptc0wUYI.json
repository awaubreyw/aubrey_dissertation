The answer was no-where-near made out clearly, and I would suggest that anyone trying to grasp the basic concept go look elsewhere. the way electron shells work (at A-level), is that each shell has an energy level that increases the further it is from the nucleus. within these are sub shells, that have smaller differences between energy levels, and finally within those, exist orbitals. The orbitals hold the electrons, and each orbital can hold two at a time. There are different types of sub-shells: S, P, and D are the basics. the S sub shells have 1 orbital, the Ps 3, and the Ds 5. this means that a full first shell can have a maximum of 2 electrons (1 full S orbital), a full 2nd shell can have a maximum of 8 electrons (1 full S orbital, and 3 full P orbitals). Finally, the 3rd level can have a maximum of 18 electrons (1 full S orbital, 3 full P orbitals, and 5 full D orbitals). remember that each orbital can hold 2 electrons. There is much more to this, but hopefully that helps. Btw, each energy energy level is labelled 1, 2, 3, and so on, and the number of sub shells in each is the same as that number.", "comment_date": "2019-10-24T09:19:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daph", "comment_text": "watching this again because of uni", "comment_date": "2019-10-24T02:51:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roman Negussie", "comment_text": "This guy likes to hear himself talk more than teach the topic.

Orbits are the paths of electrons, which we cannot know because of Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle (The more you know how fast something is going the less you would know it\u2019s position in space). So again: Orbitals are just places around the nucleus where there is a high probability of finding an electron.

This idea is based on: (E=\u02e0M\u02f3C\u00b2)\u221e with energy \u2206E equals mass \u2206M linked to the Lorentz contraction \u02e0 of space and time. The Lorentz contraction \u02e0 represents the time dilation of Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity. We have energy \u2206E slowing the rate that time \u2206t flows as a universal process of energy exchange or continuous creation. Mass will increase relative to this process with gravity being a secondary force to the electromagnetic force. The c\u00b2 represents the speed of light c radiating out in a sphere 4\u03c0 of EMR from its radius forming a square c\u00b2 of probability. We have to square the probability of the wave-function \u03a8 because the area of the sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere multiplied by 4\u03c0. This simple geometrical process forms the probability and uncertainty of everyday life and at the smallest scale of the process is represented mathematically by Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle \u2206\u00d7\u2206p\u1d6a\u2265h/4\u03c0. In such a theory we have an emergent future unfolding photon by photon with the movement of charge and flow of EM fields. This gives us a geometrical reason for positive and negative charge with a concaved inner surface for negative charge and a convexed outer surface for positive charge. The brackets in the equation (E=\u02e0M\u02f3C\u00b2)\u221e represent a dynamic boundary condition of an individual reference frame with an Arrow of Time or time line for each frame of reference.
