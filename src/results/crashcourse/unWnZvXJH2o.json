Guess what is really cool about that, yet still sad in some ways. If a blind persons eyes actually work, but the portion of the brain that brings your vision to your consciousness is damaged or just not functioning, blind people can still respond to visual stimulation. The part of your brain that reacts to other peoples emotions comes from an area that evolved in a different location much later than basic conscious sight.
