What we think of as the most mind-shatteringly macro end of the universe is actually the most mind-shatteringly micro end from a different perspective. We observe the vastness of the universe and the tinyness of quantum mechanics and perceive ourselves to be somewhere in the middle. But I feel as if there really is no end to the spectrum, observe the universe from even farther out and it&#39;s the brain of a lifeform who feels insignificant in the vastness of the universe they can see, and in the opposite direction, the subatomic particles we observe are actually galaxies full of life.",

How can you quantify the unquantifiable, something that can and can&#39;t be and are both at the same time and everything in-between?

On earth we do not need lots of gravity to make gamma and x-rays.  All we need is an electric discharge like lightning or arc welders.  So what we are seeing are probably not mathematically impossible black holes, but arcing between objects under electrical stress at the core, possibly busted up dense cores of stars or planets that busted up due to electrical stress.<br>    Also, there is no evidence that elliptical galaxies are formed from other galaxies.  They are usually wedged between two active galaxies like the low density B area between to current carrying wires.  Elliptical galaxies have very little star formation or evidence of a core, like active galaxies have. So the evidence from elliptical galaxies alone shows that they probably do not form by smaller galaxies merging or they would have more massive cores, not the lack of a core. You need to do a little bit of research into Anthony Peratt and learn a bit about galaxies.<br>   And, yes galaxies do seem to line up along electrical currents that connect them like beads on a string.   And, yes the Hubble deep field did detect galaxies that , by current expansion theory, are much older than the theoretical age of the universe.",

My question is, What is at the center of everything? we know that in our solar system we orbit the sun, and the sun orbits the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way. But what about outside of that? Does the Milky Way orbit something, and the Local group, etc etc?",

If galaxies keep colliding and getting bigger, and since gravity pulls objects together, will the universe eventually collide into one large mass? It was interesting to learn that the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy are going to collide sooner or later and become the Milkomeda Galaxy.  I\u2019ve been taught what we call the \u201cback-door policy\u201d: when naming things you should think about if you\u2019d be willing and able to shout it out the back door.  I have realized that I am not willing to shout \u201cMILKOMEDA\u201d out my back door, so I began to come up with alternatives. I thought of Androway or Andray as new possibilities. <br>-Grace Linden 9th Grade",

I did know about galaxies before watching this video but I did not know about clusters and superclusters. 100 000 000 000 galaxies! Wow, that\u2019s a pretty big number. It\u2019s only a shame that we only will be able visit so few of them...Anyway, quasars are also splendid, fascinating! Thank you for making this video!<br><br>I do have a question, though. You mentioned that there are a number of ways to classify and group galaxies together, but only talked about two grouping them together based on shape (spiral, elliptical, irregular etc.) and based on energy-output (active, non-active and quasars). So galaxies are really huge, but how massive are there? How do you group them together based on mass? How massive are galaxies?",
