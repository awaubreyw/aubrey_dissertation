You might want to do a video comparing river erosion with glacial erosion. I remember being taught that glaciers were big ice bulldozers grinding away the rock underneath, kind of like a stream. But then why the U-shaped valleys? Climbing along the glacial arete in Kamikochi Japan made me aware of the real power of glaciers- the freeze, expand cracking all along the sides of a glacier - quarrying. Aretes are usually what&#39;s left over as glaciers quarry but recede too rapidly to then transport the shattered rock. It&#39;s pretty exciting to know that with hundreds of meters of space below your butt, the rock you&#39;re holding on to is all broken (and bats hiding in the cracks are hissing).", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T21:20:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Micah Yang", "comment_text": "Very grateful that crash course makes an effort to incorporate a more complete worldview in its videos than the america-centric or western perspective usually found in class.
