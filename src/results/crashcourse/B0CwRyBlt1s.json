It is not harder to transfer heat to a fluid moving very fast. Q=mcdT references mass flow - not velocity. The amount of energy required is dependent on the amount of matter, i.e. material, not on how fast it is moving. It is actually easier to transfer heat to a fast moving fluid since the flow is more turbulent. The video even points this fact out when discussing baffles in shell and tube heat exchangers.    <br><br>The concentric tube example is correct, but the explanation is not. Speeding up the flow of the inner tube actually increases the heat transfer since the heat transfer coefficient increases with velocity. The  temperature of the cold inner fluid does drop as the flow is increased. However, this temperature drop is because the increase in mass flow is proportionally greater than that of the heat transfer coefficient - not because the fluid sped up. Again, Q=mcdT. Since m increases more than Q, and since the heat capacity, c, is roughly constant, dT must decrease. <br><br>This explanation also accounts for why the hot, outer fluid temperature actually decreases even though the outer fluid flow and the amount of area stayed the same. If the overall heat transfer had decreased, the outer fluid temperature would still have been hot (i.e. red).", "comment_date": "2018-08-30T21:44:41Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "3rdEye7", "comment_text": "She&#39;s so awesome \ud83e\udd17!", "comment_date": "2018-08-30T21:39:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HorzaPanda", "comment_text": "X-Ray <b>machines</b> make a lot of heat<br><br>I&#39;m being a stickler I know, but yes, our lab source x-ray devices have liquid cooling for the target they use for x-ray generation :D", "comment_date": "2018-08-30T21:09:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jake", "comment_text": "Who is a non student just watching for the fun of it?", "comment_date": "2018-08-30T21:01:42Z", "likes_count": 180}, {"comment_by": "Julie AV", "comment_text": "So a steam locomotive uses a shell and tube style heat exchanger (boiler) if I understand this but with hot combustion gas in the tube and cold water in the shell.
