The founding fathers were well aware of the concept of judicial review and did NOT include it in the constitution.  The supreme court bided its time and made a political decision to establish judicial review when they thought they could get away with it.  Jefferson and others saw though judicial review.  They believed it placed too much power in the judiciary and threw checks and balances out of whack.  They rightfully criticized it but the decision held.  The court initially treated the power of judicial review as a nuclear option and never again used it to invalidate a law passed by congress until Dred Scott in 1857.  That\u2019s right.  You know how the modern court strikes down laws all time time?  Back in the early 1800\u2019s the first and second cases were separated by 54 YEARS!!!  The reason is because the early court knew the concept of judicial review was problematic and therefore tenuous.  They rightfully feared the other two branches reasserting their power and overturning judicial review.  Perhaps with something equally absurd, like legislative review or executive review.  Could that still happen?  Maybe.  Or perhaps the other two branches will just stack the court with fifteen justices, as was proposed by several presidential candidates earlier this year.", "comment_date": "2020-03-27T12:37:22Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "Ugwf-VMlGFNG21DN3xJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "John-Emren", "comment_text": "Who\u2019s watching this for online classes for covid-19 or corona virus ....

And I really hope I don&#39;t come off as one of those obnoxious people who loves to snipe every little thing I see. In spite of all of that, though, I would like to ask you to consider reframing Judicial Review with some facts that I think are important and suggest it was just a given to the Founders that the court would have this power.  I think it&#39;s an important point because political opportunists just love to get people worked up with the claim that court <b>took</b> this power in Marbury as opposed to it being <b>conferred</b> to it in the Constitution.  Anyhoo, here are those facts...<br><br>First, in the Ratification Debate, Judicial Review was clearly anticipated. A plain reading of both sides make it pretty clear that the debate took Judicial Review as a given and centered on what the court would do with the power.  (Please see the Federalists Papers, Nos. 78 \u2013 82; Brutus XI \u2013 XV; Centinel XVI; The Federal Farmer XV.)<br><br>Second, SCOTUS exercised Judicial Review in its formative period; well before Marbury. It is important to bear in mind that even though SCOTUS did not invalidate the statutes at issue, it did rule on their constitutionality and never hinted that doing so was a function outside of its purview. (Please see Hylton v. United States, 3 U.S. 171 (1796) and Calder v. Bull, 3 US 386 (1798).)<br><br>Finally, it is also important to recall the prestige the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia (later, Supreme Court of Virginia) held in the early Republic and Justices Nelson\u2019s and Tucker\u2019s seriatim opinions in Kamper v. Hawkins, 3 Va. (1 Va. cases) 20, (1793) that are pretty clearly talking about the court&#39;s <b>duty</b> to review.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for letting me sound off :)", "comment_date": "2016-02-17T07:08:43Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "Ugim4OZek8TCMngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Midyy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWYFwl93uCM&amp;t=5m22s\">5:22</a> XD", "comment_date": "2016-02-10T01:49:51Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "UggW4rHKIOExBXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jack in Black", "comment_text": "whose watching this for homework?", "comment_date": "2016-02-06T19:10:12Z", "likes_count": 549}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "UgiA9-um6-g3wngCoAEC", "comment_by": "JazzHands101", "comment_text": "is there anyway you can talk slower in future videos?", "comment_date": "2016-01-25T20:39:18Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "UgjM976GEfNMbngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Rachel Faas", "comment_text": "I loved the Daredevil reference.", "comment_date": "2015-12-16T05:30:34Z", "likes_count": 12}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "UghTaADq8qeNIHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Child", "comment_text": "I actually sneezed when you sneezed &#39;statues&#39;.", "comment_date": "2015-12-13T09:41:47Z", "likes_count": 22}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "UggDjhs42gGbfngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Sigal Stein", "comment_text": "We likely already a one-party country, except that some parties haven&#39;t heard of it yet. Ask Gore. The Clintons line the pockets of judges and attorneys in return for arms deals kickbacks. Justices will put their own people in power. Ask the Bushes and watch Fahrenheit 911. Judges are immune. Attorneys have no liabilities associated with their licenses. Doctors and bankers are self-regulating. Judges don&#39;t want to be elected anymore. This brings America on  a par with Russia, China, North Korea. We have the same judicial branch. <br>In court oral Agreement Law is misapplied everywhere. See Rules of Civil Procedure 15(4) - by a moment of silence an attorney can indicate to the judge that they agree with the other side without the knowledge of the party and against its will. In Family Court the judges appoint a state funded guardian ad litem who is paid a second time for the same services as the unbundled services of the same party without their knowledge and against their will. In Criminal Court public defenders and attorneys will prosecute an innocent party for money. The party will have served their sentence and will not be released from incarceration unless they admit to a crime they didn&#39;t commit. Bribe is what the courts have always been about. The FBI can&#39;t prosecute without a prosecuting attorney, law or a judge. All are missing. Governor of Colorado, Hickenlooper, signs bills to hire cops with criminal background &amp; generate foreclosures by giving Community Association Managers the right to take &quot;undisclosed fees&quot; in the form of kickbacks from attorneys for starting litigation. The attorney who conducted the sunshine report for DORA, as well as a senior DORA representative both resigned. I hear that he wants to prevent the public from voting for judges.<br>Three new amendments to the U.S. Constitution can change the course of history: 29 - state employee, DORA regulated judges. No appeals. No need to botch the case. Work from the constitution up. Simple. 30 - Clerks supervised by Sheriff&#39;s office &amp; DORA. No justice department. No chief judges. No justices. 31- No attorneys ever elected with the legislative branch. No legislators eligible for attorney license. <br>I&#39;m not an attorney and don&#39;t give legal advice. There is no such thing as legal advice as the Supreme Court changes the law weekly. Typical rulings sound like this: &quot;no need for separation of authorities due to accountability&quot; &amp; &quot;illegal contracts with attorneys giving them absolute power are legal as the client shows trust by signing them.&quot; <br>Attorneys, doctors and bankers are self-regulating so their income doesn&#39;t represent market forces - it represents illegal corruption. The judicial branch should have no legislative powers at all. But they should stick to the constitutions, one after the other, and only later the statutes. It is easy if you don&#39;t listen to attorneys. Then all illegal activity should be curbed by state-employee, DORA regulated magistrates. A divorce should be a pro-se situation, as most if not all other civil litigation. In Criminal court innocent people are put in prison - the judges control the juries, don&#39;t follow the law, people are prosecuted by their own attorneys for profit, etc. Our judicial branch is entirely counter productive - upholding crime for business, selling people&#39;s civil rights by the hour, etc. The justice department is costing billions hourly - and all they do is sell the right for crime to politicians. Save billions and disassemble the judicial branch.<br>The problem with becoming a one-party country is that other one-party countries are likely to conquer.", "comment_date": "2015-11-24T18:51:19Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "UgjVaK9cqQSLTXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Harrison Gowland", "comment_text": "Can they exercise judicial power over small loans of a million dollars?", "comment_date": "2015-11-21T21:32:43Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "UghEJPozBMrgL3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "T Man", "comment_text": "I love the Daredevil analogy, it actually made the whole thing alot easier to understand", "comment_date": "2015-11-02T04:37:10Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "UghSok66nVOvZHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Flynn Johnson", "comment_text": "I like this guy better than John Green.", "comment_date": "2015-10-09T01:16:56Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "UgjgfKPIjfM-RHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Cade Claridy", "comment_text": "Shout out to Mr. Adler \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffb", "comment_date": "2015-09-27T23:41:13Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"mWYFwl93uCM": {"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21": {"channel_id": "Uggqmf_rnZTJkHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Kevin Barretta", "comment_text": "I spent three hours reading through my school text and still had no idea what Judicial Review really was or why we have it.
