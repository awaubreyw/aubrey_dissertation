Just think about it for a second.  If the supply of money is stable, growth is deflationary as there are more goods and services per monetary unit.  In the 1870&#39;s and &#39;80s the US had robust growth and falling prices.  Also, the fear that people might not send all their money is totally wrong headed.  Economic growth depends on robust savings and investments.  So when prices are gently falling due to growth, people will save more, leading to more growth.  However, inflation discourages savings and hurts growth.  Consider the stagflation of the &#39;70s, for example... not to mention any hyperinflation in history you&#39;d care to look at.

It is easy to understand, and covers the basic concepts still effectively. However I realize how different some of my views of economics is from the mainstream. I am much more on the free market side and every time they start going down the whole the free market breaks down here &quot;obviously&quot; so we need Government for that I go ugh. The fire department example was kinda dense if you ask m., They treat it as an &quot;obvious&quot; scenario for the need of Government? Really? is it that obvious that there are no other reasonable alternatives? What about insurance or a monthly fee so that as soon as you call they see your phone number is covered or current and then they come. Then you could utilize that free market thing they were just praising a minute ago. I know some people still find issue with that kind of system, but it is a reasonable alternative to the government forcing us to pay for it no mater how inefficiently they operate.<br><br>I also have a serious problem with the view that deflation is bad and a cause of recessions. It&#39;s not. If they want stable prices then the economy can&#39;t improve. People are better off because things get cheaper. Can you imagine if the price for computers was stable since the 90&#39;s. Making them cheaper has made them better. Don&#39;t let them fool you. This is a Keynesian view that stems from the idea that there needs to be spending to keep an economy moving and stop the cycle of falling demand.The reality is though that the reason there is no demand and prices need to fall in order for people to afford them. Yes it&#39;s bad or the economy in the short run, but it is a necessary correction for the long run, because the production does not justify the consumption. They never consider the nature of wealth and the fact that savings drives the economy. Only people who save can build wealth there is a difference between real market driven demand from savings that sets prices, and propped up prices that keep people spending from some other propped up source. Those price signals they referred to earlier also get totally skewed and it creates great distortion for investors.<br><br> If you want the free market perspective that contradict some of the mainstream ideas they push in here go study some Austrian economics after you watch these.", "comment_date": "2016-06-25T02:32:54Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Rog\u00e9rio Colantuono", "comment_text": "This series is just AWESOME :)", "comment_date": "2016-06-21T00:15:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0413\u0435\u043e\u0440\u0433\u0438", "comment_text": "Nice belt, guy!", "comment_date": "2016-06-20T14:52:26Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Oscar Kuan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uTB5XorBw&amp;t=5m19s\">5:19</a> someone looks like they have been smokin", "comment_date": "2016-06-14T16:40:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Little Phony", "comment_text": "good video but guy speaks really fast", "comment_date": "2016-06-12T00:22:40Z", "likes_count": 66}, {"comment_by": "abdou-karim Bouya", "comment_text": "macroeconomics exam tomorrow", "comment_date": "2016-06-11T19:18:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Life with Miss Liz", "comment_text": "Seasonal Unemployment wasn&#39;t included.", "comment_date": "2016-06-11T02:54:32Z", "likes_count": 41}, {"comment_by": "Man Utd dna", "comment_text": "What about seasonal unemployment", "comment_date": "2016-06-08T19:17:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Enzo Bavetta", "comment_text": "we are on episode 5 now.

Parallelly capitalists try to decrease the share of added value given to workers as compensation to save for the investments and their profits.

They also want to inflict pressure and workers and reduce the effectiveness of unions. Full unemployment means that workers are in a much better negotiating position.

If a mom decides to stay home with her child instead of working, there&#39;s no increase to GDP.

If one of those kids gets cancer, it&#39;s a huge boost to GDP as the kid has to undergo tons of expensive medical procedures. Of course, the GDP increase is at the expense of a kid with cancer.<br><br>On the flip side, the GDP does NOT measure &quot;externalities.&quot; So if, for example, a factory is able to produce 50% more widgets by dumping toxic chemicals into a pristine lake, the GDP goes up with the increased production. The polluted lake has no downward effect on the GDP. An untouched rainforest produces no GDP except perhaps as a research tool or with tourism. A forest that is clearcut and paved over produces lots of GDP.
