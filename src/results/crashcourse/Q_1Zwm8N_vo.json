It seems to me that this era of institutionalized lynching   seems to be a key period in the development of the structural racism in local U.S. law enforcement and the consequent distrust that black communities in the U.S. have for the police.  The fact that so much of this persists makes things seem so hopeless. That being said, what I&#39;d find interesting, instructive, and and a morale boost if there are examples of communities in this era that were integrated and managed to consciously diffuse or avoid these pogroms (&#39;race riots&#39; to me  implies two equal sides equally to blame)  and worked hard to protect their black citizens under trying circumstances.
