The idea is pretty interesting, a cooler without moving parts, just pass an electric current through and it transfers heat from one face to the other (you can even reverse it by inverting the current). The problem is that you need a material with good electrical conductivity, otherwise it&#39;s going to generate a lot of heat due to the Joule effect. But good electrical conductivity generally implies good heat conductivity, so the material transfers heat back from the hot face to the cold face, like trying to fill a bucket with a sieve. That&#39;s why thermoelectric coolers are much less efficient than compressor-based coolers, although researchers keep finding better materials to improve performance little by little.", "comment_date": "2018-08-23T21:20:34Z", "likes_count": 54}, {"comment_by": "GLaDOS", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK7G6l_K6sA&amp;t=0m50s\">0:50</a> I freaked out because I was watching at night and I thought someone screamed", "comment_date": "2018-08-23T21:16:01Z", "likes_count": 108}, {"comment_by": "Trinity Delafuente", "comment_text": "When one is near a fire.
