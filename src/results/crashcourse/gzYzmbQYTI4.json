If you are determining this based on the history of the group\u2019s existence in the region Maronite Catholics have found refuge in the slopes of Mount Lebanon since 402CE centuries before the Druze arrive around 1000CE . Please correct me if there is another metric being used. Also to say the this is the homeland of the Druze is especially inflammatory given the political situation in the country.

The Oppressor vs Oppressed dialectic cannot explain why some nations that were colonized are rich and others poor, nor how other nations which had no colonies are richer than those that had colonies. Empires don&#39;t make countries rich, they make the imperial elite wealthier at the expense of People, both in the overseas colonies and in the homeland (which itself is just another colonial possession in the eyes of the Elites, as one can see with England within the British Empire, where 1/6 children died before the age of 5 in 1900).<br>In other words, its a simplistic narrative that ought to be challenged, not parroted, and its funny how ancient examples such as Rome and the Ottomans are held as examples of development, but then modern empires are seen as problematic. All empires are bad, and some are much worse than others.<br>In reality, what a people did both before and after colonization (e.g. Sub-Saharan Africa had colonization for an average of just 80 years compared to millennia of history and 60 years of independence) is a greater indicator of how developed their state is economically. And also, what&#39;s with the &quot;developed&quot;, as if to question the term? If a country has industrialized, it is developed. If it still has a majority of its population still living as they did thousands of years ago, they are under-developed.<br>If one actually goes to live in under-developed countries (like myself in Tanzania), trust me, its a bourgeois luxury to sit back from the comfort of one&#39;s developed lifestyle and not have to worry about no running water, no sanitation, no electricity, tropical diseases without the means to treat them (except for with Western medicine from &quot;developed&quot; countries that under-developed countries can&#39;t produce). One can say that such a life is &quot;developed&quot;, but for those who live in such conditions, they are under no such bourgeois illusions.<br><br>But as I say, great video, but talk about both sides of the argument. I&#39;d prefer folks to provide both sides of the debate rather than this false &quot;objectivity&quot; and &quot;impartiality&quot;, which more often than not simply presents Marxist rhetoric as objective, impartial truth, which it most certainly is not.", "comment_date": "2022-01-31T23:50:09Z", "likes_count": 6}}}, {"gzYzmbQYTI4": {"What is a \u201cDeveloped\u201d Country?

Several indexes were and are considered. <br>These will include scientific and education, access to  basic needs such as water, food, roads, etc. Also, the political status of the country, regarding the freedom of the people. And wealth distribution, resulting in indexes such as the gini coefficient. <br>And mind you most of these indexes are related. For example, a country with greater scientific production and education, can make products more efficient and of better quality, thus making more wealth. Which in turn means better wages. Better infrastructure. Better social and political stability, which in turn can affect all of previous factors. <br>Also consider that the prior to the industrial revolution, there was a chemical revolution and an agricultural revolution in Europe. These allowed certain European countries to gain an advantage in scientific knowledge, that provided the basis for industrialization. <br>And then there are the social and political revolutions in Europe that fomented the shift to more democratic states. Such as the French revolution.  The Congress of Vienna. Or the revolutions of 1848. The rise of scientific socialism as a main political ideology. WW1 and several European countries increasing popular suffrage. And the list goes on.", "comment_date": "2022-01-31T20:00:36Z", "likes_count": 111}}}, {"gzYzmbQYTI4": {"What is a \u201cDeveloped\u201d Country?
