Not enough young people know how to use their money correctly (myself included). <br><br>For example, you could cover topics like: <br><br>how to write a check, how to plan and organize a budget, how to invest, how to choose a good bank, how to open a bank account, how to go about purchasing a car or a house, or how to choose a good apartment, how to figure out what kind of salary you would need to maintain your current or preferred lifestyle,  what careers would make you that salary,  what major you need to get that job, how much that major would cost and how many years it would take, how to take out a loan (student or otherwise), how to/ if you should use a credit card,  how to choose a good university, how to ask for a raise, how to prepare for an interview, how to fill out job and college applications, how to choose a good community to settle down in, how to choose an insurance company, how to watch out for scams and cons, how to plan out the next few years of your life, how to save for retirement, how to fill out tax forms, how to find a good attorney, how to conduct yourself in a civil suit, how to market your skills, which skills do employers look for in new hires, how to plan your schedule / calendar, good time management, how to write a letter, etc.<br><br>The list goes on and on.

I think it is because just like in this video, 85-90% of the content is in the form of uncommon words, uncommon interactions, and unusual names that seem important, take time to remember, and even more to even partially comprehend. So I find myself falling behind the video trying to build a building with materials I have never used and don&#39;t really understand that well were they all should fit in the first place. My suggestion for fixing this pacing problem is to have a specialist that has a deep understanding of these things try to teach someone that has no affiliation with the field but is interested and wants, just like us, to understand and see where people stutter in understanding this. I sincerely think there is a fundamental difference between how a professor teaches a class at his courses and how a specialist gives a crash course to one of his friends through simple conversation. I remember a time where these crash course videos were entertaining and teaching at the same time, telling an interesting story I could easily remember and hardly wait to share with my friends and colleagues, but the latest series have been almost no different from the dry and hollow hours in my schools, university, etc. Most might say that it is simply the nature of the subjects, they are inherently boring to teach and learn, but I will refuse to accept that the ideas that describe and help us understand our world are indeed as dull as they are depicted by those who understand them and imagined by the rest of us. I understand that this is, as the name implies, a crash course, were I will be showered with information on a specific subject, but showering us with formulas, definitions, nomenclature and &quot;this is how we physicists do things&quot; rules won&#39;t help the people that haven&#39;t had and will not have anything to do with physics. Even in the comment section, I see people ranging from specialists discussing some of the things that were wrong or were missed in the video to people that are now starting physics courses, so almost everyone here knows or will know all these things regardless of the existence of these videos, then what is the purpose here if not to help the rest(me included) get to know this field at least a little, not as the current/future wife/husband for better, for worse, in sickness and in health, but as an good acquaintance or even a friend one can be proud to say they know of when this person does something amazing(like they always do) and apear on the science news. I really hope that all this drama and analogies I spewed in this one comment will help in the planning of future videos, I also know that I may be really wrong here, but these were my honest thoughts and feedback and I give them because I think your work is great and important enough that it deserves my time in thinking this up and putting it into words.

It moves too quickly and puts too much emphasis on the mathematical equations. There is little to no discussion of WHY those equations work, which is the only actual physics in this lesson. Everything else is just algebra. As Dr. Somara said in the introduction, physics is about understanding how (and why) the universe works the way it does, so it&#39;s distressing to see yet another educational video simply saying &quot;These are the equations you should use&quot; without talking about where they come from or why they work. As another example of this, we are told that time always goes on the x (or independent) axis of the motion graphs, but we&#39;re not told why that is.

I have Bachelor in Physics and teach in a high school so I have a bit of knowledge about what I am about to say. Physics is counter intuitive. Very much so. Classical physics is, Modern physics, even more so. I think me and a few other &quot;sciency&quot; people are just lucky to have grasp the intuition early in our life and it makes understanding physics a much easier thing to do. Unfortunately, for most people, it is not so. To learn physics &#39;typically&#39;, learning one concept and and principle at a time, I think, is not the best way to go.<br><br>Instead, I am suggesting the &quot;historical&quot; route where one should start with learning Aristotelian physics, which is the most intuitive kind of physics. Aristotelian physics works most of the time, but of course we know it is very inaccurate. Then, we use experiments or thought experiments to proof/show/demonstrate how it actually is wrong, then we will progress slowly to classical physics and then modern physics.<br><br>Another rationale for doing this, besides it is easier on the learner&#39;s mind, is to teach a more accurate worldview of physics and science. Physics has never been a bunch of laws and counter intuitive concepts that just work which people somehow just know since time memorial. It is basically a description about universe which grows more and more accurate slowly over millenias. It begins from something as &quot;duh!&quot; as, if you throw things up, it will go down. Developing to Aristotelian mechanic, Classical Mechanic, and quite literally, rocket science. But most importantly, the journey has not stop. We know for sure that our description is not perfect because it doesn&#39;t match the observed data, but it will continually grow to be more so.<br><br>So if it is not too much of a hassle, please put more history, experiments, thought experiments and philosophy.

Math below to support, and a link to further explain (<a href=\"http://physics.info/motion-equations/\">http://physics.info/motion-equations/</a>).<br><br>Let&#39;s say you start at 6m/s (v0), and constantly accelerate at a rate of 1m/s^2 for a time of 4 seconds.  Plug all the numbers in and you get a velocity of 10m/s (because 6+1*4=10m/s).  But 10m/s is your final velocity (aka velocity at time t=4s), not your average velocity.  You started at 6m/s, ended at 10m/s, so your average was 8m/s.  I&#39;m not trying to be picky, but it seems entirely incorrect to say that average velocity is equal to the rest of that equation.<br>For velocity at time t (aka instantaneous or final velocity), we get v=v0+at<br>For average velocity, we get v\u0305=(v1+v2)/2<br><br>Again, I&#39;m hoping I overlooked something and I&#39;ve messed up.  Please correct me if I did.  But if I&#39;m right, then come on CC get your stuff right.  I teach physics and would really, really (pretty please!) like it if you don&#39;t use the wrong words, even if/especially if those words have similar meanings yet definitely not the same meaning.  It&#39;s kind of a big difference.  I&#39;ll happily tell the officer that my average speed was below the speed limit, but the cop only cares about instantaneous speed.", "comment_date": "2016-04-01T06:46:44Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Glial Cell", "comment_text": "YES ITS FINALLY HERE<br><br><br><br>... but why is she trying to string us along with the promise of disputing speeding tickets?", "comment_date": "2016-04-01T06:29:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ender Wiggin", "comment_text": "Thanks for not using miles per hour", "comment_date": "2016-04-01T06:28:22Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Tyrone Slothdrop", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM8ECpBuQYE&amp;t=7m20s\">7:20</a>, the left side of the equation should be &quot;final velocity&quot;, not average.", "comment_date": "2016-04-01T06:24:44Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Stephanie rodriguez", "comment_text": "Please post them all!

It&#39;s embarrassing but I literally didn&#39;t even understand how basic orbiting worked before playing KSP, I guess I just thought stuff just kind of floated up there, and didn&#39;t realize that orbiting objects were more or less just falling to the side. for real, getting a kid hooked on KSP will help them learn more about all that stuff than years of basic schooling could ever do, ( cough cough,  hint hint to any physics teacher showing this video to their class)", "comment_date": "2016-04-01T03:51:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wolflink9000", "comment_text": "You are incredibly sexy....that accent.", "comment_date": "2016-04-01T03:49:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Power Max", "comment_text": "Umm, so many kinistetic equations.

So my father who is a gradutae physicist took out his calculator and calculated that according to the evidence pictures and the distance traveled between the pictures (wich can be measured if you know that a german highway-marking is always 25m long)  he was going veeeery slow. (Something around 1m/second or 2mph in imperial) He was lucky though, cause if the cameras would have been placed the other way around he would have come up with a result that would have indicated that he was going faster than the speed of light.
