These testimonies are incredible and terrifying. The things and ways people remembered the worst things imaginable is fascinating. For example one man could recall hour by hour the day his town was occupied by the Nazis, and continued to remember the days of the week throughout his time surviving in hiding. When I cross referenced his memories with German war plans, I was able to determine that he remembered the battle accurately down to the time of day. Another man remembered very precisely the order in which things happened, and could remember how long he was kept in certain camps, but was unable to recall in which year something happened. These were not old men, they were in their 50s at the time of recording, but they remembered their Holocaust experiences very differently, likely due to trauma. The man who remembered time very well survived in hiding, while the man who remembered time in a much more disjointed way survived two death camps and several concentration camps. The history of the Holocaust is vast, and survivor testimonies show just how vast and diverse the history is.", "comment_date": "2020-08-28T20:20:10Z", "likes_count": 5}}}, {"1hAraGgEiAo": {"What
