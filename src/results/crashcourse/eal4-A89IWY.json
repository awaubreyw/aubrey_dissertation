D. Dailey", "comment_text": "I like Crash Course Psychology. I watched the whole series. I have not been in any psychology class in years. I just think the topic is interesting. This series is great in being both informative and fun. I didn&#39;t know that Freud was addicted to cocaine. Wow. Now with psychology, I wonder why. What makes a person behave in a way to consume cocaine repeatedly. That is an interesting question to explore. I could handle it the way Freud would. It would get to deep and raunchy places. Cigars are long and skinny. This is a very symbolic shape. Cocaine tends to be a white powder. It depends on the form though. Perhaps cocaine is symbolic too. Perhaps the fixation on cigars leads to the fixation of cocaine in a symbolic way. Both can be smoked through mouth so maybe there is a fixation on the mouth. Maybe the white powder of cocaine can come out of the cigar during excitement. Maybe it is symbolic of a specific kind of body fluid produced only by men and teenage boys but not other humans. I will spare the gory details, but I am hinting at something here. However I am probably overthinking it. Sometimes my boy cocaine is just cocaine. Advanced neuroscience was given as a contrast to Freud. That way of psychology would produce the explanation that makes the most sense. I think it is just that cocaine messes up the brain juices causing a physical dependence and addiction. I better look up cocaine on Wikipedia. The explanation is a bit over my head. What I can gather is that cocaine somehow hijacks the reward system in the brain that leads to an excess of dopamine. That makes sense. Too much dopamine is going to make someone really happy and really addicted. Interestingly sugar and video games can also hijack the system and raise dopamine. So they can be addictive too. I wonder if kids in the future can use this to explain reckless hedonistic behavior. They would say &quot;the dopamine made me do it&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-01-30T10:00:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laykan Thee Alien", "comment_text": "<b>I&#39;m so excited I found this omg</b> \ud83d\ude03", "comment_date": "2019-12-03T01:12:56Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tom Patterson", "comment_text": "physics could use some softening.
