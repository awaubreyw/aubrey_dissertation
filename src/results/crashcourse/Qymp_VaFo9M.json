I agree with that, naturally, it isn&#39;t chosen or changed. It just happens naturally. But, there are some questioms left unanswered. For one, could sexuality be related in significant degree to gender identity. Of course, it obviously couldn&#39;t be dictative of it, but does that have a role to play, or even vice versa? Kinda like a game of &quot;what came first?&quot; Chicken or the Egg? Another good question would be a situation where a person is intimate enough with their own  emotions to consciously gauge their sexuality and choose to try something new, like a heterosexual being bi-sexual or homosexual becoming bi-sexual. Considering that many people with these sexualities share some psychological traits, how would these traits change? Would they be altered or just added upon? Would the person making a conscious and enlightened decision to spread out their sexuality be changing, or would they just find what they always preferred but didn&#39;t realize making them already the sexuality they were going to choose? But what if they revert back in another conscious decision? Would that mean the years they spent as gay after going straight actually have had that persom be straight despite their sexual encounters during all these years? Are people really born gay or straight when we all start in a womb with the same body parts and tools omitting special cases and the obvious? Where does philosophy stop and science start here? Vice versa? Are you seeing why it isn&#39;t appropriate to make claims that we don&#39;t have definitive proof for yet? Nobody has even asked these questions in the appropriate settings, but that doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t necessary to finding answers and actually understanding what sexuality is and what purpose it serves. It&#39;s easy to put something together, but in science specifically, one flaw and it all falls apart. Don&#39;t get me started on polygamy, which we  vilify primarily to ancient and ancient religious beliefs when there is nothong saying that a state of love can&#39;t exist between three or four people, ir asexuality which is by far ome of the most inspiring sexualities I have seen, considering they are fewer in comparison.

In a way I was obsessed with male homosexuality, but unable to reconcile that with my own female existence. Maybe that also had something to do with me being a virgin at the time, I wasn&#39;t too sure of my own sexuality. Long story short, that was a phase. I don&#39;t read fan fictions any more, not that I don&#39;t think they&#39;re good, the habit just passed me. And I have a boyfriend now and I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;m straight. The point is, and this may be controversial, but I think stuff we see can influence our mentality about sex and sexuality quite a lot.

Here&#39;s the problem I have. Let&#39;s say you are a completely homosexual human being. That means you don&#39;t have or want to have sex with anyone on the other side. If that is a genetic trait, why would that genetic trait, that cannot be passed on, survive? It&#39;s not possible according to basic evolution. To me, this means, there has to be some sort of a scale, where you&#39;re on one side only so far, in terms of gender, but you do have to choose a side. So if it&#39;s not genetic, and I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s possible based on what I&#39;ve just explained, then it must be something else. You can say it&#39;s environmental, but that wouldn&#39;t explain case studies where one twin is hetero and another, with the exact same DNA, and upbringing, would be gay.

It acknowledges cultural influences on sexual activity while denying a place for culture and life experiences in shaping our basic orientation. <br><br>A quick thought experiment should show why &quot;born this way&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense, even before doing any scientific research: humans are a social species that lives in cultures that vary massively in the role and expression of sexuality sanctioned by culture (think ancient Greece vs. Saudi Arabia, or the Chinese Mouso vs. Victorian England). Having a sexual orientation that was biologically fixed at/before birth and being unable to respond to the culture that person would need to survive in would be a massive (evolutionary and personal) disadvantage. From an evolutionary point of view, we have to have (some) flexibility to adapt to culturally sanctioned sex, because our survival and reproduction could depend on it. <br><br>&quot;Evolution&#39;s Rainbow&quot;, authored by a top Transgender biologist, gives an overview of the nature/nurture science (spoiler - biological differences between people who are a kinsey 0 or 6 can be found, but, they are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain the differences - environment is the explanation). For example, in ancient Greece and Rome, most men had same-sex sexual contact and love between men was considered &quot;better&quot; than that between man and women. Were these men biologically different to modern western men where 90-95% declare they are &quot;straight&quot; (or mostly straight)? No. So, men aren&#39;t born with sexuality directed that strongly towards either men or women, both, towards specific activities, fetishes, etc: humans are massively adaptable and malleable at birth.<br><br>More detailed research on environmental impacts on sexuality include:<br>&gt; Gordon and Silva published a 2014 paper about how psychological mechanisms that may explain why people inhabit different positions on the sexual orientation landscape.  <br>&gt; Recent research by Roberts, Glymour and Koenen (2014) recently published research on the long-known correlation between childhood sexual abuse and adult homosexuality: their study found that the abuse affected sexual orientation, rather than orientation (or some other common factor) triggering the abuse. <br><br>Note: pointing out the above is not to pathologise same-sex sexuality - the fact that 90+% of people in western society say they are straight is no less a subjective, cultural phenomenon or anymore &quot;valid&quot; a sexuality. But the science shows childhood environment does shape adult sexual attraction.

If it was, the gay population in the West wouldn&#39;t be seeing the dramatic rise that it does today. Skeptics claim these people were all in the closet in the past, but that doesn&#39;t account for how rapid the rise has been. Nor does a purely biological model account for the tendency of men to be either gay or straight, while women are much more likely than men to be bisexual. As we know, the primary differences between men and women are hormonal, not genetic. Nor does a purely biological model account for the fact that one finds proportionally more homosexuality in large populations than in small ones. Most importantly, a biological model doesn&#39;t account for our inability to identify a &quot;gay&quot; gene. Even though people with gay siblings are more likely to be gay themselves, there so far has been no genetic difference identified between people of different sexualities. <br><br>All of the evidence we have at the present points clearly in one direction: homosexuality is a combination of nature and nurture.

I ASK (You, Me, Anyone Else...from I, Albert Stephen Kundrat, I, A.S.K.!) &quot;This IS my PROBLEM: &quot;A.M.F.: Albert Michael Fortunato&quot;: Will HE be REAL, remain Unreal, be Mine, or Somebody Else&#39;s?\u00a0 Be both Mine AND SomeBody Else&#39;s? Be NEITHER? Be BOTH and NEITHER? Be Neither Both nor Neither? How did I come to this? It&#39;s a very long and complicated STORY!<br>In1978, at the university of Cincinnati I was taking\u00a0this Course at the D.A.A.: The Theory of Environmental Design. In this class I did a Project (the entire Class had\u00a0the same Project!): I designed my own POSTER showing both a Natural AND Man-Made SYSTEM. Thus every Student chose His or Her own particular System to be illustrated on His or Her own Poster-Board both Naturally and Man-Made(Woman-Made?).<br>After much difficulty I\u00a0chose NUCLEAR FUSION as my Poster-Topic!<br>\u00a0I finished my Project using only black ink: on the\u00a0 board&#39;s top: NUCLEAR FUSION IN A NATURAL AND MAN-MADE SYSTEM.\u00a0 Below those thick block letters I divided the rest of the Poster under two sub-titles: STELLAR EVOLUTION, on the left side, and THE H BOMB, on the right side!\u00a0 Under Stellar Evolution: I showed the life, birth, and death of Stars in general, only ending in 3 ways, depending on Its MASS: as White Dwarf, as Neutron Pulsar, and as SuperNova. Again, all was generalized: no particular stellar constellation was depicted on my Poster. Under The H Bomb, I simply reproduced an illustration of the Bomb from an Encyclopedia.\u00a0 Again, no particular Bomb was mentioned, only the general idea.\u00a0 I finished my Project and got a B+! I took the Poster and stored it away for several years. That was that!<br>Then in 1984 a Bad Thing happened, a sort of tragedy: many personal possessions of mine were lost because of that!\u00a0 Only the strong memory of my P.P., my\u00a0Poster Project!<br>Then in 1987 the first turning point:<br>In southern Chile, IAN SHELDON, a Canadian-Astronomer in the astronomical laboratory in Chile, by accident? serendipity? destine-Fate came upon SANDULEAK as Super1987A, precisely on February 23, 1987!\u00a0 Thus a particular Constellation of Stars: The TARANTULA NEBULA had a particular Supernova as well as right next to an actual stellar-Nursary right next to it!<br>Then I990: a strange conception entered my creative mind: ALBERT MICHAEL FORTUNATO: exactly 22 letters!\u00a0 The full name A.M.F. ANAGRAMS into [The TARANTULA Role of ICBM], or, [ICBM: The Role of TARANTULA]: this was the second particularity to the right side of the Poster!\u00a0 And by then I had accidently read into ED TELLER as The Father of The H Bomb!\u00a0 But, WHO, was/is/shall be The Father of A.M.F.? Sinse then, it now being 2015, at least from my limited standpoint NOTHING HAS HAPPENED, unless some Couple, unknown to me, have already conceived a child named A.M.F., and that BY CO-INCIDENCE, unless under the Law of Synchronicity of Karl Jung!\u00a0 And\u00a0,again, perhaps no child of that name has been born yet or never will be born? I myself have never married or had children or a child of my own, but if I do, He will have to be born a Fortunato, and not a K....! Again, perhaps A.M.F. must and will remain Fictitious!<br>I have found out from Facebook and google that there are several Individuals that go by the name of ALBERT KUNDRAT: but, all have completely different middle names!\u00a0 Then again I&#39;ve known of TWO D.A.W.&#39;s : 2 &quot;Davis Alexander Weiss&quot;es!

If you think he glossed over something, it was probably touched on in previous episodes as well. Second, this is <i>Psychology</i>. It is a soft science, and while psychologists speak as if they have the answer, and the answers they give are usually generally accepted by the psychological community, the human condition is constantly changing. Psychology openly admits that it does not have all the answers, and that the answers it has aren&#39;t 100% fact (hence, a &quot;soft&quot; science. A &quot;hard&quot; science would be something like math, which has constants). Knowing this, psychology still has to be taught somehow, which is why it has these generally accepted &quot;truths.&quot; If you <b>actually listen</b> to the video, he says that a lot still remains to be understood, and uses phrases such as &quot;generally accepted.&quot; Lastly, this is &quot;Crash Course.&quot; It&#39;s meant to be a quick reference guide, or a tool to be used in <i>addition</i> to traditional teaching methods. For those saying he&#39;s &quot;conveniently leaving out facts,&quot; please keep this in mind.

Sexual and romantic attraction are two separate things and I think that was conflated here. I&#39;m asexual, but I am not aromantic. Aromantic people are not always asexual either. A sexual orientation is what gender you are SEXUALLY attracted to. Not &quot;physically&quot;. That is far too broad of a term.

Most of the influences are social, for example: somebody identifies as heterosexual and behaves accordingly in their teens and early adulthood. They then &quot;discover&quot; as they grow older that they are actually attracted to those of the same sex and from then on identify as homosexual. Causes of the initial &quot;confusion&quot; tend to center around social attitudes concerning homosexuality. When a person grows up in a culture that only acknowledges heterosexual desire, people may assume that they, themselves are heterosexual even though this is not the case.

Growing up in a culture like that will encourage men to engage in sex with donkeys, and those who don&#39;t have sex may be ridiculed for not participating.<br><br>In Japan, it&#39;s a society that&#39;s pro-sex.

Bisexuality, is a little more complicated (although homosexuality and heterosexuality can follow this form as well. Think of each human having different scales: Attraction to femininity and masculinity, attraction of genitalia, our sexual habits, our social groups, our society, what imprinting was made on us, our consumption of foods with levels or estrogen verses those with testosterone, our interests, our spiritual beliefs...a small idea. Now, each of those scales--along with others--will have to be at a certain individual measurement which varies from person-to-person. This will be your level of heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality.<br><br>For now, all we can do is theorize.

Why? Because it doesn&#39;t fit in either of the 2 basic schools of scientific thought that I know about (Christian Science IG: Creationism and Athiestic Science IG: Evolution). Christian Science, being rooted in the bible, GENERALLY condemns Homosexuality, so that should already be thrown out. Looking at the other side, a gene that determines sexual preference cannot fit. Why? Because then, obviously, Homosexual people would not exist today because they all died out due to not being able to have offspring and pass their genetics down (the exception being a mutation. But why the hell would you want to tell someone they&#39;re a mutant? Unless you have Wolverine Claws. That&#39;d be pretty cool).<br><br>Next, there is the idea of how people are nurtured. Let me give you a different idea of something that is nurtured: MUSIC. Some people listen to Music all of their Early Childhood and practice a basic Instrument such as an instrument from the Violin Family, Piano, or the Guitar. Later in life they have a choice to become a Musician. As a Musician I can name SEVERAL people who were raised listening to Music, but will never pursue a serious dedication to music in life.<br>On the flipside, there are also people who will become brilliant musicians while never having touched Music at all in their early or middle stages in life. This is because they chose to do music.<br><br>So, pulling from this analogy, I do not believe people can just &quot;not have a choice&quot; for Sexual Preference. This is because there are some people who are raised in &quot;X Lifestyle&quot; and then either A.) Followed that Lifestyle or B.)Turned around.<br>On this same strain of thought, some people will be a heterosexual for much of their life and then suddenly turn to a different sexual preference.

If you are just looking at sexual actions or potential sexual actions (who has sex with whom), then everyone is pansexual in the broadest sense because everyone could choose to or be forced to have sex with anyone, regardless of sexual attraction. But this is a very unuseful definition. If it is defined as being able to be sexually aroused by someone of a given sex or gender, then most people, especially bio-males, would be pansexual\u2014for even if the bio-male is unattracted to whomever is stimulating their genitals and they are not consenting to the sexual act, they still have a high chance of having blood engorge their genitals because of an unconscious reaction to the stimuli. If, however, you include a more psycho-social outlook on sexual orientation, then you can look at one&#39;s sexual impulsives and wants, one&#39;s sexual actions and history, one&#39;s romatic desires and aspirations, and one&#39;s culture&#39;s views on sexuality and how that has influenced their self-identification. If you use this last definition or tool, then it is more pragmatic and is much closer to what most people instinctually think about sexual orientation\u2014for we are surely not all pansexual.\u00a0<br><br>Furthermore, if we are going by this definition, then the question cannot be just focused on people who self-identify as homosexual; it would have to be applied to heterosexuals, bisexuals, pansexuals, asexuals, and zoosexuals, too. The question then becomes: Why are we sexually attracted to some people and somethings but not to others? Why aren&#39;t we all attracted to everyone of every sex and gender and every species of animal? This question has the tempting answer of &quot;Because that&#39;s how we evolved!&quot; but this non-answer answer doesn&#39;t give us anything new. In itself, it doesn&#39;t have a predictive quality to it. It doesn&#39;t explain the biological reasons, if any, for the differences in sexuality\u2014for example, what is the difference, if any, in the brains between people who are heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual, etc.?\u00a0<br><br>Lastly, just asserting that being gay is a choice is a very narrow and non-pragmatic view. Your own sexuality is equally subject to the criticism that it is just a choice if you go by this view. If sexuality is not at least somewhat open-ended, then most, if not all, people are pansexual. So are you finally going to come out of the closet and embrace your inner queerness and come to Gay Pride, or are you going to admit that sexuality isn&#39;t so two dimensional? (You are still welcome to come to Pride, though.)", "comment_date": "2014-08-26T01:47:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "T. L.

My argument: We are just sexual creatures (generally). It is in our nature. We have an instinct to feel sexual pleasure (be it with a sock or a tree or a cucumber). Now how that sexual pleasure is disseminated (pun?) is subjective and not always, but ideally, connected to the people we love and spend our lives with. How we &quot;get off&quot; I would argue - at least from a male perspective - is tied into some form of conditioning. Because if sexuality (and therefore sexual orientation) came naturally to us, then we wouldn&#39;t have to learn how to get ourselves and each other off (meaning, we&#39;d all be don juans from birth and there would be no confusion, when you&#39;re 13-years-old, about why, when you peed your bed, it came out semi-gelatinous). Or, to put it another way, my friend believed poking his belly button was masturbating and he did this well into his teen years.<br><br>I would also say that we are loving creatures and that our sexual desires influence how we define love. But to argue that sexual orientation (the narrow categories that we keep creating) is innate, that we are born with it, doesn&#39;t make a lot of evolutionary sense. Evolution does not reward specialists. What makes evolutionary sense is that we are conditioned to find comfort with certain other individuals or groups (that becomes more and more specific through exposure, as we get older), we see this as love, and we apply and inject sex into this feeling therefore fulfilling our very general purpose (to get off - not to procreate...).", "comment_date": "2014-08-19T22:49:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Musical Imposition", "comment_text": "This video was pretty cool but one main thing I got from this video(and various other sources) is females(most) want a &quot;bad boy&quot; that&#39;s packing during ovulation for a &quot;one night stand&quot;.

Some researchers think this may indicate that childhood family experiences are important determinants to homosexuality,[10] or that parents behave this way in response to gender-variant traits in a child.[11][12] Michael Ruse suggests that both possibilities might be true in different cases.[13]<br>From their research on 275 men in the Taiwanese military, Shu and Lung concluded that &quot;paternal protection and maternal care were determined to be the main vulnerability factors in the development of homosexual males.&quot; Key factors in the development of homosexuals were &quot;paternal attachment, introversion, and neurotic characteristics.&quot;[14] One study reported that homosexual males reported more positive early relationships with mothers than did homosexual females.[15] A 2000 American twin study showed that familial factors, which may be at least partly genetic, influence (but do not determinate) sexual orientation.[16]<br>Research also indicates that homosexual men have significantly more siblings than the homosexual women, who, in turn, have significantly more siblings than heterosexual men.[17] A 2006 Danish study compared people who had a heterosexual marriage versus people who had a same-sex marriage. Heterosexual marriage was significantly linked to having young parents, small age differences between parents, stable parental relationships, large numbers of siblings, and late birth order. Children who experience parental divorce are less likely to marry heterosexually than those growing up in intact families. For men, same-sex marriage was associated with having older mothers, divorced parents, absent fathers, and being the youngest child. For women, maternal death during adolescence and being the only or youngest child or the only girl in the family increased the likelihood of same-sex marriage.[10]", "comment_date": "2014-08-19T06:50:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ceegers", "comment_text": "hehe @ weird al being the celebrity crush", "comment_date": "2014-08-19T06:50:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "pink cloud", "comment_text": "Everywhere I go dickbutt haunts me.
