There are also several claims in this video that are certainly true for the 14th and 15th centuries, but provably false for earlier centuries in the Medieval period-- namely the emphasis on the prevalence of death by warfare and starvation.

Misses the Investiture Controversy of 1075, itself arguably tracing its origins to the Pope&#39;s crowning of Charlemagne in 800, a single act which gave the Bishop of Rome precedents over secular leadership, fast forwarding to 1303, kidnapping of Pope Bonaface VIII was a reaction to his excommunication of all of France as well as King Philip IV, the kidnapping is believed to have been a Thomas Beckett moment, whereby supporters of the French King burst into the Papal Palace and attempted to drag the Pope Bonaface to Philip&#39;s territory, so he might be subject to the French Crown, by so doing forcing him to absolve the Excommunication. He was very old and died more of shock shortly after. There is little evidence that Philip IV had anything to do with it, but he went with it upon learning about it; 4 this video is too Anglocentric, the greatest peasant revolt accord in Germany in the 1460s; 5 the rise of the Hanseatic League of Northern Europe and the typically neglected and shamefully overlooked Kingdom of Poland.<br><br>The Middle Ages never existed, it is an invented concept which dating from the early renaissance humanist Leonardo Bruni 1370-1444, who in his famed &quot;Historiarum Florentini&quot;, a collection of historiography, categorised civilisation into 3 Ages.

There is a tendency towards focusing on the worst episodes of the period, which admittedly there are a lot of. However, there is a lot that is lost when looking at these episodes. The medieval world was exceptionally complicated and was filled with highs and lows for people of all classes. Sure there was strife and corruption in the church but they also supported the works of scholars like Roger Bacon and Thomas Aquinas. Engineers were tasked with creating weapons of war but they also created great cathedrals that, from an architectural standpoint, rival that of the greeks and romans. Plague devastated the population of Europe but the people that survived kept going and did let this disaster break them. People underestimate the complexity of the medieval world and are willing to use Monty Python as there source for imagining the period. But this misses out on an era that reminds me that no matter how horrible things are, people survive, thrive and make incredible things.

Also will the Hussite Wars of the early 1400&#39;s might just have been Medieval Europe&#39;s only successful mass peasant revolt (&amp; proto-Reformation War, since the Waldensians, Lollards, Cathars, etc all either failed or only barely managed to survive long enough in the shadows to get assimilated into the Protestant sects that would appear in the mid 1500&#39;s). Also, Constantine XI didn&#39;t just think that Orban&#39;s price to build his cannon was too expensive, the Byzantines could literally no longer afford to pay for it.

All this was fine. I have issues with how John Green spoke about disease in Medieval times, and then used the Black Death as the only example. The Black Death was terrible and it completely destroyed guild institutions and medication orders. But this should be taken in the context of how life was like before this. In other words, this video mainly focuses on the Late Middle Ages without giving it the framing of the Early and High Middle Ages. This video should have been labeled &quot;Medieval Europe in the Late Middle Ages.&quot; I&#39;m hoping that there will be other videos that go more in-depth about the Middle Ages, but this video seems to be setting up either a video about the Renaissance or 14th century humanism with Petrarch. Again, the content is nuanced and fine, but the framing could come across as problematic  to medievalist historians. Admittedly, I am just an undergraduate history major, but I have studied High Middle Age Medieval Europe quite extensively (for an undergrad, that is).

(c.a. 900)<br>- who those heretics and hedons where and what happened to them (and mentioning how many of those &#39;hedons&#39; where believers and followers of that exact same Jesus, could help a lot in avoiding, stepping on someones feelings there).<br>- what feudalism looked like before they managed that<br>- what &#39;common goods&#39; where and how that could have been of importance<br>- and ___THOMAS D&#39; AQUIN___??? (c.a. 1220)<br><br>it would also help to mention, that the byzantine empire and most likely everyone else, as long as they could, where perfectly capable to keep there history straight and not only maintain their civilization, but actually improve up on it by roughly the amount one would expect in a Millenia. How at the same time &#39;the medieval people&#39; lost the ability to make cement &amp; mortar and had to stack reused bricks on top of each other, held together by dung (cow s--t) and how little that had to do with availability of ancient volcanic ash. How everyone was supposed to stay home at all times unless explicitly ordered to die in some stupid war about which highly degenerated descendant of whom, shook whichever roman emperors, hand at some point in time, or didn&#39;t (or what we refer to as &#39;history&#39; ever since then). That every Crafts Master and Journeyman, as well as every merchant HAD to be able to travel, read, write and do math, or even worse, geometry. and what &#39;tommy the dummy&#39; thought about all of that and about all the other things, that nutjob of a &#39;greatest and most important &#39;philo(no...can&#39;t type that)&#39; considered harmful. How such ideas as &#39;water makes sinful thoughts&#39; might have effect seven pest epidemics in a row and what general effecte that type of thinking could have in such a desperate situation, especially if brutally enforced by the freshly made up &#39;inquisition&#39;. Why everyone (unfortunately including you), keeps insisting on choosing an arbitrary point right around that time where that variant of the medieval story &#39;starts&#39; and why that&#39;s considered normal by definition.<br><br>sorry having let this one out on you guys, since you did such great work before. But that also kind of raised my expectations. I do actually understand, why technically speaking, those &#39;details&#39; I deem so important are not considered &#39;history&#39; by definition. But it took me over thirty years to understand that. I tried to wrap my head around the middle ages, a couple of times and usually just gave up, because nothing makes any sense at all! It took hundreds of hours of reading up things on Wikipedia, years of prior interest in Sociology, Antropology, Archaeology and so much more. YouTube channels and playlists turned out to be enormously helpful. Many of those where produced by you guys! So who if not you, could at least mention why history just stopped making sense and stayed complicated, weird and broken, from around those &#39;dark ages&#39; on and hasn&#39;t made sense ever since?

Not even one mention about the slavs, romanians, scandinavian or iberian people. This video is titled Medieval European History but it talks about France, England and Italy. Another bad thing is calling that schism &quot;The great schism&quot; which is false the great schism occured in 1054 with the split between the orthodox and the catholics. Not one mention of Byzantine Empire, nothing. This video was clearly written by an american and certainly if intended to be seen and taken seriously by americans only.
