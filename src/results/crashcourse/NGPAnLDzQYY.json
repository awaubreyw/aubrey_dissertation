There was (predictably) a lot of resistance by white Southerners while white Northerners were too indifferent (being largely anti-slavery but not pro-black). There wasn&#39;t the willpower or patience to have an extended period of occupation, rebuilding, and reform which probably would have needed to last 20-30 years. Especially since it was by no means the only political issue of the day, and in any case too easy to dismiss as a regional issue.<br><br>Some kind of &quot;Deconfederatification&quot; or even a truth and reconciliation commission were ideas too far into the future.
