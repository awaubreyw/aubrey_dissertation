Here is a list of some food items to consider, and their categorization, based on this definition:\r<br>\r<br>Ice cream sandwich: Sandwich\r<br>Ravioli: Not a sandwich (Enclosed, and not eaten with the hands)\r<br>Hamburger: Sandwich\r<br>Poptart: Not a sandwich (Enclosed)\r<br>KFC Double Down: Sandwich\r<br>Burrito: Not a sandwich (Enclosed, i.e. wrapped - not sandwiched - and not defined by horizontal layers)\r<br>Sub: Sandwich (Despite the top and bottom halves of the bread remaining connected, it is not fully wrapped (i.e. stuffed), and satisfies all criteria, as the layers are still horizontal)\r<br>Meatball sub: Not a sandwich (not held or eaten horizontally, typically; the filling is cradled; not sandwiched)\r<br>Corndog: Not a sandwich (obviously fails a number of criteria)\r<br>Lettuce wrap: Not a sandwich (wrapped; not sandwiched; and not defined by horizontal layering)\r<br>Crepes: Depending on the serving method, it <i>can</i> be a type of sandwich\r (they form a Venn diagram with sandwiches)<br>Pizza: Not a sandwich (top and bottom are not the same; satisfies all other criteria, but remains not a sandwich)\r<br>Calzone: Not a sandwich (enclosed)\r<br>Gyro: Not a sandwich (surrounding bread is wrapped/cradling the filling, and this not horizontally layered)\r<br>Pancake stack: Not a sandwich (Not handheld, i.e. eaten with fork and knife, and not defaultedly eaten simultaneously)\r<br>Pie: Not a sandwich (Not handheld... typically)\r<br>Hostess Fruit Pies: Not a sandwich (enclosed)\r<br>Oreos: Technically a type of very small, bite-sized, confectionery sandwich. A very atypical sandwich, but an Oreo is a sandwich. A very small, sweet one.\r<br>Cake: Not a sandwich (Decidedly not a handheld food, as well as all layers not defaultedly consumed simultaneously)\r<br>Lasagna: Although layered, not only are the top and bottom layers not necessarily the same, it is not handheld.\r<br>Tiramisu: See lasagna\r<br>A quesadilla: A sandwich, and a surprising example of one. But it acts like an incredibly thin sandwich in all ways.\r<br>Chicken and waffles: A sandwich, if you put the chicken (ideally without bones) between two waffle quarters, pick it up, and eat it like that; in that situation, you made a sandwich.\r<br>A S&#39;more: A sandwich\r<br>A taco: Not a sandwich (the interior layers may be horizontal, but the outer layers - the shell - are vertical, and not aligned the same as the interior layers; also see Meatball sub)<br>Whipped cream between two apple slices: An unusual sandwich, but it is a sandwich.\r<br>A fish between two blocks of cheese: A really weird sandwich, but it would be a sandwich, if you ate it like that.\r<br>\r<br>Of additional note is that sandwiches may be very big, but can be cut into smaller sections, even to make individual bite-sized, smaller sandwiches, such as might be found on a platter, at a party. One might expect items such as pie, lasagna, cake, and tiramisu to be excluded for the sectioning of how they are served. This is not so. Many sandwiches get cut, for example, diagonally, into smaller parts of a sandwich, which may be considered their own sandwiches.\r Additionally, it may be a potential criterion that the exterior layers be rigid enough to hold their structure when held in the hands (gravy between two layers of mashed potatoes might not count as a sandwich).", "comment_date": "2020-10-09T18:36:48Z", "likes_count": 47}}}, {"6geQjY8b7sA": {"Semantics: Crash Course Linguistics #5": {"channel_id": "UgyBJlY9n_xBwTfZFZZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Arte \u1710\u1712\u1708\u1712\u1705\u1714 Sining Art", "comment_text": "In Philippine English or the English dialect used in the Philippines by Filipinos, a toilet, toilet room, bathroom, or a wash room, is called a &quot;comfort room&quot; or abbreviated as a &quot;C.R.&quot; or &quot;CR&quot;.
