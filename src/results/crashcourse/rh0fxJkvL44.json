Wise folks value our states-of-mind (ex: desires, dreads, bliss, agony, etc) much more than any hard-science.

However, if one considers Platonic idealism in the context of the Pareminedian and Pythagorean trends in Greek philosophy, particularly with regard to mathematics and the concept of &quot;the one,&quot; then one can easily argue that while Aristotle&#39;s empirical observations on natural philosophy are now out of touch with reality, Plato&#39;s theories are much more relevant to, let&#39;s say, binary systems by which computer programs classify and distinguish things by a series of zeros and ones that express something within the context of a programming language. If we agree with Plato and Parmenides that reality is essentially an expression of being that is one, and can be expressed as one, whereas some form of non-reality or absence is something that is-not, and therefore can be represented with a zero, even though zero simply signifies the concept of nothingness or privation, then when we think about binary systems that attempt to represents real things through a code of zeros and ones in a particular order that has meaning, we will realize that anything could theoretically be represented in binary code depending on how its zeros and ones are arranged in a code that expresses the being of that thing accurately. <br><br>People try to dismiss Plato&#39;s idealism, often because they have not comprehensively read Plato&#39;s works, and thus have not had the opportunity to experience how Plato&#39;s work was not merely idealistic in the sense of anti-pragmatism, but often expressed a desire for systematic knowledge of things so that people can have more knowledge about good and bad and be able to justify themselves to others. When one reads Plato&#39;s work and appreciates it, one sees how comprehensive his work actually was, and can get beyond the charge of idealism that is used by materialists to ad-hominem attack opponents who don&#39;t accept their harsh reduction of reality to physical matter. If we overcome this conceited materialism, we will be better able to do what was at the heart of Socratic and Platonic philosophy; inquiry into one&#39;s self, one&#39;s being, and concious examination of one&#39;s life.", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T06:18:15Z", "likes_count": 78}, {"comment_by": "culwin", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not a platist, I use bowls", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T05:49:57Z", "likes_count": 706}, {"comment_by": "Limitless Curiosity", "comment_text": "Have been way out of the loop with Crash Course for a while and just stumbled onto this little gem of a video.

(The Mongol Answer XP)<br>As a consciousness we can only perceive (senses/Aristotle) and rationalize (mathematics/Plato) but we know that both are fallible and &quot;inperceivable&quot;.<br>Our senses can hallucinate, be deceived, and sometimes we just can&#39;t comprehend what it is we are seeing (or mis-comprehend).<br>As for mathematics, while it is purely logical, it is also a human construct, there is no actual object that is one since all objects are atoms bouncing off each other, and it is just the coincidence that it takes a long time for atoms of similar densities to separate that causes the illusion of &quot;oneness&quot;, on top of which all humans flaws are baked into our comprehension of mathematics, for example we &quot;know&quot; that there is at least another dimension of mathematics that we are currently only see the ripples of (hence we have &quot;imaginary&quot; number units (i))<br>So rather than going with either having our mathematics reflect our senses, or our senses reflect our mathematics, or even worse do what Socrates was quasi suggesting and debate about a perfect universe not perceivable and inconceivable, but rather recognize the symbiotic reality of our senses and rationality that both are influenced and influence the other and construct an evolving resource of experiments and conjecture to try and correlate our entire senses and rationalizations.", "comment_date": "2018-04-16T23:41:38Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "L3xX 1", "comment_text": "Why don,t they do math?", "comment_date": "2018-04-16T23:40:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PPA 1", "comment_text": "Love this :) I\u2019d love crash course art history too", "comment_date": "2018-04-16T23:35:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Stephanie Cuellar", "comment_text": "I am Aristolian that it was his N.
