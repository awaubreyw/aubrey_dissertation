Current hard-science describes our reality via our modern measurement instruments.  Thus our reality is highly dependent on what/how we measure it with (ex: einstein&#39;s relativity &amp; quantum mechanics).\r<br>\r<br>*Note hard-science works most independent of our state-of-mind (ex: most independent of our beliefs-of, disbeliefs-of, indifference-to, &amp; ignorance-of our state-of-mind ; aka empiric).  Wise folks value our states-of-mind (ex: desires, dreads, bliss, agony, etc) much more than any hard-science.

Moore, modern idealism has one single argument that is necessary to be defended and properly called idealism. That is &#39;&#39;esse is percipi&#39;&#39;. In English, it could be translated to something like &#39;&#39;What exists is perceived&#39;&#39;. Plato certainly does not argue that &#39;&#39;esse is percipi&#39;&#39;. So what do you think? Is it because Plato&#39;s idealism is different then the one described by Moore or is it a mistake to call Plato an idealist?", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T17:48:35Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"rh0fxJkvL44": {"Plato and Aristotle: Crash Course History of Science #3": {"channel_id": "UgwGC-2Ucmb6MjiUDLp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Hezekiah Ibin", "comment_text": "Eurocentrism", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T17:15:11Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"rh0fxJkvL44": {"Plato and Aristotle: Crash Course History of Science #3": {"channel_id": "UgxFZsAAl15qJC4NpYN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "ybiza pakemonow", "comment_text": "Thanks", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T11:51:11Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"rh0fxJkvL44": {"Plato and Aristotle: Crash Course History of Science #3": {"channel_id": "UgzpyGyR4S4y6ffuM8Z4AaABAg", "comment_by": "frozenstrawbs", "comment_text": "DANK", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T08:39:36Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"rh0fxJkvL44": {"Plato and Aristotle: Crash Course History of Science #3": {"channel_id": "UgxQCx75src42Ki3W0l4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Herodotus 94", "comment_text": "Aristotle, a philosopher so great that during the Middle Ages they only needed to say the Philosopher and everyone knew about which one they were talking, Thomas Aquinas called him the great teacher.", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T06:11:45Z", "likes_count": 89}}}, {"rh0fxJkvL44": {"Plato and Aristotle: Crash Course History of Science #3": {"channel_id": "UgzqbfzYNfpguzs_hcl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Blugale Doh", "comment_text": "Why not all?", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T04:32:54Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"rh0fxJkvL44": {"Plato and Aristotle: Crash Course History of Science #3": {"channel_id": "Ugyslq4NEyIVDpSqJzd4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ray Ceeya", "comment_text": "Hold on a sec.

However, if one considers Platonic idealism in the context of the Pareminedian and Pythagorean trends in Greek philosophy, particularly with regard to mathematics and the concept of &quot;the one,&quot; then one can easily argue that while Aristotle&#39;s empirical observations on natural philosophy are now out of touch with reality, Plato&#39;s theories are much more relevant to, let&#39;s say, binary systems by which computer programs classify and distinguish things by a series of zeros and ones that express something within the context of a programming language. If we agree with Plato and Parmenides that reality is essentially an expression of being that is one, and can be expressed as one, whereas some form of non-reality or absence is something that is-not, and therefore can be represented with a zero, even though zero simply signifies the concept of nothingness or privation, then when we think about binary systems that attempt to represents real things through a code of zeros and ones in a particular order that has meaning, we will realize that anything could theoretically be represented in binary code depending on how its zeros and ones are arranged in a code that expresses the being of that thing accurately. <br><br>People try to dismiss Plato&#39;s idealism, often because they have not comprehensively read Plato&#39;s works, and thus have not had the opportunity to experience how Plato&#39;s work was not merely idealistic in the sense of anti-pragmatism, but often expressed a desire for systematic knowledge of things so that people can have more knowledge about good and bad and be able to justify themselves to others. When one reads Plato&#39;s work and appreciates it, one sees how comprehensive his work actually was, and can get beyond the charge of idealism that is used by materialists to ad-hominem attack opponents who don&#39;t accept their harsh reduction of reality to physical matter. If we overcome this conceited materialism, we will be better able to do what was at the heart of Socratic and Platonic philosophy; inquiry into one&#39;s self, one&#39;s being, and concious examination of one&#39;s life.", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T06:18:15Z", "likes_count": 78}}}, {"rh0fxJkvL44": {"Plato and Aristotle: Crash Course History of Science #3": {"channel_id": "Ugznf6ZOWCiraVdTxnt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "culwin", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not a platist, I use bowls", "comment_date": "2018-04-17T05:49:57Z", "likes_count": 706}}}, {"rh0fxJkvL44": {"Plato and Aristotle: Crash Course History of Science #3": {"channel_id": "Ugxu_SKB8yfam0w4Bjt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Limitless Curiosity", "comment_text": "Have been way out of the loop with Crash Course for a while and just stumbled onto this little gem of a video.
