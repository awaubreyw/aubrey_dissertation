In your words, a word viewed as a dictionary entry. However, &quot;the United States&quot; and &quot;the European Union&quot; are not a lexeme in that sense. They are more like word sequences viewed as items in a list of geo names. Movie titles often falls into this category: &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is a movie title and it names a particular movie in Amazon&#39;s movie catalog. This fact is very relevant for speech recognizers since lists of lexical items (&quot;domains&quot;) must be known by speech recognizers for them to properly guess which word comes after &quot;play the trailer of the sound of...&quot;. Language analysers (parsers and interpreters) also need to take these word sequences as a single lexical unit, otherwise they cannot determine which video to play. Here we should separate the notion of lexical words (the name of some phenomenon realized in a wording) from the notion of grammatical words (a unit composed of morphemes in a standard way). Outside of NLP, it is useful to recognize &quot;the sound of music&quot; as a movie title, and it is also useful to recognise the individual words to get a feeling of what the movie is about.
