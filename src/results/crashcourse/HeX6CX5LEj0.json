All mythology is anchored in prejudice. Prejudice means a person can\u2019t stop believing something. They typically pick these beliefs up during childhood, when they are just starting to form their own minds. Kids sometimes get their prejudice from the people they grow up with, and sometimes they come to the wrong idea about the world all by themselves.<br><br>All prejudiced people see their own prejudice as an absolute truth of the universe (aka a delusion). They frequently build an alternate perceptual world trying to explain their own prejudice(s). If they write down a description of their world, you get doctrine. Most doctrines are prejudiced manifestos. Doctrines are the conceptual cores of all mythologies (used as a reference).<br><br>Having a prejudice is not the same as having a belief. A prejudice always exists at 100% confidence, and can\u2019t be switched off. So the person is evidence-immune on the prejudiced belief. Each concept a person learns needs to be carefully explained using their own prejudices. That\u2019s because people use their prejudices as trusted mental anchors for everything in their own minds. By the time people die, they are talking about how their prejudice anchors the entire universe. They believe that because they painstakingly put their own prejudice there.<br><br>Prejudice is not only the basis of mythology, most personality faults are learned mind faults (like the \u201cI don\u2019t trust people\u201d prejudice of paranoia), or a racial prejudice (\u201cx group is bad\u201d prejudice of racism). Whenever people are talking about extreme belief, or faith, they really mean the person is prejudiced, and can\u2019t change their mind no matter what shows up.<br><br>Thanks for listening.", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T11:38:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sheraz Khan", "comment_text": "What did he mean by that that sentence at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeX6CX5LEj0&amp;t=08m24s\">08:24</a> ?

For the Greeks though, winter was growing season, and it was too hot in the summer for the crops to thrive, so for the ancient Greeks Demeter&#39;s disappearance was discussing the summer. I know that&#39;s kind of nitpicky, and the spirit of the myth is to describe the &quot;we&#39;re not farming&quot; season, which would be winter in a whole heck of a lot of places, but I think the specifics are important for providing context for the myth, because ultimately myths were how the Greeks conceived of their universe.", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T16:51:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathaniel Leon", "comment_text": "Blindsided by a Mike!", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T16:30:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Micael Carestiato", "comment_text": "&quot;Over the next 40 episodes or so&quot; <br>OMG I&#39;m so excited", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T16:28:09Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Farm Farm", "comment_text": "sir/madam how do you do the animation for your videos? please reply", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T16:26:06Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "TheYoubregje", "comment_text": "omfg Mike, it&#39;s good to see you here!", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T16:22:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brewski118sempire", "comment_text": "As Pat Rothfuss puts it &quot;all stories are true, just some of them happened&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T15:08:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brewski118sempire", "comment_text": "&quot;Found in them something worth telling again and again&quot;<br><br>That seems to the truth of a good story.", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T15:06:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ALEJANDRO ALVAREZ", "comment_text": "I love you guys!", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T14:57:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bletwort", "comment_text": "Wow this looks interesting!

In my adult years her memory started to slip and when I would visit her she would want to hear them again and I could tell she didn&#39;t remember and it was like hearing them for the first time.  When she died we could tell it was her last day so my siblings and I were called together and we each visited her and spent some time alone with her saying goodbye.  She could no longer speak and I&#39;ll never know if she could understand what was going on but in addition to saying goodbye I spent that time telling her a myth I&#39;d told her many times before and at her funeral I told a myth and explained the role they played in our relationship.

Very few people knew how to write or read in the ancient times, so they tell the stories. And in that tellling the story can be modified.

Hades (Deity) and Demeter argued if she can return to Demeter had to stay with Hades (Deity/Realm).
