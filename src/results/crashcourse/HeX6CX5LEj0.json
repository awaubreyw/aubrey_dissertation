Prejudice means a person can\u2019t stop believing something. They typically pick these beliefs up during childhood, when they are just starting to form their own minds. Kids sometimes get their prejudice from the people they grow up with, and sometimes they come to the wrong idea about the world all by themselves.<br><br>All prejudiced people see their own prejudice as an absolute truth of the universe (aka a delusion). They frequently build an alternate perceptual world trying to explain their own prejudice(s). If they write down a description of their world, you get doctrine. Most doctrines are prejudiced manifestos. Doctrines are the conceptual cores of all mythologies (used as a reference).<br><br>Having a prejudice is not the same as having a belief. A prejudice always exists at 100% confidence, and can\u2019t be switched off. So the person is evidence-immune on the prejudiced belief. Each concept a person learns needs to be carefully explained using their own prejudices. That\u2019s because people use their prejudices as trusted mental anchors for everything in their own minds. By the time people die, they are talking about how their prejudice anchors the entire universe. They believe that because they painstakingly put their own prejudice there.<br><br>Prejudice is not only the basis of mythology, most personality faults are learned mind faults (like the \u201cI don\u2019t trust people\u201d prejudice of paranoia), or a racial prejudice (\u201cx group is bad\u201d prejudice of racism). Whenever people are talking about extreme belief, or faith, they really mean the person is prejudiced, and can\u2019t change their mind no matter what shows up.<br><br>Thanks for listening.", "comment_date": "2017-03-03T11:38:31Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"HeX6CX5LEj0": {"What Is Myth?

The Demeter Persephone story is not actually intended to talk about winter, that&#39;s sort of our interpretation of it, and potentially that of the Romans (they didn&#39;t much care for winter given their war schedule so maybe Ceres mourns over winter). For the Greeks though, winter was growing season, and it was too hot in the summer for the crops to thrive, so for the ancient Greeks Demeter&#39;s disappearance was discussing the summer. I know that&#39;s kind of nitpicky, and the spirit of the myth is to describe the &quot;we&#39;re not farming&quot; season, which would be winter in a whole heck of a lot of places, but I think the specifics are important for providing context for the myth, because ultimately myths were how the Greeks conceived of their universe.", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T16:51:01Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"HeX6CX5LEj0": {"What Is Myth?

As Crash Course has a history of being inclusive, I&#39;m hoping to see mythologies not as well known to Westerners (I.e., Africa, Oceania, East Asia). <br>For the sake of sharing knowledge on the off chance it is not already known to the creators of the show I thought I might share with you a London Review of Books lecture by Mary Beard, Professor of Classics at the University of Cambridge, on the Public Voice of Women. In it she connects the treatment of women in early Western myth and literature to how women are treated today in the public arena. I found it very interesting: <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/london-review-podcasts/id510327102?mt=2&amp;i=1000372777967\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/london-review-podcasts/id510327102?mt=2&amp;i=1000372777967</a><br><br>Also, the Heliopolis/Atum Creation Myth of Ancient Egypt is both kind of gross and hilarious - but it would require an uncensored episode of Crash Course.", "comment_date": "2017-03-01T05:47:41Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"HeX6CX5LEj0": {"What Is Myth?

When I was a kid I got super into myths and my grandmother used to sit and listen to me retell them.  Throughout my childhood I would learn new myths so that I had new ones to tell her.  In my adult years her memory started to slip and when I would visit her she would want to hear them again and I could tell she didn&#39;t remember and it was like hearing them for the first time.  When she died we could tell it was her last day so my siblings and I were called together and we each visited her and spent some time alone with her saying goodbye.  She could no longer speak and I&#39;ll never know if she could understand what was going on but in addition to saying goodbye I spent that time telling her a myth I&#39;d told her many times before and at her funeral I told a myth and explained the role they played in our relationship.  In short, myths mean so much to me and I&#39;m very excited to watch this crash course on them and maybe even learn some new ones.", "comment_date": "2017-02-25T21:21:39Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"HeX6CX5LEj0": {"What Is Myth?

How can anyone tell such a strange story for the first time and be believed.<br><br>First, most written myths were, well, written when they were already known. Very few people knew how to write or read in the ancient times, so they tell the stories. And in that tellling the story can be modified. The more significant the story is, the more times is going to be telled and the more modifications is going to get. Also, there&#39;s a cultural difference, since the XIX century and the scientific method, we care a lot about precision when telling a story. Because precision is what gives that newly invented thing, science, all it&#39;s magic.

If she does look back, she must stay. She made it all the way to the exit, but with one foot out of Hades (Realm) and the other foot still in, she heard a sound behind her and got startled and looked back. Hades (Deity) and Demeter argued if she can return to Demeter had to stay with Hades (Deity/Realm). Zeus decreed since Persephone was half in and half out of Hades (Realm) than she would stay in Hades (Realm) for half of the year and can leave the other half.
