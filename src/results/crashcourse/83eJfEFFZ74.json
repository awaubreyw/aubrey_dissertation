Keep in mind, I&#39;m following the whole series already which has been nothing short of knowledgable yet grueling. But, to really examine and to put into context how much African Americans/Enslaved Africans helped build not only this economy and country...but a good chunk of Europe&#39;s and overall the worlds? We have been beyond short-handed. It motivates me like no other to make sure I&#39;m putting money into my community, my family, and myself; thus working hard for the legacy my ancestors were never able to see. Just..yeah, beyond blessed you all are creating these, yet my heart is so heavy for the ripple effects this inhumane system created.", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T22:57:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Long", "comment_text": "Watching on my iphone", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T14:30:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justice ForJuicy", "comment_text": "Reparations now for descendants of American slavery!", "comment_date": "2022-08-05T01:16:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lula Leah", "comment_text": "This series is so important!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T01:44:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mrcead", "comment_text": "Imagine how better off America would be if black Americans were allowed economic participation after reconstruction at least", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T10:48:44Z", "likes_count": 329}, {"comment_by": "Nelson Swanberg", "comment_text": "The cotton gin extended slavery.:(", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T06:32:19Z", "likes_count": 23}, {"comment_by": "malachi champion", "comment_text": "&quot;It really doesn&#39;t get more clear than that&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T05:03:02Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Taylor Wilkerson", "comment_text": "+", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T04:58:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nat Stacks", "comment_text": "Absolutely love this series!!!
