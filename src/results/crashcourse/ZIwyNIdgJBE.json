I don&#39;t think this is a failing that disqualifies it as a science though, just look at another science with the same problem, meteorology. Meteorologists could not hope to model every atom in the atmosphere, ocean, and land to create a perfect forecast and because they are working with such a complex system that changes constantly they are only capable of a limited understanding and of producing forecasts that must adapt and change as the medium they observe changes due to both predicted and unpredictable inputs. If you don&#39;t think sociology is a science then how would you explain the science of marketing and product advertising? They may never claim to know how well a product will sell exactly, but by studying their targeted market and understanding how that market would react to various tactics a good marketing agent will almost always score better sales. I think everyone would agree marketing is a great example of how sociology can be applied to real life and sales figures could even be seen as data to compare methods and refine better sales tactics even if the marketing agents are not 100% sure why these tactics appealed to every individual that actually bought the product. Some sciences need to use forecasts or seek general trends and relationships in the data that help develop an understanding of the system as a whole, this does not make sociology a false science, just a tricky one that even the best will get wrong from time to time. <br><br>Now as to why I think there is a mild degree of hatred for sociology out there, I think most of that fits into a dislike for what was labeled &quot;critical sociology&quot;. As was mentioned, empirical data must be collected properly and from non-biased methods to have any merit, but when the scientists conducting a study have a pre-determined bias and desire for their results to confirm that bias and spur social change those scientists are far more likely to create a flawed study that is nothing more than propaganda to support that social change. Just look up videos on why most science studies are misleading or false and they can explain dozens or even hundreds of ways bias or flaws can seep into a study by accident or on purpose. Of course you don&#39;t need to learn anything to know that devoted activists are unlikely to publish results that actually hurt their positions, so that alone makes having an initial bias unhealthy for actually understanding the truth. <br><br>One example that comes to mind of a flaw in these types of studies is one that reports sexual violence incidents with suspiciously high percentages such as the classic &quot;1 in 5 girls&quot; statistic. Did only the girls who were exposed to the violence care enough about it to participate in the voluntary survey, did some girls decide to falsely claim they had been victims hoping that it would increase security and prevent any future dangers that they fear, did some or many falsely report thinking they would make up for girls they thought would be too scared to speak up??? On the other hand, maybe the numbers really are accurate or some might believe them even lower than reality because some might still have been unwilling to report. Perhaps making such a survey anonymous would increase false reports by a large amount since girls had little to loose by reporting they were victims and only stood to benefit from policies enacted because of inflated numbers, or perhaps verifying each incident as much as possible with no anonymity would scare off many actual victims resulting in under reporting. That is just one situation I can think of where gathering empirical data would be just about impossible and the results would vary wildly just depending on the methods used to obtain the data even if it was done by a non-biased sociologist with very well thought out methods. Lots of studies are being pumped out and used to justify laws or social change by critical sociologists and it is hated as a dirty weapon in modern culture wars. Because social change or resisting social change is easier with good evidence and reasons to back your personal positions every person of every viewpoint will collect &quot;evidence&quot; generated by both high quality studies and/or flawed studies to rely on. Since we are all trying to justify our positions we will likely see the errors of our opposition while sharing our own flawed studies among our peers with far less scrutiny. Because of this effect we will get the feeling our social opponents are using sociology wrong and hate on the science itself because we can see it abused so often to our detriment. <br><br>Humans are often illogical, complex, and filled with bias, so a study of human interactions by humans sounds inherently messy. For topics such as marketing where all involved share the same goals and produce fairly measurable results sociology really seems to shine as a science that seeks to understand human behavior and creates fairly accurate models and tools, but in many applications of critical sociology I think the initial bias that led to creating a study will very often undermine the study itself. Those are my thoughts on the issue anyway, I look forward to more videos and hope the topic tries to stay fair to all sides involved if it approaches politics, beliefs, social morality, or modern activism. I believe there is merit in social change that seeks to improve life for everyone, but perhaps a rapidly changing society is also inherently unstable, hard to balance, and dangerous in some ways as well, so progressive, regressive, and moderate or change resistant forces in society all play important roles.", "comment_date": "2017-03-30T10:02:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Callum McTavish", "comment_text": "Why is sociology so insecure they have to ruin the names of education and science?

We start off strong with evidence based research, or &quot;positivism&quot;, then realize positivism is hard, and give up on it. Good experiment design is hard, and rigorous statistical analysis is hard, but that does not mean you should give up.<br><br>Our knowledge of statistics and how to control for variables has come a long way. Now, peoples own opinions of there environment are important, I get that point. But people are constantly shaped by the studies they see, so using their opinions gives a positive feed back loop.<br><br>Why is racism a thing? Do people inherently think that different people are worse? If that is true, then it cannot be fixed, so we should hope its not. No, its a learned behavior. Why do people learn it? Because other people tell them racist things, and the world does not seem to contradict it. Then these racist attitudes reinforce the status quo, and we continue.<br><br>The point being, the very concepts we use, our subjectivity as you call it, causes the actual behavior. So incorporating this data into your models, especially if they form the basis of your models, will often make these viscous positive feed back loops.<br><br>Also, subjectivity is not a thing. A subjective statement is just not a properly qualified phenomenon. So many statements we make are filled with allot of implicit assumptions. This is largely good, since specifying those assumptions is expensive and most people are people and people are fairly uniform. That said, when an unstated assumption brakes, things can be confusing when you don&#39;t realize the assumption.<br><br>So while some assumptions are always necessary, the realization that you have to make some does not mean you should give up. It means you should build models and parameterize assumptions that concern you, then run rigorous statistical analysis and look for results.<br><br>In closing, sociology is hard, really hard. Luckily people can easily be approximated by simple models, so its still doable, but we are smart enough to &quot;game&quot; any models you through at us, known as the Hawthorne effect. I just don&#39;t like that sociologists seem to give up on the hard models instead of being more careful.
