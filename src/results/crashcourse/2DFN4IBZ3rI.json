The people she watches claim that the immune system is the reason we get sick and is responding only to cells that come from within the body (as if that makes any sense) I&#39;ve been procrastinating on watching the videos she&#39;s watched. She has had no interest in microbiology or evolutionary theory until this coronavirus started spreading and she immediately started watching videos talking about the conspiracies associated with the virus because she&#39;s subscribed to David Icke, Joe Dispenza, and other alternative medicine channels. She&#39;s one of those people who believes frequencies are imperative to health, that crystals emit healing energy, conventional food is poisonous, and chakras exist. Needless to say, she&#39;s completely convinced of these claims by these few and far in between medical &quot;experts&quot; who also just happen to be aired on conspiracy theory channels, some of which believe that the Earth is flat.<br><br><br>I am so frustrated mostly because she has the gall to angrily spread this misinformation around in a self-righteous way like she has all the answers when she has admitted to me that she hasn&#39;t before ever researched into biology or other sciences outside of her fringe sphere. She still doesn&#39;t know the basics of evolutionary theory, she can&#39;t name a single organelle (she probably doesn&#39;t know what that is, even though I know I&#39;ve told her) within the body (except for maybe the mitochondria), and she thinks specific frequencies can cure (or harm) anything.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t necessarily have the time to debunk the massive amount of misinformation she&#39;s watched. A lot of the videos I&#39;ve asked her to send me are at least an hour long and it&#39;s hard to want to take them seriously, even though, as an aspiring researcher, I know I should. At least I should be able to know how to debunk things, thoroughly and precisely.<br><br><br>I&#39;m just venting for the most part. I feel like it would be such a waste of time, but I know that I will most likely learn a lot more about biology than I have in the past by doing research into many more documented experiments and trials than I previously have.<br><br><br>What would you do, internet commenter? If you were in my situation, would you try and debunk these claims that my mother so vehemently spreads around like a virus in and of itself? Is it worth the time?

Perhaps more investigation is warranted in order to determine more effective means of enhancing our immune system? For example, the exploration of  how immunity is mediated epigenetically through exposure to non-life threatening (in healthy populations)  pathogens like chicken pox.

Therefore the Adaptive Immune response is like combating Death Knights, their diseases effects are viral pathologically (typically transferred by Rune Blade incisions). By having your learning B Lymphocytes train well read, it&#39;s just like playing the game. Death Knights have a spell book, too. You, by training yourself with immunizations, minimize the damage potential of a viral infection by having your antibodies build up immunities. The chilling effects cool your internal body temperature, which is bad because the inflammation associated with the Innate response can be critical at some times. Hint to succeed in the game: read. Know the type of death knight like the type of plague they carry and know the symptoms. Keep your distance and protect yourself with your saves, and use your skill to determine when to administer timed damage to the invasion. You can&#39;t stop Death&#39;s Advance, but you can still slow it, use terrain to your advantage. It&#39;s a slow tank, heavy hitter. Don&#39;t wither! There are books all over Archerus, how many students of Razuvious took the time to read?<br><br>The Innate response seems like a good counter to bacterial infections, such as those experienced from lacerations of a cat whose paws may have been dipped through the skin of several bodies already. These immune attacks can spring out of stealth, so predicting the infection ahead of the time with a shot may not be immediate enough as opposed to how your Inflammatory response would. To counter the meddlesome pawing of a Feral druid, react quickly. Apply pressure immediately and stay on it. It will try to run and cower to re-open. If you can dispel the disease with a cleansing effect like an antiseptic, do so quickly to minimize the long term effect, but do so insuring those wounds aren&#39;t reopened for a second infection. Cats don&#39;t have subcutaneous glands to produce sweat, so if they are feeling the heat, good for you! These are subtle and feline so thermoregulate and try not to die. <br><br>Nice grunt, but orcs are people, too. They read from a spell book. Travel with friends, dispel if you can and lock it down so that you aren&#39;t set up to be disease ridden for a long time. Minimize your incoming disease damage; maximize your damage output when you turn the tide in your favor, when the pathogen spreaders are susceptible, with friends or controlled.
