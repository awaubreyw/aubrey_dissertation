Many feel the VP may act in such a manner so that committees are formed and debates and votes are held to cater to the desired legislation sought by the President. This in turn would mean that the executive branch has possibly too much influence over the legislative branch than what the US Constitution allows.<br><br>Amending The US Constitution-Vice-President Part Two<br>Should the VP be President of the Senate? Look at the following criteria for President of the Senate.<br>1. Popular vote is not possible for the President of the Senate. This position is not supposed to be involved in the lawmaking process. This is direct democracy and the position will be affected by the winds of populism.<br>2. Direct selection by the POTUS of this position is not viable as well. The President of the Senate belongs to another branch of government and there cannot exist proximity and ongoing official contact between the two. Yet the President of the Senate hands all bills to the POTUS directly. This is Imperial Democracy at work.<br>3. For some of the same reasons listed in the number two clause, the Vice President cannot be the President of the Senate due to proximity and ongoing official contact with the POTUS.<br><br>Amending The US Constitution-Vice-President Part Three<br>If the VP should no longer the President of the Senate, what will his/her role be?<br>Since the VP is no longer doing what is constitutionally mandated, then why continue to mandate? Remove the requirement that he/she serve in the US Senate and instead limit his/her role within the confines of the White House duties as representative of the POTUS at the will of the POTUS.<br><br><br><br>Amending The US Constitution-Vice-President Part Four<br>If the VP should no longer the President of the Senate, who would indeed fill that position? Look at the following requirements.<br>1. The President of the US Senate cannot be directly elected by the people since his/her role is merely to apply laws in the governance of the upper house of the federal legislature. That role is not a lawmaking one and therefore has to be insulated from the winds of populism. In this role, discretion is not allowed.<br>This model of direct democracy(democracy with a small d) cannot be deployed in picking this position.<br>2. The President of the US Senate cannot be selected by the same people he is supposed to preside. There would exist too many conflicts of interest and would therefore lead to unnecessary power brokering and influence peddling. This would lead to direct democracy as the lack of checks and balances would lead to a lack of accountability. The political party in control would have too much influence over this position holder. Popularity cannot have too much of an influence of this office holder.<br>3. The President of the US Senate cannot be selected by President because the President would have to deal with this position holder on an ongoing basis. There lies a conflict of interest and the executive branch would gain too much power. This would lead to Imperial Democracy as the lack of checks and balances would lead to a lack of accountability.<br><br>Amending The US Constitution-President Of The Senate Part Five<br>The candidate for President Of The US Senate cannot also serve as a lawmaker in the US Senate unless there is a tie on a specific vote.<br>All the members of the upper houses of each state legislature cast a vote for President Of The US Senate. The reason why the upper houses cast votes for this position is the role of state senator is similar to the role of federal senator.<br>If a candidate wins the majority of the state senators&#39; votes, either initially or through Ranked Choice Voting, that candidate wins all the electoral votes for that state. Each state is assigned the same number of electoral votes as they are entitled to for the presidential election.<br>There are 538 electoral votes that the state legislatures offer. There are also 538 electoral votes that the House of Representatives offer.The reason why the House of Representatives cast votes for this position is there is no attached conflict of interest with this position on their part.<br>The percentage of votes that a candidate receives in the House of Representatives is applied against the number of electoral votes, which is 538.<br>If a candidate fails to win the majority of the electoral votes from the state legislatures, then the top two vote recipients receive one newly assigned vote from each state that he/she has the higher number of electoral votes.Then the percentage of the total of newly assigned votes received by these two candidates is applied to the previous number of electoral votes, which is 538.<br>The candidate who wins the most electoral votes based on the combination from the State Legislatures and from the US Senate wins the election for President Of The US Senate.<br><br>Amending The US Constitution- Vice President and President Of The Senate Part Six<br>- When the US Constitution was written, the VP was not part of the Presidential ticket. He ran separately and if the candidate received the 2nd highest total of electoral votes, he became the VP and the President of the Senate. Since he was not part of the Presidential administration, the President as head of the federal executive branch could not be asserted of having undue influences over the US Senate.<br>Over the many decades to come, the role of the VP changed and for good measure. Since he was also there to take over the role of presidency in case the president was removed from and/or was no longer available to serve that role, it made inevitable sense that he become an integral part of the presidential administration. It also made sense he no longer be that active in serving as President Of The Senate.<br>The difficulties lied in the fact that these customary changes were not reflected officially in amendments in the US Constitution. So for 150 years-200 years, the roles of these position holders have been shrouded with gray. The overlapping and co-mingling of duties by the VP continued to this day.<br><br>Amending The US Constitution- Vice President and President Of The Senate Part Seven<br>At the start of the American nation, it was correct that the VP was not part of the Presidential administration considering his main active duty was to serve as President of the US Senate. However, what indeed served the flawed democratic model of direct democracy was the fact he was,while electorally, popularly voted.<br>There is a firm reason why the framers of the US Constitution did not want office holders who merely are supposed to only enforce, apply, and support the law to ever be elected by popular vote. A popular vote victory for any candidate in this position would give them cause to start utilizing discretion, which is absolutely prohibitive.<br>Discretion is only reserved for those in the lawmaking capacity(legislators and heads of the executive branch) when it comes to making the law. All others in government service must follow and implement the law to strict standards on an uniform basis.<br>This is why the state legislatures and federal representatives in the US Congress must select the President of the Senate and that position holder cannot concurrently serve any other role in any of the government branches, such as VP or Senator. This also holds true for the Speaker Of The House, who cannot either be directly elected, selected by House Representatives, or be a member of the House that he or she presides.", "comment_date": "2020-01-05T11:19:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Your Big Head Cousin", "comment_text": "The Confederation congress was designed to keep the individual states from squabbling during the revolution.", "comment_date": "2020-01-04T20:14:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roman Soiko", "comment_text": "27 amendments preamble 7articles", "comment_date": "2020-01-04T09:33:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesus Carrillo", "comment_text": "Love you amazing video !!!", "comment_date": "2020-01-04T00:50:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gibson Armstrong", "comment_text": "Bruh this is so liberal", "comment_date": "2020-01-03T21:29:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uc9c0\uc0c1\uc6d0", "comment_text": "summary please...", "comment_date": "2020-01-03T15:37:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Morrissey", "comment_text": "Who were the senators", "comment_date": "2020-01-03T06:02:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cooper Anderson", "comment_text": "You clearly don&#39;t understand the electoral college, even though you drone on about it for quite some time.<br>Its purpose is not to ensure that the &quot;rabble&quot; cannot win, rather, it&#39;s to prevent states with massive urban cities with a high population density make all the decisions for people halfway across the country.

It would probably help to get people to worry more about those than presidential ones, the president may be the &quot;head&quot; of government but your representatives are your/our voices in it. You do such a good job on your videos, do one on the offices president and vice president. Maybe we can get back to the way it was originally done, and by doing so maybe, either get away from our current party situation or, force the parties to work together better.", "comment_date": "2016-02-14T21:12:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "huskerdoodle", "comment_text": "So, I&#39;m a 29 year old graduate student, and I&#39;m totally hooked on John Greene&#39;s history videos.

It has a federation of six states who surrendered a limited set of powers to a federal government. It has a House of Reps and a Senate (12 senators per state, 2 per territory), but no President heading an executive branch. It has a separation of judicial powers with a High Court of Australia. However, in Westminster style, it has a monarch (represented by an appointed Governor General) and the &quot;executive&quot; is effectively headed by a Prime Minister (though that office is not mentioned in the Constitution) who is the head of government in the House of Reps. That means a single locus of power rather than two, which means it works more fluidly than in the USA. There are also controls against filibustering. From Switzerland it borrowed the idea of referendums (a vote by all citizens) as the means of changing the Constitution. For example, the 5th amendment transferred jurisdiction of aboriginal people/issues from the states to the federal government (effectively enabling them to be counted as citizens). Most referendums fail, but that one got over a 90% &#39;Yes&#39; vote. With fewer states there is also a lot of alignment of laws between them, often brokered by COAG (Council of Australian Governments). So things like road rules and educational standards are fairly consistent between states. There is also local government; it is not spontaneous, but regulated by the states with far less jurisdiction than in the USA (e.g. it covers municipal services, parks, local roads, building/development controls etc; but things like Police, Fire, building regulation, main roads, licences, etc are all at state level). Federation in Australia was driven by security fears (e.g. a single defence force to protect against &#39;asian invasion&#39;), elimination of tariffs and constraints on interstate trade, and a need to standardise railways (mostly run by the state governments, and then a significant source of income). There wasn&#39;t much &#39;deep thinking&#39; about federation, as most of that had already been done by others, but it didn&#39;t involve any revolution or insurrection either. Officially we&#39;re a &#39;Commonwealth&#39;, a nation aimed at maximising the common good of its citizens. Next stop is to replace the GG with a President (probably in the German or Irish style), with that most likely triggered by the passing of the highly respected QE II.", "comment_date": "2015-12-04T07:45:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lil ball sweat Balls", "comment_text": "i like balls", "comment_date": "2015-12-03T21:42:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake Ellsworth", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t understand why a government has to be either large or small, why can&#39;t it be medium?

The Civil War might have ended without emancipation. Instead it was lengthened until that emancipation was written into law. And the abolitionist movement was also there at the birth of the United States - you dishonor them when you call them racist.<br><br>It is forgotten now that the citizens of the United States wanted self-rule, that they were an agrarian society composed of solid and virtuous individuals who were capable in their independence. Because of the growth of industry, cities, corporations, and banks, we are an unrecognizable citizenry, and now slaves to the massive worldly powers of consumption, economy, jobs, money. The new shackles are debt - either already contracted or necessarily to be. And we are ignorant, so we don&#39;t recognize it. And we are ignorant because we are not wise, and our lack of wisdom springs from our lack of true education and of virtue. Somewhere along the line we forgot that we have an obligation to be good.<br><br><br>That is what we need for the American way to be relevant.

It was not some &quot;byzantine&quot; process that Americans were ashamed of. Whether it still has a purpose now is up for debate, but back then, it could take months to reach parts of the country, so an Electoral college made up of representatives of the disparate parts of the country had to come together, otherwise, the election for President would take way too long.

For example, the right to privacy in your letters is specifically protected in the constitution, so the government can&#39;t open your mail; but since the telephone hadn&#39;t been invented yet, they can legally spy on your phone conversations. When it comes to the structure of the military, and preventing the government from using the military as a tool of oppression against the public, our founding fathers gave us the right to bear arms and form a militia as we see fit. The problem here is an obvious one that&#39;s been brought up a million times: the state of modern military technology is such that there&#39;s no way in hell a private citizen could even afford weapons they could use to contend with the military, so the right to bear arms no longer effectively addresses that problem. There&#39;s also a snobbish elitism in our government, such as the electoral college. This whole concept that the general public can&#39;t be allowed too much power in government is complete garbage, and you&#39;d be hard pressed to find an average working class American who disagrees with me.

When talking about 3/5\u00a0compromise\u00a0he again was quick to say they were all racist but fails to mention that the vast majority of people on earth were racist at that time and that\u00a0Africans\u00a0sold their own slaves to us. Instead of pointing out that these people gave up the enormous amount of power that was in there hands as they did, and paved the way for freedom from tyranny, he would rather bash them for being rich and racist.

First off, the Articles of Confederation. The Articles actually did provide a method to have a national judiciary- a single issue judiciary that was picked in a ridiculous fashion (see the 9th Article) but a judiciary nonetheless. He missed a very important reason that the Articles were weak- they were created by those who were accountable to their states, and the states considered themselves to be sovereign nations at that point in time. As such it was rather difficult to get them to hand over as much power as they did to a national government. He also forgot a few issues that the Articles government faced - like the fact that the states could also coin their own money, and set taxes that hurt the other states trade wise, that wasn&#39;t just on the international scale (Franklin once referred to New Jersey as a keg tapped at both ends- meaning the ridiculous taxes that discriminated against it from New York and Pennsylvania). Also, the NW Ordinance of 1787 required the states to provide for education (why does everyone always forget about education?)<br><br>Next up, convention-y stuff. The Annapolis Convention wasn&#39;t the first time the states tried to work things out for trade agreements. The Mount Vernon Convention came first, and was a bit of a cluster, and was a direct cause for the Annapolis convention. As for the whole scrapping the Articles idea that came from the Philadelphia convention? Madison. Like that probably wouldn&#39;t have been a thing if Madison hadn&#39;t started off the Convention with the VA Plan. And was strongly contested. As was the whole creating a much stronger national government <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NewYorkDelegation\">#NewYorkDelegation</a>  <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ExceptHamilton\">#ExceptHamilton</a> \u00a0. Also, the New Jersey Plan did actually just amend the Articles (but it wasn&#39;t really seriously considered, it was just a political thing that the smaller states used to rally around as an objection to the popular representation in the Virginia Plan). Furthermore, there&#39;s the whole how senators are elected thing. John should have mentioned that thanks to the 17th Amendment, senators are no longer elected by state legislatures (thus breaking federalism and state sovereignty, but that&#39;s another rant) and are instead elected by popular vote. ALL HE ACHIEVED BY NOT MENTIONING THIS WAS POSSIBLY CONFUSING PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT KNOW SQUAT ABOUT THE AMERICAN ELECTORAL SYSTEM, WHICH BASED ON THE COMMENTS, HE DID. The 3/5ths Compromise, while being completely horrible, was in there to give the slave states power in the House - but not too much power, and was necessary to convince those states to stay in the union, so yeah I&#39;ll stick with him about being ashamed about that being in the US Constitution, despite the fact that it was rendered useless by the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery. (Note, it wasn&#39;t just white people who were counted as full people, it was literally just non-slaves. That&#39;s right! Free women too were counted as one person to help get the rich white men more power). However, nice job on pointing out that judicial review isn&#39;t actually a thing in the Constitution. It was basically considered a power they would have (see Federalist papers), they still had to grant it to themselves (Marbury v. Madison). Also, thanks for pointing out how our formerly dual federalist system is supposed to work (RE: 17th Amendment rant that I&#39;m not going to go into)\u00a0<br><br>Now, the Mystery Document. Seriously, a Hamilton paper? The ones Madison wrote were more interesting and important. Also, the Second Amendment argument is frankly irrelevant to the paper. Know why? Because the Federalist Papers were a series of arguments as to why the Constitution should be ratified WITHOUT AMENDMENT. The Bill of Rights (1st-10th Amendments) were added after the Constitution was ratified, and as such can&#39;t be used to argue against Hamilton&#39;s random (unsupportable) arguments in the Federalist Papers. Furthermore, Hamilton had squat to do with passing the Amendments considering the fact that they came about during the first Congress, which he was not a part of. So blame Madison for that admittedly nearsighted Amendment, not Hamilton. Furthermore, the Antifederalists are the reason that we have a Bill of Rights- it was their only unifying argument, and fact that the Federalists agreed to have one is how the Constitution was able to be ratified, New York and Virginia wouldn&#39;t have otherwise.<br><br>My last complaint is how much democracy was talked about here. Because the simple fact of the matter is that the US never has been a democracy. The Founders intended to create a republic with democratic influences, not the other way around. Frankly, the widespread and continued talk of democracy has increased the myth that that is what the Framers intended to make, which is simply wrong.<br><br>TL;DR I did enjoy this video- it had a lot of good information.

The Presidents of the United States of America ran as fast as their legs would carry them over the blood-soaked bridge. They stumbled over the bodies of presidents and monarchs as they fled back to Washington.<br>At last, they reached land and caught their breath.<br>\u201cRally, men!\u201d Ulysses Grant yelled before taking a swig from his flask. \u201cReform the line! We hold them at the shore!\u201d<br>\u201cFor God sake, Grant!\u201d George HW Bush replied, looking back at the advancing British monarchs. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken my son prisoner! We have to negotiate.\u201d<br>\u201cThey have five of us prisoner,\u201d Thomas Jefferson said with a sigh. \u201cAnd, if my count is correct, there\u2019s only eight of us of left and twenty of them. Compromise is starting to look like a better option.\u201d<br>\u201cYou know all about compromise, don\u2019t you Thomas,\u201d Barack Obama said angrily. \u201cYou had no trouble making that three-fifths compromise during your presidency.\u201d<br>\u201cI will not let someone like you criticize my presidency,\u201d Jefferson said, advancing on Obama.<br>\u201cAnd what do you mean by \u2018someone like me?\u2019\u201d Obama replied, staring down his predecessor.<br>\u201cThat\u2019s, erah, enough boys,\u201d came the distinctive speech pattern of John F Kennedy. \u201cSave it for the enemy.\u201d<br>Initially, the battle had gone well for the presidents. Teddy Roosevelt showed excellent leadership and fought like a man possessed. He was the first to draw blood when he threw a spear into the back of Henry V\u2019s head in the middle of his St Crispin\u2019s day speech.<br>It\u2019s hard to say exactly where things went wrong. George Washington had fought conservatively but, when he saw George III, his thirst for revenge took over. Blinded by rage, the nation\u2019s founder was captured by Edward Longshanks.<br>Despite all their losses, the battle still seemed winnable until the presidents suffered the greatest blow to moral. Teddy Roosevelt, while holding Edward III and Edward IV in a headlock with each arm, was speared in the chest by King John. Without releasing the two Edwards, Roosevelt fell backwards, off the bridge, into the roaring Potomac.<br>Faced with the loss of their leader, the remaining Presidents had no choice but to flee. Now, they had no leader, eight men remaining, and twenty monarchs advancing over the bridge.<br>William the Conquerer stepped forward with five prisoners and forced them to their knees.<br>\u201cGood evening, gentlemen,\u201d he said, wiping blood from his sword. \u201cI think this bloodshed has gone on long enough. Surrender the city to us, and your lives will be spared. Persist, and you will all die. Who speaks for you?\u201d<br>\u201cSurrender?!\u201d Grant exclaimed, throwing his now-empty flask on the ground. \u201cDid you forget who you were talking to?\u201d<br>\u201cI suppose this drunken vandal will be replacing Theodore Roosevelt as your leader,\u201d William said with a sneer.<br>\u201cYour majesty,\u201d Bill Clinton said gently. \u201cIf you release those prisoners, we might be able to negotiate. Why don\u2019t you just let a few of them go?\u201d<br>\u201cThey attack us because we are free,\u201d one of the prisoners said in a Texan accent. \u201cThey hate us for our Freedom.\u201d<br>\u201cDammit, son!\u201d George HW Bush yelled. \u201cKeep your voice down!\u201d<br>But George Bush Sr was too late. Queen Victoria stepped up behind George Bush Jr with her sword drawn.<br>\u201cWe are not amused,\u201d she said, glaring at the prisoner. Without another word, she decapitated the forty-third president.<br>\u201cSon!\u201d George HW Bush screamed. He attempted to run forward but Hoover and Clinton held him back.<br>\u201cKill them all,\u201d William said solemnly.<br>One of the prisoners looked to the others and offered reassuring words. \u201cWe have nothing to fear but fear it-\u201d FDR was cut off as William IV stabbed him through the stomach.<br>The remaining eight presidents were speechless. Even Grant couldn\u2019t find a single obscenity to slur at the monarchs. At last, Lincoln stepped forward.<br>Obama grabbed him on the shoulder, whispering, \u201cDon\u2019t throw your life away, you damn fool!\u201d<br>Lincoln gently removed Obama\u2019s hand and said to him, \u201cLeadership means doing what is necessary.\u201d<br>Honest Abe approached William the Conquerer and took a knee before the King.<br>\u201cI surrender the city to you,\u201d he said in a subdued voice.<br>\u201cVery good,\u201d William said. \u201cBut if you wish to apologize properly, why don\u2019t you remove that ridiculous hat?\u201d<br>\u201cOf course,\u201d Lincoln said, taking off his hat.<br>As the hat slid down his head, George VI noticed something.<br>\u201cL-L-L- Look. He\u2019s trying to- to- to- to- He\u2019s got-\u201d<br>\u201cGood lord,\u201d Edward VI sighed. \u201cI thought you had gotten over your speech impediment. What are you trying to say?\u201d<br>George VI didn\u2019t have time. Lincoln reached into his hat and pulled out a hidden dagger. Rising from his knee, Honest Abe jammed the knife upwards into William the Conquerer\u2019s throat.<br>\u201cChaaaaarge!\u201d Lincoln yelled, leaping over William\u2019s corpse and plunging his knife into Edward VI.<br>Lincoln left three corpses at his feet before the monarchs over-powered him at last. The remaining seven presidents leapt at the monarchs, fighting for their lives.<br>Gradually, the adrenaline wore off, and the outnumbered presidents were forced to backpedal off the bridge. All except for Grant, who continued to yell, \u201cDamnation, here I come!\u201d even as Richard the Lionheart\u2019s spear tore into him.<br>The survivors were split into two groups. Obama, Jefferson, and Clinton were pushed to the left while Hoover, Kennedy, and the surviving Bush were driven right.<br>Bush kept screaming his son\u2019s middle name as he cut down king after king. At last, Richard the Lionheart, the greatest swordsman on the battlefield, advanced on him. With his overwhelming strength, Richard knocked the sword from Bush\u2019s hand. With another slash, the president was eviscerated.<br>Kennedy pulled his sword from Edward Longshanks\u2019s corpse and looked in horror as he saw Hoover fall under Henry VIII\u2019s spear. Kennedy stood in a defensive stance, facing Richard and three other monarchs.<br>Suddenly, Richard held up his hand to stop the other three monarchs. \u201cDeal with the last few presidents,\u201d he said. \u201cThis one is mine.\u201d The other three obediently charged toward the other group as Richard advanced with a smirk on his face.<br>Meanwhile, the other group of presidents were running out of energy. With the exception of Richard the Lionheart, all of the remaining monarchs were advancing on the last three presidents. They were outnumbered ten to three.<br>Jefferson attempted to backpedal away from his attackers but tripped over a corpse. He lay helplessly on his back as Edward III stood over him, ready to land the killing blow. Suddenly, a spear flew through the air and landed in Edward III\u2019s chest. Jefferson looked over in disbelief and saw that Obama had saved him at the last second.<br>Before Obama could return his attention to the other monarchs, James II sliced into the president\u2019s thigh. Obama groaned in pain and backpedaled against the wall of a nearby building.<br>James II stepped forward, smiling. \u201cThe Moor is mine,\u201d he said.<br>\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d Obama said, summoning the last of his strength and skewering James II. \u201cI\u2019m not a Moor.\u201d He pushed the corpse off his sword and onto the ground. \u201cI was born in the United States. Don\u2019t you ever forget it.<br>Jefferson looked and saw Henry VIII knock Clinton to the ground with his spear. The president from Arkansas attempted to crawl away as Henry VIII stood over him. \u201cImpeached for cheating on your wife, eh?\u201d the King said as he performed the killing blow. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have lasted long in this bloody country.\u201d<br>Before Jefferson could get up, he was forced to the ground again, this time by Charles I. The king knelt above him with a knife. \u201cI\u2019ve got you now, you scum!\u201d the monarch yelled.<br>Suddenly, a massive figure appeared behind Charles I. Charles noticed the shadow but was afraid to turn around.<br>\u201cYou didn\u2019t hear him coming, did you?\u201d Jefferson said, smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s because he speaks softly.\u201d<br>Suddenly, a massive club connected with Charles\u2019s head, knocking him off of the president. The dazed monarch looked up and saw Teddy Roosevelt standing over him. The man was bleeding and still dripping with water from the Potomac River. Behind him were the corpses of the rest of the monarchs.<br>\u201cAnd I carry a big stick,\u201d Roosevelt said with a maniacal grin.<br>Jefferson rose to his feet and held his sword over Charles\u2019s throat.<br>\u201cNot again,\u201d Charles moaned right before he was decapitated.<br>Meanwhile, Kennedy had been put on the defensive by Richard. He had been forced to backpedal into a nearby building. Richard fought him up the stairs, taunting him all the way to the roof.<br>At last, Richard knocked the sword from Kennedy\u2019s hand. Kennedy crawled to the edge of the roof, searching for anything he could use as a weapon.<br>\u201cAll out of room, lad!\u201d Richard declared triumphantly. \u201cOh, look at that,\u201d he said, looking to Kennedy\u2019s right. There was an American flag attached to a pole, waving in the wind. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll have to be taking that down. I forgot to bring a Union Jack with me, but I guess we\u2019ll think of something.\u201d<br>Kennedy sprung into action, kicking Richard away. Before the monarch could recover, Kennedy pulled the flag pole from it\u2019s post and delivered a blow to Richard\u2019s face. The king swung his sword, breaking the flag pole in half.<br>Still holding both ends, Kennedy lunged forward and dug the broken chunk of wood into Richard\u2019s side. The king screamed in pain as he staggered backwards towards the edge of the roof. Finally, Kennedy jammed the end of the pole with the flag still attached into Richard\u2019s throat. His blood mixed with his red beard and the king collapsed on the\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-02-07T16:24:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GDveertje", "comment_text": "Loved the video!
