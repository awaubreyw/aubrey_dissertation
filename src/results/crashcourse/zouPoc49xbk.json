Yes! Finally! Of course, I had to wait for a long time, but, now, here it is! I thank John Green and Hank Green for starting Crash Course and adding so many new courses. I thank the staff of Crash Course for thinking about this and finally doing it. I thank the course hosters of each course in Crash Course for hosting the courses. I thank all of you! Please continue to make new courses and educate the next generation. You&#39;re videos are awesome. They mix learning and fun - something that other YouTube channels like TED-Ed, Kurzegsagt - In a nutshell, Thought Caf\u00e9, Life Noggin, SciShow ( including associated channels like SciShow Space) , Khan Academy, Minute Physics, Numberphile, etc have actually done so far, but, as always, every channel mentioned here has its own unique way of educating. So do you! I like the way you crack jokes between the episodes. I also like the way you explain stuff. I love the animation, too! I thank PBS Digital Studios, Thought Caf\u00e9 (for the animation), and all the other organisations that have contributed a lot to Crash Course. I also like the music. You&#39;re videos have helped not only me, but all of us, a lot! You&#39;re awesome! Once again, thank you so much for the courses.
