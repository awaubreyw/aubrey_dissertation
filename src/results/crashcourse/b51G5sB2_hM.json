Great video, btw. <br><br>India is a super interesting example in the Green Revolution because, on the surface level, it fits into that classic Malthusian problem where population growth outpaces food production. In response to this, the US proposed hybrid crops, mechanization, and herbicides and pesticides to increase yields. <br><br>But here\u2019s the thing with that. The costs for owning a farm quickly went through the roof. As the technology for increasing yields became the new normal, farmers with even the smallest farms had to invest in the new technology just to keep up. This meant that they had to buy seeds every year (as there are lots of issues with trying to use seeds from hybrid crops for sowing the next year), and investing in a lot of expensive and often dangerous chemicals that the plants needed to thrive. At the same time, the US held a lot of the patents for seeds, fertilizers, etc and they gained the profits from these farmers. Whether their intentions were noble or malicious, these changes resulted in bankruptcy and loss of jobs or farms for many poor farmers. <br><br>The US also refused to work with countries who wanted to implement land redistribution or heavy agricultural subsidies. Although similar policies were (and still are) vital to the survival of the American agricultural system, such policies in \u201cdeveloping\u201d counties smelled like communism to 1960s America.
