Developing film in the camera would have required pouring corrosive development chemicals into a camera body made of wood and filled with oiled gears made of metal.    It&#39;s much more likely that the camera was used as a printer to expose developed negatives to unexposed film stock in order to create a positive print for projection.    This was called an all-in-one camera,  because it was used to take film., then it was used as a film printer by re-exposing the negative to make a positive print, and finally it was used to project film by attaching a separate light source.   But, when it comes to developing the film, it&#39;s much more likely that this was carried out in the normal way,  by using vats of chemicals in a dark room, not in the camera.   I think the video is misleading, it should have said the camera could also be used as a film printer, not to develop the film.", "comment_date": "2019-08-08T15:12:30Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"aFkSjdaqbyE": {"The Lumiere Brothers: Crash Course Film History #3": {"channel_id": "Ugy1XYKVSpbJQajkL9p4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Nata Yud", "comment_text": "Wow!

On the one hand I&#39;m very disappointed that the German Skladonowsky brothers&#39;s Bioscop only gets such a small mention when it was a huge step forward in film technology and they held the first commercial public screenings of Europe in Berlin one month before the brothers Lumi\u00e8re, spawning the world&#39;s first commercial film theater (the oldest continuously running movie theater &quot;Pionier 1907&quot; can still be found in former Germany, now Poland).<br>On the other hand, however, their invention was far inferior to the Lumi\u00e8re&#39;s Cin\u00e9matographe and in the end they couldn&#39;t compete because of a lack of financial means and entrepreneurship to improve and market their Bioscop projector.<br>I guess around this time there were so many inventions by so many people and everyone wanted to be the first guy to have invented this awesome piece of technology that you can&#39;t really tell who really made the most important invention that spawned cinema as we know it today. Everyone somehow played an important role in the rise of movies and film theaters.<br>And it makes kinda sense that everyone is a little biased around that topic, so I can see why you would mention tons of &quot;Americans&quot; instead of all the other French, German, English and Scottish (yes, Dickson was a Scotsman after all) inventors of that time who made crucial contributions to the surge of the film industry at that time. But it&#39;s kinda nice to know how they all got inspired by each other to improve their inventions and to take the next step forward.<br>So in the end we should just be happy about that the movie camera and projector were invented and that they could all improve their technologies simultaneously without suing each other like crazy (like Samsung and Apple did e.g.).<br><br>Fun fact: The German word for movie theater (Kino) is directly derived from an abbreviation of the French Cin\u00e9matographe (in Romanian a movie theater is still formally called &quot;cinematograf&quot;) and the Dutch word &quot;bioscoop&quot; [and derived from Dutch: Indonesian (bioskop), Javanese (biyoskup), Sundanese (bioskop)], the Serbian word (\u0411\u0438\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f) and the Croatian word (bioskop) for movie theater are all directly derived from the German Bioscop.

Later this would be done with different emulsions that develop with different specific frequencies of light, and in different colors. the first method I described is Technicolor, and the second is how Polaroids work.
