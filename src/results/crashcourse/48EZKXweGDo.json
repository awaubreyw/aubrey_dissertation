Elections are nothing but a very well written and staged reality TV show, this one is just more intense with plot twists to keep people interested in their show keeping them blind to what really goes on, they even go as far as arresting people who have actually committed crimes, using them in their plot twists making it seem all that much more realistic. Other then all this since 2016 think back as far as you can to all the times and official was caught committing crimes, when I do i remember that regardless how big or deprived the criminal actions were 95% of those crimes resulted in nothing more then asking yes asking that official to resign, 4% of crimes committed by official were made a big story in the news for 1 to 3 days then nothing more said and letting those officials continue to do there jobs without any repercussions and the last 1% are actually charged not because evidence was better against them then all the others but because politically it was beneficial to one of the parties, in most cases Democrats.

My example is my home country, Colombia. For most of the 20th century we had two political parties, left-center and right-center. However, the apparition of a very charismatic independant change things in the begginning of the 21st century, and the left-center party got shattered into 3 parties, and the right-center into another 3. That and the apparition of new independent parties which promote more singular ideas (like environment, or ethics-morality issues) has increased the number to 9 parties with at least one senator. On this landscape, major elections (president, governors, city mayors) usually mean alliances of different parties to promote a particular candidate. In our current local elections, the alliances are determined almost position by position - two parties allied to elect a governor, may have different candidates running for a citiy mayor on that state. <br><br>I think media and technology are primary elements of this fracture. It is way easier for smaller groups to deliver a message to a potential electorate, and to win some key positions. For example, our green party is very much dedicated to elect congressmen and councilmen, but have fewer candidates to run for mayors or governors, they just choose someone to support. I think it might not be impossible to consider that a strong candidate could campaign as a third option in the US in the near future (yeah, maybe Trump, but maybe the election after), and that might create the idea in some elements of the Republican party (who drink tea) to launch their own image.
