All of the Government Workers got paid, everyone got a bonus, the government debt went up, but all nations had the same thing happen, and the one thing economics teaches is, everything is always relative, that&#39;s the constant in economics, when you learn that, the rest is elementary my dear Watson.

And my dad also told me that when he was a kid, his parents would tell him about how they only had one pair of shoes a year. And this lasted from the Depression until the end of WWII.

It was so significant, that it led to the creation of a new branch of economics-Macroeconomics. This event is considered to have been the reason for founding of macroeconomics as a separate branch of economics.<br>The general public mostly associated the Great Depression with the crash in the stock market that occurred in October, 1929. Indeed, stock prices fell dramatically on the day of the crash and the trend continued for several years post that. However, the Great Depression was not just a crash in the financial markets; it was a much bigger event. The crash was a co-symptom of a variety of underlying issues rather than the cause of the depression.<br>The Great Depression is important to understand due to: 1. Its magnitude as a social phenomenon; 2. Its impact on how the world views Macro Economics and 3. It&#39;s importance in changing the role of federal government in the American economy. In the words of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, from their Monetary History of the United States, &quot;The contraction from 1929 to 1933 was by far the most severe business-cycle contraction during the near-century of U.S. history we cover [1867-1960] and it may well have been the most severe in the whole of U.S. history. Though sharper and more prolonged in the United States than in most other countries, it was worldwide in scope and ranks as the most severe and widely diffused international contraction of modern times. U.S. net national product in current prices fell by more than one-half from 1929 to 1933; net national product in constant prices, by more than one-third; implicit prices [a broad index of prices across the economy], by more than one-quarter; and monthly wholesale prices, by more than one-third.&quot; From a social and macroeconomic perspective, the most commonly cited business cycles indicator, the unemployment rate, rose from 3.2% of the labour force in 1929 to 24.9% in 1933. Unemployment fell to 14.3% in 1937, but then increased again to 19.0% in 1938 and was still 9.9% in 1941 before the boost received from military recruitment associated with World War II brought it down to 1.9% in 1943. Real gross national product (output of goods and services) per person only recovered to its original levels of 1929 after 1940. As the above quote suggests, prices kept falling steadily through 1930s as well. Table 1 summarizes some major macroeconomic statistics for the period 1925 to 1940.<br>The Great Depression altered the role of the federal government in America\u2019s economy. Pre<br>Depression, federal government spending accounted for less than 3 percent of GDP while post the event by 1939, federal outlays exceeded 10 percent of GDP. The Great Depression was also the reason for the formation of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), stringent regulations of securities markets, the birth of the Social Security System and the first national minimum wage.<br><br>                                                 CAUSES OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION<br>Economists disagree on what caused The Great Depression- which is why they continue to study it. While many theories have been proposed over the years, there remains no single theory which is universally agreed upon.<br>The 1929 stock market crash is often the first thing that comes to mind when people think of the Great Depression. The crash wiped out considerable wealth, but perhaps what was more important was that it sparked doubts about the health of the economy. This then led consumers and firms to pull back on their spending, especially on big-ticket items like cars and appliances. However, as distressing as the crash was, it was not the sole reason for the Great Depression.<br>Some economists cite the protectionist trade policies and the collapse of international trade as the reason for the Great Depression. The Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930 artificially increased the cost of imported goods and led to retaliatory actions by major trading partners of the United States. This being said, the Great Depression was a worldwide phenomenon, the collapse of international trade was greater than the decline of world output of goods and services. Still, similar to the stock market crash, protectionist trade policies alone did not lead to the Great Depression.<br>Other experts offer different explanations for the Great Depression. Some historians have called the depression an unavoidable failure of capitalism. Others blame the Depression on the \u201cexcesses\u201d of the 1920s: excessive building, excessive production of commodities, excessive spending, excessive financial speculation and excessively skewed distribution of income and wealth. None of these explanations have held up well over time.<br>On the contrary, one explanation that has stood the test of time focuses on the downfall of the U.S. banking system, resulting in the contraction of the nation\u2019s money supply. As money stock fell, consumer spending on goods and services declined, which in turn pushed firms to cut prices, reduce output and lay off workers. The consequent decline in income made it more difficult for borrowers to repay loans. This caused defaults and bankruptcies to soar, creating a vicious spiral in which banks failed, leading to further contraction in the money stock, and continued decline of output, prices and employment.<br>When we think about the stock market crash in parallel to this, the effect is compounded. Stocks lost about three-quarters of their value between October 1929 and 1933. At that time, it was common for investors to borrow money from banks to purchase stocks &quot;on margin&quot; with the value of the stocks as collateral on such loans (Such margin loans are now much more carefully regulated). A sudden collapse in stock prices reduced the value of the collateral, triggering banks to make margin calls where investors were asked to either repay their loans or provide additional collateral. In order to obtain enough liquidity to meet margin requirements, investors attempted to sell their stock, which drove stock prices lower more rapidly in a self-reinforcing spiral. Since many customers were not able to get enough liquidity to make their margin calls, defaults on bank loans soared, leading to a loss in confidence in the banking system.<br>As bank deposits were not insured at that time, the depositor who held an account in a bank that defaulted would not receive any compensation for his loss. This meant that depositors who were able to withdraw their money before it actually closed would be paid in full, while others would get their money back only in part and only after the bank&#39;s remaining assets would be sold. This created a race to be first to the withdrawal window, starting what is called a &quot;run on the bank&quot;.<br>However, banks keep only a small fraction of depositors&#39; money in the form of liquid reserves (vault cash and readily available deposits at the Federal Reserve Banks), while the rest is lent to customers to earn interest or used to purchase interest bearing securities. A run on the bank can use up a bank&#39;s reserves swiftly, forcing it to either (1) sell some of its loans and/or securities immediately for cash, (2) borrow cash , perhaps from the Federal Reserve, or (3) close down, at least temporarily. The securities (and even loans) of a bank are quite liquid (commonly traded, so it is easy to find a willing buyer) during normal times, but during a crisis there are far more sellers in the market than buyers. If a bank is forced to sell into a distressed market, they may get very low prices for the assets they sell. If they sell assets at a loss, the bank\u2019s situation worsens and may push it over the edge into insolvency - the bank&#39;s liabilities exceed its assets causing it to fail.<br>When the Federal Reserve System was founded in 1913, its primary mission was to provide an &quot;elastic currency&quot; by acting as a &quot;lender of last resort&quot; for banks, lending through the &quot;discount window&quot; by purchasing their loans and securities for cash when the banks faced runs and needed liquidity. However, during the Great Depression the stringent rules put in place by the Fed on the securities it would accept as collateral disabled banks from avoiding a bank run. Between 1929 and 1933, bank failures became so common that the number of commercial banks operating in the United States fell by over one-third.<br>                                          RECOVERY FROM THE DEPRESSION<br>The monetary damage experienced during the Great Depression finally ended when President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared a national bank holiday just one day after he took office in March 1933. Roosevelt ordered all banks to close, including the Federal Reserve banks. He permitted them to reopen only after they received a government license. Meanwhile, the federal government set up a temporary system of federal deposit insurance and a year later followed up by creating the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and a permanent deposit insurance system.<br>Roosevelt\u2019s policies reinstated confidence in the banking system, and money poured back into the banks. Money supply began to increase, which in turn increased spending, production as well as leading to a rise in prices. Economic recovery was slow, but the bottom had been reached and good times were in sight.<br>History books credit Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal as the beginning of the economic recovery from the Great Depression. Under the New Deal, the government put in place many programs of relief and recovery that employed thousands of people and made direct cash grants or loans to individuals, firms and local governments. However, in the first few years of the New Deal, federal government spending did not increase significantly.<br>Thanks.", "comment_date": "2017-10-21T09:26:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Matthews", "comment_text": "So basically if life sucks for the poor it&#39;s par for the course but the second life starts sucking for the rich we have to redefine entire historical periods as &#39;The Great Depression&#39;", "comment_date": "2017-10-19T10:54:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "almightymina taur", "comment_text": "Im just seeing this because of some dank meme Instagram post showing squid ward asking for spare change with the 2 words, Great Depression.

The way it is presented seems to say that the tariff was enacted before Hoover came to power and he did little in response. <br>In reality, Hoover was the president that signed the bill into law. <br>------<br>The notion that the US keeping the gold standard while European nations dissolved does not thereby mean economic calamity took place in response. The fact that the US didn&#39;t lose the gold standard like other nations did is a main reason why global trade is conducted in US dollars today rather than another currency. While the value of the US dollar would remain stable, foreign nations that pursued inflationary economic policy would see the value of their currency change wildly since their currency was not representative of any tangible thing. <br>-------<br>The notion that Hoover did nothing to avert the depression is simply wrong. He fought companies who were trying to marginally reduce wages in response to the economic situation. Rather than letting the market balance itself, he insisted upon intervening to maintain wages. He forced companies to pay higher wages which made it almost impossible for the US private sector to sell their goods. The prices for US goods went up in response which made it that much harder for American business to compete on the global scale. Yes, American worker wages remained steady. However, once American business&#39; were bankrupted the former wage earners had no job at all. <br>------<br>The problem isn&#39;t that Hoover didn&#39;t try to have enough influence. The problem is that he tried far to hard to influence the situation. He knew that private business&#39; were the best way out of the situation. Rather than leaving them to their own devices he continually meddled in their operations. Had he gotten the hell out of the way the US would have been able to rebound from recession just as it had in the past. Yes, the rebound would not be instantaneous. However, it would be steady and have a great deal of longevity. <br>------<br>The Revenue Act of 1932 did not &#39;arguably&#39; make the situation worse. IT DID make the situation worse. It jacked up taxes and most notably the top rate went from 25% to 63%. New investments in industry that would be necessary to work out of the recession were stopped cold in their tracks. The rich that otherwise would have built new business&#39; and developed new technologies said to hell with it since their profit motive had been taken away.<br>------<br>Yes, by 1932 the depression was already under way. The tariff Hoover had placed had decimated nearly every sector of American industry. Once the industries fell the rest of the economic sectors collapsed as well. <br>------<br>Roosevelt then rode into town and spent an extreme amount on public works projects, but also vast welfare systems and brand new concept of the military industrial concept. All three of these areas have grown far out of proportion and are currently crippling the US economy with the resulting exponential growth in the national debt.", "comment_date": "2017-05-15T05:37:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FlyingMonkey", "comment_text": "lol this video is really helpful but he talks so fast!

If this is indeed your claim I will have to respectfully disagree as the basic premise behind this is laughable. first off the Hoover administration did do an economic stimulus package in which, among a large number of other things, the Hoover dam was built. The major misconception about Hoover comes from an ideological stance based on his political party, basically most people think that because he was a Republican he was not into public economic spending and the expansion of government. This thinking however is false, Hoover adamantly believed that the only way out of the great depression was  engineering the economy through government spending, which was a horrible idea keeping us in the depression. As for the federal reserve bailing out banks, we have the perfect example of why that is a horrible idea in 2008 when then President Obama bailed out the banks, citing that they are to big to fail, which is a fallacy. Nothing is to big to fail, if the banks had failed smaller banks would have purchased all of the toxic assets creating a decent number of smaller banks instead of a handful of obscenely large banks. Yes all of Obama&#39;s banking friends would have had to sulk back to the Hamptions with their tails between their legs but the banking industry wouldn&#39;t have taken the huge hit on trust it took and sound investments would have helped the economy. The only thing that would have ended the great depression would have been the government to leave it alone and let the free market fix and reregulate itself.

That collusion existed at the highest ranks of society in setting up and knocking down folks by promoting credit and installment buying, and subsequently threatening disaster through major media to manipulate stock market confidence, is fairly well established.  Legally, as is ever the case, the barn doors of Financial Law were closed after the horses were already long gone.  The 1% benefited marvelously from the misery of those beneath them . . . just like they&#39;d planned all along.<br><br>We, as a nation, were still broke, as WW1 financing and profiteering proved too deleterious for our otherwise flexible system.  The 1929 crash was malice with forethought.  All those foreclosed properties were scooped up by the 1% for pennies on the dollar.  This had the long term effect that the Rural Electrification Act did not benefit the stricken hardscrabble citizen farmers it was meant for.  Wealthy folks, advised in advance by unethical leaks from the big banks, grabbed all the property as soon as the banks rather precipitously foreclosed on property all across the nation--but strangely focused in the Dust Bowl area.  Now those ultra-wealthy families have free telephone and electricity in perpetuity.  Pretty sweet deal for the entitled--eh?  I wonder why they don&#39;t mention it in the news?  Or in our tragically underfunded public schools?<br><br><br>To show how deep the misconceptions go, may I addend this bit of our favorite source, Wikipedia, on the topic?<br>Here&#39;s what the Wiki says--<br><br>&quot;Merchants of death was an epithet used in the U.S. in the 1930s to attack industries and banks that supplied and funded World War I (then called the Great War). The term originated as the title of a book by H. C. Engelbrecht and F. C. Hanighen, Merchants of Death (1934), an expos\u00e9. The term was popular in antiwar circles of both the left and the right, and was used extensively regarding the Senate hearings in 1936 by the Nye Committee.[1]<br><br>The Senate hearing examined how much influence the manufacturers of armaments had in the American decision to enter WWI. 93 hearings were held, over 200 witnesses were called, and little hard evidence was found. The Nye Committee came to an end when Chairman Nye accused President Woodrow Wilson of withholding information from Congress when he chose to enter WWI. The failure of the committee to find a conspiracy did not change public prejudice again the manufactures of armaments, thus the popular name &quot;Merchants of death&quot;. See the United States Senate, Senate History page.&quot;<br><br>Notice that this says nothing about the profiteering of our arms and armaments manufacturers while we were NEUTRAL?  We sold arms--and raw supplies--to BOTH sides, making money hand over fist, gradually causing the Great Depressions all across the world thereby.  Our 1% so profited by sales of armaments during the 1914-1917 period that the Senate&#39;s exclusionary focus on our actual, literal, Military contribution (which was infinitesimal on the Grand Scale) is nothing but disinformation.<br><br>And now for my personal belief: <br><br>We caused the depression.  More precisely, our 1% profiteered impossibly well on the chaos of WW1, those in it created the Stock Market Crash, caused the great depression, and, for the most part, pursued a strategy meant to create those events as opportunities for further financial windfalls . . . like heroin addicts, once they had the taste of wild profits, they could never go back to the way it had been before.<br><br><br>If you took time to read this you are a very kind and, likely, open minded, individual.

You could blame the start of the great depression on the failure of banks but more importantly - why did they start failing? The truth is the deflationary forces and the bank failures were caused by bad debt. You briefly touched on this but many loans for new items and new industry were created and spent as new money using the new &quot;fractional reserve banking system&quot;. The bank failures happened because the banks made loans that people could never pay back. The natural result of these loans failing and the debt (another word for money in this case) disappearing from the economic system was deflation. To paraphrase Hayek, Malinvestment was the problem. The additional printing of money and cheap loans by the Federal Reserve does nothing to help the poor but increases the wealth gap. This&#39;ll be a little more complicated so bear with me. When the Fed infuses money into the economy they do so mainly by creating extremely low interest rate loans and encouraging lending (see, debt is money). This type of &quot;soft landing&quot; (the phrase most often used by Keynesians) to avoid deflation hands out cheap money to those who can borrow at the cost of inflation. In other words, those who already have assets can expand their existing assets by using market derivative or margin investments at the low point of the economy. This also created the seven year debt cycle as all loans or &quot;debt money&quot; are just borrowing against future income. In order for expansion there always has to be a deleveraging\u00a0period where debt is destroyed for the creation of more debt. I&#39;ll avoid writing an entire book here but please understand the federal government cannot solve all problems and did nothing to help during the great depression. They made things much worse by prolonging the deleveraging period and creating future deleveraging periods in the debt cycle.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-09-20T15:46:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aesedai Annabon", "comment_text": "Some of his videos are great but he could not be more off base in this one. Prior to the Federal Reserve there were several periods of deflation that were actually a huge plus to the economy (usually in deflationary periods consumption, in real terms, would go up since falling prices meant the dollar went further - basically it should feel like everything is on sale). One of his main problems is in examining the depression overly from the bust side (a common practice even today). \u00a0The reality is that with a central bank you have artificial booms created by fiat creation of capital. \u00a0During the periods of boom you have malinvestment... meaning the market is being triggered with low interest rates to start long term projects (in a free market this would mean that peoples preferences are switching to saving or delaying consumption and thus there are freed up resources that can be used to complete long term projects). \u00a0Unfortunately at the same time consumer credit is doing the opposite of what needs to happen in order for the long term projects to succeed (ie. both longer term projects and shorter term consumption-oriented projects are scrambling for the same finite resources AND consumers are falling deeper into debt making it unlikely that they will be able to afford all the long term projects spurred on by the low interest rates).<br><br>I will say he does try and \u00a0give an even viewpoint but I think he just doesn&#39;t understand free market economics. The government has been massively intervening in the economy since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1914... he is right that the depression started because of lack of capital but that is the nature of a central bank - it floods the market (or an industry - as in the tech boom of the 90&#39;s) and cuts it off when it sees fit and crashes everything... insiders that know what is coming (cough: Goldman Sachs) make billions off of this.<br><br>Two more things he gets way off:<br><br>1) Herbert Hoover WAS A LEFTIST! The previous too presidents were on the right (Calvin Coolidge and Harding who both had to live with the Federal Reserve but Harding pushed for DEFLATION which actually helped to end the recession of 1920 and kept it from becoming a depression). Hoover was trying to control the economy whereas his two predecessors did what they could to stay out of the way.<br><br>2) YOU CAN NOT BLAME ANDREW JACKSON!!!!

Business stimulated to the most unhealthy activity; a vast amount of over production in the mechanick arts; a vast amount of speculation in property of every kind and name, at fictitious values; and finally, a vast and terrifick crash, when the treacherous and unsubstantial basis crumbles beneath the stupendous fabrick of credit, and the structure falls to the ground, burying in its ruins thousands who exulted in the fancied security of their elevation. Men, now-a-days, go to bed deeming themselves rich, and wake in the morning to find themselves stripped of even the little they really had. They count, deluded creatures! on the continued liberality of the banks, whose persuasive entreaties seduced them into the slippery paths of speculation. But they have now to learn that the banks cannot help them if they would, and would not if they could. They were free enough to lend their aid when assistance was not needed; but now, when it is indispensable to carry out the projects which would not have been undertaken but for the temptations they held forth, no further resources can be supplied. The banks must take care of themselves. \u201cCharity begins at home.\u201d The course of trade is turning against the country. We have purchased more commodities abroad than our products will pay for, and the balance will soon be called for in specie. The banks, which lately vied with one another in effusing their notes, are now as eager competitors in withdrawing them from circulation, and preparing for the anticipated shock. They have no time to listen to the prayers of the deluded men whom their deceitful lures seduced so far upon the treacherous sea of credit. They cast them adrift without remorse and leave them to encounter, unaided and unprepared, the fury of the gathering tempest. Or should, perchance, some tender hearted moneychanger relent, and consent to tow a few victims into harbour, is it unreasonable that he should charge wrecker\u2019s fees for the service\u2014half the cargo and twenty per cent commissions on the remainder?
