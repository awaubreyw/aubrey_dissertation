Another question, &#39;Was there really an unexplained loss of 9 Trillion Dollars from the Federal Reserve?&#39; Is there insurance to cover the loss just like the citizens $250,000.00 worth of FDIC insurance. Is there loan insurance to cover the 21 Trillion Dollar debt? All the government has to do is lie and say they formulated the loan to be spread out the country over in the names of each citizen through The Corporation of America and require the use of the FDIC insurance amount. They can lie again and say they used the money for emergency purposes or any lie that would work. But who is the private corrupt government accountable to?

You are not allowed to murder, rape, steal, commit fraud, or otherwise infringe on another individual&#39;s rights to their own person/property. Government protects against such infringements through law enforcement, a justice system, and a military. Everything else should be left to the people to decide for themselves. Social security, health care, social welfare, education, etc. should all be privatized (or at least left to individual states). We should eliminate all illegitimate spending will temporarily keeping taxes constant. We would use that excess revenue to pay off the national debt. And then I would also want to eliminate all federal taxes and replace them with a single flat consumption tax that has one of the least negative impacts on economic growth of any tax and would be fair to everyone. Also, there would be certain exceptions on staple food items so as to not disadvantage the poor. Putting numbers to this, our national debt is now about $20 trillion. The 2015 budget had a total revenue of $3.8 trillion ($583 billion was borrowing; deficit). The military is by far the largest of these few legitimate roles at about $598 billion. Including federal law enforcement and justice system, let&#39;s put the total required revenue for legitimate expenditures\u00a0at about $700 billion. That leaves $2.517 trillion per year to pay off the national debt ($3.8 trillion minus $700 billion minus $583 billion; no more adding to the debt). $20 trillion divided by $2.517 trillion means we would eliminate the national debt in 7.95 years (about two presidential terms). After eliminating illegitimate roles of government and the national debt, we would then eliminate all federal taxes and replace them with a single flat consumption tax. Americans spend about $10.7 trillion per year. With exemptions on staple food items let&#39;s say only $8 trillion of that is actually taxed. $700 billion (needed revenue) divided by $8 trillion (taxable spending) means there would only be a single flat federal consumption tax of 8.75%. Also, further making these legitimate roles more efficient and effective would mean we could further decrease this tax rate. To start, I don&#39;t believe we should be involved in any nation we are not currently at war with. That means we shouldn&#39;t have foreign military bases that we spend over $150 billion/year to maintain. $700 billion minus $150 billion means we already brought the needed revenue down to $550 billion. $550 billion divided by $8 trillion means the tax rate would now be about 6.88%.", "comment_date": "2016-07-03T04:25:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fake Apple Store", "comment_text": "It&#39;s Jacob!", "comment_date": "2016-06-26T02:06:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saili", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sUCSGVYzI0&amp;t=1m50s\">1:50</a> what about avogadro&#39;s number<br>lol it&#39;s in the sextillions<br>~602 sextillion", "comment_date": "2016-06-26T00:17:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryce", "comment_text": "MIND BLOWN!

Yes countries like China and Japan also own a lot of US debt, but that&#39;s for simple currency conversions. They basically don&#39;t have a choice.
