In one way or another all of our lives and actions have a small effect on everyone else\u2019s and we don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. So if you don\u2019t care that others don\u2019t exist that in turn simply means you shouldn\u2019t want to exist because even if you omit everyone you are still part of everyone\u2019s life. Just not a productive part. As harsh as it sounds if that\u2019s your mindset the you might as rush to the finish line of life if you know what I mean. <br><br>When people ask why they should do anything for the greater good I can\u2019t explain it but it\u2019s really a question of \u201cYour life is not about you. Otherwise there would be no importance in interacting with other people. Life is about us.\u201d The Bible teaches a certain way to treat people because if everyone treats one another that way we will all basically be trying to make one another\u2019s life better with little concern for ourselves. That\u2019s the closest to Heaven the world could get us if everyone cared just enough to make another person smile. If life was just solely about the individual then what does it matter when they die? But as we know when someone dies it matters very much because emotionally there is a connection and understanding between humans that is forged wether or not you live your life to yourself or with others just because of the way we are psychologically. A beautiful way to think about it (at least in the USA) is that if two people are looking at one another it\u2019s not until one person talks a different language do we think we can\u2019t understand them. Before that point all we know is that we are both people with emotions and what we do (or don\u2019t do) can have an impact on those emotions and it\u2019s really not up to us how the other reacts but we do both know that even if one speaks Slavic and the other English we are both here and by acknowledging that we realize that the stories our life at that moment isn\u2019t about ourselves. When we cross paths whether it\u2019s being told about the person or actually seeng the person, for this brief moment these people are apart of one another\u2019s lives. A deer in the woods may know little to nothing of what other animals or humans are near. Their scope is fairly small when it comes to life but humans are vastly aware of the entire planet for the most part. That\u2019s what our life is about. Like our story in a book, us and everything we are aware of are written on those pages making them apart of our story in one way or another. If you want life to be good then what\u2019s on those pages should matter because even if you don\u2019t care and you take yourself out of the story you are still trapped in someone else\u2019s story as tragic as that sounds. At least take advantage of that as a competent individual or you begin to fall below the line of what makes humans remarkable and thus become less human in a sense when you don\u2019t care about anything. <br><br>You might as well watch people be burned <br>alive whilst saying \u201cwhy should it matter to me?\u201d I\u2019m a Christian so I will mention another thing in the Bible that basically mentions that choosing not to take action when you know something is wrong is the same as being more okay with what\u2019s happening then having to actually stop it. Therefore to know if a crime and a solution and do nothing makes you just as guilty as the person who commits the crime. Bible also says not to get too comfortable in life because discomfort is what drives humans forward. If we were comfortable we wouldn\u2019t want anything better. So if that\u2019s your reason not taking action that\u2019s just lazy and you too are falling beneath us as humans. <br><br>Sorry for the rant.

This video helped me flesh out some rationale so I won&#39;t lose my mind about not giving away every cent I own:<br>1) Saving the money for college allows me to pursue a career that would help more families and possibly prevent children&#39;s suffering in the long run.<br>2) After experiencing life-altering health issues that cause my suffering, I need to save everything I have to help prevent my own agony while I convalesce.<br>3) Giving more than I already have would leave me in poverty, too, as I have very little to donate now.

Yes, I would have saved the girl, of course, but I\u2019m still regularly not donating to charity (I\u2019m only 14 y/o, so I think that will have to wait). However, every time our family goes to the grocery store, which we do a couple of times every month, we give the poor (often, but not always, Romani) girl or boy sitting outside 5 or 10 Swedish Crowns (\u00bd and \u20ac1 respectively). Why can\u2019t we just donate 30 kr every month to UNIFEC instead? That is a good question. I do believe geographical relation has a lot to do with morality and who we care about, especially whether we see them or not. Maybe it\u2019s also a bit law science? I mean, the citizens of the European Union should put their main focus on helping poor European citizens, despite being relative few, instead of citizens of African countries, right? Maybe it\u2019s also a question of responsibility: we are first and foremost responsible to our poor fellow citizens of the country, then to citizens of the European Union, and then to other poor people, like to them living in Africa. There are ready few rich people in Africa who can help the poor citizens if they want to: the leader, presidents and what not. They can help, but not everyone wants to help. Look at this <b>Yahya Jammeh</b>, who basically robbed his country before fleeing. <br>   Lastly, if these presidents really do not have any money to help their poor residents, then they should get help from other countries, like the countries of the Europe and the USA. However, collecting this money through private donation is a far too tedious process. To maximize the effect of donating to the less fortunate poor people, one should raise the taxes and give to a determined percentage of the public exchequer to organizations helping the poor, assuming they provide a guarantee that the money will not be misused and go to filthy warlords and chefs instead.<br><br>Also, thanks for the video, John and Hank Green!", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T07:52:56Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"D5sknLy7Smo": {"Poverty & Our Response to It: Crash Course Philosophy #44": {"channel_id": "UggIqU9uEmM0u3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jsmes Wagner", "comment_text": "why does it come down to my money..why aren&#39;t drug companies giving the medecine..why are they waiting around to place guilt on people who can&#39;t get their to help..there are billionaires who can get on their jets and fly there and fix the problem...but they still have to wait for the meds or food..", "comment_date": "2017-03-16T08:35:12Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"D5sknLy7Smo": {"Poverty & Our Response to It: Crash Course Philosophy #44": {"channel_id": "Ugikbg2-r5hCCHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Edgewalker001", "comment_text": "There are a couple of very morally wrong questions to ask however.

We were made in God&#39;s image in that his main quality is love and we were made able to imitate his qualities.<br><br>(1 John 4:7) Beloved ones, let us continue loving one another, because love is from God,<br><br>(Col 3:7-10,12-14) In those very things you, too, once walked when you used to live in them. 8 But now really put them all away from you, wrath, anger, badness, abusive speech, and obscene talk out of your mouth. 9 Do not be lying to one another.

Teaching a man to fish rather than just giving him a fish, and all that. &#39;Course, it takes time to learn and master a new skill, so you need a little of column A, a little of column B. <br><br>Harm reduction, education, a chance to become self-sustaining; being able to build yourself a boat is a good start. After all, the people with a boat built theirs, it&#39;s not like boats just pop into existence out of nothing, it was hard work and understanding of boat building that got them there. Everyone gets help when they start out, be they nations or individuals. We all sink or swim depending on how well we&#39;re nurtured while we mature. Getting the ball rolling by having an ace fisher give a newbie one of their spare fish while showing the newbie the ropes will help tide that newbie over until they start reeling in their own meals. <br><br>As for giving handouts, there&#39;s a lot of unknowns that can make oneself suspicious. Something that may make one think twice before giving aid of the give-a-fish kind in the first place, especially to a complete stranger they can&#39;t get to know directly, is that one never can tell if the person in need is actually in need. In fact, in big cities like San Francisco I personally know that there are perfectly capable people who pretend to be beggars simply because it&#39;s easier to sit around waiting for handouts than actually putting in effort. After seeing it first-hand, I can&#39;t help but be skeptical of those who genuinely seem to be in need, and that skepticism spills over to one&#39;s impression of charities, as well. <br><br>Unless oneself has the time to get personally familiar with each and every person in need to assure they&#39;re actually in need, and that they&#39;ll use the handout to its fullest potential, and to then begin helping to teach that person how to care for themselves, you can&#39;t be sure that you&#39;re doing anything to help. In fact, without harm-reduction programs, any drug-addicted peoples in need will likely end up squandering their handouts on a self-perpetuating cycle of drug addiction rather than the essentials they should be concerned about (food, shelter, medical attention, etc.). And, sure, there&#39;s the argument of giving to charities, but the same skepticism applies in that you can&#39;t be sure that the money is actually going toward doing the most good. There&#39;s too many wheels in this machine, you can&#39;t keep an eye on it, and blind faith in people is just asking for trouble.", "comment_date": "2017-02-05T22:08:25Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"D5sknLy7Smo": {"Poverty & Our Response to It: Crash Course Philosophy #44": {"channel_id": "UggCv-GMmkVQhXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "alvarojose22", "comment_text": "do abortion", "comment_date": "2017-02-05T20:07:55Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"D5sknLy7Smo": {"Poverty & Our Response to It: Crash Course Philosophy #44": {"channel_id": "Ugg4ivHrG-nbCngCoAEC", "comment_by": "The Geekpublican", "comment_text": "I think people should morally give.

The question of whether to save the child should not be thought of in such callous terms as cost-benefit analysis. When you see someone suffering, you don&#39;t stop to consider their value, either to society, the economy, their family, or otherwise. You imagine yourself in the child&#39;s place and imagine how awful you&#39;d feel, and morality compels you to help. You know you can, so you do it. And, you know that mud washes off, especially if you clean your shoes quickly. I know all this because I&#39;ve done it - it was a neighbor&#39;s dog, but it was being carried down the river, and I jumped in to save it. I did kick off my shoes first, because I could. No laces = time saved. I also set aside my phone and wallet. No reason to get my credit cards wet. But, my point is, the cost-benefit analysis is nothing compared to the emotional reward of doing the right thing, and making a positive impact on the world. You&#39;re lucky when life gives you these opportunities to act.<br><br>Now, how is this different from helping someone halfway around the world? There are three salient factors that Singer ignores: trust, scope, and time. When I see a child, or dog, who needs help, I make a split decision, I spend a few minutes of my life helping, and I see my impact immediately, as I carry the wet dog home to his family. When I\u2019m asked to give money to charity\u2026 I have to trust that someone really is in need halfway around the world, I have to trust that the charity involved really will help these needy people (the Red Cross has a poor record of using funds efficiently), I have to trust that needed supplies won\u2019t be stolen by some warlord, and I have to trust that while this temporary aid is given, that someone out there will work to improve the situation so that I won\u2019t have to keep giving indefinitely. This requires a great amount of trust \u2013 in large numbers of people I\u2019ve never met. And then there\u2019s scope. There isn\u2019t just one needy kid in the world, there are millions of them. Three dollars buys just one net. As a teacher in central Europe, I don\u2019t make that much money, and there\u2019s no way I could buy nets for everyone who needs one, as much as I\u2019d like to. Let me win the lottery one day, and boy-oh-boy, nets for all! So, when countries need millions of dollars, and church fundraisers just won\u2019t do, that\u2019s when I say, this scope requires organized intervention beyond simple charity. It requires government assistance, and this aid has to be more than money, because throwing money at problems is never enough. There has to be effective strategy. It can\u2019t all depend on me.<br>This is where time comes in. The amount of time required for me to be an active humanitarian, to raise money, to contact my political representatives, to protest and write chain letters begging everyone around me to change laws and agree to work as a nation to help others \u2013 this becomes a full-time job. I can\u2019t just jump in some mud and save the entire world. I would if I could. So, if Singer doesn\u2019t recognize these huge factors, that\u2019s not right.<br><br>On the other hand, this Hardin fellow\u2026 If your boat has room for ten more, then you should bring on ten more people. If that\u2019s the boat\u2019s maximum capacity, then filling it to capacity shouldn\u2019t endanger anyone else onboard the boat \u2013 if it does, then blame the boat designers, not the victims sitting on it. How do you choose whom to save? First come, first serve basis. Does that leave a woman or child left drowning? You could leave it to people in the boat to sacrifice themselves to save another \u2013 of course, there\u2019s also the trouble of them clamboring to get in, and having to keep a healthy distance. You could also argue that two-three children equal one adult in terms of weight, if you really want to get ethical about it.

The argument seems to be that, in each specific instance of opportunity to help, if cost is low and benefit is high, you must help. The false equivalence seems to be in equating &#39;low&#39; with &#39;zero&#39;. Certainly if there is actually zero cost to me, then it could be argued that I am morally obligated; however, life is not a single action. My life will consist of many such opportunities to help people at low cost for high benefit, after all; the error is that adding up a lot of low costs does not guarantee the total cost is low.<br><br> (This can be illustrated in defining a &#39;small number&#39; as a number which is greater than zero but intuitively &#39;small&#39;. This is analogous to how we define moral concepts - intuitively, rather than discretely. 1 is certainly a small number, as is 2. Adding 1 to a small number should not affect whether or not it is small. When speaking in terms of hard numbers, it becomes obvious that if you add 1 enough times, you will eventually get a number like a billion, which is clearly not small, but you can never pinpoint where it stopped being small along the way, due to your intuitive definition of &#39;small&#39;.)<br><br>So, the question is, am I required, morally, to help people so long as the total cost of my help is &#39;low&#39; in some definition? And low compared to my own means, or low compared to the value of the benefit they receive, or both? At what point and I morally allowed to stop helping, because the cost stops being &#39;low&#39;, when each individual help is &#39;low&#39;? Clearly I cannot afford to help every single person in extreme poverty by myself, even if nobody else anywhere is helping; but since each individual person has low cost to the benefit of a saved life, I am individually morally obligated to each of them, by Singer&#39;s argument.<br><br>This is not to say that &#39;we can&#39;t help everyone so we shouldn&#39;t help anyone&#39;. That is clearly not a useful answer... but at the same time, any line we draw as to &#39;when is it enough&#39; will seem arbitrary at best. &#39;When you have given enough cost that to give any more would significantly negatively impact you&#39; is an intuitive answer - but when is it significant?

The reason was ecological: humans, like any other animal, tend to multiply until they reach their environment&#39;s carrying capacity, that is, the number of individuals that a given environment can support. Humans are the only animal who can be induced NOT to do this by artificial (but important) cultural/economic/political factors, which is why SOME human groups (specifically, those in the developed world) reproduce less than others (specifically, those in the developing world). In the absence of such factors, a human group (like any other animal group) will increase in number not just TO the environment&#39;s carrying capacity, but BEYOND it, meaning that those who cannot feed themselves or get fed or stay healthy or whatever suffer and die and bring the numbers back down. This mechanism is the only non-arbitrary one that can limit a group&#39;s numbers. This is like a law of ecology, from which we like to imagine we&#39;re exempt since we like to imagine we&#39;re not animals. But anyway, when we in the developed world send food aid to the developing world, we increase the carrying capacity of a given environment, which, at least in the long term, results not in better-fed individuals but in more individuals who are just as poorly-fed as the earlier ones. So, feeding starving people creates more starving people. The argument, as I remember it, was not against all aid; it upped the priority of things like contraception and healthcare, but also called for infrastructural improvements like better roads and internet connections. Supposedly, this would increase the struggling people&#39;s quality of life without increasing the number of people, and was thus more humane from a utilitarian perspective.

Just because I live in a wealthy nation does not make ME wealthy. Assume I live from paycheck to paycheck on minimum wage, using government assistance for housing, food, and healthcare. In the drowning child analogy, wouldn&#39;t this be similar to me seeing the child but not being able to swim, myself? Do I have a moral obligation to swim out to save the child, or to donate my income, merely because I&#39;m from a wealthy country, and I&#39;m aware the child is drowning--or is my obligation limited because of my lack of personal wealth?<br><br>2) How much giving is sufficient to satisfy my moral obligation? Now assume I am wealthy, with $100 million in assets at my disposal, and an annual income of $10 million. Assume the government takes away 25% of my income each year, and I always choose to give away another 25% to charitable organizations and foundations, whose stated goal is to eradicate worldwide poverty. Thus, I give away $5 million every year to help people in my own country as well as people in other lands. My charity potentially saves the lives of millions of people every year (although I&#39;m not directly involved in it, so I don&#39;t know--and if I WERE directly involved, I would cease making so much money), but still millions more starve, while I am left with $5 million in income annually and $100 million in assets. Have I done enough, or do I have a moral obligation to do more? What if one year I give half of my assets to charity? What if one year I give all $10 million of my income to charity, and I live on my remaining assets? What if I give 90% of my income to charity every year and live on $1 million? Is any of this sufficient? The poverty does NOT stop...children are still &quot;drowning&quot; in poverty. And one person could argue that giving away 90% of my income is great cost to myself, while someone else could argue that it is not a great cost, because I still have millions of dollars at my disposal--more than 99.9% of the world. When does my moral obligation to give cease? (I would change the drowning child analogy in this case: Imagine there are 100 children drowning in the shark-infested beach waters. I am the only one who can see them drowning. I swim out and rescue ten over the course of an hour, but it seems that ten more appear on the horizon--there are always more drowning children. I&#39;m exhausted, but I may have a little more energy. How many more am I morally obligated to save?)<br><br>Of course, most Americans are somewhere in between the extremes presented in 1) and 2), but both ethical questions apply to each American. Should every American give, as long as they, themselves, are not living in poverty? How much are they obligated to give?<br><br>3) Who has the ethical right to decide how much I am obligated to give, and is it ethical for them to force me to give the amount they decide? Does any person or government have the ethical right to take my property from me by force and give it to someone else? What if the person taking my property uses a large portion of it for building weapons or morally reprehensible actions? Does their right to my property change if they actually have a feasible plan to end poverty with it? And what if they don&#39;t have such a plan?<br><br>Neither of the analogies presented in this video seem very useful to the moral question of helping the poverty stricken.<br><br>Perhaps this analogy is better: There are 1000 people drowning in the ocean around a cruise ship that has 5000 people and enough food and supplies for everyone--paid for by the passenger&#39;s ticket fare. However, of the 5000 people on the ship, only 50 passengers really know how to swim enough to save multiple lives. Another 250 could probably save one life. The remaining people would drown if they jumped into the ocean to save someone. There are no life boats; the cruise line regularly spends all its income (and much, much more) on food, healthcare, and weapons for those on board. They have no plan to save 1000 drowning people around the boat. Who is morally obligated to jump into the ocean to save the 1000 drowning people? The 50 expert swimmers? The 250 strong swimmers? All 5000 passengers? When does their moral obligation end? After they have each rescued one person? After they have rescued as many people as they personally can--and drown in the attempt? Are the passengers morally obligated to pay MORE money to the cruise line, demanding that the cruise line build life boats--but knowing full well that the cruise line will just spend the money on gun turrets? Can the cruise line FORCE the passengers to jump into the water to rescue the drowning people? Can the cruise line FORCE the passengers to pay a higher fare (or jump off) so that they can build life boats?What if they have no intention of building said boats?", "comment_date": "2017-01-31T20:50:57Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"D5sknLy7Smo": {"Poverty & Our Response to It: Crash Course Philosophy #44": {"channel_id": "UgiOFrFpBZr29ngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Luyang Han", "comment_text": "I think it is not fair to say &quot;We didn&#39;t make them poor&quot;.", "comment_date": "2017-01-31T20:50:20Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"D5sknLy7Smo": {"Poverty & Our Response to It: Crash Course Philosophy #44": {"channel_id": "UgjDnWqYeHCVt3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Dwight E morgan", "comment_text": "&quot;the poor will always be with us&quot; Jesus.", "comment_date": "2017-01-31T20:48:32Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"D5sknLy7Smo": {"Poverty & Our Response to It: Crash Course Philosophy #44": {"channel_id": "UghSbME2C8JjB3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Daniel Hall", "comment_text": "&quot;We easily have enough resources to solve world poverty.&quot;<br>Actually, that depends on your definition of poverty, a popular definition now days is define the poverty line as a fraction of the median wage.

The other one is that the kid is starving because of complex reasons, not from a single accident or catastrophe. People can relate less, because an accident or a natural disaster is more likely to hit us than famine caused by the combination of overpopulation, poor natural resources, corrupt and uncaring leadership.<br>Helping someone once has closure. Sustaining others don&#39;t, and raises much more moral questions. Let&#39;s assume, the world decides to end hunger completely. There will be a 2% worldwide tax on everyone to contribute. Now that kid has something to eat. Something. The kid just barely lives. Isn&#39;t it our moral obligation to lift him/her up from that? Then they introduce another, say 4% tax, so the kid has access to sanitation. But isn&#39;t it our moral obligation that the kid should have proper medical care as well? OK? let&#39;s increase our taxes by 10% because medical care is so damn expensive. And now you pay 16% in taxes, but the kid in Africa has food, clean water and medical care.

Sure there is plenty of wealth out there, but what of food, water, land, etc? My thought was that in the future,  our human population on earth may be reaching capacity. Saving all human life, Hardin says, is counter-intuitive to living systems- once an animal reaches the capacity of its environment, its population declines so that its environment can then manage it again.

Capitalism is built on the idea that workers should be proportionately rewarded for their effort, and they should be able to choose how that reward is spent themselves. If someone sees no reason they should personally sacrifice their hard-earned resources for something that seemingly doesn&#39;t benefit them in any way (or at least not to a sufficient enough degree), it&#39;s their right to decline helping. I would argue that there actually are completely valid reasons to help them even if some people don&#39;t see them. <br>For example, Healthcare. If someone gets sick, why should your money go towards paying for their treatment? You don&#39;t know them, you may have a different purpose in mind for how you wanted to spend that money, why can&#39;t they use their own resources to pay for their own treatment? Even if you did help them, what do you get out of it? <br>Medical treatment is very expensive, few people can pay for it themselves. Also, I&#39;d argue that you do actually get something out of helping, two somethings in fact. 1) No one who lives in a developed nation can live on their own power. You have customers who buy the goods or services of your company to give you money, you buy food from grocery stores or restaurants that need many employees to run it, you need vehicle manufacturers to provide your transportation, you need architects and construction workers to build all the buildings they&#39;re all in, etc. You are one of a complex network of many jobs that all intertwine and depend on each other to function as a society. If too many of those people are taken out of the workforce due to serious health issues, that makes society less functional, which tangentially effects your everyday life. It is in your best interest to make sure as many people are in as workable a condition as possible, it allows the society you depend on to remain dependable. 2) when you are eventually afflicted by a health issue, the same courtesy is extended back to you. <br>As for how that ties in to helping those of separate societies, those societies may not be as separate as you think. Nations all over the world import and export with each other, there are many international companies, there are many nations that only are what they are today because they are either current or former colonies of other nations or otherwise foreign influence, etc. 3rd world countries have potential to become just as stable and productive as any other nation, but they can&#39;t due to issues that have a prerequisite cost to get past- prerequisite costs that any 1st world nation could easily resolve. But they don&#39;t, because they&#39;re too short-sighted to see how they can indirectly benefit from helping them even if there is no direct benefit. And they act like it&#39;s their right to be short-sited, they don&#39;t have to gain long sight if they don&#39;t want to; contentedly if not proudly short-sighted. <br><br>P.S.

Being privileged enough to go to Southern Africa on holiday, I have seen what people can do, even with limited resources, but I have also seen people starve in one of the most abundant nations in the world, because those who own orchards and farms would throw the poor to the dogs then sell the crops to Europe and USA.<br><br>There is also the part where humans, being animals, tend to breed in order to have at least one surviving offspring and if many children die, either in infancy or before sexual maturity, families tend to aim for more children.

Ultimately, the reason why it is difficult to provide aid to others happens to be the problem of community. The difference between real life and the thought experiment is that sending aid to other countries changes the power balance between nations. Certainly helping out to some extent has such a negligible impact as to be irrelevant, but on the scale you are suggesting it would cause huge problems. <br><br>First, there is the problem of loyalty. Helping someone within your own nation means that you understand you won&#39;t ever be helping your enemy. The solidarity of a country is part of the reason a well-established nation can use government resources to provide for its citizens. In dictatorships, the primary reason the citizens are treated so poorly is because if they were healthy and affluent, they would be fighting the dictator. No amount of aid you send to these people will make them better off. They will instead go to the soldiers fighting your country or allies.<br><br>Secondly, helping people whom you can not both see and understand is irresponsible. This doesn&#39;t mean that we shouldn&#39;t help people, it is just that we really do need to see the person we are helping. In other words, a child drowning in front of your eyes is different than one halfway across the world. This is because if you cannot see how you are affecting something, you might actually be contributing to something terrible. Maybe that $3 for a mosquito net bankrupts the mosquito net sellers. Maybe the money isn&#39;t buying nets at all. Maybe the nets aren&#39;t going to the people you intended to help. Maybe they don&#39;t even want mosquito nets if it is coming from your country.

With it being portrayed in the media of charities being set up that are just funding someone personally that isn&#39;t in any particular need or just the money is being wasted, examples being in Seinfeld or Weeds (that I can remember specifically). If people knew their money was actually going where it needed to go, sure as hell more people would donate. It&#39;s the same line of thinking as &quot;I&#39;d rather save the life of a child right in front of me than one far away&quot; because you KNOW the child your helping in front of you is getting the help, you can never really be sure about the child across the planet unless they give you confirmation somehow, or you observe it yourself.

I don&#39;t go out of my way to go to a charity&#39;s website and donate, but if a store I&#39;m buying from has a partnership with a charity and there&#39;s a button on the pinpad after I swipe my card to add a couple bucks on as a donation and I&#39;m not hurting for cash at the moment, sure I&#39;ll add on the donation.<br><br>I feel like if more places had that sort of &quot;press here to donate extra money to people in need&quot; button with a purchase, more money overall would be given.

In a wealthy nation like the U.S. some people choose to send pocket change to developing nations because they simply derive more fulfillment from the act, whereas I and many others do not.

In the end, our charity is kind of bad and complicit to maintaining poverty.<br><br>Think of it this way: Say you&#39;re in a society that doesn&#39;t have access to food or clothing. If you don&#39;t have access to food, it&#39;s probably because it&#39;s been taken from you, as cultures have a tendency to spring up around food and water. If you&#39;re in a city, or anywhere that companies own the resources in your area, then you don&#39;t have access to that natural bounty or it might have just been destroyed entirely. So you need to engage with the market instead of the environment for food and drink. This is what happens, for instance, when Nestle or Coca Cola comes into your indigenous land, drills a well, and lowers your water table below your ability to access it anymore or pollutes your lakes and rivers to be undrinkable.<br><br>So, companies (usually foreign ones draining wealth to another place in the world) establish an infrastructure that is too expensive to properly engage with. Now, maybe a local operation can build up in the shadows of these multinationals. It&#39;s not impossible for that to happen. Then the food aid comes in and people can get free portable food from the same foreign interests that took away the forests and rivers. As a local business, it&#39;s very hard to compete with that and you flop. Without local business growing, a local market fails to appear, and wealth continues to drain out of the region. The situation doesn&#39;t improve because of the well meaning donations of the foreign land that benefits from the companies that exploit your land and people.<br><br>Same with clothing. Instead of being able to manufacturer your own industry, you get secondhand the goods that you produce for a foreign market. It&#39;s free, it&#39;s bad quality, and it keeps you dependent on those markets for survival.<br><br>Meanwhile, in those foreign countries, it&#39;s often the middle class (not the rich) supporting you. This helps increase the wealth divide abroad by deflecting the financial responsibility, once again, from the businesses that control your infrastructure and keep your own markets from appearing.<br><br>So is donating the best thing for the middle class American worker to do?

I cannot buy that child a mosquito net. I cannot buy that child the medicine she needs. What I can do is give money to an organization, which may or may not, use that money to buy those things and give to her. That organization in turn can only buy and distribute these badly needed resources to the extant they are allowed by the governments and environments that control the area the child lives in. <br><br>What makes the child across the globe different from the child in the pond? My power to act. In the case of the child in the pond, I am the only thing stopping me from saving her. In the case of the child across the pond, there are many things stopping me for saving her. We can only be responsible to the extent we are able to act, not just based on physical constraints, but also spheres of responsibility. The United States could solve world poverty, but that would require massively intervening in the affairs of other states, altering the way they handle imports, changing their transportation infrastructure, altering their government to allow for resources to be distributed correctly. We would have to override their sovereignty. Zimbabwe&#39;s economy has been devastated since 2000. This is entirely due to mismanagement by Mugabe&#39;s government. We could save the people suffering there, but only if we overthrow that government and replace it with a just and competent one. Do we have a right to do so?

I could do much to rectify her suffering, but it would require taking control of the child away from her parents.

If you&#39;re standing around the proverbial pond, one person can call an ambulance, another can wade in to save her, and a third can try to keep her alive until help arrives (this isn&#39;t a particularly malleable analogy, I&#39;m afraid). If you called 911, and waded in, and tried to perform CPR (or something) then you would be doing a great deed, in fact one that I believe any good person would do, shoes notwithstanding. But what if you are one of the other people? If you see someone do all three things, and the girl dies because they weren&#39;t able to do it all in time on their own, then are you guilty for not helping them? Wouldn&#39;t it have been better if you had shared the responsibilities and been able to save the girl?", "comment_date": "2017-01-30T23:08:58Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"D5sknLy7Smo": {"Poverty & Our Response to It: Crash Course Philosophy #44": {"channel_id": "Ugg1iBiGNov9gXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "alexander reusens", "comment_text": "In the West, it is socially acceptable if you don&#39;t give to charity.

This is not impossible if we take for example the rapid advancement of countries such as Japan in response to the colonialism of western nations. It is difficult and there will be many problems along the way with causalities of both people and culture. But if we are to give aid, it should be from the top down. Don&#39;t catch a fish for a man to feed him for a day but instead teach him to fish so that he can eat for life. If people want to make a change in countries that require aid they should think long term and give aid to the governing bodies of those countries to reform them in our image. Yes this will cause a great loss of local culture and variation in the world however the natural selection analogy still applies. The Human Development Index is highest in countries of Western culture and democratic policy, these traits should then be replicated throughout the world until a stronger culture and policy evolve and so on etc. In the sense of Hardin&#39;s analogy don&#39;t give them aid, build them a new boat.

I think the &quot;true&quot; answer can be found in this question: can they provide something better or can they care about themselves after you have helped them? Just to clarify this question, let&#39;s go back to the example of malaria net, food and medicine. Let&#39;s suppose that you want to help them and give enough money to clear that problem, will they then be able to at least sustain themselves? Or better, can they provide more then what we gave them because now they have constructed some kind of infrastructure and they can exploit their own resource and become productive? I think those are the real question to ask. In the lifeboat example, you could save some people that you know will be able to make more boat or be more productive then dead. In the case of the little children, you have a reasonable expectation that she will be able to grow up and be a useful member of the society. But what about a child in some remote village that can only live if you gave them money? It will then become a bottomless pit  and you will never really help then, just subsidize them.
