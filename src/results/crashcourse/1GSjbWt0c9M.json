and if it tries, will bloated, inefficient. the usual alternative of each language having it&#39;s own code is not much better, for there is much redundancy. there&#39;s a middle ground, where one makes a standardized encoding system, which lets anyone make their own character encoding, and anyone to easily install a new character encoding. though there is a concern raised that this would cause a flood of character encodings which would cause each computer to have a ton of encodings lest they are unable to decode some message, the fact is that people would gravitate, as a mediary between individuals, to local standard encodings which capture everything written in one script, perhaps with some small tweaks allowing similar scripts to be captured (the idea being to maximize how much content is encodable per the space all the content that is already, or will be in the foreseen future, encoded), while individuals might have their own preferred encoding on their private machine, if they are willing to host a transcoder between their code and the local standard.<br>the reason that this will happen is because<br>1: creators choosing to publish will want their work to be in a code their target understands, while creating in the code that is most effective for their work<br>2: consumers will want to use an code which most efficiently displays everything they consume<br>3: languages tend to be extremely different, though almost all, and i think all of which we are aware, though i do not claim to know all languages, so don&#39;t take my word for it, share many common features (Japanese (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e) (i&#39;m not a native usor of japanese, so if you know that something i wrote here is wrong, maybe you are a native usor of Japanese and have a differing opinion about your language, i won&#39;t be offended if you correct me, and will be delighted, because it will be an great opportunity for me to learn more), for instance, has many scripts, of of which there are usually only 3 that are used or mentioned (though it can be difficult to say whether a now mostly defunct script is a different script, or a historical variant of an existing script, or something else), 1 which is mostly semantic, called kanji (\u6f22\u5b57 literally Sino-/Chinese Characters), in which most symbols have a meaning, and most symbol&#39;s can be analyzed into components, most of which of which also have meanings and are often used for their semantic properties, though sometimes for their phonetic properties, or even for their visual properties (take \u53e3 which usually means (in the more abstract sense) mouth, derived from looking sorta like a mouth (e.g. \u5473, which means taste, or flavour, and \u540d which means name (because when the crescent moon is the only source of light, it may be hard to see who you are speaking with, and thus must ask their name if you wish to identify them)), though in \u77f3, meaning stone, it is used not to mean mouth but as a picture that looks like a big lump, or {\\slant stone}, and in \u5718/\u56e3, meaning organization, it is just used to enclose \u5c08/\u5bf8, and does not mean stone or mouth, and i think it has no specific semantic or phonetic interpretation, so it is encoded as a separate character, in english it is usually called the enclosure character), and words are ordered sequences of these kanji, and another 2 which are phonetic, called hiragana and katakana, which are also quite similar, but considered separate, and used differently. though all the scripts are still scripts written using strokes of a pen/pencil/brush on paper, just like English, and texts written in Japanese are still totally ordered strings of characters, just like English)", "comment_date": "2018-02-11T23:59:42Z",
