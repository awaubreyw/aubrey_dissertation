Therefore, given time, a species will never gain new traits, and over time everyone will tend to become completely uniform, natural selection or not. This is only solved by genetics.

The first is mutation-- random alterations in the genetic material over time due to copying errors, and the second is natural selection-- a non-random process that drives how mutations are spread through a given environment.<br><br>Mutations are extremely well documented and are actually the source of some of the more deadly diseases to afflict animals across the planet. There are two major types of mutations that can occur. <br><br>The first is a point mutation. A point mutation occurs when a base in a gene is swapped for another base, and nothing has been inserted or removed. The result is generally benign or produces no effect in the resulting protein as the amino acid is not altered (There are 64 possible combinations in a single codon, which consists of 3 base-pairs, and there are only 20 amino acids used in life on earth. As a result, more than one codon can code for the same amino acid). For example, sickle-cell anemia is a point mutation that produces malformed hemoglobin and increases the risk of various cardiovascular complications (due to their rigid shape). <br><br>The second type of mutation involves the insertion and removal of nucleotides from the gene and is prone to causing problems in translation. This sort of mutation causes problems because a single codon consists of 3 base pairs, and has designated start and stop signatures that are read by tRNA. When a single nucleotide is inserted into a sequence it can cause the translation of this gene into a protein to start or stop prematurely-- this is known as a frame-shift, and if this happens the mutation is referred to as a frame-shift mutation. <br><br>Of course, these sorts of mutations can occur with more than one nucleotide at a time, as is the case with Tay-Sachs disease. Tay-Sachs is most frequently caused by the insertion of four nucleotides into the HEXA (hexosaminidase A) gene, and the result is progressive deterioration of nerve cells-- generally starting at around six months old. There are several other kinds of mutations that can occur, though this should do for the basics. <br>On to natural selection... Natural selection is an observable process that has to do with a given population of animals. Specifically, it&#39;s a combination of social and ecological pressures on a population that causes mutations to propagate in a non-random pattern. Animals that express mutations that are ill-suited to their environments are less likely to pass on those genes when compared to animals that express genes that allow them to thrive more adequately given current pressures. This means that if you have a mutation that causes a disease such as sickle-cell anemia, you&#39;re (slightly) less likely to pass on that trait unless you live in an area of the world that is afflicted by Malaria, to which sickle-cell anemia provides natural resistance. As a result, sickle-cell anemia is quite common in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world and still lingers in the populations of people who hail from these regions. <br><br>So to summarize: <br>- Mutations occur at random. <br>- Mutations come in several varieties, the most important for our purposes right now are insertion, deletion, frame-shift, and point. <br>- Point mutations are less likely to lead to health problems than insertion or deletion mutations because more than one codon can code for the same amino acid. <br>- A frame-shift can cause tRNA to begin or end translation from RNA to a protein prematurely and will cause the sequence following the frame-shift mutation to translate incorrectly.<br>- Natural selection is NOT random and is the result of environmental pressures on a population. <br><br>And from this we can make the following rather basic logical deductions: <br><br>- It is more likely for a point mutation to propagate through an environment than a mutation that adds or removes nucleotides. <br>- Insertion and deletion mutations are more likely to propagate through a population if they insert or remove nucleotides in multiples of three. <br>- A mutation does NOT need to be entirely beneficial to propagate. The benefits need only outweigh the detriments in a given environment. (See also: sickle-cell anemia) <br>- Animals better suited to their environment are more likely to thrive in it than animals that are not. <br><br>Pretty simple, right? Here&#39;s the tricky part. <br><br>Because genes are passed down from parent(s) to child(ren), you have an accumulation of mutations over time. <br><br>Because mutations occur at random during the copying process, any part of your genome can be affected by them. <br><br>Since both of these things are true, then that means that mutations can be accumulated by a population over time. If mutations can be accumulated by a population over time, there will come a time where a species will no longer share enough DNA in common with its ancestors to breed successfully (children will be sterile, stillborn, will miscarriage, or won&#39;t even fertilize an egg).
