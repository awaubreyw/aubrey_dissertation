Once you enter the equation hit ENTER and then set X equal to 0. hit ENTER\u00a0 again and hover over the 0 in your X section and press ALPHA +\u00a0ENTER. Let your calculator do the magic and voila! The x value is displayed for you in the X section.

Therefore, you can assume 2.00 - x = 2.00 and solve.<br>x^2 = 1.3*10^-22/2.00<br>and then take the square root and get 8.1*10^-12.<br>You can find that x is indeed very small.
