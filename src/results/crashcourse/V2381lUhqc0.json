All of the radioactive isotopes are presumably made during this stellar explosion.  So, planet forms from this space dust with all of the isotopes within the dust and makes the compositions of the planet.  \r<br>\r<br>So, my question, why is there any difference between the amounts of isotopes anywhere on a planet?  \r<br>Shouldn\u2019t the age of all rock be the same age as the space dust it was made from?  \r<br>\r<br>Again, maybe it\u2019s a supper dumb question but my understanding is that there is not really any new isotope formation  so when we radiometrically date rocks there was kind of a fixed concentration at the starting point which is why the dating is reliable.
