See, I don&#39;t think words alone can cause anything to happen or change. If a president declares war, there really is no war without any battling taking place. If a priest declares two people as &quot;husband and wife&quot;, it changes nothing unless they actually do something about it. In both of these examples there theoretically is a difference made by words, but no actual change will ever happen by words alone. This being said, words often cause some sort of reaction in the person/people hearing them, but it has nothing to do with if they decide to do something about it or not, since the difference caused this way will be caused by the actual actions taking place.

Why is it assumed impossible to marry someone who is already married or to marry an animal?  And why is it assumed possible to marry someone of the same sex?<br> By presenting these assumptions as settled, the history of the philosophical understandings of marriage are summarily dismissed, from marriage in the Law Code of Hammurapi to defenders of the practice of polygamy to the Christian philosophy of marriage (which I believe to be true).  It could easily have been avoided by saying that the speaking of an oath in marriage makes oneself a spouse to another, and then left everything else out, thus leaving the discussion of the philosophy of marriage for another video.<br><br> P.S. The speech act that makes people married is not the officiant saying \u201cI pronounce you husband and wife,\u201d but those who speak the vows.
