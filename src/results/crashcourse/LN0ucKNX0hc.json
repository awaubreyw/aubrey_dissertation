Also, since relays are electromechnical devices, they can actually be designed to be fail-safe via gravity control - this is something still used today in the railroad industry for example.Vacuum tubes are still used today for professional music applications.

In that year the Pall Mall Gazette reported that \u2018Mr. Edison \u2026 had been up the two previous nights discovering a \u2018bug\u2019 in his phonograph\u2013an expression for solving a difficulty, and implying that some imaginary insect has secreted itself inside and is causing all the trouble.\u2019\u2026.<br><br>This meaning was common enough by 1934 to be recognized in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary:  \u2018bug, n\u2026. 3.

It does appear that the term \u201cdebugging\u201d came into use around Hopper\u2019s time period, but there are not any evidence firmly tying it to this particular moth.

I had previously learned about how relays and vacuum tubes worked, but putting them in the context of history really solidified their importance to computing. Bravo! But, the computer scientist and programmer inside of me is screaming at the fact that you labeled what is clearly and ECE course as CS. <br><br>Don&#39;t feel bad, most people assume CS is building computers or writing code, but there is quite a distinction: CS is mostly theoretical and is built upon MATHEMATICS, NOT ENGINEERING. Hell, the AP Comp Sci exam is done in pencil and paper! All this stuff about relays, vacuums tubes, and transistors is great but if you don&#39;t talk about how they relate to logic, well it&#39;s not computer science. <br><br>That was actually my hope for this episode: &quot;An Introduction to Logic.&quot; The history&#39;s great and all but, if you don&#39;t cover CS principles, well it&#39;s not a CS course. For example, when you talked about transistors being a switch, that was a great way to introduce logic gates using multiple transistors. Two in series makes an AND gate and two in parallel make an OR gate. That kind of thing. You could have also had a bit on binary (&quot;bit&quot; was a pun!) counting and conversion to octal and hexadecimal (stuff that&#39;s tested on the APCSA exam). The direction you&#39;re currently moving is towards CPU design (according to previous videos). Again, I find that fascinating to me, but it is still not computer science.<br><br>Your primary audience for Crash Course  appears to be high schoolers looking for help on their APs (see: CC World History, CC Physics, etc.). It would really be helpful if you paralleled the AP. An episode on arithmetic, relational, and logical operators and binary counting WOULD BE COMPUTER SCIENCE and I have no doubt you guys could make as interesting and engaging as your other CC series (not to mention relevant to your target audience).<br><br>Overall, I really hope you guys either change the name of this or simply go back to the drawing board because passing this off as a CS course is not doing anyone any good.", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T04:35:53Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"LN0ucKNX0hc": {"Electronic Computing: Crash Course Computer Science #2": {"channel_id": "UghLrgVE16mgUXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Unktheunk", "comment_text": "why is there a oscilloscope in the background?", "comment_date": "2017-03-02T04:31:52Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"LN0ucKNX0hc": {"Electronic Computing: Crash Course Computer Science #2": {"channel_id": "UghaZ-aMtC5grHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Legoboy", "comment_text": "I joined my school&#39;s robotics team this year, and was working a lot with transistors.
