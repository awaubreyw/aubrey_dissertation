Rather, it&#39;s all about probability.  It&#39;s not that we <i>can&#39;t</i> make a perfectly efficient engine, it&#39;s just the the probability of it happening is practically 0, but actually slightly higher.  What&#39;s really going on is that entropy is a measure of the number of states a system can exist in.  We talk about macrostates vs microstates.  For example, if our system consists of a single vase, one potential macrostate would be &quot;broken&quot;.  A microstates is an exact configuration of particles.  There are FAR, FAR more microstates that correspond to &quot;broken vase&quot; than &quot;not broken vase&quot;, so a system consisting of a broken vase has higher entropy than one consistenting of a whole vase.  This is where the misleading description of entropy as being a measure of &quot;disorder&quot; comes from.  Most macrostates we&#39;d consider disordered are higher entropy simple because there are more microstates that correspond to them.  But this isn&#39;t what entropy is about.  So what does this have to do with energy and efficiency?  Well anytime we apply energy to a system to do work on it, we&#39;re changing the state of the system.  Even if we intentionally apply the energy in a very specific manner, there are simply SO MANY ways for some of the energy to be wasted compared to the number of ways for it to all be used for useful work.  There&#39;s nothing <i>stopping</i> a 100% efficient heat engine from existing, per se, but the probability of it even a single perfectly efficient heat engine cycle to occur is such that we&#39;d never expect it to happen in any way imaginable amount of time.  <i>However,</i> given infinite time, it&#39;s virtually <i>guarenteed</i> to happen, not just once, but an infinite number of time.  That&#39;s because <i>anything</i> with a non-zero probability of occuring, no matter how tiny, will eventually occur given a sufficiently long period of time. However, the probability is such a thing is probably on par with the probability of all the particles in your body quantum tunneling at the exactly the same time in such a manner to teleport you someplace.  It theoretically <i>could</i> happen, but don&#39;t count on it.  I think the amount time needed for it to have even a 50% chance of occuring is longer than the age of the universe, though I&#39;m going on memory.", "comment_date": "2020-05-30T03:39:48Z", "likes_count": 12}}}, {"2B81W6nNds0": {"Why We Can't Invent a Perfect Engine: Crash Course Engineering #10": {"channel_id": "UgwPMcgpFFiR5Ic6czx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Aerospace Engineer", "comment_text": "I am an aerospace engineer and I have been mocked by these &quot;physicists&quot; for being an end-user of their theories and equations.
