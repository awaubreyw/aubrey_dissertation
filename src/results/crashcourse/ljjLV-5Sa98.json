The Earth <i>rotates</i> about its axis. Telling people that the Earth spins at 1600 kph at the equator, and 600 kph at a higher/lower latitude, is a best not useful. At worst it will cause confusion and misunderstanding. If we have two people at the same line of longitude north and south of each other, let&#39;s say one at the equator and one at latitude 45, the sun will track across the sky at the same rate for both of them. This is because they&#39;re not going different &quot;speeds&quot; like we&#39;re told here. Remember - motion is relative, so the figure of 1600 kph of spin speed at the equator is only relevant to an observer whose position is static in space above the planet (meaning that it does not follow earth&#39;s axial rotation), while following the planet&#39;s orbital rotation around the sun. Since it isn&#39;t likely (if not impossible altogether) for anyone to occupy this observational position, it isn&#39;t useful to anyone to know that figure of 1600 kph. Same goes for any other figure for any other latitude. That information is equally as useless.<br><br>So at the equator, the Earth moves 13x faster than a cheetah? Hogwash. That&#39;s only true if you&#39;re observing the planet from a magic bubble that perfectly matches Earth&#39;s orbital motion but somehow stands outside Earth&#39;s inertial reference frame. <br><br>A much more useful and accurate description of the Earth&#39;s rotational velocity is this: Given 24 hours in a day, and 12 hours on the face of a clock, we can infer that the Earth&#39;s rotation is equivalent to <b>half the speed of the hour hand of a clock.</b> <br>Try watching the hour hand of a clock for a little while.
