I asked where she got this info from and she told me... Facebook. <b>Facepalm</b> If she had voted for him, or against her, being accurately informed, I wouldn&#39;t have been so frustrated. About 3 days after he was elected, and she saw the outcry, she regretted it and realized she&#39;d been fooled. I totally understand why my dad supports Trump, as his values and interests are upheld, but my sister was completely fooled and voted against her own best interest. The Electoral College doesn&#39;t seem to help protect us from this self destructive ignorance. So... I&#39;m wondering what can be done. Censorship is a bad idea, but being able to say anything and having poorly educated masses is resulting in inaccurate understandings of the world.

We all like to think we&#39;re informed but really only a small minority of the electorate are. We can all argue whether or not Joe the everyman conservative/liberal has accurate opinions, but the fact is that his opinions affect those in his social circle. This is always factored in when analyzing public opinion, especially on a local level.<br><br>2) Gas Prices:<br>You said that key policies e.g. Obamacare are affected by economic conditions. That is totally true! However, current comprehensive analyses of macroeconomic standing by qualified economists do not accurately predict public opinion. When it comes to opinion on any policy headed by a major figure like the president, public opinion on that policy and on that official vacillate according to gas prices. Seriously, go to gallup&#39;s website and plug in the variables. When presidential approval ratings are up, the approval stats for their policies also increase. However both presidential and presidential policy approval go up and down depending on the price of gas. The delay is usually between a few days and 2 weeks.<br><br>P.S. There are exceptions such as the major ratings boost leaders get in wartime, right after election etc. Controlling for those variables, you&#39;ll see that gas prices are the greatest predictor of authority-initiated public policy opinion.<br><br>3) The Undecided<br>It really comes down to the 10% in the United States. Most people have made up their minds ideologically. Whether they truly think a policy is wise or not, most people stick to their party or ideological identity. However about 1/10 people are genuinely thoughtful and vote with up-to-date judgement. THEY are the target of manipulative ad campaigns, not the general public.<br><br><br>Edit: Also there&#39;s also methodology!  People 35 and younger generally don&#39;t answer phone questionnaires and don&#39;t participate in long-study online public opinion studies! Thus we can&#39;t get a good idea of how effective the methods in your video are.
