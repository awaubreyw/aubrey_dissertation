Firstly, Goodman&#39;s new riddle of induction isn&#39;t meant to simply illustrate that inductive reasoning can lead us astray. No one would ever accept an argument like the one provided concerning &#39;grue&#39;, so there is no need to worry. What it instead shows us is that there are some predicates that are more suitable for use in inductive reasoning than others (he calls these predicates &#39;projectible&#39;). The real riddle comes from trying to explain what it is about green that makes it a projectible predicate; it has to be something that isn&#39;t also true about grue and it can&#39;t merely take for granted that green is projectible while grue isn&#39;t. <br>Secondly, the Socratic Method isn&#39;t just &#39;exchanging ideas through dialogue&#39; or the type of back-in-forth argument presented in the video. The Socratic Method refers to an argumentative technique used by Socrates (mostly) in Plato&#39;s early or &#39;Socratic&#39; dialogues (referred to as such for just this reason). Socrates specifically asks his interlocutors to define some nebulous concept like &#39;justice&#39;, &#39;piety&#39;, &#39;knowledge&#39;, etc. and then criticizes their proposed definitions. Ultimately, Socrates shows that they have failed to give any satisfactory definition. That being said, I have a feeling that Hank is planning on starting with Socrates next week, so I can see why he would try to make this connection.", "comment_date": "2016-02-23T23:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mr8ty8", "comment_text": "My deductive reasoning leads me to conclude that religion is the cancer of humanity.

Because immediate taste preference between individuals is completely subjective. You COULD give arguments as to which are objectively better on another standard. You COULD say that one is technically healthier than another, which would be  good as it would possibly lead to greater satisfaction down the line in that you will feel healthier and/or die later than you would have otherwise, therefore you ought to like those M&amp;Ms. You could say that the process to make one is more sustainable than the other. Maybe peanut farming is more intensive than farming the various other ingredients in M&amp;Ms, therefore you ought to like regular M&amp;Ms more. And you could associate behavioral arguments with this. Maybe if you form a habit of eating M&amp;M&#39;s you are just as likely to eat as many of either M&amp;M&#39;s per unit time, no matter their properties, therefore plain M&amp;M&#39;s are better because they contain fewer calories and cost fewer resources to make. Or Peanut M&amp;M&#39;s are better because, despite increased caloric intake, the calories are made more nutritious by the peanuts, and that nutrition is most important. But as far as food goes, the best thing that you could do for sustainability and nutrition or the ethics of creating the product in the first place for any food choice would be to drink Soylent, which is basically this liquid mixture of perfectly balanced nutritional and caloric needs met with very sustainable production and it produced without any animal products. So what you OUGHT to like the most is Soylent, and you OUGHT to like it so much that you could never dream of consuming another thing again. Except human beings taste buds and neural interpretations of taste based stimuli aren&#39;t actively chosen by you. You are forced to taste what you taste. You can&#39;t force your taste buds to prefer plain M&amp;M&#39;s to Peanut M&amp;Ms any more than you can force your taste buds to make broccoli taste like cake.
