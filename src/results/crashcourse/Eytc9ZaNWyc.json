Judges and attorneys make up their own terms of employment &amp; their own laws. The Judicial Review Committee is made primarily of attorneys, who, justices declared to be above the law. They are &quot;unregulated as a matter of trust&quot; and there are no liabilities associated with their conduct. Clerks are supervised by Chief Judges &amp; judges stamp their own fictitious arrest warrants. Transcribing Solutions are self-regulating and generate fictitious transcripts. Since Obama &amp; Clinton, both attorneys, collaborate, judges &amp; attorneys became bolder. Read the LexisNexis Intro. To the Rules of Professional Conduct &amp; West Law Practice Series Rules of Civil Procedure 15(4). There is basically no law - only abuse of discretion in misapplying one part of the law to another. Judges &amp; attorneys are pocketing the wealth of the middle class. They are eyeing anyone&#39;s appreciation on their home - through damage law suits; by filing fictitious QuitClaim deeds on anyone&#39;s property; by generating nuisance or violating the terms of their rental leases. They also take people&#39;s marital estates &amp; inheritances by appointing a double-paid double-duty guardian ad litem and other court entities. Please call the FBI - I have details. Here&#39;s how it works: Clinton subsidizes Monsanto by $11 billion annually. Justices say it is fine for them to own the EPA &amp; USDA. Monsanto sponsors her campaign in return. Clinton goes into the secret security budgets and shares with justices. Justices are happy. Bribes become unprosecutable. Attorneys must be barred from both the legislative &amp; judicial branches or the 1929 crash is coming - followed by a holocaust of sorts. Time to amend the Constitution and eliminate the billion-$<del>per-hour guzzling justice department. Regulated magistrates &amp; computerized processes are lean. Atrocities are free - why should the public shed a third of their income to purchase them? US HIstory #8</del> Attorneys in all branches of government are collaborating to pocket the wealth of the middle class, in effect bringing the 1929 crash back using the same methods. Perhaps its a 100 year cycle - as media expands more and more of them participate, they become more aggressive defending their territory and eventually there&#39;s just not enough welath for them all to pocket - which is why we currently have a deficit. Colorado Capitol is working on generating foreclosures because attorneys file fictitious QuitCaim deeds to assume anyone&#39;s property hiding behind the confusion. Community Association Managers can take kickbacks from attorneys to start litigation, from insurance brokers to start a fire &amp; from vendors to avoid preventative maintenance. Governor Hickenlooper signed this into bill, along with a bill importing criminals into the police force. Around Supreme Courts is where the most crime &amp; least good police departments are generally found. Washington is practically the murder capitol - because if anyone should happen to understand what politicians are doing they get murdered and some innocent kids are put in prison. For the entire thing to work judges tweak Court Rules, Rules of Civil Procedure &amp; Rules of Professional Conduct weekly at the Supreme Court. The Court Improvement Committee is known to respond to steaks. We need to bar attorneys from both the legislative &amp; judicial branches. Judges should not be past or future attorneys &amp; they should not be in the Capitol, White House or City Council either. Computerized processes to replace hearings; detailed rulings in response to standardized statute-specific procedures; automatic notifications, etc. Aren&#39;t you all happy you get to pay for a Guardian ad Litem for me - who makes money thousands of times faster than you do? She gets paid a second time by the wealthy party to become my unbundled representation without my knowledge and against my will so she can wave my legal entitlements away C.R.C.P 15(4) style.
