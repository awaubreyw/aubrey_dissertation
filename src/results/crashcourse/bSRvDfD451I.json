Make sure you reward and retain the best workers in your department, they are essential to productivity.<br>3. Delegate tasks and choose someone to be your right hand man/woman to help keep things rolling, you can&#39;t run  a department alone.<br>4. Communicate effectively, and honestly for long term success. Public speaking courses, courses on rapport building, psychology courses, and sociology courses can all help with this.<br>5. Optimize where possible, and begin working to improve processes after you have a good working knowledge of the work at hand, and the people in your department.<br><br><br>Your style of leadership will vary depending on the individual workers, and the general atmosphere of the company, that you are working with.
