The bite almost always leaves a mark and sometimes it even bleeds a little, nevertheless often I go weeks without feelings anxious so i&#39;m not sure if my situation could fit in the spectrum of OCD, or if it might be slight anxiety that I shouldn&#39;t worry about much. I shake when i&#39;m anxious and laugh for no reason. Hard. I never feel like washing my hands, bathing or even like a germaphobe. Small mistakes in things do bother me, maybe more than in should because its often about just one technicality. That can really annoy me and get me anxious, but big mistakes or errors never bother me much, or at least in a unhealthy manner. I get really stressed when I am not really informed on topics, even some that I would never need to know.  When I smoke E cigarettes and get a strong hit of nicotine, I cant control my thoughts, I feel very confused and feel that everything i do and say is dumb, I feel pointless and hate myself. after a few seconds of that then I just feel trapped in my own body and start shaking. After a few minutes I eventually forget everything I thought of before and just carry on with my life.  I often feel insecure, different and sometimes I isolate myself and I drink a lot. I normally take about 30-40 minutes to fall asleep but sometimes I sleep very fast, depends on my mood. Its important to keep in my that I am a 15 year old boy so it might just be the hormones.

The longest I\u2019ve done is probably just 13mins of me slowly opening and closing the door), tapping my foot in a star or square pattern when sitting, and repeating the last word I\u2019ve said out loud in increments of 4 (most of the time I have to whisper this). If I couldn\u2019t or can\u2019t act these out my mind can\u2019t focus, and some past cases lead to self harm.<br><br>I don\u2019t really know what this would count as but if I\u2019m not ready or expecting to be touched I have to wash what ever part of me was touched and the other side. If i can\u2019t wash I rub it, often close to breaking the skin.

Until then, thank God it&#39;s not That easy  have As I become older, I am encouraged to believe that &#39;anxiety&#39; is self-limiting.  Meaning that should every other effort fail you, time will <br>eventually eliminate it.  But waiting isn&#39;t necessary.  In the mean-<br>time, today there are an almost count-<br>less number of things that will help or<br>even eliminate your &#39;nerves&#39;;  but, if it&#39;s<br>possible, nail down cause - in the <br>meantime anyway.  This is of course<br>because it is likely the surest, most efficacious,<br>and perhaps quickest sure-fire &#39;cure&#39;.  But whilst sprinting out of a bus-station<br>screaming your way in-and-out of heart failure - you&#39;ll probably think of &#39;cause&#39; and only be interested in throwing out the god-damn window.There are of course many other ways  of dealing and treating anxiety,   but<br>most people will probably do the two<br>most frequent, medication along with<br>relationship therapy.<br>Benzodiazepines are popular, they&#39;re<br>a great anaxiolytic (anxiety-killer), but they&#39;re problematic unless they are <br>used infrequently.  This is a problem<br>in any event with anxiety-disorders because the<br>problem is too pervasive making the<br>probable result; tolerance, abuse, and<br>eventually addiction.

As of recently, I am finally being treated with CBD oil and its the only way I can sleep, eat, and feel like an overall normal human or what I assume normal people feel like.

I take medication and see a psychologist. <br>Now that that\u2019s out of the way, I want to thank you for making this video. It can be really frustrating when OCD is one of the most talked about specific anxiety disorder, but nobody really knows anything about it. Everyone\u2019s like \u201comg your drawer is so messy, it\u2019s giving me OCD\u201d or \u201chey you lie things to be symmetrical?

They just think that if you\u2019re organized or if you don\u2019t like germs, you have it. <br>When I was diagnosed, I was washing my hands so much they bled. I couldn\u2019t bend my fingers because they cracks in my hands would reopen and start to bleed again. They stung constantly. They were red and raw and cracked and bloody. You know when you\u2019re swimming and your hands get all wrinkly? I\u2019d wash my hands for so long that that would happen. Over and over again. I would wash, dry, and repeat forever, and eventually I was just scraping away the skin in my hands. <br>Then, the other compulsions. One huge and very common obsession many ppl who suffer from OCD experience is the fear of hurting yourself or someone else. I\u2019d be shaking in the corner of my room with my door locked, sobbing, trying to tie my hands together so I would hurt anyone. I was terrified that one day for some reason, I\u2019d just hurt sb. It was so stupid looking back on it because I know I would never hurt anyone, but these images would just pop in your head of you doing these things. I remember begging my parents to send me away and to lock me in some mental institution to get me away from them because I was so scared something would happen. I would plead with them to call the police and get them to arrest me and put me into solitary confinement. I wouldn\u2019t hug anyone anymore because I kept seeing myself choking them.

(This may be triggering for OCD people, please dont read if you do get effected easily) I haven&#39;t gone to a doctor about this because I dont think it effects my life as much as it does to others. It is very slight and I can kind of control it. I think i may have some form of OCD, but not too bad. I know that sounds like I&#39;m trying to fake an illness but I swear I&#39;m not, I&#39;ll just tell you about some things that happen to me daily. (My brother has adhd and autism btw, you&#39;ll need this information for later) Sometimes my brother would get very upset or get hyper, and my mother tells me I often went to wash my hands because I said I felt in control, along with the fact that I distinctly remember pacing back and forth at least 7 times unlocking, relocking, twisting the knobs on the doors in the house to check if they were okay. It got so bad that at one point I was almost at ten until my mom grabbed my hand and told me I needed to go to bed and that I had just spent 30 minutes checking the doors. I got so paranoid some nights I would look at the ceiling and go back and forth on the wall, then check another just the same in continuous motions until i felt satisfied  and hadn&#39;t messed up once. I still feel some sudden urges to wash my hands vigorously. Whenever I think there&#39;s been hair in my food I feel like there&#39;s hair in the back of my throat and I start to cough to &quot;get the hair out&quot;, the coughing got so bad one time I threw up and still coughed cause I thought the hair was still in my throat. I can&#39;t wash dishes (even if they&#39;ve been precleaned by me which they usely are) without gloves on. When I think or see something disgusting I feel the sudden urge to scratch my head.(it got so bad one time I reached under my hair and it was bleeding a lot, and I had a scab for a while) whenever I get paranoid about someone or something i pace and count my steps or scratch my skin until it&#39;s bleeding. I love cleaning, and whenever I go over to a friend&#39;s house (which isn&#39;t often because of the locks thing) I always end up cleaning their house. Sometimes I look at perfectly clean items and somehow my brain convinces me they&#39;re dirty when in reality they&#39;ve been washed, but then I get a maggots digging into your scalp kind of feeling and start scratching.When I was very young I would avoid cracks, and count 1 2 between them. If I messed up and touched a crack or my count got off I would stop, turn around, count my paces back and start again. I hold back a lot of my urges because people would probably judge me if I scratched my head all the time, but that doesn&#39;t mean they dont exist. As well as the fact that I could add many more experiences that I have daily that make me feel compulsed to do things unordinary. I&#39;ve probably rewritten this paragraph way too many times.

Before I leave the bathroom I open the door,close the light,and open another light near me so the light will reflect inside the toilet and it will shine,so I will se it as clean and shiny before closing it.Then before leaving,I avoid looking in the toilet and sink and instead I look at something shiny which looks clean and then before closing the door,I avoid and try not to think about disgusting images of dirty toilet (which are linked to bathroom) that pop uncontrollably and another things I don&#39;t like.And instead I fantasize about that perfect character of my fantasy with long and slim legs (and if the \u201cbad\u201d thoughts start to pop and if I can&#39;t keep fantasizing or fantasize her ugly or distorted then I will focus and look at my slim and tall legs to distract myself from \u201cbad thoughts\u201d and then I close the door as fast as possible before \u201cbad\u201d thoughts pop and her being ugly or different and with ugly fat and short legs that I don&#39;t like.<br><br>4.When I buy something new that I like,I will perform those \u201cfantasy\u201d rituals I value and like,whenever I stare at those things.Or otherwise that is supposed to mean that I don&#39;t really like those things and that they are including to \u201cbad thoughts\u201d.Also when I dress up and after doing my makeup,my rituals and compulsions are stronger than ever and at that time while I stare at my clothes,my makeup tools and at my reflection, I think about the perfect things without flaws I value and like.Or otherwise that means I&#39;m like the \u201cbad thoughts\u201d that may pop.<br><br>5.While I&#39;m performing my rituals when I&#39;m standing,I keep my posture as straight as possible.When I lay down and when I&#39;m on the phone I constantly fantasize \u201cthe perfect things\u201d<br><br>6.When I&#39;m listening to music that I like,value and that is somewhat linked to my \u201cperfect fantasizes\u201d,I lay perfectly and covered perfectly with my blanket and keep fantasizing until the music ends.<br><br>7.Things that usually get dirty and are greasy or things that I suspect that may be,I touch them with my clothes and if I touch them with my hands then I will immediately wash my hands.And as about this,it&#39;s not that I&#39;m afraid of getting sick or diseases from contamination like most people and everyone I&#39;ve seen on the internet,but instead I&#39;m just disgusted.<br><br>8.I put things in order and my stuff perfectly in a simetric way and even when I move them or they mess up,I will put them in the exact spot they were before.And EVERY time I stare at them I will fantasize.(because I value them)<br><br>9.Before going to sleep I straight the sheets of my bed (and while I fantasize and trying to avoid \u201cbad thoughts\u201d while doing that) I also will check if the door is locked,if the windows are closed,and straight the sheets of the eating table.And even if they are,I will still close and lock even more (and fantasize about every thing I do) I will fantasize even in the moment I&#39;m laying down and I lf a \u201cbad thought will pop\u201d I will get up and try to focus again ! Lol<br><br>Now it&#39;s so severe that I have to fantasize about nearly everything I do and I I accidentally think of something else or a \u201cbad thought\u201d that I dislike then I will start over again and will redo that thing until I success.<br><br>I&#39;m not diagnosed with OCD but I&#39;m sure I might have this.But this seems so crazy and even if it&#39;s obssesive though,it&#39;s far more complicated than OCD itself.And when I do my rituals,I don&#39;t fear that something bad will happen like most people but that it may affect my thoughts.And trust me,it was so freaking extremely hard to explain all these,even one.The only times I get rid of most of OCD for a while is that when I get busy,extremely tired or irritated by these but however it doesn&#39;t last for so long and they will come back strong as ever and even new ones.And I suspect that the root of this is daydreaming.Because at first I enjoy doing some of these rituals (like fantasizing) but then I will get so addicted that they will be linked to other compulsions and new rituals will be created. For example when I got free from OCD for a while,I started having a crush on a movie character and started daydreaming until the compulsions came back.And this is so ironic like OCD is trying to get me back and busy by these happening Lmao.I&#39;m attached emotionally to these compulsions that when I ignore them,I feel empty depressed and feel as if something is wrong.

I wake every single morning after a minute the first thought is the word anxiety. My whole life until the end of 6th grade I started feeling odd not physically but mentally. I have always had bad headaches and stomached even when I was 4-7 when I would go to school. I remember sitting at the nurse\u2019s office. Then one year it went away for awhile. I went through a rough year of 6th grade dealing with fake friends, bullying, and shyness. I didn\u2019t know what the word anxiety meant until last year, when I was kinda of diagnosed with it from my therapist. Not just GAD, but also social anxiety(SAD), and OCD. My head began to feel in a weird way so often, that I would take time in a period at school to sit there and cry for 20 mins starting in 7th and now. I don\u2019t know to get out of this state anymore. I\u2019m always tired, annoyed, worried or agitated at anything, and tense. At school it\u2019s so bad, I went to a doctor for my headaches and stomachaches. I was diagnosed with IBS and the whole worrying thing makes it even worse. Sometimes from the hate and pressure I put on myself I just want to cry and scream at everyone and tell them how I feel. But I won\u2019t because then it will only make it worse. I have a family history of anxiety and depression. So that mean I most likely might have depression, even though I\u2019m feeling sadder by every passing day. I have turned myself into such a nice, loving person to everyone, but to myself, I hate myself. I\u2019m constantly worried of people at school that now all I think is that I\u2019m sometimes not that involved that I\u2019m not important or they hate me. It feels so good to finally be able to rant, but there\u2019s so much more that I can\u2019t even express or talk about it.

I ran down the hall to the office, far from the restroom, and tried to call my mom, but the office was closed after school hours so I was stuck. I was hyperventilating. I ran back and was crying and freaking out. I stood by the doors to where they couldn&#39;t see me and started to cry and hyperventilate to where I was light-headed. I went to the bathroom and tried to calm down. That is when 4 girls came in and tried to talk me out of not doing to concert in front of other kids. I was dead set on going home and avoiding the peer concert all together and just doing the parent concert. One of the girls left to get someone to calm me down. Then the other three did something soooo stupid. They were pulling me and pushing me trying to get into the auditorium and out of the bathroom. (I am not exaggerating) When I saw the other classes started to come down the hall, I started to resist even more by clinging to the bathroom wall. I hate germs but I didn&#39;t care at the time. I just didn&#39;t want them to see me like this. I clung to that wall like if I didn&#39;t I would fall in a volcano.

According to my papers that i got with the diagnosis i need to talk to a therapist togheter with the medication. I pressured the specialistnurse to give me an appointment with a therapist or psychologist because i knew i felt alot of anxiety in my everyday life. She kept asking me these questions about how i expressed my anxiety and how it affected my every day life and i thought it was kind of weird but i still told her how i felt. Apperantly she was specialized in OCD and told me that it most definently sounded like i have OCD toghether with my ADHD. My most noticable trait being that i scream and cringe of pain while i thing back of everything i did wrong in social situations duiring the day, almost like a tick that i can&#39;t control (I don&#39;t have social anxiety btw, im extremely outgoing). I think she picked up on it because of the way i speak, im extremely careful with the words i say and sometimes have a hard time talking fluently because of it.

I always feel like I am being judged by other people. I just feel ugly or weird around others, I guess. As for the OCD, I have intrusive thoughts about stabbing myself in the throat or eyes (I would never, ever do this; it causes me great distress), several ritualistic behaviors, and the ridiculous idea that thinking about awful things will actually cause those awful things to happen in real life (and to prevent it from coming true, I have to repeat certain phrases in my head). I also &quot;feel&quot; like inanimate objects have feelings, even though I am well aware of how dumb that is. They are not delusions because I know that they are stupid, but they are pretty close, I think.

I&#39;ve been thinking about the same thing, and I&#39;ve realized; maybe it&#39;s due to the fact that we&#39;re trying to oversimplify this. If you look at the bigger picture of the realm of disorders, taking anxiety for example, you&#39;ll notice there can be broader terms to explain the symptoms; such as external vs internal symptoms. For example, external symptoms can range anywhere from the fear of how others will judge you at a social event to the phobia of having another panic attack on the bus in front of all those people, and internal symptoms can involve things like a reinforced behavior developed from appeasing anxiety by removing oneself from the situation.

I can&#39;t be left alone for very long periods of time, especially at night. I like to be alone because it gives me some &#39;me time&#39; and it&#39;s just nice. But my front door has a glass part in it where you can kind of see outside. Each time I pass it I HAVE TO check it. It&#39;s compulsive. I check for movements and shape figures. And if I&#39;m walking around and hear a noise, I stop, go stiff, my heart begins to race and I feel like a fricken deer or somesort of animal. I run and jump around, making the least amount of noise possible, I even run passed the door as fast as possible. I start to shake as well. You better believe I don&#39;t move when I hear that doorbell or hear the phone ring. I used to stay inside my room once I was alone and didn&#39;t come out until someone came home. I didn&#39;t even leave to use the bathroom. Sometimes I still do that. For hours.<br>I care a lot about how people view me. I have friends and I hate thinking about how they&#39;re slipping away from me, while they&#39;re probably not, so I&#39;m becoming very clingy. If I don&#39;t talk to a person I care about regularly (everyday), I get really scared and paranoid. I even do this with strangers. If I walk by someone and I hear them laugh, I&#39;ll immediately think their laughing or talking about me. I try to brush it off until I forget about it, but it happens a lot. <br>I don&#39;t know if any others have this type of paranoia but there are some cases where it&#39;s just my mind and I know it, yet I still hate it. I feel as if there are cameras in my room, that people can read my mind, that things can pop out at me. I check the halls whenever I walk out of my room to make sure no one&#39;s there. I check above me as well. When ever I think that someone can read my mind, I think of a distraction to see if anyone is doing so, like imagining something crashes through the wall; who ever flinches or looks in the direction of the distraction is obviously reading my mind. I do this everyday as well. <br>When I wake up in the middle of the night, I immediately thinks there&#39;s this ungodly creature waiting for me to move. So I don&#39;t move. At all. And I know it&#39;s not real and I&#39;m fine, but it&#39;s just my mind and it&#39;s just like, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re gonna die if you move. Hope you&#39;re not planning on sleeping&quot;.

At my junior high, they brought in some mental health professionals, and had some of us take tests and then talk with the staff after. The test results showed that a panic disorder and social anxiety was present, but when I tried to explain my panic attacks, the lady quickly wrote me off and said it <i>wasn&#39;t</i> panic attacks. Uhm, excuse me? I got so stressed out at a restaurant one time I couldn&#39;t breathe, accidentally  made myself vomit and just cried in the bathroom for over ten minutes, and here you are telling me that it&#39;s not valid? Anyways, she said I probably had a social anxiety disorder but said I might say something to my parents about a follow-up with a doctor. I told my parents, and they kind of just wrote it off. I have some &quot;coping mechanisms,&quot; bur they don&#39;t help me whilst in the social situations I get crippling fear during. I know everyone I&#39;ve talked to says being diagnosed with a disorder was the worst day of their life, but my parents seem to be avoiding my diagnosis and making me deal with it. I actually got up the courage to ask about anti-anxiety meds to my mom, and she said they increase depression, especially in teens like myself. I already <i>have</i> mild depression, so why not prescribe me a low dose of anti-depressants? She takes both those medications (though she has GAD) so I thought she would understand. But it doesn&#39;t really seem like she does. For example, I&#39;ve been wanting a ukulele for a really long time. We went to the store and I found one I liked, but the part where they kept the ukes and guitars and such was in an different room than everything else, so no workers were there. My mom said I had to go and tell a worker I wanted to buy it, but I couldn&#39;t, We wasted half an hour with me just shaking my head and her and my sister trying to convince me it was easy. To me, it just isn&#39;t. My sister definitely doesn&#39;t understand that, and my mom hasn&#39;t been affected by her anxiety for years, due to the medication. She eventually got tired of it and asked someone, but was annoyed with me later.

I&#39;ve always been on the skittish side and come fifth grade I was diagnosed with Anxiety when I had my first panic attack (or at least when I first figured out what those episodes of intense fear were called.) It was tough, but I saw various therapists and managed to somewhat gain control over my anxiety. Then suddenly, in my second year of high school, that all fell apart. My panic attacks spun out of control and very soon I was barely able to leave home because of how severe my attacks and fear of future attacks was. I was missing school and driving my poor mom nuts. She did her best to comfort me whenever I had attacks and was always there for me but then she also got understandably frustrated with me, too. Finally I went to a psychiatrist to try medication, my parents weren&#39;t too thrilled about it because they were afraid it&#39;d turn me into a &quot;zombie&quot;, but in fact after I started taking it things started to look up. It didn&#39;t happen all at once, after all medication takes time to build up and start working and even with the medication helping I still had to bite the bullet and go back to school and try to piece my life back together after it had very nearly fallen apart. It wasn&#39;t easy, but thanks to my meds, the support of my friends and family, and my own perseverance I was able to tough it out and get my life back. I&#39;m proud to say I&#39;m finishing my second year of college and panic attacks are nearly a thing of the past for me. I still suffer from mini panic attacks from time to time and, rarely, bigger ones, but I&#39;m able to function and stand on my own two feet and I&#39;m no longer terrified of leaving the house or of going places by myself. :)", "comment_date": "2017-02-09T04:35:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bleach", "comment_text": "My brother knocks on doors ect to make sure they&#39;re close up to 20 min. and switches the nightlamp on and off up  to 30 min. when he knocks the doors,he kind of makes sounds and movements that are weird.My brother visits the doctor too often,he believes that he has a tumor up to kidney stones ect...this goes on for years wtf is wrong with him?", "comment_date": "2017-02-08T21:59:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaytlen Harms", "comment_text": "I agree that people tend to minimize the significance of mental disorders by making fun of them.

Anxiety has been an... emotion... or feeling that has been associated with humans most likely for the last hundreds of thousands of years. It&#39;s basically our brains telling us that it can&#39;t process a situation. Or that the outcome of a situation was uncertain. So when hunters found themselves surrounded by predators, for example, they would experience anxiety. Why was this useful? Well think about the symptoms of anxiety. The two most common (and vague) symptoms of anxiety are Hypervigilance and Sweating. For those of you who don&#39;t know, hypervigilance is basically sensory sensitivity. Meaning you hear better, see better, can focus better, etc.... which is a dead give away of why it could be use full in a high stakes situation. And sweating, well... you need to keep your body cool. Any ways. Anxiety is a tool that we humans have been equipped with, to help us survive. The problem today is that people are finding it harder and harder to differentiate between situations that should cause them anxiety and situations that shouldn&#39;t. So these symptoms are coming at unwanted times. What I&#39;m basically saying is that people don&#39;t know how to process complicated situations anymore thanks to our societies accomplishments of eliminating such complications. So now we&#39;re stuck with this fight or flight mode and our brain is turning it on when our socks don&#39;t match. The fix is simple. Teach our children how to keep calm and process difficult situations instead of keeping them protected from anything and everything from the outside world. Or they are going to end up thinking that not bringing a pen to class is the end of the world.

As you were reading this you probably considered this something that you do or is very common, yes it is, everyone does it, but what differs me from you or ruminating to normal is that this thought can be all i think about in a day, or a week, or a month, and it would be considered and obsession hence the name obsessive compulsive disorder. I worry too much, my decisions, other people&#39;s decisions they could be all i think about. So when i must explain that i have OCD, the first things anyone ever says to me is &quot;but your not clean&quot; and that&#39;s true, my rooms is a mess, i never do my laundry, my lockers a mess, but it&#39;s probably because i spend all my time thinking things over and over and over. The definition of obsession or obsess is &quot;preoccupy or fill the mind continually, intrusively, and to a troubling extent.&quot; nowhere in this dictionary definition do i see the word clean, neat, tidy.

What i mean by that is that religion and weed might not be dangerous for all and in itself, but to some a mixture of those things especially, can worsen or even cause the psykosis. If you are scared of what &quot;god&quot; might think about  every little step you take, its time reevaluate your life, and your thinking patterns, some traumas and past rejections hidden beneath perfectionism and workaholicnism cause the distress, and you cant see it, you think its only anxiety, but its more than that. You need to selfanalyse, for then, NOT analysing that much, cause if we cant snap out of analysing, something i have a difficult time doing, it makes us even more crazy and paranoid. So the road towards sanity lies in what YOU are willing to do, and say goodby to of habbits and negative things you have identified yourself with..

It is indeed a bittersweet experience to think of it, I hate it for the fact that I have to do presentation in front of people while struggling with this social anxiety, but also I do feel grateful because I got no choice but to practice to get over my social anxiety by doing tons of presentations. Because if not I would avoid them at any cost and stuck in anxiety loop forever. I&#39;m in college now and I can feel my anxiety are lower than my high school days, I get less sweating &amp; shaking, I started converstations (which I&#39;ve never dared to do it before) and even I volunteered to do something.

I have about 3 friends that I feel completley normal around, except a slight fear that I am going to screw something up that always follows me. I also have 5ish other friends that I feel sort of okay talking to, but sometimes just feel the need to make up an excuse and runaway from a conversation with them to calm down. Besides those friends, I find it very, very hard to talk to anyone even remotely my age, and if they start a conversation I say about 2 sentances max., then I just try to slowly non-awkwardly get away from the conversation. I actively avoid talking to any strangers(well, at least IRL that is, the internet feels like a seperate entity for me) and every time a person comes up and talks to me, and I feel like that person is... &quot;cool&quot; I guess? Just generaly fits my personality in any case, and I try to contact them on facebook, I just can&#39;t get myself to send the message, because of the fear that the person will react negatively in real life and will think less of me, so I just sit and watch the message for 15 minutes, then delete it.

So i gave her my number and we briefly talked, later that day she texted me and we started texting, i saw her the next day at the conference again and tried to talk to her more but i noticed she was a bit shy and didn&#39;t make much of it.The day came to an end and we parted ways while we continued to text. Little by little we got to know each other and i just completely love the way she is, hoe she thinks and everything about her. I then asked her when would i see her again and she opened up to me telling me about her dating anxiety,it seemed like she had it pretty severely for even us talking about it made her really uncomfortable and she felt really bad. At that point i thought it was a question of her being comfortable around me, but time kept going, we got even closer, but she feels the same way. Its been almost 3 months now and i can&#39;t see myself without her anymore, but at the same time don&#39;t see future anymore. she seems unwilling to meet up,(also we do live 1 hour away) and I&#39;ve read about it so i never try to pressure her to do it or anything. please any suggestions will help,how can i change her mind?", "comment_date": "2016-04-30T02:55:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renae", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not really sure if this is a panic attack or not so can someone help me?<br> I&#39;m really shy but I know I don&#39;t have social anxiety or anything and I&#39;m not depressed so I&#39;m kind of confused.<br> It was really late at night and I was just watching YouTube videos like I usually do and I just started shaking and freaking out.

Also, just this year, my English teacher made us do speeches to practice public-speaking. The first speech was a disaster. I was so upset and anxious that I couldn&#39;t sleep for nearly the whole week before the speech. I even begged the councilor to give me a pass from speaking for one day. Then, the next day, I was sitting there for ten minutes before we started speaking writing &#39;I hate speeches.&#39; over and over again in my English notebook. I was having a very hard time breathing and crying my eyes out. When it was my turn to read my speech I still couldn&#39;t stop myself from crying and couldn&#39;t keep quiet about it. My friends tried to calm me down, but as my teacher approached I grew even more anxious of giving my speech. I wanted to skip my speech, but my fear of failure overpowered me. My teacher gave me some bullshit advice and that she&#39;d base me purely on my own abilities and ushered me to the front of the class. I was so embarrassed about crying so much, but I still hadn&#39;t been able to stop. I stood in front of the class, shaking all over, for several minutes and muttered repeatedly, &quot;Give me a few minutes.&quot; to the class. Eventually, I was forced to start and began to quietly give my speech, trying to wipe away the tears. I started crying as soon as I sat down again, fearful of getting a horrible grade. I had wanted to read off my speech as an attempt to calm my nerves, but my teacher had declined. That&#39;s probably the worst my fear of public speaking has been in a while.

If you do as I say, as I am asking you, this heavenly joy will become more and more available to you and you will share this joy more and more freely. You will be a true representative of heaven in your joy and others will be attracted to the heaven that you represent.\u00a0<br><br>I want you to believe Me when I tell you that you can trust Me. If you could not trust Me, dear apostles, why would you continue to follow Me? The answer is that you can trust Me, of course, or you would fall away as others have fallen away. You do trust Me. You rely on Me and you are safe with Me. You have made a wise decision by putting yourself into My care. It is always the best decision to rely on the One who loves you perfectly and holds, in His heart, the perfect plan for your time on earth.\u00a0<br><br>Why would you let fear diminish your joy? Why would you let anxiety for yourself or others eradicate the joy that is available to you in the present moment? My dearest apostles, you live in the present, not the future. If the present is difficult, I am there. If the future becomes difficult, I will be there, too. You will not be abandoned and your loved ones will not be abandoned. Ultimately, the greater the trust in Me, the greater the joy in each moment. I want you to abandon fear. I want you to cast yourself into the providence that surrounds you. Fear is a snare for you or I would not treat it so seriously.\u00a0<br><br>Ask Me now for greater trust and I will give it to you. Ask Me now for greater joy and I will give that to you, also. It is important that others see in you an accurate reflection of the graces heaven makes available to apostles. Do not hide these graces away. Let these graces flow out from you to those around you. Share what is good, dear apostles, not what is bad. Share what comes from Me and you will help to draw others back into our family. I am telling you that I have greater graces available to you so make your Jesus happy and ask for these graces. You will be blessed with all that you need and joy will be yours. Be at peace.

Here&#39;s a story: My dad is the kind of person that wants everyone to like him. However, our neighbors aren&#39;t exactly the most friendly. They haven&#39;t really done much to us, but they don&#39;t like us. My dad cannot stand it when someone does not like him. He has become EXTREMELY paranoid about this and does all sorts of weird things, such as duck around the windows so that no neighbor will see him. Make note that before we moved into the house he wasn&#39;t like this. Anyways, so that isn&#39;t all he does. Sometimes he will tell me and my mom things that have supposedly happened before. Once he said the neighbors had installed cameras everywhere, and he heard a hovering noise behind his ear and there was a helicopter there (not a toy one). The problem is, that isn&#39;t possible since there are too many big trees in my backyard for a helicopter to even fly close to there. In another instance, he said that I, (yes, me) was locked outside the backyard door and they were throwing things at me. First of all, I have never been locked out of the house. Secondly,  the only things that have gone over our privacy femce are some oranges (they tried to feed our horse) and toy rockets that they shot towards our house. Today, he unexpectedly put our house up for sale and we had never planned that, not for even years. Not this soon. In the car, he explained to me that apparently Satan had taken over our home, making me and my mom so &quot;hateful and angry&quot;. He always talks as if he is dying and says my mom is going to die if we aren&#39;t nice to her. I honestly don&#39;t know what is wrong with him. He has increasingly gotten worse. I am really worried. Does anyone have any idea if he has a mental disorder and if so, what disorder it is? I want to know, since I am so concerned, Thank you for reading all the way down here.

Hank does an &quot;okay&quot; job describing OCD and I put that in quotations because he is obviously smart and reads a-lot. Everything sounds like it came out of a text book. Unless you&#39;ve personally experienced any type of disorder first hand you will never be able to comprehend, help, or explain it in it&#39;s truest form. Before I had OCD I was fascinated with psychology so when OCD came over me apart of me was actually intrigued with how my brain obsessed over one &quot;thought&quot; and &quot;why&quot; so I pretty much saw myself as an experiment instead of getting caught up in fear. Now, it didn&#39;t start off that way. I always struggled with anxiety due to irrational fears and after my life came crashing down in November of 2013 I developed OCD. I was scared out of my mind because the rational side of me couldn&#39;t comprehend why I would obsess over something so stupid. Not knowing it was OCD at first made it worse because all my &quot;focus&quot; was revolved around my &quot;thoughts&quot; and symptoms. The main struggle with OCD is &quot;focus&quot; because unless you divert your attention elsewhere you cannot cure OCD. The only reason it&#39;s so hard to do that is because of the importance you&#39;ve given that one single thought which has automatically triggered a negative sensation in your body &quot;anxiety&quot; therefore your brain thinks something is wrong with that thought and you obsess over it. It&#39;s as if every time you think of it an alarm is set off in your brain. The more you think about it or anything related to it period will only prolong your OCD. After 2 months of suffering and rushing thoughts, hoping it would go away I realized something was seriously wrong. I then came to realize I had developed OCD and read that curing it was only possible with professional help using coginitive behavioral therapy and ERP. I don&#39;t like to believe everything I read so I decided to learn as much as I could about OCD and the brain. I studied endlessly, persistently, day in and day out for 2 more months and when I had finally wrapped my head around the whole ordeal I realized that it isn&#39;t all that scary and I wasn&#39;t going to let this get the best of me. I was going to cure myself and within the next two months of practicing mindful awareness, patience, and perseverance I was free from OCD. It wasn&#39;t easy, but nothing in life is easy and if you want something you have to be willing to fight for it, work day and night for it, you would be surprised what you can accomplish when you set your mind to something. At first I struggled but I kept at it and eventually it stuck. Never let anyone tell you that you can&#39;t do something, If I can cure myself on my own and it&#39;s been a year since then... anyone can. I didn&#39;t get into much detail but if anyone is in desperate need of help feel free to message me.

Hours passes anxiety goes to lower level, back to being disorientaded and depressrd. This is a contineus thing, just terrible. The one thing I can conform is that when you have depresions combined with GaD then sometimes you have more problems wihh GaD which makes you less depress or you have more problems with depression which takes away the anxiety.

A lot of it no doubt stems from people&#39;s desire to be edgy and cool and dark or whatever. Personally, that sort of thing annoys the hell out of me. If you met me, you&#39;d never think anything was mentally unbalanced about me; those who know me(mostly family as I have...well, no friends) know I&#39;m intelligent creative and a good person. But....for years now(5 years maybe?) I&#39;ve basically lived within my apartment 24/7. I leave maybe once every 3 days, only to get something from the convenience store a block away. That&#39;s IT.<br><br>When I&#39;m out in public...there&#39;s something horribly oppressive about it. Society is LOUD and BRIGHT and aggressive and harsh and abrasive. When I&#39;m home, I feel ok...sometimes even quite happy. But, I find people and public life to be overwhelmingly hostile. You know when people will say something really mean and judgmental, and then follow it up with, &quot;What?? I&#39;m just bein&#39; honest. Just bein&#39; real.&quot; Well, that&#39;s what ALL of public society feels like to me. Just a giant <i>mean</i> place devoid of intelligence, compassion, creativity, and warmth.<br><br>However, because of this, I&#39;ve lost many jobs...and cannot leave my apartment to find a job. The few times I&#39;ve tried, I&#39;ve had <i>horrible</i> panic attacks. I know it hurts my parents greatly...and they try to help. It truly sucks. I WANT to be a part of society...I don&#39;t want to die a recluse, but, I&#39;m not sure how to take the first step and do what to me feels like jumping into a bath of acid.<br><br>I will say, marijuana helps a LOT....I mean a huge huge amount. Sadly, it&#39;s illegal where I live(TN) and I can barely come by it. If only I had that whenever I needed it, my life would utterly transform. It calms me, focuses me, allows me to see the good in life, and feel ok in my own skin in public. But no, the government won&#39;t ALLOW me that....which I find utterly evil. It disgusts me that I&#39;m barred from using something that would transform my life because a handful of Senators deem it unworthy of Americans or something. Yet <i>another</i> reason why I find society gross and harsh and worth avoiding.<br><br>Is there anyone else who can relate? I&#39;ve lived like this for 5 years or so now. I&#39;m 31...and I simply can&#39;t waste my life anymore. I feel I&#39;ve got too much potential to be couped-up inside forever. Yes, I feel safe and often happy here....but I don&#39;t want to do this forever. And yes.....I&#39;ve gone to doctors, been prescribed meds, done therapy, etc etc etc. The <b><i>ONLY</i></b> thing that&#39;s ever helped is marijuana. But, when I mentioned that to a doctor, you know what his reaction was? <i>&quot;Oh...so you have a drug problem too? Here, I&#39;ll prescribe you some Xanax; it&#39;ll help.&quot;</i> I almost didn&#39;t know what to say...I thought he was joking. Plus, marijuana isn&#39;t physically addictive and has zero negative side effects(for me)...<i>quite unlike</i> the Rx fucking <i>narcotics</i> I&#39;ve been prescribed in the past. It angers me beyond words how strangers will vote to keep it illegal, unaware of the harm they perpetrate. It&#39;s sickening.<br><br>Sigh.... sorry for the long post. Can <i>anyone</i> relate?

Now I know that&#39;s the common trajectory for developing many mental health issues--every part of my life was full of compulsions and things completely fell apart before I finally went to get help.

That&#39;s not the case. We&#39;ve made the shift to preventative, proactive care when it comes to physical health, but culturally, our approach to mental health lags behind.

It is not helpful to wait until things get so bad that your world is falling apart and your harming yourself. There are many opportunities to deal with anxiety disorders before things get that bad and there is an amazing range of effective ways to recover fully from an anxiety disorder so you can do things you want to do in life and go the places you want to go, rather than constantly reacting to fears and uncertainties.

It was one of the hardest challenges I have faced in my life, but I beat it.<br><br>People who gossip, &quot;Oh, he must have OCD&quot; are ignorant fools. Psychiatrists aren&#39;t very useful because they base their analyzes on a text book definition of OCD, the only thing they gave me was drugs (because that fixes everything).

No one can force you to face or\u00a0 beat it, just know that in the end you will be better off without it. \u00a0 \u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-09-25T01:29:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rebekah Lewis", "comment_text": "I wish that this video highlighted better that this was a spectrum.

Ok this is from my view of my life not all men or all women so chill out. I was married at a young age taught that there were no divorces so I hung in until there was nothing to hang on to. He left me and abandoned all attempts to try to make it work. I had the problem not him. So I did what any REAL mother would do. I worked like a dog and raised my child until age 19 then he decides he wants to be a Dad now I am the crazy bitch. So here&#39;s my question to all who have been where I have.If I am so f@#$%d up how come he is on his 3rd Marriage break up.So you see we all have things that hurt us love does hurt. I take my share of anything I did that may have harmed my marriage but I refuse to take it all. I lost my Son and my Grandchildren because he thinks I have no feelings and I speak out. I didn&#39;t used to but was encouraged to do so by my Dr. if we keep it bottles in we will lose our minds. If we speak about it who knows it may help another young girl of 27 from trying to take her own life like I did and spent 6 days in hospital. Feeling like I was a failure and now I know I am not. You can&#39;t make someone stay or love you forever. That&#39;s the way I was brought up till death do us part. Not look the other way while your husband plays. I am worth more than that.

I&#39;ve been introverted and anxious my entire life, but it never really became a problem until the age of eleven or so. I started to come up with coping mechanisms and tricks to get by; little things like planning for the next situation (where to look when talking to someone, is the door push or pull, cross or uncross my arms, sit or stand, how many people in the room, how long will I be there, what will I need, who do I know there, what will be required of me, the amount of social interaction, will I be the center of attention, should I smile or look serious, how do I get out of this situation if I need to, etc.), creating a personality for a situation (mirroring others&#39; personalities, actions and behaviors mostly, sometimes outright lying and acting), and some misc. compulsive behaviors to calm myself down (mostly counting, controlling my breathing and doing things with my hands; things that wouldn&#39;t be noticed by others or bring attention to me). I have no friends (I outright prefer NOT to have friends), I distance myself from others (people at work hardly know me, I avoid my neighbors/people I see on a daily basis, etc.) and being around people - even when not interacting with them - is exhausting and stressful. My brain is constantly abuzz with thoughts like &quot;look away, you&#39;re staring too long&quot; and &quot;breath in, breath out; from the diaphragm not the chest, don&#39;t let them see you&quot;. Because of this inner dialogue to keep me functional in the real world, it can be difficult for me to do much else than just that: function. I am always tense and closed in, ready for anything at any moment. My heart races, my head is pounding and I&#39;m sweating. When I&#39;m finally alone or around a single person that I can trust and feel comfortable around, it is like the world get quiet. I can breathe again and my mind is at ease. It is a beautiful feeling, but a very lonely one. No matter how many times I snuggle my dog or talk to myself, I will always be friendless and isolated. I&#39;m not shy and I do get lonely. I don&#39;t hate people and I have things to say. Having social anxiety, for me, is very debilitating on my social life (obviously), work life (promotions are hard if no one knows you), school life (I&#39;m afraid to go to college; what if I can&#39;t handle it?), and inner life. Having social anxiety can cause feelings of low self esteem, contributes to depression and loneliness. On the one hand, I want to be alone, but on the other hand, I miss people. I want to know them. I meet people that I want to interact with and get to know, but I am too afraid to risk it. What if I can&#39;t handle it? What if they don&#39;t understand? What if they reject me? What if I turn out to NOT like them, how do I get rid of them without being rude? How do I tell people that I miss them and care about them.... but I don&#39;t want to see them, talk to them or spend time with them? One begins to question if it is even possible to truly connect with others with those kind of limitations. I don&#39;t expect people who don&#39;t have social anxiety disorder to understand, and I really don&#39;t want them to, on some level. I kind of wish it was this big secret I could keep so I could keep acting normal forever.<br><br>I&#39;m not sure if that is an accurate description of SAD (pffft, that minimalism) \u00a0for everyone, but that has been my experience.", "comment_date": "2014-09-09T20:32:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sleepy Pup", "comment_text": "I&#39;m freaked out by rainbows.

I&#39;m young (Still in highschool) so it was really weird to me that I kept getting sharp chest pains and feeling dizzy out of no where. So I started basically diagnosing myself with all sorts of things, like I was having a heart attack, or that my blood veins were &quot;deformed&quot;. At one point I questioned if I was just dead and it was like, the afterlife. I made my parents take my to the doctors and I made sure I ruled out every possible thing that could be wrong. But even when I sat right there and watched the heart monitor or saw the results of my tests as healthy, I was still sure that I had something wrong with me. At one point they thought I had a blood clot, and I was so happy because I thought &quot;Finally they found what was wrong and this&#39;ll all end.&quot; But I was upset when I didn&#39;t actually have one, which really sounds weird. I also had this &quot;dizziness&quot; that made things not even seem real, and I really thought people were saying scripts just to mess with me. The panic attacks were awful too, and I still have &quot;anxiety&quot; about certain things I guess. For example, I had a panic attack while taking a bath, so I would bathe less frequently, which made me feel even worse. And I still feel a little anxious when I&#39;m in the bathtub. The panic attacks just led me in loops too, because I would have one when I thought something was wrong, or something hurt, and panic attacks just made me hurt even more. Eventually I didn&#39;t want to sleep because my brain created nightmares about what I was going through in real life. I couldn&#39;t even sleep and be in peace. Then I just didn&#39;t want to wake up and didn&#39;t really care if I died anymore. And at the same time I wanted to live so badly. Then people called me a hypochondriac for being so worried about my health, and a druggy for being on anxiety/depression medication. So seeing like, things about meth or weed (I&#39;m in Colorado where weed is legal too) really freaked me out for a while, and I wouldn&#39;t/still don&#39;t take simple things like cough drops.<br><br>TL;DR: Anxiety really sucks, and doesn&#39;t just go away. And to anyone out there dealing with anxiety, especially at a young age, just know that it&#39;ll get better. You won&#39;t be like this forever, and you aren&#39;t the only one with it. Some things might change about you, but with willpower, you can change those things back. Unless those changes are for the better of course. And also, don&#39;t feel bad about taking medication to help you get through something. If it helps you, it helps you, and it helps you get through another day. Just make sure its the right thing for you, and if you feel uncomfortable with it, then talk to a doctor to get you off of it.", "comment_date": "2014-09-03T22:55:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Sterr", "comment_text": "Poisonous snakes?\u00a0<br>Venomous snakes Hank.

On places where I go daily I do not count always, just about every second day or so and I do various countings, like the 60 steps are 4 x 15 steps with a little &quot;plattform&quot; between them. Sometimes I cound just up to 15 and then from 0 again, sometimes to 60, sometimes in base 8 (I know I am weird), you get the picture.<br><br>Also when walking on tiled floors I avoid stepping on the edges and adjust my step size to match the size of the tiles. If the tiles are too small and odd shaped (like on the paving on the train plattform I walk on every day) I search for repeating patterns on which I prefer to step. I must look crazy as the patterns make me &quot;rotate&quot; my foot... But again, I do not do it always, but really much more often than a normal person. In fact I have never seen anybody else doing it. I do it especially when waiting for a train and killing time, I search and walk patterns I recognize in the &quot;patchwork&quot; of the paving blocks. However when I need to catch the train I forget about everything and run normally, ignoring the edges. So it does not affect me that much, just when there is no hurry.<br><br>Another thing is turning corners. After every 90\u00b0 turn I feel like a sprung and have to return to my original direction, this feeling fades away after a few steps. What I feel especially unpleasant is to walk a way in a shopping mall for example around a pillar when I have to take something that is just behind it and rotate 360\u00b0 to get where I was, it is as if I felt a &quot;tension&quot; which I can release only by rotating myself standing on one spot in the opposite direction. This has become less of an issue over the years, but as a child it was very unpleasant.<br><br>I also find myself counting the number of axles of passing trains. I know that some people count the number of cars of a passing train, this is pretty normal, but I cound axles. And this is sometimes a challange as there are 2, 3, 4 and 6 axle cars in mixed freight trains. If it passes by fast I get confused sometimes. Especially the three axle cars are a challange when mixed with four axle cars that look similar. But again, I do not cound every passing train, just most of them. I feel irriatated when something blocks the train I was couning, like another train or when I am counting when sitting in a moving train and a fence abruptly stops my counting without finishing it.

They don&#39;t realize how absolutely terrified I am of spiders, \u00a0because they don&#39;t realize that phobias are not like normal fears; the paralyzing feeling you get when you are submitted to your trigger is like being attacked from all sides, and you feel like throwing yourself of a bridge in that moment. You even feel that way when you&#39;re only thinking about the trigger. What&#39;s worse is that because people just don&#39;t understand, they think it&#39;s fun to prank you every now and then. Luckily, my room always seems to have spiders in it, and since I have forced myself to stay in that room (at first I only fell asleep once exhaustion set in, even though I had gotten someone to kill the spiders), I have been gradually able to reduce my anxiety in situations with small spiders. I am now able to stay calm in the presence of smaller spiders, and through meditation I have been able to reduce situations in which I work myself into a frenzy just by thinking about spiders. If there is a point to this I would say that it is if you have a phobia, do your best not to avoid that phobia (you don&#39;t have to actively seek it, just not avoid it) and after a while the phobia will become much more manageable as you aren&#39;t reinforcing the behaviour.

At the time,where the illness was already part of my life, I enrolled only in classes that did not check attendance, just expected extensive projects in the end. I attended less and less seminars and in the end did not leave the house for 3 months. At that time i had a job, doing outhouse graphics for an agency - i only communicated with them via mail and telephone. Since I was able to hold down this job all the time, I thought: nothing wrong with me. see. I have a job. And hey, i AM studying. Not in the unniversiy, but at home. Maybe I am just lazy. I lied to my friends and family how my classes went and what i had done that day.<br>I got my friends to pick up groceries for me. I always had a good excuse, why i looked like a sleep depraved corpse. That flue i was getting over, nightshift at the agency... At the peak of my anxiety, i was afraid of everything &quot;officy&quot; - telephones i did not know, voices on the phone i had not talked to before, mail boxes, clocks. I redesigned everything on my computer to not look official. On the last day of that semester I had to turn in a project. I had done about half the work that others had done and came to the presentation - heavy makeup, wide clothes. I knew, that for the sake of my sanity, i had to pass at least one class - see - i am studying! The professor saw something in my work and gave me a very good grade and a very long, hard stare. I was so relieved... a feeling i had not had for months, that my body gave up. I broke down crying, completely lost it. Much later i understand, that my body knew - i could not go into the semester vacation. i could not be without contact. I am sure now, that i would not have survived. The professor then saved my life.\u00a0<br>She got me into her office and regularly checked on my while she took other students finals. I was just crying. When I had calmed down a little, she talked to me about her own sickness and how a psychiatrist had helped her and how she had suspected from seeing my paintings. She gave me the the address and telephone number.<br>I took all my courage to call that psychiatrist and got an appointment 2 months later. 2 months. But i really did not make my point on the phone, that i needed help now. I was talking to somebody i did not know. I do not know, what i did those two months. This appointment and the way, the professor saw through me when i was hiding from everybody else... I later found things i did in that time. I had hidden away everything buerocratic in that time - i found invoices and paperwork behind cuports and book cases and do not remember having put them there, i hid my student file, my tax report, i wrote an irratic message to the financial ministry, who asked for my tax report and other thing...<br><br>In the end, it took almost a year to be fully enrolled in a treatment. I got antidepressants that helped ease that permanent feeling of tension (but also caused nightmares so severe and horrible, that I had several sessions just about the induced nightmares) and a behavioral therapy, that first taught me, how to calm myself down in public and explored, how i can cope with reality again.\u00a0<br>I had to change my life. There was not the one thing that put me there. But many things that made my mind compulsively go into a very dark place - seeing threat where one was and over-interpreting negative things.\u00a0<br>To this day, I have to force myself to go out at least once a week, am usually drenched in sweat when i talked to a person on the phone I do not know (but I DO make those calls). I spot avoidance behavior and try to work against it and am always, ALWAYS honest to the people i trust and told them, how to behave, what kind of help... helps me personally. \u00a0I also know other people that have similar issues and try to help their loved ones to find the right way to deal.<br>It doesn&#39;t have to get that bad. As soon as you spot behaviour that takes away quality of your life to avoid something unpleasant, be really, really honest to yourself. Sometimes... it is just laziness or no time for conflict ; ) - but if it becomes a patter that you cannot get out of on your own anymore, it is not shame to ask for help. I did not see myself worthy of a professional therapist, because there are people with really bad problems out there - schizophrenia! Delusions! I did not even get, that I was afraid, i thought, i was just lazy with all this avoiding and not going shopping for myself. But... i could not participate in society. I could not &quot;enrich&quot; it - work a job, support others. You letting yourself be helped helps everybody.<br><br>Sorry for this essay. IT felt so good to type all that out.
