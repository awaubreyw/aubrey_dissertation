The point he seems to be missing is, no free country has a law that provides freedom from being offended. Offending someone isn&#39;t a crime.\u00a0 If this sort of behavior(hypersensitivity to virtually anything) is not only permitted but encouraged, through apologies and self censorship, then soon any rational conversation won&#39;t be permissible out of fear of offending someone. Thankfully, our forefathers (USA) didn&#39;t feel this way or we&#39;d still be under English rule. There&#39;s no way you can have CHANGE in a country without offending people. People in SC are offended that people want their flag removed, people in TX are offended that certain groups don&#39;t want creationism taught in science class. If you are offended by something, good, that&#39;s how life is supposed to work. Just another example of the pussafication of our country.

Dinosaurs evolved for a low oxygen world that was perpetuated by Pangea, which had very little coastline and continental shelf and the interior had a lot of desert, so less overall photosynthesis happening. Dinosaurs, along with today&#39;s birds, have a respiratory advantage with their lung design, hence why they were able to displace the mammal like reptiles at the end of the Triassic. As the continents split, oxygen got higher and dinosaurs got bigger in the late Jurassic and evolved a lot of giant sauropods. The herbivore pressure on the plants pushed the evolution of flowering plants, which could grow faster and were more effective. Oxygen levels then reached today&#39;s levels and the world actually favored mammals. But Triceratops, T-Rex, Parasaurolophus, Ankylosaurus evolved at at that point and they were adapted to eating flowering plants. But then the deccan traps erupted and a new form of plankton that thrived in high oxygen removed a lot of CO2 from the atmosphere in the form of chalk (that the cretaceous was known for) and sea levels dropped. Some scientists think only 10 dinosaur species were left when the impact happened. So it seems that the impact wasn&#39;t actually needed to get mammal dominance. Also, I think the ammonites were also adapted to low oxygen like the dinosaurs were.", "comment_date": "2015-07-03T02:10:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clayton Krumm", "comment_text": "Hey Phil, what&#39;s your sign?", "comment_date": "2015-07-03T02:05:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vincent Medani", "comment_text": "I saw a bolide once.
