Then, the story of his life is told through others, each having their own biases and perspectives on both life and Kane himself. Therefore, we cannot fully trust what they say about him, especially considering how most of them had some kind of falling-out with Kane. I thought it was fascinating how the film took (or, perhaps, helped to form) the concept of the unreliable narrator and translated it into four (five, if you count the butler&#39;s brief contribution) unreliable narrators.

I mean, the film is so literary, I guess that&#39;s what makes me feel differently about rosebud.... There is this cave of what is considered classical and medieval wealth for many cultures (precious materials, art, objects with intrinsic value not just representative value) maintained in a massive castle like estate, property based medieval/modern wealth in a European centric, which is all acquired and maintained through the very modern we lath gaining structure of capitalism via industrialization and modernization and business which blatantly intercedes politics. None of these systems recognize rosebud as having any value, intrinsic or representative:  its used as fuel (especially noteworthy considering in industrial/capital overtones) Kane sought all the glories known to western European societies, yes Rosebud was his innocent childhood, but it was also his father, his mother, the home he grew up in outside of those realms of wealth, and when they all coalesced onto his life, his mother inheriting land with precious resources to be used for industry, a business transaction, it destroyed his family. I mean, he could think of Rosebud, this modern, gleamy factory-ish produced sleigh (I am assuming) was a death knoll for his capacity to fully experience life and know love. It may not have been a longing for rosebud in his quote, but the summation of forces and societal structures that impeded his life. His mother wanted him to be stable, which meant money, education, etc, he could always have a rosebud, have what he needed, wanted. but I think he came to understand none of that provided him with stability or need-satisfaction of any serious quality. Rosebud in the fire can be a damnation of modern society and the unseen powers at play, peoples doomed ideas of what will constitute a full life; or the former, the question of when wealth and value of familial and human ties will be fundamentally appreciated bu human societies (cant speak for pre-society or traditional human communities) as as valuable as everything in that cave and the mansion and land its contained in, the businesses that built it, or perhaps even more.

(event though I&#39;ve seen it 5 times for school and such) It&#39;s long, plodding, unrelateable, and worst of all: Boring. The WRH connection was what made this movie famous. Even though there are new techniques in cinematography, lighting, etc. it&#39;s just not as great as it is. They always claim that you have to watch it multiple times to &#39;really&#39; understand what is going on, or notice subtle things. But if you constantly have to explain things, you&#39;re telling not showing, and that&#39;s one of the worst things to do in story writing.  I could go on forever but I won&#39;t. I hate this movie.

And if you think about it, Citizen Kane doesn\u2019t really have a mind-blowing plot.
