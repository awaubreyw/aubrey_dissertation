For muscle function, it would be awesome to see stuff like what muscle we use to abduct our shoulders, or hips. Just putting it out there because kinsiology, although similar to both anatomy and physiology, it goes it in to much more depth and it would be so beneficial to have it be it is own category.

First, the anatomical directions are conventional for ALL organisms, not just humans. So when I define a cranio-caudal axis it could stand for an vertical axis in humans but for a horizontal axis for a quadruped or a laying human. &quot;Cranio&quot; means skull and &quot;caudal&quot; means tail, which are two invariable points in anatomy. If a person is lying on his back cranial would mean to the left or to the right depending on where you are standing in regard to the person as the axis is horizontal. The same goes with caudal. Take for example the planes. How are you going to call them if not by their conventional names? In standing position the hand would be the superior member, the leg would be the inferior, the same goes in dorsal decubitus (that&#39;s when the patient is on his back). If you&#39;d call superior - high and inferior - low, in laying position, the hand cannot be described as &quot;higher&quot; than the leg or the leg &quot;lower&quot; than the hand. It just doesn&#39;t make sense. Then you have what&#39;s called lateral and medial which cannot be substituted with right and left, because left and right depends on the direction you are facing, but medial is always medial and lateral is always lateral. The utility of these terms comes from the fact that in anatomy the subject is the spatial reference for himself, whereas when you use traditional directions like right, left, up, down, etc, you do it using yourself as a referential.\u00a0<br>Imagine a cut that&#39;s going vertically in the sagittal plane through a nasal cavity, which has a medial and a lateral wall. You cannot call the lateral wall the left or the right wall because you can cut through the right or the left nasal cavity, and directions would always have to change. Lateral wall would mean the left wall for the left cavity and the right wall for the right cavity, whereas left wall for the right cavity would be medial. So if I define the human body as an absolute referential I do not care if the body is standing, on the back, on his right or left side, or sitting.", "comment_date": "2015-01-30T22:10:21Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"uBGl2BujkPQ": {"Introduction to Anatomy & Physiology: Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology #1": {"channel_id": "Ugjp2Tby-Hq4pHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "suki3275", "comment_text": "thanks hank! i just found out i will end my semester of A&amp;P 2 with a final over both A&amp;P 1 and 2. this is a great review", "comment_date": "2015-01-29T03:49:16Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"uBGl2BujkPQ": {"Introduction to Anatomy & Physiology: Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology #1": {"channel_id": "UghvejIorURlSngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Hoshimaru57", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve wondered this ever since I started delving into heavier physics topics: Our atoms are not alive, no individual particle of us is or ever will be alive and atoms are 99.9% empty at that, so how on earth is it that I&#39;m even here.
