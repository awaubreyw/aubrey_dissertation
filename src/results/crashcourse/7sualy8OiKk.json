It was the work of Dr. John Gunnell born in Canada, who became a US Citizen in order to become the general in charge of the Battle of the Bulge. Dr. John Gunnell is the son of Dr. Joseph Merrick the Elephant Man. No reflection of the Elephant Man who was a Catholic. The Merricks were a Catholic family. In fact, I was baptized a Catholic (even though I was already baptized as a Presbyterian as a baby, so I didn&#39;t need to be baptized again. I was already a Christian; but since it meant that I could go to the US, albeit via Canada and Regiopolis College, another Jesuit high school, I agreed. However, John Carey Merrick when he became a young man, he went to Brigham Young University and became a Mormon. He graduated with a BA. He also fought as a boxer by the name of Harry Greb the Pittsburgh Windmill. Obviously he didn&#39;t die. Harry Greb has a boxing website. Dr. John Gunnell decided to discard his US Citizenship in order not to stand trial when the US Supreme Court would ask him to come to Washington DC and if found guilty of making the US responsible for the murder of the six million Jews and then blaming it on Germany (and Germany&#39;s Chancellor Angela Merkel has already planned the trial and execution of Dr. John Gunnell to make him pay for the total destruction of Germany by the US and Queen Elizabeth&#39;s as the British Monarch who approved the death of the six million Jews and the method of how they were murdered, and later tried to prevent the State of Israel from being formed when as a Queen of Great Britain sent British troops to kill the returning freedom fighters who took back their homeland, the Land of Israel, and flew the Star of David as their flag and they choose the color blue as a sing that Israel was going to be a peacefull nation. Therefore Dr. John Gunnell and Elizabeth II are my target to make sure that the UN Tribunals for Justice should be able to have them both tried and executed by the firing squad. As Dr. John Gunnell has already been sentenced to be executed in Israel by the firing squad, but President Donald Trump is harboring him for financial reasons, and as he is also Canadian born and a traitor, he might also be tried by the same UN Tribunals in order to be executed eventually, also for harboring the two criminals former President Barrack Hussein Obama and his FBI Director James Comey who made multiple attempts and succeeded in assassinating and killing Dr. Barrack Hussein Obama Sr; and since President Donald Trump is also harboring them, and since he has also had the Muslim President Obama raping his wife Melania the First Lady in order &#39;to teach her a lesson&#39;, I am seeking the charging and sentencing all these men who are US Traitors (together with their allies in the US, whomever they may be; I am going to charge them through the US Supreme Court and the UN Tribunals until they are all executed by the firing squad. In the meanwhile if I fail, I shall continue to deny the US and Great Britain the signature under which my father who formed the CIA in 1906 put me in charge of rewarding the US Troops that won the US all wars against their enemies after I bring to Justice the US Traitors mentioned and implied in the US -- Victor Nimrud Alexander", "comment_date": "2019-05-18T07:54:29Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"7sualy8OiKk": {"Supreme Court of the United States Procedures: Crash Course Government and Politics #20": {"channel_id": "Ugz7GFwPnxPPzY32WVh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Anthony Pena", "comment_text": "You unpatriotic son of a b, how dare you kick the eagle!", "comment_date": "2019-05-17T14:11:22Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"7sualy8OiKk": {"Supreme Court of the United States Procedures: Crash Course Government and Politics #20": {"channel_id": "Ugw-w2srfXAMhXHvNXl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Jamila Sysselle", "comment_text": "AP GOVT EXAM TOMORROW \u270c\ud83c\udffc\u270c\ud83c\udffc\u270c\ud83c\udffc", "comment_date": "2019-05-05T21:43:37Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"7sualy8OiKk": {"Supreme Court of the United States Procedures: Crash Course Government and Politics #20": {"channel_id": "Ugyb_X4BPthT3xtF7eh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Bernard O'Connor", "comment_text": "not on 8 chan  but on qmap since 17 stage 4 fighting bring it on drop the hammer Q we love you", "comment_date": "2019-04-23T22:06:38Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"7sualy8OiKk": {"Supreme Court of the United States Procedures: Crash Course Government and Politics #20": {"channel_id": "Ugx2MCRA0CAnlONPpih4AaABAg", "comment_by": "The Only Alex Ryder", "comment_text": "Good god Stan put on some cloths", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T02:07:17Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"7sualy8OiKk": {"Supreme Court of the United States Procedures: Crash Course Government and Politics #20": {"channel_id": "UgxKLD8OyM3GDG6XfaB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "PatriciaWalton", "comment_text": "So if the lower court&#39;s are breaking laws, and they continue to abuse their authority, until you have exhausted the lower courts, which could be doomsday when their abusing authority, the supreme court refuse&#39;s to hear it! that is BS!", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T15:35:29Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"7sualy8OiKk": {"Supreme Court of the United States Procedures: Crash Course Government and Politics #20": {"channel_id": "Ugw7DmSiy_OgfVxBGMF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Jennifer", "comment_text": "How is 30 minutes each side enough time?!

The courts are making money off of all of this. In divorce Judge Arkin appointed an attorney in a double role. The first as a GAL paid by the state, but unable to participate in the case because of a lack of psychiatric evaluations or instructions (psychiatrists are licensed through DORA). The second is as my unbundled representation paid by my husband. The double payment method is a laundering of bribe money. Unbundled representation simply shows up - I am supposed to be asked about it and agree, but judges are unregulated. In fact, they are self-regulating. They declared attorneys to be immune. The Supreme Court&#39;s Attorney Regulation Board is a front. The only current duty of an attorney is an oral &quot;consultation.&quot; Nothing else. Read the LexisNexis Introduction. The Judicial Review Committee is made of attorneys who return the favor.
