Isn&#39;t modern a purely &quot;technical&quot; term, not a political or value judgment?  Doesn&#39;t it mean nothing more than &quot;the current time&quot;?  Isn&#39;t everyone, always, living in what, for them, are modern times?  It might be that some societies which value timelessness -- that emphasize stability over change -- have no concept of modernity.  Modernity implies change, that the current age is distinguishable from past ages -- that &quot;ages&quot; or &quot;eras&quot; exist.  A society that wanted to think of itself as part of an eternal classical golden age might find &quot;modern&quot; meaningless.  But for us, I think the question is always &quot;how far back does &#39;modern&#39; extend?&quot;  It extends back as far as seems to be our own era, our own age, a time we recognize, a time we feel we could live in without feeling we were in a historical role play.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a value judgment (modern times when we are no longer barbarians) so much as a comparison (modern times when things have been about like they are now).  For me, I think it&#39;s about World War One.  Before that, horses and carriages, men in top hats as everyday wear, gas lighting, telegrams.  After that, autos, telephones, electricity, movies, sound recordings.  I think the Age of Invention -- specifically consumer-good invention -- defines modernity for most of us.  Politically or philosophically it&#39;s much slipperier.  The rise of democracy?  The recognition of universal human rights?  No, modern times also saw the rise of dictatorship and oppression.  The best that could be said is that many of us ASPIRE to a more small-l liberal political philosophy, yet even that may go too far (as current nationalism in a West that liked to think of itself as liberal points out).  So modernity may be more simply a matter of available consumer technology than anything else.
