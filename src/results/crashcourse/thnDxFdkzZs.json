It is the nucleus that molding the shape and size of the orbitals. During chemical reaction, either heat will be absorbed or dissipated from the nucleus. The changes in stockpile of photons within nucleons will cause them to have different angular momentum. This changes in angular momentum of the nucleons causes the unique nucleus structure to flex differently before and after chemical reaction, therefore an atom or a chemical compound will change its physical and chemical characteristics before and after chemical reactions.

Existing and eternal exist, to probe and to separate the various clusters in concentrated points without space, resulting in an inexistence of cohesion / physical concretion and consequent non-existence of visualizing the bodies and material bodies!
