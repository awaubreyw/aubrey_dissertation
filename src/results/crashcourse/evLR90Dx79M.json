They lost there label,  &quot;the FBI&quot;  from overmarketing(flooded).        All locations that they did have became &quot;corpate offices , with to much buisness to keep track of&quot;.   So they aloud agencies to pick up the slack,  agencies who copied what they did,  ( as corpate offices, but where FAKE, at no authority&quot;.     So the whole scene, of authority, got flooded so to speak.     <br>  <br>Its a old line the FBI was working with &quot;on the line&quot;     So alot of them, where not equipped or talented enough,   to handle the surge of money that was comming in.  It was lots of money, Money every where.  So they kind of got extorted by the system naturally , through politics actions and diplomatic actions.     Its was like a &quot;boom of information, and transactions paperless&quot; .     <br><br>There still good people, they just need probbly alittle more staff now, maybe less contracting, grow. TGB the way i mean it.<br><br><br><br>Its simple ,   No taxes for Americans, and make illegal to have over a million dollars.   ( you have to spend it, by statues, build bridges, roads, real things nice signifigant, pretty, for the community for the city, for the towns, for the land. )   it takes time (and people, americans) to build these things, so they &quot;cost money&quot;   you can use the time in a good way.  TGB the way i mean it.<br>Its really good oppurtunity, to make america, to build america, something that will last, think ancient stuff, think cool stuff, think american.  The ancient America, that will have your roads and building here a 1000 years later. (if your a american billionaire or millionare)  its provactive and worth it.  People will be walking on them for ever,(living) its way better than hiring NGO&#39;s[to IT stuff/internet, or paperwork] to do the same thing your already doing.
