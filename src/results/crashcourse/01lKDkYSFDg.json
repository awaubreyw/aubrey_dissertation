Pretty much all of them think that price ceilings on rent reduce the quantity and quality of the housing that\u2019s available <br>        - Price floor - a law that sets a minimum price in a specific market<br>            - Keeping the price artificially high and not allowing it to fall down to equilibrium<br>                - Higher price would give producers an incentive to produce more, but, at that high price, consumers are instead encouraged to opt for substitutes  <br>                - Argument for price floor - if producers cannot get a high enough price, they\u2019ll stop producing and, in the case of essential products, we will run out of food and suffer<br>        - In terms of actually helping consumers and producers, the vast majority of economists consider price controls counter-productive. But there is one notable exception: minimum wage<br>        - The amount of gas society wants is where supply meets demand. Producing any quantity less than that will result in deadweight loss.<br>            - The quantity produced at the price ceiling is not allocatively efficient<br>            - As long as it is below the equilibrium price, the lower the price ceiling, the lower the deadweight loss and inefficiency<br>    - Subsidy - a government payment given to individuals organisations or businesses designed to offset costs to advance a specific public goal<br>        - While these maintain the market at equilibrium with no shortage or surplus, stable living, limited food price inflation, and encouragement of stable food supplies, many farmers are not poor (and are argued by economists to have the income they need to handle price shocks), and may discourage farmers from innovating (over reliance) as they have guaranteed income from the government<br>            - A survey of economists found that 85% think the US should eliminate agricultural subsidies<br>            - Economists recognise that market prices are set for a reason<br>                - If corn prices decrease because of decreased demand, it is inefficient and wasteful to spend money on subsidies<br>                - If there is a natural disaster affecting farmers then short-term aid may be required - but this is not the reality of farm subsidies<br>                    - In the US, agricultural subsidies have been around since the Great Depression. They were meant to help prop up farm prices and farmers. <br>        - Direct payments - basically government grants handed out to farmers based on land ownership and historical production levels <br>            - In the US - received regardless of the market price for crops or production rates (proved inefficient and eliminated in 2014)<br>        - A large portion of US agricultural subsidies go to crop insurance<br>            - Some economists argue any form of government interference distorts the market, resulting in unintended consequences<br>            - Crop insurance guarantees farmers and income and could encourage them to take more risks (planting on less fertile land)  <br>    - If demand is greater than production, the result is a deadweight loss (underproduction of this product). A subsidy would aid society and improve efficiency<br>    - Govt subsidies in research and development in energy stave underproduction <br>        - Some economists argue for this reason, deadweight loss is reduced<br>        - Other economists argue businesses already have an incentive to innovate and that subsidies create false demand and that there is no deadweight loss (and even if there is, markets will adjust)<br>    - In conclusion, subsidies aren\u2019t inherently good or bad and depend on societal and and market values", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T23:34:10Z", "likes_count": 5}}}, {"01lKDkYSFDg": {"Price Controls, Subsidies, and the Risks of Good Intentions: Crash Course Economics #20": {"channel_id": "UgxPEJVd7h_lqFyUEop4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Will K", "comment_text": "Question: What about Price Controls for public services, e.g. Education, Transport, Health Care and others?<br>The intention has been to keep these public services accessible to most other people, but because it is the government who provides these services (most of the time), the government could ensure there are enough services/products being produced through its other sources of funding, i.e. taxes.

But it should be pointed out that this is definitely not the general case. I think, in most developed countries, farmers are not rich and aren&#39;t well protected by the government. In fact, in a country like India, with a population of almost 1.3 billion, we are heavily dependent on our very few numbers of farmers to provide for such a big number of people. On top of this huge demand, most farmers here are not highly educated (a consequence of many factors), and are therefore not able to upgrade to the latest techniques or don&#39;t know how to deal with situations such as water shortages which leads to crop failure and shortage of supply. They don&#39;t how to deal with their crops getting infected, or properly treat and take care of their soil. So without government intervention, our farmers would be at a loss :(", "comment_date": "2020-03-19T17:04:47Z", "likes_count": 21}}}, {"01lKDkYSFDg": {"Price Controls, Subsidies, and the Risks of Good Intentions: Crash Course Economics #20": {"channel_id": "UgzPxo8l3eNzvM55usN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Aakanksha Chandra", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who thinks that Adrienne was more cheerful in the initial videos?

Why? There is little demand. It doesn&#39;t matter how much you spend in the industry. If there is little demand for your product you are going to be entirely dependent on those subsidies. The moment the subsidies are gone, so is the industry. You can try to subsidize the industry until there is demand in the future, however, this is risky and extremely costly. Better to wait for demand from consumers and let the market handle it. Regarding things like NASA, I acknowledge the massive good they have done, but I still disagree that this should have come from government. Space exploration is not a legitimate role of government. Individuals are free to do these things on their own, but I don&#39;t want my tax dollars going to any of these things. The only legitimate role of government is in protecting the people&#39;s rights to their own person/property through law enforcement, a justice system, and a military. You are not allowed to murder, rape, steal, commit fraud, etc. Everything else should be left to the people to decide for themselves. In these few legitimate areas, government is free to participate in the market through consumption of the same goods/services, as well as to produce their own goods/services and then allow these same technologies to be taken advantage of my private businesses. For example, the military innovates and produces plenty of new technologies that are handed down to the people. The military also buys equipment, like fighter jets, from businesses like Lockheed Martin and Boeing.

If you set the minimum wage hirer than what a particular employer is worth to a business, then you just forced that business to fire that employee (or not hirer in the first place).

These people are worth the least to employers. You eliminate their ability to gain any income and thereby eventually raise themselves out of poverty. For example, say a poor person is willing to work for $5/hour and an employer is willing to pay them said amount. If the minimum wage is $8/hour, it is illegal for that person to be hired even though both parties agree to it. That is messed up. Price controls, subsidies, minimum wages, and every other form of government restriction on the economy may have good intentions, but are often very harmful. This is the hallmark of Leftist Liberals.

First, you can&#39;t quickly produce more food - there is a growing season that is longer than the time it takes for somebody to starve without food. Second, there are too many variables in growing food that can cause crop failure. And third, this isn&#39;t like cars or widgets - this product is necessary for human life.<br><br>But I also see where you&#39;re coming from with the bad ideas in price controls and subsidies... You can&#39;t expect producers to produce extra just because there may be a catastrophe. The market is inherently selfish, not benevolent.<br><br>But what about the government simply buying say 20% extra of whatever is purchased of any crop, and pay 20% over the current market price? It would artificially, but linearly increase demand. It would increase the cost of the goods. But the paying over the current market price would artificially pad the profits of the producers, thus increasing the profit and allowing producers to lower costs in competition (So to the average consumer, the price shouldn&#39;t be all that much higher than they&#39;d be without the government intervention).<br><br>Would this be a subsidy? Or what would this be?<br><br>The government could store the food in reserve, then destroy it when it goes bad. I don&#39;t think they could sell it, even on the international market, it would just flood the market and kill the price...

We need to ask some questions about this. Does government know when a market is failing? Does a government know the proper steps to take to resolve this failure? Is a market failure in one industry really a bad thing for the economy or markets in general?<br><br>Once you compare the people in the market with those in the government then the answer should be obvious. People in this market have direct knowledge about the market and a vested interest in having the market perform well. If the market is still failing it is despite the best intentions and best interest of that part of society that knows the market best. The people in government do not have specialized knowledge of this market and they have no vested interest in whether it does well or does poorly, their interests lay in getting re-elected and in their own personal gain and their knowledge is mostly concentrated in politics.

Once cars became the preferred method of travel then you could say that the buggy whip market failed. Is this one of the times when the government should have stepped in?
