And your obviously  not giving all the facts about the nullification crises and only using the ones that suit your cause. You failed to mention that the war almost broke out when the US government threatened to use the military but the issue was resolved by a compromise that lowered the amount of taxes the north wanted.

The war of attrition strategy was not to wear down the United States per-say until they couldn&#39;t fight any longer. Rather, the idea was to hold out until the presidential elections of 1864. This presidential election saw Abraham Lincoln running against former General George B. McClellan. McClellan was considered to be more sympathetic to the South and the Confederate hope, was that war weariness would make Abraham Lincoln unpopular enough that he would lose the election to McClellan who was then expected to sue for peace. The South would be able to negotiate their return to the Union from a favorable position that would allow them to ensure guarantees to their rights to own slaves in a reformed constitution. Their strategy was initially successful, as the Union lost most of its major engagements in the beginning of the war, and Abraham Lincoln seemed to be dropping in popularity along with general enthusiasm for the war. A few things changed that got his presidency back on the right track. Primarily, the appointment of Ulysses S. Grant to oversee military operations in Northern Virginia had one of the biggest impacts and Abraham Lincoln won reelection in a landslide, thus foiling the Southern strategy of attrition. The war ended within six months of the election.", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T20:44:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mam162", "comment_text": "Militarily, the South had no chance of winning. Zero. They were way too outmatched, and unlike the Revolution (where the colonies had an ocean separating them from Britain) railroads allowed the Union to easily move troops into rebel-held territory. However, wars are fundamentally about political objectives and not kill counts, so the South really had one prime directive: last until November 1864 and hope Lincoln was voted out of office. That actually came surprisingly close to happening--Grant&#39;s brutal attrition battles against Lee created an outcry in the North, and Lincoln spent most of 1864 convinced he would lose. If the South had done better at resisting Sherman, there would have been a horribly bloody stalemate with no end in sight, and I think Lincoln would indeed have been voted out and the South would have had a real shot at negotiated independence.", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T12:34:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Funny Foster Animals", "comment_text": "I love these crash course videos!

Well after that they surrendered Fort Sumter after the Unions Troops were bombarded with artillery and Lincoln declined sending ammunition, but only food and water. There were no casualties (Until the CSA had a celebration and fired straight in the air and What goes up, must go down happens and kills a couple soldiers). The CSA only had to maintain their territory and had to wait for the battle to happen on their land which was a huge advantage, but the North was packin when it came to supplies and men. Surprisingly the Confederates killed more Yankees during the war, but then again they had over 9000000 men. The thing that led to the downfall of the CSA was when they blockaded their port cities and the Mississippi which led to inflation in the CSA and they had to march to Ghettysberg for some Shoes and they got heavily ambushed by the Union.

The common man doesn&#39;t fight and die so some rich aristocrats can keep their slaves. The fight against federal oppression, like regulations that kept southerners from making liquor with their own crops, having a cotton gin, or manufacturing anything themselves or many other restrictive laws, was the real reason for the war.\u00a0 Most Northerners were NOT abolitionists, they made up only 10% of the northern population. Northerners fought to preserve the Union because they correctly assumed the country could not survive without the huge cash crops grown in the South.\u00a0 The anti-slavery propaganda began as a Northern rallying cry to help foster support for the war in the North about half-way through the war when public opinion had begun to sway against the war and more towards negotiating some kind of reconciliation with the South. That propaganda has successfully worked against future generations in convincing them that was a central issue or cause of the war when most people in the North did NOT want to end slavery in the South and would never fight a war risking their lives to end slavery of a people MOST of them still saw as less than human. In Abraham Lincolns inaugural address he stated very clearly he had no intention of ending slavery in the South. So, there was no threat of slavery being ended when the South segregated from the Union, but there was threat of the Federal government continuing to tell Southern States what they could or couldn&#39;t do in their own states in regards to many other things to the point of restrictive oppression. They told them what they had to charge for their own crops when selling them to manufacturers in the North. They told them they couldn&#39;t trade with Europe or other countries but had to sell to the Northern States. They told them they couldn&#39;t manufacture things themselves using their own raw materials. They told them what they had to pay for manufactured goods made in the North, which was more than most Southerners could afford. All of this was in direct violation of the promise of self-governance that was given to them at the formation of the country. Most of the quotes used in these videos\u00a0are from rich landowners and politicians who for them personally the most important &#39;states right&#39; was the right to own slaves of course, BUT what war can be fought by the top 10% of the population? \u00a0The majority of the South supported succession for other reasons that also involved violations of &#39;states rights&#39; and were of much greater concern to them personally, like Federalist over regulation and restrictions that made it very difficult to provide for their families.", "comment_date": "2019-10-08T22:21:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vandini \ud83d\udcab\ud83d\udd8b", "comment_text": "This was insanely helpful!

Had Atlanta not fallen when it did Lincoln very likely would have lost re-election and President elect McClellan would have to negotiate a political peace that would have required recognition of the Confederacy. Second, by the end of the war the Union Army,  who had the far harder job of actually having to conquer the Confederacy (the Confederacy only needed a Stalemate to win), produced far Superior Commanders Who not only won the war but whom history considers the first modern Industrial Age Generals in Grant, Sherman and Sheridan. General Lee, on the other hand is considered by most military historians as one of history\u2019s most over rated General. Although brilliant tactically Lee was a terrible Strategist and his lack of a clear grand strategy played a major role in the Confederacies defeat.

Emancipation Proclamation summary: The Emancipation Proclamation was issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, as the country entered the third year of the Civil War. It declared that &quot;all persons held as slaves \u2026 shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free&quot;\u2014but it applied only to states designated as being in rebellion, not to the slave-holding border states of Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri or to areas of the Confederacy that had already come under Union control. The careful planning of this document, with Lincoln releasing it at just the right moment in the war, ensured that it had a great positive impact on the Union efforts and redefined the purpose of the war. The Emancipation Proclamation continues to be a symbol of equality and social justice.  So, it hurts to see someone calling his self, educated, not knowing the real truth.

Northern business interests and their tools in Congress forced this legislation through.  It amounted to forcing the southern states to pay for the majority of the costs of the federal government.  Remember that back then there was no income tax, so funding the federal government came from tariffs and other fees.  This legislative abuse alone was enough grounds to cause the southern states to secede.  This interesting comment was borrowed from the   DEO VINDICE channel on youtube.<br><br>The Morrill Tariff ultimately tripled the Tariff rate from 15 to 48%. It was passed the day before Lincoln took office. The next day at Lincoln&#39;s first inaugural address, he promised that any state that would not pay the taxes would be invaded and the taxes would be taken by force with bloodshed if necessary. In that same address Lincoln said he supported the Corwin Amendment and said if the southern states rejoined the Union that the Corwin Amendment would pass and be ratified. The Corwin amendment would have kept Slavery Legal in the south forever under the US Constitution. Lincoln never had any intention of freeing a single slave and in fact said the opposite when taking office. So, the south clearly did not secede over the threat of losing the right to keep slaves.. It had to be something else...<br><br>Northern states by 1860 had a majority in the House of Representatives. It was with this majority that the North was able to TAX the South to death. Although the South had 25% of the population, they payed 80% of the nation\u2019s tariffs! The northern states used their majority in congress to use that tax money on improving the industry and infrastructure of the North. So the southern states payed 80% of the nation&#39;s taxes and saw less than 20% of the entire tax revenue spent by the federal government in SOUTHERN STATES. <br><br>Taxation without representation, no control in the US congress, and the recent election of Abraham Lincoln.. who received less than 40% of the popular vote &amp; was a member of a new political party created ONLY to help NORTHERN INDUSTRY, NORTHERN BUSINESS, &amp; NORTHERN PEOPLE AT THE SOUTH&#39;S EXPENSE! These political reasons are among the major causes of the southern state&#39;s decision to secede and gain the ability to govern themselves. The people&#39;s right to abolish or alter the government is a fundamental right our founding father&#39;s recognized and would have supported.", "comment_date": "2018-01-22T02:10:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "King Raider", "comment_text": "Civil war is fake news!!", "comment_date": "2018-01-20T18:37:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Merciless_ gaming", "comment_text": "he talks at like 1000 speed learned so much thank you", "comment_date": "2018-01-18T17:35:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jknbt jknbt", "comment_text": "Civil war causes part 2<br> <br>Here are a few more &quot;follow the money&quot; examples:<br>*   The union army styled itself as heroes who were struggling to free the poor exploited slaves. Actually, they were thugs, murderers who killed unarmed prisoners, thieves, and rapists. The first thing southerners did when they heard the union army was coming was to move their daughters to safety at least 100 miles out of harm&#39;s way, since the blue uniformed rapists left no white woman untouched. If all they wanted was to free the slaves, why didn\u2019t they free the slaves in states that did not secede that had slavery laws like MD, MO, DE, &amp; KY? <br><br>*  Union army murderers routinely killed their prisoners since it was impossible to march them safely back north to a prison camp. They also lynched farmers who destroyed their crops or killed their livestock rather than letting them fall into Union army hands.<br><br>*   The union army thieves stole everything that was not nailed down and shipped it all back North. The scene at Tara House in the movie Gone with the Wind was not a literary exaggeration--they stole everything including the green curtains, and THEN THEY BURNED THE HOUSE DOWN. Sometimes they went through the ashes so they could steal the nails also...really high moral standard you keep there, Yankees. This was a war on civilians, not on military targets. Why is this truth never exposed?<br><br>*   Sherman&#39;s march to the sea was a war on civilians and the economy of the South. The purpose was to destroy the manufacturing center that Atlanta had become, and then to destroy the deep-water seaport that Savannah had become. Why?  Because the business interests there threatened the northern businessmen, manufacturers, and shipping interests. These businessmen forced Lincoln and Congress to support the war. All wars are ultimately fought for economic reasons but for moralistic excuses. The net effect was that manufacturing and shipping in the South was destroyed and did not begin to recover for at least 80 years at the time of WW2. However, the manufacturing and shipping was done by northern companies and investors who had located their plants and shipping facilities in the South. This turned the South into an economic colony of the North. This is one more thing that the Confederate heroes were fighting to avoid. Can&#39;t anyone see past skin color issues to recognize this?<br><br>*   More examples of the staggering growth of the federal government:  federal hamburger laws; federal commode laws enforced by the potty police; and federal clothes washing laws\u2026.sorry friends, but because of the explosive growth of the federal government, you can\u2019t eat a hamburger, flush your commode, or wash clothes without if being a \u201cFederal Question\u201d and Involving NUMEROUS INVASIVE FEDERAL LAWS. <br><br>A fair question:  What would be an example of a legitimate federal law based on a \u201cFederal Question\u201d?  Basically, any concerns common to two or more states, or a concern involving an international boundary. Here are three examples of reasonable federal legislation:  1) regulating barge traffic on the Ohio River;  2) importing goods manufactured overseas;  3) vetting refugees who request asylum with the intent of becoming citizens.<br><br>Federal Hamburger Laws:  A perfect example is the common fast food restaurant hamburger with a sesame seed bun. A law firm did a comprehensive survey, and no less than 26,000 federal laws come in to play in one form or another to produce one single hamburger. For example, inspection of the beef, interstate trucking laws, regulations on importing the sesame seeds with tariffs and inspections, regulations on the container vessel moving the sesame seeds into a port, agriculture laws concerning producing the wheat flour, labor laws, union laws, the list goes on and on and on...<br><br>Federal Commode Laws:  Another example is Congress passing laws concerning the nation&#39;s water supply to the point that the amount of water used to flush your stool is an important matter of urgent federal scrutiny. How much water I use to flush my stuff is not any concern of Congress. But plumbers and suppliers have to be careful about installing a commode that does not conform to the federal standard. A master plumber can lose his license if he installs a surplus commode from the 1960&#39;s found on the back lot of the plumbing supply house that uses a little too much water. Doesn&#39;t anyone but me consider this a little invasive and unnecessary?<br><br>Federal Clothes Washing Laws:  Congress even regulates how much water can be used to do a load of clothes. Manufacturers have had to redesign washing machines to the point that it takes two washes just to get the clothes clean. Federal laws now regulate how much water can be used to wash a load of clothes. The net amount of water it takes to get your clothes clean has actually increased, since the first wash job is so inefficient. To compensate, they are now selling special, expensive, highly caustic soaps, which bleach the color out of the clothes and rot the fabric. This is what happens with politicians with an insane environmentalist agenda take over the design of washing machines. They can\u2019t trust the manufacturers to design an efficient machine that uses the minimum amount of water needed to get the clothes clean.<br><br>*   And try to get your gold and silver back from a bank!  Take your Federal Reserve paper money to a bank, and say to the teller you want silver dollars for each paper dollar. They will laugh at you. A silver dollar sells in the coin shop for about $17 to $25 these days (paper money). An American Eagle $50 gold ounce costs around $1300 paper dollars in the coin shops. This should give you a picture how much the counterfeiters at the Federal Reserve have inflated the currency supply. Their money is just green ink on cotton paper with no real value to itself, unless you care to use it for the toilet paper it is. The Constitution plainly says that \u201cgold and silver shall be the money of the land\u201d. It doesn\u2019t say anything about green ink on cotton paper printed a pallet load at a time by the mint.<br><br>*   People don&#39;t realize how the federal government grew after the 9-11 disaster. Laws are on the books that will turn the country into a totalitarian state on 24 hours\u2019 notice. Bush jr. asked Congress for emergency powers when the Lehman Brothers bank started to fail in 2007. The thought of a Federal Reserve stock holding bank going under so disturbed the northern business interests, that they were ready to turn the country into a dictatorship. This didn&#39;t happen because the financial cabal that controls the banking system orchestrated the collapse of the economy. It was necessary for at least one really big bank to go under to crash the stock market as completely as they did. The super-rich that ordered this had already sold most of their stocks. After the crash they created, they bought them all back at bargain basement prices (as much as 90% off of the former year\u2019s price), doubling their fortunes in a year, tax-free, and WITHOUT ANY RISK AT ALL. You can only get this with a Federal Reserve system controlling the nations&#39; banks and economy.<br><br>\u2022  People don\u2019t realize how the Supreme Court and the Federal court system has overstepped it bounds through passing their own legislation. The founders\u2019 original intent did include judicial review of laws explicitly passed by Congress. There is nothing to indicate that they wanted the Supreme Court judicial activist judges passing their own laws based on what they esteem as some nebulous \u201cimplied\u201d rights hidden in the Constitution. The document was written in a clearly explicit manner. Where did all these hidden, implied rights suddenly come from?  It is a complete abuse of power for the judges to base decisions on those rights that are new and outside of the boundaries of laws passed by Congress. This sort of power grab was not part of the first 70 years of government in this country, since the states agreed to a limited federal government with the majority of the powers reserved to the states. This amounts to minority rule by decree, which is a form of oligarchy and dictatorship. This method of minority rule through bogus federal court decisions was unthinkable to the founding fathers. For example, there is nothing in the history of the US federal law that says gay marriage is legal, legitimate, and equal to traditional hetero marriage. The Roberts court insanely overstepped their powers to pass this law on their own authority, instead of getting Congress to pass this sweeping act. This is just one more law passed by the Supreme Court in violation of the limited powers given them by the constitution. This follows a series of bogus decisions going back to Murray vs Curlett decision in 1963 which was the beginning of the legislative agenda of the atheist-liberal-humanist-homosexualist minorities. These people knew they would never get their agendas passed through Congress, so they used the federal courts to pass their legislative agenda. That is what has brought down the US to its current low moral state through an unprecedented &amp; breathtaking moral decline since 1963. Judicial activism of this sort should be an impeachable offense.  ONLY CONGRESS gets to pass federal laws.  If the federal judges do not understand this, they do not know enough constitutional law to have any business sitting on a federal bench.<br><br>*   The people of the South saw all this coming. The bottom line is that northern business and shipping interests still control Congress and the passing of invasive federal laws. This has been the case since 1861. So yes, the leadership of the South who saw all this coming and fought against it are genuine heroes.

It is a right reserved to the states. Show me the article or amendment that says a state can&#39;t leave.<br><br>*  Lincoln declared an illegal war on the states of the South to force them back into the union. The moralizing excuse was to free the slaves. Only the super-rich top 1% of the southern elites owned a large number of slaves. Most southern whites were as poor as slaves themselves.<br><br>*   Other Lincoln illegal acts include blockading southern ports without a declaration of war; suspension of habeas corpus (\u201ccharge them or release them\u201d Constitutional protection guarantee); arresting and holding without trial or charges northern citizens sympathetic to the secession, including some sitting state legislators; censorship of telecommunications; issuance of baseless paper money with no gold or silver backing; confiscation of private property and guns owned by northerners sympathetic to the secession; turning the country into a dictatorship with government by decree; enforcement of the Morrill Tariff, which unfairly penalized the South<br><br>*   You people who refuse to listen to the \u201cother side of the story\u201d need to take off your own magical glasses that make you see everything as a black vs white race issue. Something is wrong with your glasses if they can only see two colors, black and white. <br><br>*  The southern leaders did not want to be owned or controlled by the northern businessmen. This was a fight over state&#39;s rights. The slavery issue was just the touchstone or excuse. They had draft riots in the North because northern conscripts did not want to get killed just to free the slaves. Can you imagine the riots and reaction that would have happened if Lincoln and Congress said, &quot;Now come on boys, the Yankee manufacturers want to put the Southern manufacturers out of business for good. They are afraid of the competition. So go join General Sherman&#39;s army outside of Allentown. They are about the march South and burn every factory in Atlanta down, and then burn Savannah harbor, oh yes, and then march north and burn Columbia to teach those rebs a lesson. Come on boys, my officers won&#39;t say anything if you take a few mementos and souvenirs home with you, like the entire contents of a southern mansion. You&#39;ll get rich, rich, rich!&quot;<br><br>*  All of the northern states except PA had laws on the books allowing holding slaves. NY had legal slavery until 1845. Border states like Delaware and Maryland had slavery laws in effect throughout the war. When the new laws that would free the slaves were about to take effect, northern slave holders would quietly move their slaves down South to be sold to southern slave owners. The super-rich 1% southern plantation owners doubled their labor pool overnight when they bought the northern slaves at bargain prices. It was a win-win for the super-rich of the North in partnership with the super-rich of the South. What hypocrisy!  Then the former slave owners of the North moaned about the plight of the oppressed southern slaves!  <br><br>*   The abolitionists got the slave laws overturned in the North. They would have eventually gotten the slave laws in the South overturned without a brutal, bloody war. These people got a half million people killed for their cause out of the 31.5 million people living in the country in 1860. If the same percentage of people were killed in a war in this decade, the number of dead would be a staggering 5.3 million people. Every family in the country would lose loved ones.<br><br><br>*  Black southern freedmen and slaves trying to earn freedom carried arms and fought for the South. They proved to be competent fighters in battle.<br><br>*  Black freedmen owned black slaves. About 40% of black freedmen used the cheap labor of slaves. A farmer had to do this to compete and stay in business.<br><br>*  The majority of the states, 6 out of 11, left because of the state&#39;s rights issue, not because of the slavery issue. They did not want the rich merchants of the North dictating to the sovereign states their laws. The Republic had a limited federal system originally. The growth of the federal government to the giant octopus monster ogre that it is now started with Lincoln and the Civil War. Roosevelt, Johnson, and most of the presidents since Reagan have aggressively campaigned for more and more federal government with correspondingly higher taxes. The country will never get out of the debt it has taken on to fund the growth of the federal government.<br><br>*  The cause of the war was ultimately economic, as with all wars. The northerners did not care about the poor slaves until the southern merchants and manufacturers started shipping directly out of Savannah and Charleston to London. Until the late 1850&#39;s, southern merchants sent overseas shipments through New York harbor and Boston harbor. When northern merchants started to lose this income, the business, manufacturing, and merchant sector joined the abolitionists to crush the competition. This was the ultimate reason for the war. This truth has been suppressed or under-reported from the beginning, since this takes away the moral justification the North used to make war on the civilians and business interests of the South.<br><br>*  If you don&#39;t believe that statement, follow the money. Business boomed in the North as suppliers built whole fortunes providing equipment and arms to the northern armies. War is good business, as long as your factories and homes are not getting destroyed.<br><br>*  Again, follow the money...Lincoln paid for the war with greenback paper money, which had no basis and was illegal to print. This issue of money was still in use until recent times. Have you ever noticed a red triangle on the back of a dollar bill?  That was the issue of money that Lincoln printed out of thin air. The Fed has taken out of circulation all those bills, but their derivative issues are still in use without the noticeable red triangle.<br><br>*  Again, follow the money...Lincoln&#39;s baseless paper money was the beginning of the Federal Reserve System. The US Federal Reserve is the biggest criminal counterfeiter that has ever existed. Read:  The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve by G. Edward Griffin for the story on how the super-rich bankers corrupted Congress and President Wilson to invent this monster in 1913. The Fed with the help of a corrupt Congress will eventually bankrupt the country. Thanks, Mr. Lincoln, for giving this pending disaster its start.<br><br>*  Again, follow the money\u2026the Morrill Tariff was designed to penalize the southern manufacturers for having the audacity to buy their equipment and supplies from Europe rather than from northern manufacturers. It imposed a whopping 48% tariff on certain imported goods. This legislative abuse alone was enough to start the Civil War. The tariff became federal law shortly before Lincoln was sworn in. He promised ruthless enforcement of it against any violators, meaning punishment of southern businessmen who imported equipment from Europe.<br><br>It is downright heroic that people would fight against the oppression of the federal government with its confiscatory taxes, baseless money, endless deficit spending, and overwhelming laws that rob states of their rights. Do you know that there are laws on the books that Bush jr. helped invent that allow the Homeland Security goons to break into your house in the middle of the night, haul you away without any charges, and hold you indefinitely in a secret prison in northern Utah for the rest of your life without telling your relatives where you are being held?

The bottom line is that northern business and shipping interests still control Congress and the passing of invasive federal laws. This has been the case since 1861. So yes, the leadership of the South who saw all this coming and fought against it are genuine heroes. They should be honored with statues to remind us of what they fought for.<br><br>*   An interesting comment borrowed from    DEO VINDICE<br><br>The Morrill Tariff ultimately tripled the Tariff rate from 15 to 48%. It was passed the day before Lincoln took office. The next day at Lincoln&#39;s first inaugural address, he promised that any state that would not pay the taxes would be invaded and the taxes would be taken by force with bloodshed if necessary. In that same address Lincoln said he supported the Corwin Amendment and said if the southern states rejoined the Union that the Corwin Amendment would pass and be ratified. The Corwin amendment would have kept Slavery Legal in the south forever under the US Constitution. Lincoln never had any intention of freeing a single slave and in fact said the opposite when taking office. So, the south clearly did not secede over the threat of losing the right to keep slaves.. It had to be something else...<br><br>Northern states by 1860 had a majority in the House of Representatives. It was with this majority that the North was able to TAX the South to death. Although the South had 25% of the population, they payed 80% of the nation\u2019s tariffs! The northern states used their majority in congress to use that tax money on improving the industry and infrastructure of the North. So the southern states payed 80% of the nation&#39;s taxes and saw less than 20% of the entire tax revenue spent by the federal government in SOUTHERN STATES. <br><br>Taxation without representation, no control in the US congress, and the recent election of Abraham Lincoln.. who received less than 40% of the popular vote &amp; was a member of a new political party created ONLY to help NORTHERN INDUSTRY, NORTHERN BUSINESS, &amp; NORTHERN PEOPLE AT THE SOUTH&#39;S EXPENSE! These political reasons are among the major causes of the southern state&#39;s decision to secede and gain the ability to govern themselves. The people&#39;s right to abolish or alter the government is a fundamental right our founding father&#39;s recognized and would have supported.", "comment_date": "2017-12-29T04:38:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Smith", "comment_text": "Where did you get your history education from, because the war was indeed caused by many things, not just slavery.

Ie, if the war was about slavery, why did it occur now and not earlier or later? Why was slavery not abolished in the north? Etc. Everyone knows the civil war was about controlling the resources of westward expansion. And whoever controlled the west, would consequently employ their mode of resource extraction -- i.e. slave or waged labor -- to extract those resources. Hence why it appeared like the war was about slavery, because it was, in the sense that slave labor signaled the control of southern planter class over northern industrial class over economy. The fight was about what kind of economic system would be used to extract and control resources in newly expanding frontier states. And that&#39;s how slavery and abolition came into the picture. See the Kansas Nebraska act just prior to civil war. There was never any illusion about getting rid of slavery in south, since that would inevitably cause a war and risk the very dissolution of the country, which it nearly did. If you look closely at expansion of railroad and banking system in north, you will understand how civil war was caused by fight over the west. Not by some sudden moral upspring for abolition amongst ruling classes in north. Who, by the way, relied greatly on cash crop economy of slave labor to provide liquidity necessary to back the loans required for continuous industrial expansion in north. Until, of course, the two sides came into conflict with one another over the west.

It is a right reserved to the states. Show me the article or amendment that says a state can&#39;t leave.<br>*  Lincoln declared an illegal war on the states of the South to force them back into the union. The moralizing excuse was to free the slaves. Only the super-rich top 1% of the southern elites owned a large number of slaves. Most southern whites were as poor as slaves themselves.<br>*   Other Lincoln illegal acts include blockading southern ports without a declaration of war; suspension of habeas corpus (\u201ccharge them or release them\u201d Constitutional protection guarantee); arresting and holding without trial or charges northern citizens sympathetic to the secession, including some sitting state legislators; censorship of telecommunications; issuance of baseless paper money with no gold or silver backing; confiscation of private property and guns owned by northerners sympathetic to the secession; turning the country into a dictatorship with government by decree; enforcement of the Morrill Tariff, which unfairly penalized the South<br>*   You people who refuse to listen to the \u201cother side of the story\u201d need to take off your own magical glasses that make you see everything as a black vs white race issue. Something is wrong with your glasses if they can only see two colors, black and white. <br>*  The southern leaders did not want to be owned or controlled by the northern businessmen. This was a fight over state&#39;s rights. The slavery issue was just the touchstone or excuse. They had draft riots in the North because northern conscripts did not want to get killed just to free the slaves. Can you imagine the riots and reaction that would have happened if Lincoln and Congress said, &quot;Now come on boys, the Yankee manufacturers want to put the Southern manufacturers out of business for good. They are afraid of the competition. So go join General Sherman&#39;s army outside of Allentown. They are about the march South and burn every factory in Atlanta down, and then burn Savannah harbor, oh yes, and then march north and burn Columbia to teach those rebs a lesson. Come on boys, my officers won&#39;t say anything if you take a few mementos and souvenirs home with you, like the entire contents of a southern mansion. You&#39;ll get rich, rich, rich!&quot;<br>*  All of the northern states except PA had laws on the books allowing holding slaves. NY had legal slavery until 1845. Border states like Delaware and Maryland had slavery laws in effect throughout the war. When the new laws that would free the slaves were about to take effect, northern slave holders would quietly move their slaves down South to be sold to southern slave owners. The super-rich 1% southern plantation owners doubled their labor pool overnight when they bought the northern slaves at bargain prices. It was a win-win for the super-rich of the North in partnership with the super-rich of the South. What hypocrisy!  Then the former slave owners of the North moaned about the plight of the oppressed southern slaves!  <br>*   The abolitionists got the slave laws overturned in the North. They would have eventually gotten the slave laws in the South overturned without a brutal, bloody war. These people got a half million people killed for their cause out of the 31.5 million people living in the country in 1860. If the same percentage of people were killed in a war in this decade, the number of dead would be a staggering 5.3 million people. Every family in the country would lose loved ones.<br>*  Black southern freedmen and slaves trying to earn freedom carried arms and fought for the South. They proved to be competent fighters in battle.<br>*  Black freedmen owned black slaves. About 40% of black freedmen used the cheap labor of slaves. A farmer had to do this to compete and stay in business.<br>*  The majority of the states, 6 out of 11, left because of the state&#39;s rights issue, not because of the slavery issue. They did not want the rich merchants of the North dictating to the sovereign states their laws. The Republic had a limited federal system originally. The growth of the federal government to the giant octopus monster ogre that it is now started with Lincoln and the Civil War. Roosevelt, Johnson, and most of the presidents since Reagan have aggressively campaigned for more and more federal government with correspondingly higher taxes. The country will never get out of the debt it has taken on to fund the growth of the federal government.<br>*  The cause of the war was ultimately economic, as with all wars. The northerners did not care about the poor slaves until the southern merchants and manufacturers started shipping directly out of Savannah and Charleston to London. Until the late 1850&#39;s, southern merchants sent overseas shipments through New York harbor and Boston harbor. When northern merchants started to lose this income, the business, manufacturing, and merchant sector joined the abolitionists to crush the competition. This was the ultimate reason for the war. This truth has been suppressed or under-reported from the beginning, since this takes away the moral justification the North used to make war on the civilians and business interests of the South.<br>*  If you don&#39;t believe that statement, follow the money. Business boomed in the North as suppliers built whole fortunes providing equipment and arms to the northern armies. War is good business, as long as your factories and homes are not getting destroyed.<br>*  Again, follow the money...Lincoln paid for the war with greenback paper money, which had no basis and was illegal to print. This issue of money was still in use until recent times. Have you ever noticed a red triangle on the back of a dollar bill?  That was the issue of money that Lincoln printed out of thin air. The Fed has taken out of circulation all those bills, but their derivative issues are still in use without the noticeable red triangle.<br>*  Again, follow the money...Lincoln&#39;s baseless paper money was the beginning of the Federal Reserve System. The US Federal Reserve is the biggest criminal counterfeiter that has ever existed. Read:  The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve by G. Edward Griffin for the story on how the super-rich bankers corrupted Congress and President Wilson to invent this monster in 1913. The Fed with the help of a corrupt Congress will eventually bankrupt the country. Thanks, Mr. Lincoln, for giving this pending disaster its start.<br>*  Again, follow the money\u2026the Morrill Tariff was designed to penalize the southern manufacturers for having the audacity to buy their equipment and supplies from Europe rather than from northern manufacturers. It imposed a whopping 48% tariff on certain imported goods. This legislative abuse alone was enough to start the Civil War. The tariff became federal law shortly before Lincoln was sworn in. He promised ruthless enforcement of it against any violators, meaning punishment of southern businessmen who imported equipment from Europe.<br><br>It is downright heroic that people would fight against the oppression of the federal government with its confiscatory taxes, baseless money, endless deficit spending, and overwhelming laws that rob states of their rights. Do you know that there are laws on the books that Bush jr. helped invent that allow the Homeland Security goons to break into your house in the middle of the night, haul you away without any charges, and hold you indefinitely in a secret prison in northern Utah for the rest of your life without telling your relatives where you are being held?  Yep, the 9-11 attack changed many things.", "comment_date": "2017-11-29T02:07:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jknbt jknbt", "comment_text": "Civil war causes part 2<br> <br>Here are a few more &quot;follow the money&quot; examples:<br>*   The union army styled itself as heroes who were struggling to free the poor exploited slaves. Actually, they were thugs, murderers who killed unarmed prisoners, thieves, and rapists. The first thing southerners did when they heard the union army was coming was to move their daughters to safety at least 100 miles out of harm&#39;s way, since the blue uniformed rapists left no white woman untouched. If all they wanted was to free the slaves, why didn\u2019t they free the slaves in states that did not secede that had slavery laws like MD, MO, DE, &amp; KY? <br>*  Union army murderers routinely killed their prisoners since it was impossible to march them safely back north to a prison camp. They also lynched farmers who destroyed their crops or killed their livestock rather than letting them fall into Union army hands.<br>*   The union army thieves stole everything that was not nailed down and shipped it all back North. The scene at Tara House in the movie Gone with the Wind was not a literary exaggeration--they stole everything including the green curtains, and THEN THEY BURNED THE HOUSE DOWN. Sometimes they went through the ashes so they could steal the nails also...really high moral standard you keep there, Yankees. This was a war on civilians, not on military targets. Why is this truth never exposed?<br>*   Sherman&#39;s march to the sea was a war on civilians and the economy of the South. The purpose was to destroy the manufacturing center that Atlanta had become, and then to destroy the deep-water seaport that Savannah had become. Why?  Because the business interests there threatened the northern businessmen, manufacturers, and shipping interests. These businessmen forced Lincoln and Congress to support the war. All wars are ultimately fought for economic reasons but for moralistic excuses. The net effect was that manufacturing and shipping in the South was destroyed and did not begin to recover for at least 80 years at the time of WW2. However, the manufacturing and shipping was done by northern companies and investors who had located their plants and shipping facilities in the South. This turned the South into an economic colony of the North. This is one more thing that the Confederate heroes were fighting to avoid. Can&#39;t anyone see past skin color issues to recognize this?<br><br>*   More examples of the staggering growth of the federal government:  federal hamburger laws; federal commode laws enforced by the potty police; and federal clothes washing laws\u2026.sorry friends, but because of the explosive growth of the federal government, you can\u2019t eat a hamburger, flush your commode, or wash clothes without if being a \u201cFederal Question\u201d and Involving NUMEROUS INVASIVE FEDERAL LAWS. <br><br>A fair question:  What would be an example of a legitimate federal law based on a \u201cFederal Question\u201d?  Basically, any concerns common to two or more states, or a concern involving an international boundary. Here are three examples of reasonable federal legislation:  1) regulating barge traffic on the Ohio River;  2) importing goods manufactured overseas;  3) vetting refugees who request asylum with the intent of becoming citizens.<br><br>Federal Hamburger Laws:  A perfect example is the common fast food restaurant hamburger with a sesame seed bun. A law firm did a comprehensive survey, and no less than 26,000 federal laws come in to play in one form or another to produce one single hamburger. For example, inspection of the beef, interstate trucking laws, regulations on importing the sesame seeds with tariffs and inspections, regulations on the container vessel moving the sesame seeds into a port, agriculture laws concerning producing the wheat flour, labor laws, union laws, the list goes on and on and on...<br><br>Federal Commode Laws:  Another example is Congress passing laws concerning the nation&#39;s water supply to the point that the amount of water used to flush your stool is an important matter of urgent federal scrutiny. How much water I use to flush my stuff is not any concern of Congress. But plumbers and suppliers have to be careful about installing a commode that does not conform to the federal standard. A master plumber can lose his license if he installs a surplus commode from the 1960&#39;s found on the back lot of the plumbing supply house that uses a little too much water. Doesn&#39;t anyone but me consider this a little invasive and unnecessary?<br><br>Federal Clothes Washing Laws:  Congress even regulates how much water can be used to do a load of clothes. Manufacturers have had to redesign washing machines to the point that it takes two washes just to get the clothes clean. Federal laws now regulate how much water can be used to wash a load of clothes.  The net amount of water it takes to get your clothes clean has actually increased, since the first wash job is so inefficient. To compensate, they are now selling special, expensive, highly caustic soaps, which bleach the color out of the clothes and rot the fabric. This is what happens with politicians with an insane environmentalist agenda take over the design of washing machines. They can\u2019t trust the manufacturers to design an efficient machine that uses the minimum amount of water needed to get the clothes clean.<br><br>*   And try to get your gold and silver back from a bank!  Take your Federal Reserve paper money to a bank, and say to the teller you want silver dollars for each paper dollar. They will laugh at you. A silver dollar sells in the coin shop for about $17 to $25 these days (paper money). An American Eagle $50 gold ounce costs around $1300 paper dollars in the coin shops. This should give you a picture how much the counterfeiters at the Federal Reserve have inflated the currency supply. Their money is just green ink on cotton paper with no real value to itself, unless you care to use it for the toilet paper it is.  The Constitution plainly says that \u201cgold and silver shall be the money of the land\u201d. It doesn\u2019t say anything about green ink on cotton paper printed a pallet load at a time by the mint.<br>*   People don&#39;t realize how the federal government grew after the 9-11 disaster. Laws are on the books that will turn the country into a totalitarian state on 24 hours\u2019 notice. Bush jr. asked Congress for emergency powers when the Lehman Brothers bank started to fail in 2007. The thought of a Federal Reserve stock holding bank going under so disturbed the northern business interests, that they were ready to turn the country into a dictatorship. This didn&#39;t happen because the financial cabal that controls the banking system orchestrated the collapse of the economy. It was necessary for at least one really big bank to go under to crash the stock market as completely as they did. The super-rich that ordered this had already sold most of their stocks. After the crash they created, they bought them all back at bargain basement prices (as much as 90% off of the former year\u2019s price), doubling their fortunes in a year, tax-free, and WITHOUT ANY RISK AT ALL. You can only get this with a Federal Reserve system controlling the nations&#39; banks and economy.<br>*   The people of the South saw all this coming. The bottom line is that northern business and shipping interests still control Congress and the passing of invasive federal laws. This has been the case since 1861. So yes, the leadership of the South who saw all this coming and fought against it are genuine heroes. They should be honored with statues to remind us of what they fought for.<br><br>*   An interesting comment borrowed from    DEO VINDICE<br><br>The Morrill Tariff ultimately tripled the Tariff rate from 15 to 48%.

Charles Dickens in a London periodical in December 1861, &quot;Union means so many millions a year lost to the South; secession means the loss of the same millions to the North. The love of money is the root of this as of many other evils....The quarrel between the North and South is, as it stands, solely a fiscal quarrel&quot;<br>2. The South paid 84% of the tariffs, rising to 87% in 1860. They paid 83% of the $13 million federal fishing bounties paid to New England fishermen, and also paid $35 million to Northern shipping interests which had a monopoly on shipping from Southern ports. The South, in effect, was paying tribute to the North.<br>3.The address of Texas Congressman Reagan on 15 January 1861 summarizes this discontent: &quot;You are not content with the vast millions of tribute we pay you annually under the operation of our revenue law, our navigation laws, your fishing bounties, and by making your people our manufacturers, our merchants, our shippers. You are not satisfied with the vast tribute we pay you to build up your great cities, your railroads, your canals. You are not satisfied with the millions of tribute we have been paying you on account of the balance of exchange which you hold against us. You are not satisfied that we of the South are almost reduced to the condition of overseers of northern capitalists. You are not satisfied with all this; but you must wage a relentless crusade against our rights and institutions.&quot;<br>4. As the London Times of 7 Nov 1861 stated: &quot;The contest is really for empire on the side of the North and for independence on that of the South....&quot;.<br>5. An editorial in the Charleston Mercury 2 days before the November 1860 election stated: &quot;The real causes of dissatisfaction in the South with the North, are in the unjust taxation and expenditure of the taxes by the Government of the United States, and in the revolution the North has effected in this government from a confederated republic, to a national sectional despotism.&quot;<br>6. 21 January 1861, five days before Louisiana seceded, the New Orleans Daily Crescent editorialized: &quot;They [the South] know that it is their import trade that draws from the people&#39;s pockets sixty or seventy millions of dollars per annum, in the shape of duties, to be expended mainly in the North, and in the protection and encouragement of Northern interests....These are the reasons why these people [the North] do not wish the South to secede from the Union.&quot;<br>7. When South Carolina seceded in December 1860, followed by the other Confederate states, all the powerful moneyed interests in the North were in favor of appeasing the South over slavery in order to preserve the Union. If the South were to be a sovereign nation with low tariffs, it could undermine Northern business and trade. The South believed that it did not need the North, since it could buy the goods it needed from Europe, but the North needed the South as a market for Northern goods.<br>8. December 1860, before any secession, the Chicago Daily Times foretold the disaster that Southern free ports would bring to Northern commerce: &quot;In one single blow our foreign commerce must be reduced to less than one-half what it now is. Our coastwise trade would pass into other hands. One-half of our shipping would lie idle at our wharves. We should lose our trade with the South, with all of its immense profits. Our manufactories would be in utter ruins. Let the South adopt the free-trade system, or that of a tariff for revenue, and these results would likely follow.&quot;<br>9. On 18 March, the Boston Transcript noted that while the Southern states had claimed to secede over the slavery issue, now &quot;the mask has been thrown off and it is apparent that the people of the principal seceding states are now for commercial independence. They dream that the centres of traffic can be changed from Northern to Southern ports....by a revenue system verging on free trade....&quot;<br>10. The Republican platform of 1860 called for higher tariffs; that was implemented by the new Congress in the Morill tariff of March 1861, signed by President Buchanan before Lincoln took the oath of office. It imposed the highest tariffs in US history, with over a 50% duty on iron products and 25% on clothing; rates averaged 47%. The nascent Confederacy followed with a low tariff, essentially creating a free-trade zone in the South. Prior to this &quot;war of the tariffs&quot;, most Northern newspapers had called for peace through conciliation, but many now cried for war. The Philadelphia Press on 18 March 1861 demanded a blockade of Southern ports, because, if not, &quot;a series of customs houses will be required on the vast inland border from the Atlantic to West Texas. Worse still, with no protective tariff, European goods will under-price Northern goods in Southern markets. Cotton for Northern mills will be charged an export tax. This will cripple the clothing industries and make British mills prosper. Finally, the great inland waterways, the Mississippi, the Missouri, and the Ohio Rivers, will be subject to Southern tolls.&quot; These tariffs fell primarily on southern imports. And the South was the one footing the bill for northern expansion. They were sick of it.<br>11. Karl Marx wrote in 1861: &quot;The war between the North and the South is a tariff war. The war is, further, not for any principle, does not touch the question of slavery, and in fact turns on the Northern lust for sovereignty.&quot; <br>12. The Corwin Amendment was passed in both houses of Congress March 2, 1861: No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.<br><br>You might be able to foist such claims that the war was about slavery to a unknowing high school student that doesn&#39;t know any better, but I&#39;ve been studying the Civil War for a very long time.", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T10:03:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noji", "comment_text": "Lincoln did great things, he was calm and strong. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MemoryOfLincoln\">#MemoryOfLincoln</a> So please do not make fun of him.

Deep South Cotton states certainly seceded because of slavery, with some states like Arkansas, Virginia, and Tennessee seceding because of Lincoln&#39;s plan to forcibly invade the South. Further, it is no foregone conclusion that war MUST follow secession. Nor does it follow that if a war is declared that it is fought for the reasons that caused secession. If CalExit happens and Cali secedes b/c it can&#39;t stand to be in the same country with people who voted for Trump then it wouldn&#39;t follow that the US MUST invade CA. The USA could just let them go. Nor would it follow that the USA&#39;s reason for invading CA, which would most likely be about taxes and maintaining Pacific military power, would have anything to do with why CA seceded. And that is why the Civil War isn&#39;t about slavery. Lincoln himself said it was in 1864, AFTER the Emancipation Proclamation: &quot;\u201cMy enemies pretend I am now carrying on this war for the sole purpose of abolition. So long as I am president .

Davis was held in rugged conditions inside Fortress Monroe, in Virginia, for nearly two years, before he was released without being tried. Cooler and wiser heads had prevailed.

The southerners were not the first to consider secession. Previously the idea almost came to action by the New England states, during the War of 1812. New Englanders had swiftly resumed trade with England after the Revolution, and resented the Embargo Act and the interruption of business when open warfare erupted. They despised the War, and grew rich carrying on a treasonable trade with the British, without which the British would have been unable to maintain their army and navy in North America. The New England states went so far as to call a Convention to meet at Hartford, Connecticut in 1815 to discuss and enact secession. But, by the time the Hartford Convention met the war had ended, so the issue died back to a simmer. There were several other instances before and after this near-secession by the New Englanders where states or regions came more or less near to getting serious about secession. <br><br>The fact is, that up until Lincoln was elected everyone knew that if you really wanted out of the US, you could get out.

These bankers were afraid that the United States, if they <br>remained in one block and as one nation, would attain economical and <br>financial independence, which would upset their financial domination <br>over the world. The voice of the Rothschilds predominated. They foresaw <br>tremendous booty if they could substitute two feeble democracies, <br>indebted to the Jewish financiers, to the vigorous republic, confident <br>and self-providing. Therefore, they started their emissaries in order to<br> exploit the question of slavery and thus to dig an abyss between the <br>two parts of the republic. Lincoln never suspected these underground <br>machinations. He was anti-slavery, and he was elected as such. But his <br>character prevented him from being the man of one party. When he had <br>affairs in his hands, he perceived that these sinister financiers of <br>Europe, the Rothschilds, wished to make him the executor of their <br>designs. <br><br>They made the rupture between the North and the South imminent! The <br>masters of finance in Europe made this rupture definitive in order to <br>exploit it to the utmost. Lincoln&#39;s personality surprised them: they <br>thought to easily dupe the candidate woodcutter. But Lincoln read their <br>plots and soon understood that the South was not the worst foe, but the <br>Jewish financiers. He did not confide his apprehensions; he watched the <br>gestures of the Hidden Hand; he did not wish to expose publicly the <br>questions which disconcert the ignorant masses. He decided to eliminate <br>the international bankers, by establishing a system of loans, allowing <br>the states to borrow directly from the people without intermediary. He <br>did not study financial questions, but his robust good sense revealed to<br> him that the source of any wealth resides in the work and economy of <br>the nation. He opposed emissions through the international financiers. He<br> obtained from the Congress the right to borrow from the people by <br>selling to it the bonds of the states. The local banks were only too <br>glad to help such a system. And the government and the nation escaped <br>the plots of foreign financiers.

I could be wrong, though I did get that out of the history book. And my favorite question, was Lincoln constitutional legally right to go to war with the South? It States in our constitution that the only way to commit treason, is to declare war on the U.S. or to Aid and Abed are enemies. It also says that Rebellion is not treason and is treated differently, also the U.S. never recognized the Confederacy as a country, and still considered it part of the United States.

So why did John green say when Lincoln said the war was about keeping the union together that he was not telling the truth?

But to a man, on an individual-to-individual basis, the South had superior soldiers and military commanders. Southerners were much better riflemen, more experienced horseback riders, had an increased understanding of the terrain &amp; familiarity with living off the land, and were more motivated to win the war since they considered this conflict an unjust invasion by the North to exterminate Southern society. Launched by a central government in Washington that had exceeded the limits of it&#39;s power\u2013having become the same type of enemy the founding fathers fought against during the Revolutionary War\u2013and led by a president the entire South viewed as a &quot;bloodthirsty conqueror&quot; hellbent on expanding his own power by destroying Southern culture. Regardless of whether or not that was true about Lincoln &amp; the federal government, the South believed this to be the case nonetheless. <br><br>What bothers me most about the Civil War is the narrative it has taken on. As is to be expected, like all epic conflicts, there is a mythology built up around the Civil War. In this case it is the false notion that the North was an army of noble, chivalrous, tolerant heroes fighting valiantly to free black people from the wretched, demonic Southerners who really didn&#39;t care about upholding slavery in order to sustain the South&#39;s agrarian economy..... they just wanted to keep torturing &amp; tormenting black people to satisfy a cruel, sadistic pleasure that is inherently Southern. Sadly, that is the message too many young people in America today have of the Civil War. I know the rule of thumb when it comes to history : The winners write the history/official record of events for future generations to learn about. In reality however, 90% of Northern soldiers weren&#39;t activists or abolitionists or compelled in any way to risk their own lives for the sake of black slaves living faraway in what was essentially a foreign nation in their eyes considering the distance geographically, economically, culturally, and politically the North and South were by the mid 1800s. No, the Northern soldiers were often equally racist and intolerant themselves. The masses who made up the armies of the North were fighting to preserve the union, not abolish slavery. To the Union soldiers standing in the ranks, marching, fighting, dying, and suffering hardships year-in &amp; year-out, they weren&#39;t sustained by the virtuous ideal of freeing blacks\u2013  they believed they were fighting for everyone in the USA because an American continent with multiple sovereign states weakened the entire nation by opening the door for potential invasions from the industrialized Europe superpowers who were becoming increasingly imperialist and expansionist. Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and Russia would have most certainly been casting greedy eyes on America at that time with it&#39;s abundance of natural resources. So that&#39;s what always bothers me about the Civil War and the message too many people have about it. The Northern armies may have been in agreement that slavery was an embarrassing &amp; outdated practice for a civilized nation to still be conducting in the 19th century, but that didn&#39;t mean the slaves were welcome to migrate North so they could live &amp; work amongst each other equally. As one freed slave wrote in a letter home to his family still living in the South, he said, &quot;The only difference between the North and the South is the weather&quot;.", "comment_date": "2016-01-25T07:36:14Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "CharethCutestory", "comment_text": "What&#39;s so civil about war anyway?", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T09:13:44Z", "likes_count": 122}, {"comment_by": "ws04", "comment_text": "Goldfield America Aflame p.326?", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T02:13:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kynarion1", "comment_text": "Is it true that Russia sent fleets to both the Atlantic and Pacific, while contacting Lincoln and informing him that Russia would intervene on the North&#39;s behalf, if asked?", "comment_date": "2016-01-21T03:46:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meg Brody", "comment_text": "thank u", "comment_date": "2016-01-21T03:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meg Brody", "comment_text": "i love u", "comment_date": "2016-01-21T03:43:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Coral Beaches", "comment_text": "Of course, he also said: &quot;If I could preserve this Union without freeing the slaves, I would.&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-01-20T16:16:16Z", "likes_count": 289}, {"comment_by": "Danielle", "comment_text": "When John began talking about the Confederate leaders and their last words, all I could think of was Pudge!<br>OK.

The escalation of both armed conflict and secession, surrounding the Nullification Crisis, forced the Compromise Tariff of 1833. This is the only reason why both full scale secession and armed conflict did not occur prior to 1860, though it was at &quot;the tipping point.&quot; Between 1833 and 1860, protectionism reescalated, which in turn continued southern economic hardships under mercantilism. This was the sensitivity to Lincoln&#39;s election, of him not only being a &quot;black republican,&quot; but also a very well known &quot;Whig Republican.&quot; To omit this from your presentation, and only focusing on the immediate cause of slavery, is to do history no justice. It is the equivalent of stating a boat sank by a hole, but not by the turbulent waters that filled the boat. <br>It is very important to frame the issue of slavery appropriately. The 4 Declaration of Causes for Secession issued by Mississippi (and the like) clearly state that slave-state representation, in becoming a minority, was a direct threat to Southern economies. Which is congruent with the turbulence already caused by harsh protectionism and Northern majoritarianism. The South had been systematically plundered to subsidize Northern industries for the past 30 years, and though the South would unanimously vote against harsh tariffs -that deeply harmed Southern economies, the Northern Votes far outweighed a unified South. Essentially, the South was already backed into a economic &quot;corner&quot; by the time of Lincoln&#39;s nomination. The issue of slavery, in regards to secession, was the &quot;back end of the wave,&quot; as a continuation of economic challenges to the South.<br>Moreover, there seems to be a common confusion of issues, between the reasons of secession and the reasons for the war. Both your episode and my argument above are concerned with the issues of secession, not the issues of the war itself. The two are disjointed. By the Montgomery Convention of Feb 1861, the Confederate States of America was a functional, sovereign government, that had already legally and peacefully seceded. It had an elected president, congressional body, constitution, a means to raise armed forces, and emissaries issued to Europe (the South&#39;s main trading partner).The Confederacy continued as a functional, sovereign country until 1865 (4 whole years), when the North forcefully removed its government after CFS armies surrendered. Instead of avoiding the bloodiest conflict in American history, Abraham Lincoln refused such things as peace brokering by Bonaparte the 3rd, for he claimed that the South had no right to secede (which it did), and invaded an established CFS on the grounds of both &quot;retaliation&quot; (post Fort Sumter incident provocations) and &quot;reunification.&quot; Therefore, the issues of the war were concerned with the Union assimilating the South by force, and the CFS maintaining its liberty. (Because of this to even claim the &quot;War of 1861&quot; a &quot;Civil War&quot; is errant, being that a civil war is sides conducting battle to determine a shared government. As demonstrated, the two did not share a single government, were no longer of the same country, nor were fighting to determine a shared constitution. It is then better to claim &quot;the Civil War&quot; as the War of Southern Assimilation, or more honest still, the War of Union Aggression.) Just as historians claim that there is a Confederate &quot;Lost Cause&quot; narrative, there is equally a Union &quot;Moral Abolitionism&quot; narrative, that is still rampant today, that still &quot;flavors&quot; this video.

Secession is not an act nor a declaration of war, simply leaving and establishing a new country. It was not to defend slavery whatsoever, it was to defend their homeland against northern invaders.

(Seems not much has changed in 150 years) Another interesting fact is that in the North, blacks were not treated as citizens. In Ohio for example a black man and his family would be forced to put up a bond of $500 per family member to insure they would not cause trouble. They could be sold back in to slavery if they did cause problems but were not allowed to vote or bear witness against whites in court. The fact is that the North used slavery as an issue to get support in a war against the South for not paying the high taxes levied on them.  During this period the South was where all of the money came from. The South felt they were not being represented by the government and seceded. This is where the argument for states rights comes from. And as a side note the confederate battle flag was never an official flag of the confederate government.

Slavery was a terrible thing, but at the start of the war both North and South had slaves. The war was not about slavery, it was primarily about State&#39;s rights. In a previous video it was asked &#39;State&#39;s rights to do what&#39;. Well, for one to secede from the Union. Also, the right of states to decide taxation and the\u00a0laws that are followed in a given state. In many ways providing these rights is what killed the South. The States were given power over taxation, and didn&#39;t hand over their taxes to the central Confederate government. An early video in the series mocked the Articles of Confederation, but those articles were noble, and much of the war was the South fighting for those early principles. The South fought for a small central government and the natural right of states to decide their own destiny. If it had been a war about slavery, I would wholly support the North. It was not. Instead, the North used slavery as an excuse to drag the South back into a union it no longer wished to be a part of, then razed Southern identity, culture and civilisation to the ground. Had the North allowed the South to simply leave, within 20 years slavery would have been abolished in the South, and both the USA and the CSA would be far less racist today. If the North cared so much about African Americans, why is the USA still so racist today? Why is it that a century later, when Roosevelt invited an African-American to eat at the White House the nation was up in arms?", "comment_date": "2015-07-11T19:46:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Michael Martin", "comment_text": "But if the south just wated their slaves then they would have stayed in the union.

Also when asked y not just let the south go in peace Lincoln said then who would pay for the federal government. So it would make more sense to say the war was about money.

The War Between The States was no more about slavery than World War Two was a crusade to end The Holocaust and &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot;, the ending of those were merely a happy coincidence, and never a primary motivation for war. One hundred and fifty years of well-considered, deeply planned propaganda by professional mouthpieces for government oppression cannot change this fact.\u00a0<br><br>Equally false is the idea that northerners gave a wiff about slavery at all. The Draft Riots, especially the New York Draft Riots were not about the Rebels being in Gettysburg; they were about the widespread opposition that the conscripted masses had to Lincoln&#39;s wholly political and substantively empty (and legally void) &quot;Emancipation Proclamation&quot;, which is why there were so many LYNCHINGS of black folk in NYC.

Slavery was not the cause of the war. Yeah,  you&#39;re getting that from the user with the Battle Flag of Northern Virginia as my avatar, however, The South solely seceded to preserve their states rights. I will not deny that there was slavery in the south. I will also not deny that the preservation of slavery was not at the forefront of some political leaders. However, the general consensus of Confederate soldiers were not interested in preserving slaves in the CSA. That was up to the leaders. The majority of Confederate soldiers seceded to preserve their states rights because they believed that an oppressive government was taking away the rights of their states. That sounds a bit harsh, but to put it simply, the local governments of the southern states wanted more power over the central government. Therefore, they created a Confederacy, where the local governments of the states had more power over the laws then the central government did. The South believed that to be the better form of government for their region. I believe that slavery was a horrible injustice to many blacks across the country. I agree with Robert E. Lee that slavery should be outlawed as it is an evil. But slavery would not have continued in the South. With the advancements of mechanized farming and New World civil rights taking over, the institution of slavery would have been done away with shortly after the war. It was likely that would that would not have lasted past the 1880s. That doesn&#39;t make it right, but a lot of people have The misunderstanding that slavery would&#39;ve continued into today. I don&#39;t think that racial injustice would have gone away completely, but I think at this point, if the Confederate States of America were here on Southern soil today, there would be changes within the black community and other racial equality. Keep in mind, too: the American flag was the only flag that ever flew off the slave ship coming from Africa to the states holding black men.  Never once did the Confederate flag fly over slave ships, as the trade of slaves from Africa was outlawed in the Confederate Constitution. And that grand old Capitol building in Washington DC? Built with slave labor. And the North wasn&#39;t very nice to blacks during the Civil War, either. The north was full of racist. Just because they didn&#39;t agree with slavery, didn&#39;t mean that they weren&#39;t racist.

We ended\u00a0right before the civil war. If Lincoln would of lived we would of been restored. instead of common law rights we now have civil rights. Everything is a privilege instead of a right. civil rights can be taken away which they are being taken away more and more every year. This video does not examine the real reason\u00a0for the Civil War.\u00a0The Civil War was not about slavery. It did end slavery but with the 14th amendment we all became slaves with civil rights not common law guaranteed rights.
