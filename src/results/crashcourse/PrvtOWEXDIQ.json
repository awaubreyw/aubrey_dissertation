Courage is not refusing to fight if there is any chance of being hurt. That is cowardice. If you doubt me, then ask how cowardice would behave any differently. Courage would accept some level of harm, but not a reckless amount. Courage would not charge unarmed into a fight against 10 men with guns, where death would be certain. But courage would definitely accept the possibility of loss or damage in an effort to help or rescue someone. Think about how preposterous it would be to define &quot;courage&quot; as peeking from the safety of your window and calling the police. And when the police arrive, are they supposed to not approach a robber unless they have a guarantee they won&#39;t be hurt as well? Even if the police outnumber a robber and all have guns, there is a chance they could get punched or shot. So if courage means no one is to accept the possibility of danger, then I&#39;m afraid no one will tackle the problem, no one will come rescue the little lady getting her purse stolen, and courage will simply cease to exist.

The place of virtue in the soul is important to note because of Aristotle&#39;s ultimate goals. For Aristotle, the ultimate goal is happiness (which we know because everyone desires it), and happiness for Aristotle is rational activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. This is because there are essentially three parts of the soul to Aristotle (well, two and a half). The first part is pure reason, the rational part of the soul. The other parts of the soul could both be considered &quot;nonrational,&quot; but one of them (the appetitive part), is capable of following reason. The reason I bring this up is because it&#39;s necessary to know to understand why virtue is important at all- it&#39;s the means of the nonrational to cooperate with the rational.<br>2. Virtue is not an arithmetic mean, but rather a circumstantial one. Hank somewhat implies this, but it&#39;s important to be said more fully, as the interpretation of it as an arithmetic mean was done extensively in the middle ages, which is actually a pretty terrible misreading. Consider the purpose of a virtue like temperance- if someone has the virtue of temperance, they are able to fight against the urges of the body and have reason overcome them. Considering this an arithmetic mean, like the church did, puts a hard limit on not doing things like drinking, which removes the focus of the virtues from the idea of cooperation with rationality. Like I said, the rationalism is important.<br>3. Virtue also can&#39;t just be done, it has to be intended. Children are able to do virtuous things by accident, but that does not mean they are virtuous. This is something that Hank actually misses a bit. The importance of intention, once again, connects to the idea of rationality.<br><br>I bring this all up because it&#39;s easy to overemphasize character virtues in Aristotle&#39;s works. The rational aspects of it are just as important, and shouldn&#39;t be neglected to be noted in an introductory video.
