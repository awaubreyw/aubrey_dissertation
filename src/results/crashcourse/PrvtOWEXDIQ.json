As a greek myself, I&#39;d like to share this information about the definition of Eudaimonia. We learn in school that the meaning of this word has been changed several times. The philosophers of the age before 500BC gave to this word the meaning of &quot;Someone who gets anything he asks for from the Gods&quot; (maybe because he is in good relationship with them). Then, around 500BC, Hippocrates, Demodocus and then Aristotle gave the meaning that we also use to day: &quot;To be happy regardless of the situations, feeling accomplished for taking action always with good manners.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-06-19T12:59:57Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Abe Sapien", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a fan of Nichomachean ethics, but wow, I really disagree with the example of courage discussed here. Courage is not refusing to fight if there is any chance of being hurt. That is cowardice. If you doubt me, then ask how cowardice would behave any differently. Courage would accept some level of harm, but not a reckless amount. Courage would not charge unarmed into a fight against 10 men with guns, where death would be certain. But courage would definitely accept the possibility of loss or damage in an effort to help or rescue someone. Think about how preposterous it would be to define &quot;courage&quot; as peeking from the safety of your window and calling the police. And when the police arrive, are they supposed to not approach a robber unless they have a guarantee they won&#39;t be hurt as well? Even if the police outnumber a robber and all have guns, there is a chance they could get punched or shot. So if courage means no one is to accept the possibility of danger, then I&#39;m afraid no one will tackle the problem, no one will come rescue the little lady getting her purse stolen, and courage will simply cease to exist.

Obviously, any amount of bravery needs to be complimented with good judgement to be consistently beneficial, but my point is that I do not think it makes sense to say that recklessness is too much bravery or too much of a good thing when it seems to me that it is simply a lack of a good thing(good judgment).", "comment_date": "2017-06-06T21:18:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fred", "comment_text": "Hi, I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m curious, and I&#39;m not hating or maybe I am, kinda new to this, but don&#39;t you think your &#39;crash course&#39; emphasized\u00a0too much on a practical approach to philosophical subjects matters, not condemning logic, after all,  you do make a lot of sense, if that&#39;s all you do??", "comment_date": "2017-05-31T21:49:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis Sierra", "comment_text": "Elon Musk is my Moral Exemplar", "comment_date": "2017-05-29T22:55:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sisina Anish", "comment_text": "This channel eocks", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T14:23:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Flip Venom", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t going to bed on the end of the day &quot;feeling exhausted&quot; be caused by having excessively tried to be virtues?

I&#39;ve been struggling for a while now only till very recently, by which I mean a couple days ago, realizing that if I truly wish to live the life I want that I need to emulate the person I feel would be capable of the task. I totally understand what Aristotle means by that I know what to do and how to be a virtuous person, but the vast majority of people I have met have no clue.<br><br>I live in a richer area but my family and I are very poor. Being that I was able to gain experiences through my families suffering (of being poor), yet also being a Christian (having great morals that other religions also have), but at the same time I was able to develop my mind (due to my parent&#39;s enrolling me in these rich dense school areas), I am very much setup to achieve human flourishing.<br> <br>Thanks for the video and for introducing me to, not the concept but branding or label of, eudaimonia! I&#39;m going live, ofc, but also share this (*\uff3e\u25bd\uff3e)\uff0f (\u30ce^\u2207^).", "comment_date": "2016-12-05T22:41:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AnakimLuke", "comment_text": "Wait, I don&#39;t want to get pneumonia!!", "comment_date": "2016-12-05T22:38:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Taysom", "comment_text": "But why should/would I want Eudaimonia?

The place of virtue in the soul is important to note because of Aristotle&#39;s ultimate goals. For Aristotle, the ultimate goal is happiness (which we know because everyone desires it), and happiness for Aristotle is rational activity of the soul in accordance with virtue. This is because there are essentially three parts of the soul to Aristotle (well, two and a half). The first part is pure reason, the rational part of the soul. The other parts of the soul could both be considered &quot;nonrational,&quot; but one of them (the appetitive part), is capable of following reason. The reason I bring this up is because it&#39;s necessary to know to understand why virtue is important at all- it&#39;s the means of the nonrational to cooperate with the rational.<br>2. Virtue is not an arithmetic mean, but rather a circumstantial one. Hank somewhat implies this, but it&#39;s important to be said more fully, as the interpretation of it as an arithmetic mean was done extensively in the middle ages, which is actually a pretty terrible misreading. Consider the purpose of a virtue like temperance- if someone has the virtue of temperance, they are able to fight against the urges of the body and have reason overcome them. Considering this an arithmetic mean, like the church did, puts a hard limit on not doing things like drinking, which removes the focus of the virtues from the idea of cooperation with rationality. Like I said, the rationalism is important.<br>3. Virtue also can&#39;t just be done, it has to be intended. Children are able to do virtuous things by accident, but that does not mean they are virtuous. This is something that Hank actually misses a bit. The importance of intention, once again, connects to the idea of rationality.<br><br>I bring this all up because it&#39;s easy to overemphasize character virtues in Aristotle&#39;s works. The rational aspects of it are just as important, and shouldn&#39;t be neglected to be noted in an introductory video.
