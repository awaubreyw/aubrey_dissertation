Where does culture come from? It didn&#39;t just fall out of the sky. It comes from us. If culture has been structured in such a way that women are being conditioned into care-based morals, then that would be because women have care-based morals innately. It would be a feedback loop. We create culture, then culture reinforces our behaviors, which reinforces culture, which reinforces behaviors, and so on. The point is that it starts with <i>us.</i> If you think men and women are somehow equal underneath, then can you explain why culture conditioning doesn&#39;t reflect that? You can&#39;t.
