May 17, 2015 I died of a massive heart attack. For me it was a dreamless sleep. No pain even though I was electricuted 5 different times I never felt anything. 8 days later in a CCU the doctors told my kids that it was over they could do no more. Now (granted my son told me all this stuff after.) My kids were to return in the morning at 8 am and say good bye. The staff would then stop the machines keeping me alive. That night or morning I don&#39;t know, but I woke up, I felt the tube in my mouth and began to chew on it, my chewing set off the alarm and the nurse came in to the dark room turned on the light and saw me looking at him. It sounded to me far away but he yelled He&#39;s alive. From that point forward I felt everything that had been done to me. Coming back is the same as being born, nothing works, I had to relearn my life, walk, talk, just like a baby, it&#39;s been 5 years and I feel great, 1 big stent in the front of my heart fixed me.

The self or the spirit soul is spiritual in essence. There is a distinction between the two. The body is animated and appears to be living because of the presence of life (self, spirit). When the life/self leaves it behind, it is pronounced &quot;dead&quot;. The soul, covered by the mind (experiences, attachments, feelings, desires etc) will then transmigrate into another body - human, animal or plant. Some of the desires, experiences, attachments will be carried on to the next life - like child prodigies and savants. The abilities that they honed from their past lives manifests at  even an early age with virtuosity. There are children who can vividly remember their past lives but forgot about it later on. Sometimes the self, who is a &quot;woman&quot; in his past life, gets confused when she is put in a man&#39;s body in his next life. This is due to strong attachment being a &quot;woman&quot;. It is the consciousness and Karma that we develop that determine our next body -  animal, maggot or plant. <br><br><br>Death is like changing clothes or exiting and entering another door.

When I was much younger I needed dental surgery to remove deeply rooted canine teeth so that my adult incisors would be able to grow in properly, at the time I was naive. I was told that the anesthetic gas could cause specific dreams, aka if you pick the &#39;green&#39; cannister you will dream of soccer, no doubt to make it less scarier than &#39;you&#39;re not going to exist for the next 3 hours&#39; that it really was. My memory of it is still vivid, I could tell the gas wasn&#39;t air, it was off, and within a matter of moments my eyes fell shut and then nothing, next thing I can remember is being carried. Then being awake in the car, and being asked what I wanted to eat.<br><br>I don&#39;t remember the empty space, there&#39;s nothing to remember, it was empty blackness and as such I&#39;m fairly certain that when I die I will have a solid 30 minutes of existential dread. Maybe 4 or 5 minutes of fading consciousness and pain if I am unlucky, perhaps longer if I am really unlucky and shock hasn&#39;t set in, after which the long dark will take me. <br><br>My philosophy though has always been best described in book metaphors, we are each writing our own story and all our stories are woven together into a single book for each of us. Our books all take place in the same universe, I am but an unmentioned background character in a great many of those books but for my friends and my family I&#39;m a recurring character. They are likewise part of my narrative, and while our books may share chapters they are never written the same, nor is the style similar, it&#39;s a different perspective. Death is the ending, it&#39;s the final letter or the period or the exclamation mark or whatever else, it&#39;s the final touch of pen to paper and with it the book is closed. Some books will be referenced in others even after the ending, their leads wrote about in touching memories, tall tales being woven for strangers, or even published in online articles and spread around the world. But their book is over, those mentions don&#39;t change that, no one will ever pick up their book and continue the story for them, and when those books that referenced them are closed as well they cease to be stories and start to become one of many quadrillions of books that lay littered about. <br><br>My fear isn&#39;t for when my story ends, my fear is for when their story ends, when I can no longer read their pages or recall their authors with that same clarity I can right now. My fear is the day my mother&#39;s author steps away and I am left with a lifeless paperback upon the countless other stacks that came before, my fear is the day my brother&#39;s novel comes to a close and I am left writing chapters with but brief recollections of previous pages or moments we shared. My fear is the day my story closes and I know I&#39;ll never get to know how it all ends, what the climax of the overall story arch actually is. <br><br>Dying first would be a blessing as I&#39;d never have to know how my own story progresses without them, but a curse because I&#39;m leaving them to write after I&#39;m gone. <br><br>When my book is closed and ink no longer dances over paper I&#39;ll cease to be, or maybe I&#39;ll join the other authors as I get to sit back and see where it unfolds from there. Maybe I&#39;ll get to see my parents again, maybe my dog will be there, maybe my goldfish, maybe my prehistoric fish ancestor will be excited to see his story spawned so many sequels. I don&#39;t know what happens after the book is closed, personally I think that&#39;s it, that&#39;s how my story ends, and it fills me with dread to know that my story will either continue past my relatives and friends or they&#39;ll continue past me.<br><br>And at the end of the day, when my fingers are weary and my eyes are heavy I&#39;ll sleep soundly, but until then my imagination runs wild and I worry about the nightmares that will never come.", "comment_date": "2018-02-15T18:01:30Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"mjQwedC1WzI": {"Perspectives on Death: Crash Course Philosophy #17": {"channel_id": "UgxaP-L5BgrNmL6mutB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "TheGrizzly artist", "comment_text": "I hope what ever happens we\u2019ll be ok", "comment_date": "2018-02-14T06:00:14Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"mjQwedC1WzI": {"Perspectives on Death: Crash Course Philosophy #17": {"channel_id": "Ugykdu2tyQ2rAWYXx-F4AaABAg", "comment_by": "oriana garrido", "comment_text": "YOLO!", "comment_date": "2018-02-13T16:27:49Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"mjQwedC1WzI": {"Perspectives on Death: Crash Course Philosophy #17": {"channel_id": "UgwnH5P5_gnmTHkf32N4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Pascal Massie", "comment_text": "Once again, this is very good.

Afterlife is simply your lingering reputation in the real world.  People may try to tell stories about you after you died, but the &quot;you&quot; they describe would be nothing but a shadow of the person &quot;you&quot; were.  In other words, all of their memories of you would be mere hypothesis on who you actually were.  Once your reputation dies (people forget about you), your afterlife ends and the concept of &quot;you&quot; officially decompose into oblivion.<br><br>For example, take the late 14th century English monarch, Richard II.  He was really just like any other human in life:  he had weaknesses and he had strengths, and due to many events and circumstances, he was deposed and killed by his cousin (Henry IV).  200 years later, Shakespeare wrote a play with him as the titular character, and portrayed him as more or less an &quot;empty shell&quot; of a king (long story).  This led to many people thinking of Richard as a weak person who just couldn&#39;t cut it.  According to my proposal, this is Richard II&#39;s afterlife.  He was turned from a real flesh-and-blood person into a sort of 2 or 2.5 dimensional caricature of the real him.

Those are the people who should fear dying. I would agree with Zhuangzi. You should celebrate death, if you are going to have eternal life. At my church we have celebration of life events instead of morning the death of a someone. Death is only a transition, like baby to toddler or child to teenager. Death is a going away party, but only temporarily. As Christians, we still morn the loss of a loved one; we morn the loss of their presence in our lives. But, this is only temporary.

You cannot know the future that way, only speculate about possibilities. Additionally, you cannot go to the past.

That in itself is scary, knowing that one day, you&#39;ll eventually leave behind the people you care about, and/or will affect the people who cared about you, unable to see the effects of your death in others. Of course, this is only if you had both people you care about and people who care about you. If people didn&#39;t care about you, death may be more of a relief, knowing that your death didn&#39;t cause any unwanted feelings of others, or rather that you could even escape the harshness of life and reality permanently. Of course, there will still be things missed if you cared about someone, even if they didn&#39;t care about you. Which comes to my final point, where death truly wouldn&#39;t be so dreadful. When you don&#39;t care about anyone else. Apathetic. Narcissistic. If you can truly not care about the people affected by your death, and can die with a straight mind, without being concerned about anything else...then maybe death can be peaceful.

Just look at all the war stories or survivor stories. Those people obviously didn&#39;t want to die and some feared it. I think we only fear death when It&#39;s inconvenient. If you lived a nice long life of 100, then you probably wouldn&#39;t mind dying. You might not like leaving loved ones behind, but that&#39;s just a part of life and death. But, if you&#39;re young (like me, I&#39;m 16) you don&#39;t want to die. You never even experienced what the world has to offer. I think we all in the back of our head have a little fear of death. That fear takes over when you&#39;re thrown into the wilderness and you need to survive. To be more specific, I think we fear of what we will die from. None of us want to die a painful death. I would think the best death is dying in your sleep of old age. In survival situations, we fear dying alone and being killed by a wild animal. I real life, we fear dying of diseases (If we&#39;re going through it). I think humans are the most determined creatures on the planet. If we&#39;re trapped in deadly situations in life, we have a powerful mental will never to give up no matter what. Some lose hope, but others refuse to let death consume them. They feel the need to win this battle, despite they will just die later on. That is one thing that always interested me about humans. Our powerful will to survive no matter what the costs. This essay thing went all over the place, but I tried my best to state my point. (Oh also, always try new things in life. The more things you do, the longer your life will feel.

However, they did not make me think about death as something pleasant. They made me think that my life is irrelevant. That intelligent life is not the most unique thing in the universe. Of all of the amazing things the universe has, as far as we know, nothing, absolutely nothing gets even close to reason as we do. To be creative as we are. To wonder about ourselves and the reality we experience. Yet, despite being so incredibly unique, we are one of the most fragile and ephemeral things in the entire cosmos. This not only sounds absurd to me, but also as a waste of resources. Humans have a literally endless potential. The limitations on the span of our lives have caused us to simply think that brief existence is somehow better than an eternal one and find reasons to argue for it. Apart from people who want to end their pain or don&#39;t value their existence as the most important thing there is, we all want to live. Not necessarily forever, but we want to live. Having experiences and reacting to the world around is not always pleasant but it is much better than ceasing to exist together. I don&#39;t think these guys got to consider the very notion of not existing in a critical manner. It&#39;s not the end of pain, not the end of suffering. We feel pain now and death is not a savior. It&#39;s like the guy who watches you get beat up and then knocks you down with a pipe. Some people could argue that he relieved you from the pain, but isn&#39;t much more reasonable to think that he was just piling on on your suffering? And these people who say eternal life is boring or dangerous cannot really argue for death being a good thing, because they are doing the very thing to contradict their statement: living to say that death is good. I understand some people who argue that there is nothing we can do about it, so arguing is pointless. But people who say death is natural and we should welcome it, I do not understand. I love my life. With all the good and the bad, the one thing I wish to avoid more than anything is to stop existing. Hell, I would definitely abandon my morals, ethic or any sort of abstract belief for the certainty of living forever. I&#39;d do anything to live for as long as I wanted and not just wither and die like I was nothing to begin with. Life is good. But with its end, it makes it nothing but a brief pleasure. An everlasting life would be perfect, because even if you did want to stop living, which I doubt most people would, you would still have the chance, you would have the freedom. And that&#39;s what death is. It enslaved us. And it has done such an amazing job, even the smartest people in the world don&#39;t dare to question it or fight against it.

The Self, whatever that is probably cannot be studied, the same way fire can&#39;t warm itself, and photons can&#39;t shine on their selves. However, whatever the Self is, it&#39;s everywhere, and it&#39;s immortal.

However, unlike our predecessors, we have the means to escape, to break our programming, to give our lives meaning beyond reproduction and transcend the biological bonds that hold us.  Already, we have nearly defeated its chief tool: natural selection.  Those poor people born with errors in their genetic code, failed experiments, can now live fulfilling lives.  With the number of scientific revolutions occurring (with CRISPR, quantum computing, etc.) I would not be surprised if we defeated natural death itself within the next 50-100 years.  We will use technology to remove biological disadvantage.  The mind will be improved to such an extent that its original predetermined composition will not mean much.  There will be no unintelligent people, only very powerful and unique minds.  Physical strength is already irrelevant, but it will become more so.  Everyone will be aesthetically beautiful according to their own tastes, making appearance an honest reflection of one&#39;s personality.  Of course, the expiration date will go as well.

I think this is what scares most people. We never experience being nothing, thinking nothing or not having a consciousness. We are all of afraid of the unkown and being nothing is something we&#39;ll never know/experience. Socrates mentions that he could &quot;use the rest&quot; so the good part of. an endless dream that he refers to is probably the feelimg of being well rested after waking up.

Even religious people cry when their family members die, even though they probably wouldn&#39;t cry if they&#39;d simply moved away somewhere very nice. Every human on some level understands that death is a terrible final ending. Fearing death is like fearing a giant monster with claws and sharp teeth. It actually makes a good deal of sense, because death is basically the worst possible outcome. You say it&#39;s a tragedy when someone dies at 20, because they missed out on so much life. But if we could live for 200 years, dying at 80 would seem a terrible loss. It&#39;s only because we <i>have</i> to die so soon (currently) that we rationalize and pretend like it&#39;s okay; it&#39;s too hard to look at it straight in the face. And if some species never had to die at all, the existence of death itself would seem a deeply terrible tragedy, and that&#39;s exactly what it is.
