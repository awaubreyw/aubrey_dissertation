The reality is that fiscal stimulus HAS to be paired with austerity. It cannot magically generate jobs. All you can do is smooth out the free market. If you give it a giant boost today there are consequences tomorrow.

You made it seem as though the US exclusively employed Keynesian economics as opposed to the  Classical method of Europe. You made it seem as thought Keynes says we should lower taxes and raise spending, but that is not true. In the stimulus bills, the highest marginal tax rate was actually increased and only a relatively small number of tax cuts went through. Most notable Keynesian economists (Krugman comes to mind) advocated a massive tax increase on the upper middle class and rich. Europe already had ridiculously high spending and they really couldn&#39;t stimulate further. They actually followed Keynes advice by raising taxes on their wealthiest citizens to pay for the social programs for the poor and jobless. As you pointed out, this led to further unemployment and what remains as a terribly damaged economy. Now admittedly stimulus and a progressive tax system are important, but please don&#39;t make it seem as though Europe didn&#39;t follow Keynes&#39; policies and are paying the price. Europe has been almost exclusively following his advice for going on 40 years. It has led to out of control spending and taxes, less economic freedom, and an inefficient economy.

Then after the war they reversed many of the New Deal economic policies. Eliminated the price fixing national relief act. Engaged in free trade and repealed the Smoot Hawley act and the high tariffs.

I mean it&#39;s literally madness, we only do it because we happen to be here at this point in history, but it&#39;s on the whole quite nonsensical to measure anything via country to country comparisons and so on. I mean no individual that exists is the &quot;average&quot; citizen that statistics show, that kind of person doesn&#39;t exist in any country. <br><br>All those &quot;newly hired&quot; workers aren&#39;t earning more money either by the way, they are earning the money taken from the people from whom the government took it in order to invest it into &quot;putting idle resources back to work&quot;, they did not increase earnings, they increased the debt. Not just that, but surely you guys should have mentioned that economics 101 tells you that running consumption on borrowed money is pretty much never a good idea. And this kind of Keynesian stimulus and production runs entirely on borrowed money as you&#39;ve just explained.

Thus an input likely will not give the desired output, although just as often, it will. Humans are also fickle in regards to both positive and negative stimuli and react quickly, often irrationally. This contaminates &quot;theory&quot; dramatically over time. If Keynes was actually right, bubbles wouldn&#39;t be shifting around the global economy from sector to sector; they&#39;d simply be smaller overall and less painful when they burst. National debt / surplus also would ebb and flow as a counterbalance. This is obviously not the case and the only winners as this experiment has run its course (or losers in a lot of ways) are the lenders with productivity (and/or generational wealth) comfortably higher than their consumption in a twisted spiral of escalating interest payments which necessitates the ever lowering of interest rates which are systemically approaching negative and are an important signal or inflection point. This latter point also leads to the specter of cronyism which is a real thing, though, how truly endemic it is as an economic force which affects the system itself is debatable.<br><br>Freedom of subjectivity, has its own significant impact. Again, unless you have a despotic, mechanical and arguably tyrannical reign present you cannot control every detail of human behavior or opinion. Consequently, human perceptions rather than statistics drive most of the macro workings of their interaction together. Those perceptions are largely based on past events. If those are negative events, we are wired to reject them and not take them into consideration even if their passing would be beneficial in the longer term. Eventually the well intentioned coddling of human interaction will spiral out of control in a largely positive direction until enough people perceive that the medium, money, is without meaning any longer. Disenfranchisement takes hold and untold and unimaginable results present themselves.<br><br>That&#39;s the folly of intervention. It&#39;s not evil per-se, however it can be perceived as evil rather easily as historical examples of intervention have much more often than not lead to ultimate disasters after they run their course. It&#39;s just that the longer time frames involved leave room for the typical human to forget most of the details and causes of the events and focus more on the immediate situation thus going along with schemes that benefit them in the intermediate term.<br><br>My hope for the future is, once this system runs its course, crashes and burns with whatever calamity it brings; the information age will have connected enough people to the direct happenings that the folly of intervention will be less likely in the minds of the survivors. Either that or we somehow transcend the notion of scarcity and from then on the universe is our playground. Hope for the latter; prepare for the former.

The problem that happened with the 2008 recession is the fact that interest rates hit near 0%, you could not lower interest rates anymore (i.e. -1% interest rate).  You can only super inject the economy for so long without having a net interest rate gain before you get a recession you can&#39;t get out of using those means.  This is why the Fed settled for a cash infusion of money i.e the bailout.  This does not have the same effect as lowering interest rates, it never will.  What people need to understand is, that we need to raise interest rates upwards, if we want to have another 20-30 year period of time where the economy can hum along.

Even if said farmers took a hit, they still could get the basics on their own (Food, Candles, Clothes).

As such when another big recession hit (as it did in 1929), it effected every industrial world.
