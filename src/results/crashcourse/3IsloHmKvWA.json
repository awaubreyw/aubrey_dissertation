Instead of cutting off the healthcare (mostly Medicaid) of people in vegetative states, the government should continue to pay for the people on the machines until their bodies give out. And instead of cutting off children&#39;s insurance, such as CHIP or Medicaid, the state should be required to pay for treatment. All I can say that I&#39;ve had the unfortunate experience of meeting too many screwed up politicians who like to tell women not to abort their pregnancies  but then cut off food stamps, cash benefits and health care once the baby is alive.

One example is Betsy DeVos, who wants to give every child with disabilities a treatment with a company with which she has an investment in called NuCor.

Therefore the fetus is not strictly part of a womens body. the fetus has dna that is not wholy identical to the mother. so while the child does grow within a womans body it is not part of it. this leads me to conclude that on the subject of abortion and adoption it cannot be simply the mothers choice. these type of decisions should be made by either both parents or by the child in question who as a fetus has no way to commune. now as to the concept of a child being forumed with a disability and that the avoidance of suffering could justify an abortion. pain is relative, for example say a fetus was found to have brain damage during its development. this brain damage would cause the child to develope with severe retardation. how do we know that the retardation is suffering? it could be the child has no understanding of life without this limitation and could be perfectly content. I find that most arguments for abortion are not for or wholy for the benifit of the child but more for aleaving parents of their suffering in dealing with a disabled or unwanted child. we live in a world where many people well never experiance the joy of parenting. yet we also live in a world where many have children but either cant provide for them or dont want them. adoption should be the first choice not abortion. perhaps we should make people gain certification to parent and fine these people who get pregnant due to recklessness", "comment_date": "2017-08-21T13:55:29Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"3IsloHmKvWA": {"Assisted Death & the Value of Life: Crash Course Philosophy #45": {"channel_id": "Ugxxbe3ESyKKhNdNSiJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Beth Duffus", "comment_text": "Well done Crash Course.

I respect for women decision whether she keep the pregnancy or not, we must respect their choices because it\u2019s not our decisions, and we shouldn&#39;t judge them from the choices they about to made. In few countries including U.S, they are forcing women to have an abortion or keep the baby(ies) and not let women to decide.  For example, mostly republicans are against abortion and they are placing laws to prevent them for having one. Mostly of them will says like, &quot; I hate abortion because it against my religious beliefs. If my beliefs said it wrong for women to have abortion and y&#39;all shouldn&#39;t having it. If a woman did had abortion and they will be punishing for it\u201d. This is show that conservatives are using religious methods and use it against their will. Another example, if a Chinese woman want to keep her baby(ies) because it&#39;s part of her flesh and blood.

(I do get that Thought bubble and the images were carefully selected to have a variety of other examples, but authority figures should play into it too)<br><br>White feminism? I smell a version. Throw in token Chinese people, and done.<br><br>But I would have liked the basics of Eastern and Western Philosophy--which is something I enjoyed in my own High School classes (and Sunday School, though I&#39;m Jewish--complicated story on how a Korean can be Jewish and going to Sunday school). And this section was completely skipped. Cultural relativism in philosophy is large and wide, but I believe it could at least be condensed. Things like &quot;What is the nature of time?&quot; is different in Western and Eastern Philosophy. But even those labels are reductive, because that&#39;s only covering usually (East and sometimes South) Asia and Greece/Roman bases. What happened to those other continents? Africa? or North and South America?<br><br>I think there was a huge missed opportunity by only covering White feminism&#39;s PoV on &quot;What is Philosophy?&quot; Sun Tzu, Confucius, and also the line between what is philosophy and what is religious thought? would be a good place to look more globally at &quot;What is philosophy?&quot; (There&#39;s got to be others as well.) By implicitly guessing that people are more interested in Christianity, is to also guess that the majority of your audience is in, fact, Christian. (Majority of the world&#39;s population, BTW, is Muslim, last I checked). If Crash Course reaches a worldwide audience, what makes it statistically likely that the majority of that audience will be Christian? What happened to other religions? I get other thoughts were covered, but they were rarely front lined.<br><br>BTW, for people that don&#39;t know. Implicit Bias is not always conscious, which is the argument against diversity blind. Being diversity aware makes you conscious of these discrepancies so you don&#39;t end up navel gazing at your own diversity. Even if you are diversity aware, implicit bias can make you still favor your own groups subconsciously and put other groups as a second thought, rather than a headline. And while it&#39;s not intentional, it can be insidious all the same. For example, the intention might be to educate in a wide field, but the impact might be, &quot;Well, do black people, Latinx/Hispanic, Native peoples, Indigenous people also not have philosophers?&quot; thus telling the People of Color, they rarely have important thinkers in past or present and white people that they are the most important in philosophy (even if this is subconscious).

I believe this and will fight for this as I always have. That being said, I&#39;d like to discuss and debate the realities of why people make the choices that they do. I feel like the dialogue has gone from what would be best for the mother&#39;s health and well-being toward, if you can afford it, controlling for the most desirable outcome if one were to go full term and create an autonomous human being (with its own body and its own choice). <br><br>What concerns me the most is that people aren&#39;t just aborting &quot;disabled fetuses&quot;, they are aborting the idea of what those fetuses will become. They are having &quot;selective&quot; abortions motivated not by the quandary of &quot;Do I want to be pregnant?&quot;, but instead motivated by &quot;Do I want to bring a disadvantaged human into the world?&quot;<br><br>For example, say you know that your child is likely to have down syndrome once it&#39;s born. The fact that you know this now changes the context of your abortion. It stops being a consideration of one&#39;s own body and it becomes about your judgement on whether people with down syndrome have the right to live. That&#39;s harsh, but a fetus with down syndrome poses no risk to itself or the mother and therefore if you have an abortion, you&#39;re having an abortion based on the reality of WHAT IT WILL BECOME and not what it is.<br><br>That means, essentially, by basing your decision on what your child might be, you&#39;re making a judgment on who has a right to live in the world and who doesn&#39;t. Using this type of thinking actually complicates everything. It&#39;s not simply about your body any more. Well, technically it is. Just because you have pre-cog on what your baby will become doesn&#39;t change the fact that it is in your body and you have a choice.<br><br>There is something strangely psychotic and consumerist about this concept. And prejudice, as if deformity or special needs = a less than fulfilling life. If you are able-bodied, how can we possibly make this judgement?<br><br>I would never take choice away. That is ridiculous. But I do question the ethics behind a choice to abort a fetus based on what that fetus might become in the future.

I do no think that this is discriminating against the disabled. However, not all parents have the ability to provide the extensive care these children will need. Also, if these children are born, life will be extremely difficult for them. Day by day will be a constant struggle against these abnormalities. In my opinion, it is in the fetus&#39;s best interest to be terminated so that it does not have to live a suffering, painful life. Life is sacred, however quality of life needs to be considered. Allowing a child to come into this world knowing they will be in constant pain will weigh on your conscious just as much as it does for those parents who abort their perfectly good child just because they do not want to care for it at the time. By using the standard of substituted judgment that is discussed in the video the parents should make the decision based off of what they believe the child would want, not what they want. Even if the parents want their disabled, abnormal baby to live they must consider that the child probably would rather pass away than live a life filled with constant suffering.", "comment_date": "2017-02-08T16:46:41Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"3IsloHmKvWA": {"Assisted Death & the Value of Life: Crash Course Philosophy #45": {"channel_id": "UgjqJsiDQSGRCngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Muhammad Zulhusni Putra", "comment_text": "excellent", "comment_date": "2017-02-08T14:46:00Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"3IsloHmKvWA": {"Assisted Death & the Value of Life: Crash Course Philosophy #45": {"channel_id": "UgimDc3CJdBmxHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "s1lverp3nguin", "comment_text": "Aw I&#39;m gonna miss CC Philosophy :(", "comment_date": "2017-02-08T14:10:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"3IsloHmKvWA": {"Assisted Death & the Value of Life: Crash Course Philosophy #45": {"channel_id": "UgjdK2vlt-jq6HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Parasdyo Mangku", "comment_text": "this is the first series of crash course that i followed from beginning to end after i subscribed..", "comment_date": "2017-02-08T14:03:48Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"3IsloHmKvWA": {"Assisted Death & the Value of Life: Crash Course Philosophy #45": {"channel_id": "Ugj3Qo_tAaKGc3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Trine Juel", "comment_text": "I have followed this series with aw and really don&#39;t want my journey in to the world of philosophy to end now.

At week 25, brain waves reach a regular rate signifying cognitive consciousness aka life. This is well after pregnancy is noticeable. Any abortions before week 25 are perfectly fine with me (unless doctors can prove regular EEG activity before then). After week 25 however, any abortions should only be &#39;mercy abortions&#39; for example aborting a fetus with life crippling disabilities. This can be seen as a moral duty as proposed in the video. Any non &#39;mercy&#39; related abortions at this point can&#39;t be far from murder.

For example, there was a man living in Canada with a older woman living next to him, this older woman did not talk to him much, but from what he knew she was a kind-hearted lady. One day he found out she got a doctor to end her life by getting a prescription of medicine.(She did not need) It is really heartbreaking to see this happening to people, even the ones who aren&#39;t even born yet. Crash Corse most likely should have used both sides to this since everyone has an opinion, whether you think it&#39;s right or not, you need to respect the other person and their opinion just as you want to be respected and accepted. I think if someone has a terminal illness they shouldn&#39;t end their own life,(even if they are in pain). You should live life to the fullest, but I think it&#39;s just that in that moment they want it to be over. Have you ever been in a lot of pain? In that moment you didn&#39;t care because you  just wanted everything to be over, right? This is how people with a painful illness must feel like, but I believe when they overcome that illness or get the right pain medication they can not only get better, but feel better. With abortion I think it&#39;s horrible that an unborn child doesn&#39;t have the opportunity to choose whether they live or not. I understand that a women would get one because they are scared or simply don&#39;t want a baby, but I believe there are better options. If a child has a mental or physical condition it should be THEIR choice, not the parents, could you imagine a parent just killing off it&#39;s own child because of that?Something else that is coming from this new law is that people are just killing off relatives for their inheritance.
