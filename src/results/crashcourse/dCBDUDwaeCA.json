A few points:<br>(I actually really liked the video by the way. Please don&#39;t see all these points as very negative. Most of them are just tiny things. On of the biggest problems indigenous peoples of the Americas face nowadays is that their history is being ignored. In schoolbooks, at universities, in Europe, but (more sad), in the Americas as well. So thank you for making this and keep up with the good work!).<br><br>&quot;Stone carvings mostly concern gods and wars&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=1m35s\">1:35</a>)...... Not entirely true. There is indeed a lot about wars, that&#39;s right. But the 4 books actually talk a lot more about gods than the stones, who mostly talk about human (or supposed human) history. The idea that they were mostly about gods is a bit outdated (= pre- 1990s/1980s).<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=2m26s\">2:26</a>): besides the &quot;art style&quot;, the others are not Olmec but (lookalike Maya), Maya, and Aztec (calendar system).<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=3m15s\">3:15</a>): not only future dates, also for the past<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=3m29s\">3:29</a>): we are very, very, very sure that didn&#39;t believe the world would end in our year 2012. They also didn&#39;t run out of anything and wrote about events that will happen in the far far future, well beyond our 2012 year.<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=3m48s\">3:48</a>) again, the calendar shown here is NOT Mayan, but Aztec. And we see different calendars, they didn&#39;t . For them it was one system.<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=5m29s\">5:29</a>) &quot;symbolic&quot; is a bit of a weird word. Pictographic, logographic &amp; ideographic would be better.<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=7m31s\">7:31</a>) ah, I was waiting for that one... the wheel and the horse... :). We don&#39;t really know if they used the wheel a lot or not. They surely had it (as was proven a long time ago). One of the fascinating lidar discoveries is that the roads (the so called &quot;sac beho&#39;ob&quot;, white roads) were a lot longer, bigger &amp; wider., connecting not only palaces, but also cities. The horse wasn&#39;t there, that&#39;s true. But obviously you don&#39;t need those to build big cities. The idea that they didn&#39;t have wheels is a misunderstanding of 19-century research about the lack of chariots (which, of course, makes sense when there are no horses).<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=7m31s\">7:31</a>) A common mistake... There was no Maya empire, neither hydraulic, nor otherwise. There were a lot of city states, some bigger than others, some, indeed, almost empire-like. But there never was 1 big Maya empire. That says of course nothing about how big the civilization was.<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=7m49s\">7:49</a>): &quot;under stress&quot;... Hot research topic and well discussed nowadays! 1st of all, there was no such thing as a civilization collapse (thank you, mister Jared Diamond). It transformed a lot: old cities fell in disuse, new ones grew and became very powerful (like Mayapan for example). What seems to have collapsed was the ruling system of the Classic Period. About the Long Count. Another misconception I&#39;m afraid. It was still used at the time of the Spaniards, as in evident from the remaining books (all written in the Post Classic Period, and mostly at the end of that period, between the 13th and the 16th century).<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=8m20s\">8:20</a>): &quot;Nah WHO ahs?&quot;. ooooww! That actually hurt my ears :) . It&#39;s pronounced something like (spelling for English language speakers): &quot;Nah Wahs&quot;. And the Lake, in there language Nahuatl is pronounced &quot;Tesh-Co-Co&quot;. The &quot;x&quot; was pronounced as &quot;sh&quot;. It later changed in Spain to represent the &quot;ks&quot;-sound of today, but when the Spaniards arrived in the 16th century it was still a &quot;sh&quot;-sound.<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=9m14s\">9:14</a>): The Aztecs (or better: &quot;Mexicah&quot;, with a sh-sound!) didn&#39;t use the MAYA-calendar Round, the thing was Mesoamerican, not just Mayan.<br>(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCBDUDwaeCA&amp;t=10m35s\">10:35</a>), yep. Not only Mesoamericanist, altough I&#39;m not sure if the word &quot;Andeanist&quot; also exists :) Anyway, to answer a lot of the questions about the spelling: yes, Inka is as correct as Inca. Quechua (the language of the empire and still spoken in different forms from Colombia till Argentina) nowadays, has officially adopted the letter &quot;k&quot; in a lot of places although the &quot;c&quot; is also still wildly used. The same goes for the letter &quot;w&quot;, versus the more Spanish looking &quot;hua&quot; (kay/cay = to be.  Wasi/Huasi = house). By the way, the Inka/Inca-empire didn&#39;t start at CE 1100. The people were there, for sure, but the empire only started in the 15th century.", "comment_date": "2020-06-09T13:02:18Z", "likes_count": 42}}}, {"dCBDUDwaeCA": {"The Americas and Time Keeping: Crash Course History of Science #5": {"channel_id": "Ugz7jsn-PQAijV20xN94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Pat B", "comment_text": "I love corn.

They constructed huge mound architecture and their largest city (Cahokia, across the river from modern St Louis) had 40 thousand people, fairly large on the world scale for the period. They had an elaborate religious system and class hierarchy and polities engaged in complex politics with one another. The staple crops of maize beans and squash spread to North America in 100 BCE about 4600 years after their origin in Mexico I believe (not especially familiar with the exact dates but it&#39;s about that time frame). Over the next thousand years, societies gradually developed into the Mississippian culture. We then had about 400 years of this civilization before it temporarily collapsed and then was colonized by Europeans. Because of the limited time frame, it doesn&#39;t look as impressive as Mesoamerica and is usually brushed to the side. Another part of the problem is that we don&#39;t know very much about their actual society beyond the very basics. They didn&#39;t have stone architecture or writing, which are both extremely important in piecing together the history of mesoamerica. <br><br>There was also Oasisamerica (the Pueblo peoples) and a lot of cultures in the area in between Mesoamerica and the Andes (what is now Central America and Colombia), known as the Isthmo-Columbian area. From Wikipedia: this featured cities with &quot;impressive platform mounds, plazas, paved roads, stone sculpture and artifacts made from jade, gold and ceramic&quot;. They also developed a very sophisticated metallurgy tradition. This area also had no writing tradition and apparently no giant polities like Aztec or Inca, so it tends to be overshadowed as well. Muisca, tairona, timoto cuica, diquis, and the so-called &quot;ciudad blanca&quot; of Honduras are the most noted here. Most of Ecuador was also more similar to this area before they were briefly conquered by the Inca Empire. They  developed the city of Quito (Kitu) and had a tradition of maritime trade with the coast of western Mesoamerica. <br><br>There were also cultures of the Caribbean that produced ceramics, stone carvings, petroglyphs. Agriculture was introduced at a similar time to North America. <br><br>I have no doubt that if the conquest didn&#39;t happen, we would have seen the development over time of interesting and sophisticated civilizations in the Caribbean, in California and perhaps on the fringe some parts of the Pacific northwest, in the Paran\u00e1 + Paraguay river area in Paraguay, Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil, in Venezuela, and perhaps also in northeastern and Central Brazil and in the Amazon (which by the way did develop the Marajoara culture, supporting 150,000 people and some amazing pottery, as well as a really sophisticated mode of life and ecological management that produced massive geoglyphs), and the real flourishing of civilization in North America, Colombia and Central America.
