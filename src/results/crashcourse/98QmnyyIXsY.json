Like the bad ending (not as bad as some might suggest). The reasons are the multiple false endings towards the actual ending and the scenary being a bit of a too big contrast to the movie&#39;s beforehand scenes. Due to that it marginalizes the charachters ending a bit, even if the intentions are well. Also there are some inclusions that feel a bit unnatural to the movie (the implications of the political stance of the time of the movie and the time in which the film was made).
