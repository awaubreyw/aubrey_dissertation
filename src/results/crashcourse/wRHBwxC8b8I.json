The Euthryphro dilemma seems better suited to the Greek pantheon then the Christian God. In Christianity, God is considered omnibenevolent, but also omnipresent and omniscient.

If this is the case, the standard for goodness (being like God) is static. So while Socrates arguments was quite logical, he wasn&#39;t even talking about the same concept as the Christian God.  <br>Also, while God is static, what things mean to a culture is not. If in one language a harmless word (say it means &#39;apple&#39;) is actually a slur in another language, its not like everyone who says apple in the first culture is sinning. It&#39;s not what you say (or how you dress) that makes it a sin, it&#39;s what it signifies. Gold chains, braids, tattoos, and the mixing of fabrics means something different in one culture then it does in another, and there is a whole field of research digging into the setting of Ancient Israel and Roman Palestine to understand what was meant by the commands. The meaning is then taken and reapplied to the modern context. If tattoos were associated with paganism at the time, what are symbols of modern idolatry that we shouldn&#39;t promote?<br>That doesn&#39;t make the divine command theory easy. Theodicies are still not enough for many people.

In this covenant were hundreds of rules for man, and hundreds of promises by God. The rules included the practical, or &quot;humans dealing with humans&quot; such as washing your hands before you eat, and not eating rotten meat. Also there was moral and social practicality, like don&#39;t kill and don&#39;t steal, take care of widows, etc.. These helped keep a peaceful society. Then there were rules that were meant to distinguish the israelites from the pagan countries, rules such as dress codes and circumcision,  symbolic things which identified the Israelites as God&#39;s people.<br><br><br>The second kind of rules were rules on how to approach or worship God. Very specific, symbolic instructions on building a tabernacle and ceremonies.<br><br><br>All of these rules were assigned a purpose, their purpose was as a mirror. Time and time again the new testament asks &quot;can the law save you?&quot; or says &quot;if you keep the whole law, but fail in one way, you are guilty of it all.&quot; The purpose of the law was to put humans in their place. Pagans and the tower of babel were examples of people trying to reach God, instead of having faith in Him to reach them. The law, which no one could follow, highlighted the need for a saviour.<br>Enter: Jesus.<br><br><br>The old Israelite commandments are not binding to anyone other than the ancient people group that entered a covenant. Jesus eliminated the need for human sacrificial atonement because Jesus came as the intercessor for us all, the intermediary between us and God. All of us are &quot;sheep lead astray&quot; and Jesus &quot;bore the transgressions (wrongdoings) of us all&quot; as an eternal atonement (appeasement)<br><br><br>As for the reason that modern Christians still follow the 10 commandments, we don&#39;t, not all of them, it just so happens that 9/10 of them were repeated in the new testament. Jesus came to fulfil the law. Jesus also kind of exploded the idea of the Sabbath, and most Christians do not hold a holy sabbath (saturday). When asked what the greatest commandment was, Jesus responded with the first commandment, more or less, by saying &quot;Love God with all your heart, soul and strength.&quot; and then he gave a second, &quot;love your neighbor as yourself&quot; We learned much of the symbolic meaning of the law in the new testament. For instance with murder, &quot;you say do not kill, but I tell you that any man who has hatred has commited murder in his heart.&quot; or with adultrey &quot;any man that looks at a woman with lust commits adultery in his heart.&quot; learning to follow the spirit of the law above the letter.<br><br><br>As for the new testament laws he gave, wearing gold chains was a sign of vanity, and vanity isn&#39;t good if you back up in the timothy passage, it starts by saying that people should be modest, and then gives examples how.. and you shouldn&#39;t gossip. <br><br><br>Anyways, my point is that there are still people, myself included, that truly do believe that the entire Bible is literal and true, moral and practical. I try very hard to live by it, and I do not dress funky or do anything religious. The entire misconception is this: People believe that for God to love them they have to do stuff to appease Him. The whole message of the Bible is that there is nothing that you can do to work your way to heaven. &quot;For it is by Grace (undeserved favor, mercy) that you are saved, through Faith, and not of works...) -Ephesians. <br><br><br>I hope that helped, if you have any questions let me know", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T01:46:44Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"wRHBwxC8b8I": {"Divine Command Theory: Crash Course Philosophy #33": {"channel_id": "UgwZqycKCUF9gjI9lY14AaABAg", "comment_by": "Eat beans", "comment_text": "In the context of the old testament, many of the rules that the Israelites were instructed to follow were to differentiate them from other tribes around them, like the Egyptians.

There is nothing inherently good or bad about going to bed at that specific time, but there is a good reason for the rule.  As circumstances change, your parents may also change the rule.  A common interpretation for why the Israelites had to follow so many seemingly arbitrary rules is because God was trying to keep them separate from the numerous pagan societies because every time so mixed with those societies  they started worshipping idols.

Under the new covenant, they no longer apply.

It seemed like you were using the examples at the beginning as if you believed that EVERY command made by God in the Bible was to be taken as a universally binding decree, which it is not. Some of them were given to particular people, others for a specific time, etc. Many commands were ceremonial, and most importantly, some decrees were bound to a specific covenant with a specific purpose. One of the major paradigms of the New Testament was to reveal just what many of those laws, ceremonies, and sacrifices were designed for and WHO they were pointing to and ultimately fulfilled by (namely Jesus). Once they were fulfilled, they were no longer needed, much like a scaffolding on a tall building.<br><br>2. Euthyphro: Here is a quote from the Holman QuickSource Guide to Christian Apologetics by Doug Powell that I believe addresses the dilemma. Consider below:<br><br>&quot;There is a third possibility that answers both objections and shows moral objectivism to be completely coherent. This explanation says that goodness is a reflection of God&#39;s character. Goodness is not external to God, nor is it something that has authority over God. Rather, that which corresponds to His character is called good. His preferences are extensions of His character, not an arbitrary decision on His part. Because His character does not change, morality is grounded in the very character of God.&quot; <br><br>Thanks, and keep delving!", "comment_date": "2017-05-09T18:52:30Z", "likes_count": 9}}}, {"wRHBwxC8b8I": {"Divine Command Theory: Crash Course Philosophy #33": {"channel_id": "UghOX1XnDtKShngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Zachary Reitsma", "comment_text": "Green, you&#39;re killing me!

As the bible says that god knows good and evil. he creates good and creates evil. Morality does not exist because god says so, exactly. God created the conditions for the clock work of the universe, and that the commands are basically a rule book on how those things operate. Take for instance not eating unclean meat, specifically pork. Pork has a parasite in it that is harmful to humans. So he commands us not to eat it because it might kill us. He created the pig, he created the parasite, and he commands us not to eat it to protect us from the parasite. And this is where his divine command comes into play. God would not change his command because he has already created the universe and set its functions and rules accordingly, he specifically states &quot;For I the lord do not change.&quot; and even jesus specifically said &quot;I do not come to change the law.&quot;. Likewise he can see the future, so many of his commands pertain to the outcome of the future.<br><br>The bible says that the wages of sin is death. His commands in the bible are designed only to prevent us from death. It does specifically tell us exactly which sins will prevent us from being saved and inheriting the kingdom of god. Those sins are far different than just the everyday sin that might cause us to die. As science and knowledge increases we begin to understand why god commands us the way he does. In ancient times they had no knowledge of the parasite in pork, today we do, so it makes sence that god tells us not to do it, and eating pork will not keep you from heaven, but will kill you(or at least shorten your lifespan). As time goes on, more and more of his commands will become clear.

Preface this with that I am a fan of this show and the other crash course videos and am not offended by any of this but do want to try and clarify some things. Also I am a Christian but I have not studied the Bible in great depth and am not qualified to call myself a theologian by any means. I will try to explain this to the best of my capability.  <br><br>One problem with a  some of what you say about the Bible is that most of the rules you quoted are from the old testament. Leviticus and really all of the laws stated in the old testament is based on the old covenant of God ie the way things were before the death of Jesus. Before Jesus died people became right with God, as in made up for their sins, by strictly holding rules and laws as well as through animal sacrifice. After Jesus died the minutia of the old law our no longer important as the covenant that they were based in no longer exist and is replaced by the new covenant of Jesus&#39;s sacrifice, we are made right with God by the mercy of Jesus and only through him can we be saved. Galatians <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=3m24s\">3:24</a> sums this up &quot;So the law as our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith&quot; that was from the New International Version Bible. Basically Jesus made the old laws obsolete by simply forgiving us. There are still rules for how Christians behave but those are laid out by Jesus and include the Holy Spirit helping Christians to no what is right and God. Many of the rules we still follow or at least try all our lives to are the same as some of those in old testament because Jesus reaffirmed them at different points. However there are others that were obsoleted such as many of the laws concerning what could be eaten. <br><br>Mark <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=7m14s\">7:14</a>-19 says &quot;Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. \u201cAll of you listen,\u201d he said, \u201cand try to understand. 15It\u2019s not what goes into your body that defiles you; you are defiled by what comes from your heart.\u201d 7Then Jesus went into a house to get away from the crowd, and his disciples asked him what he meant by the parable he had just used. 18\u201cDon\u2019t you understand either?\u201d he asked. \u201cCan\u2019t you see that the food you put into your body cannot defile you? 19Food doesn\u2019t go into your heart, but only passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer.\u201d End Bible quote.<br><br>Most of what Jesus says about morality when questioned what is the greatest of the law said. &quot;The most important one,\u201d answered Jesus, \u201cis this: \u2018Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. \u201931The second is this: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no commandment greater than these.<br><br><br> Now I&#39;m not a priest or something I&#39;m an engineer. I&#39;ve traveled around alot seen different cultures and apprcieate sicence, logic, and reasoning. So I&#39;m saying this as a Christian who appreciates science and philosophy and I&#39;m by no mean anti-logical reasoning. I enjoy your shows these crash course videos are engaging and thought invoking. However, some of the examples you have were a little misleading. I don&#39;t think this is purposeful as I&#39;ve been a Christian my entire life and these self-same question of what parts of the old law are still in effect is a hard one to answer. As for morality it is my belief that morality is rooted in God and that he does decide what is moral. The issue with this being that morality is arbitrary to God&#39;s decision is nullified for me personally by the belief that God himself is not an arbitrary being but a just and righteous one which created everything and has a greater understanding of things then myself.

Want to be moral with me, ask me about it. Don&#39;t just stand there. I will acquire sufficient protection from pain but allowance of enough pain to know whence cometh joy. The few things all humans hate will be universally punished anyhow. That is the nature of being a human and not a rock. A rock has no morals.

I feel like you have some biases against religious belief, which I wouldn&#39;t care about if it didn&#39;t show through your presentation of the material. For example, you say God commands people to kill &quot;whenever he feels like it.&quot; I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s true or not, but it&#39;s a little needlessly derisive. Rather, you could say he commands people to kill when he deems it necessary. This was especially glaring in your use of Isaac&#39;s binding, which would be an excellent intentionalist debate if you had given any mind to his retraction of the command.<br>What I mean to say is,  you presented the argument in terms of a big guy with a beard giving arbitrary commands, which if not indefensible is Christian-focused (i.e., what about religions like Hinduism, where God is in every detail of the universe?). The thought bubble segment was confusing, because the theistic argument is simply that God <b>wouldn&#39;t</b> do such a thing. And anyway, the whole Christian doctrine is based around the grace outlined in the New Testament. Jesus&#39;s &quot;do unto others&quot; is hardly different from Kant&#39;s formulation of universality, and in fact you will find Kant supposed the morality of religion could be rediscovered through pure reason.

Is this the best arguemt against the divine command? Those philosophers knew nothing about the bible and so they made a  bad argument. Here is the answer to the dilemma. In this video you forgot to add a bit more about the events in the bible. God did not only tell the Jews to kill some nations he also ordered Moses to kill a person for working on the Sabbath. BTW Isaac was not actually killed. It is obvious that when God said do not kill it does not mean exactly what we think because a lot of people killed in the bible but they were favoured by God like David. The definition of kill in the context of the 10 commands means to kill because of revenge if you trace the word from the Hebrew Bible.  I bet some people are still skeptical about this right now. But the bible says the wages of sin is death. everyone has sinned so everyone is entitled to death. If you read about the nation&#39;s that God told the Jews to kill you will find that they were very sinful. In the case of Moses God told Moses to kill a person because he has sinned a sin that is punishable  by death. Therefore killing someone in battle or because they sinned is  not a sin if and only if God gave you the permission and it does not contradict the bible because you would not be killing because of revenge or your own reasons or you would be giving someone the wages he deserves with the permission of God. You are not allowed to give everyone so someone his wages unless God let&#39;s you. Now to finish this. Everything that I have just said would be valid only in the old testament. In the new testament Jesus paid the wages for us and therefore we can live again with him after we die. So in the new testament you are not allowed to kill at all and I don&#39;t recall God telling anyone to kill anyone else I  the New Testament. We are under the new Testament so we cannot kill anyone and God will not show up to anyone and change his word like they showed in this video. He never changed. Some might say that he changed in the New Testament compared to the Old Testament. But he did not. The only difference is that Jesus came and died for our sins. God seems different after that but without Jesus it would be the same as in the Old Testament.

However, there is actually a little more to the discussion, because there are two very different versions of the DCT. The first, also known as Theological Voluntarism, revolves around the WILL of God. An action is right or wrong because God commands or forbids it; in other words, moral value is determined by the brute force of God&#39;s willing it so. It&#39;s like the old parental retort about why the child should clean his room or wear matching socks, &quot;Because I said so, that&#39;s why&quot;. And yes, this makes morality 100% arbitrary, and easily demolished by the Euthyphro Dilemma. It is also logically self-defeating  and unhelpful in way of a &quot;decision procedure&quot;. This understanding is the basis on which many criticize religion as being blind adherence to arbitrary rules. <br>But, there is another option. <br>The second version of the DCT places moral value not in God&#39;s brute &quot;say so&quot;, or in a standard outside himself, but in his very NATURE. Actions are right or wrong only if they conform to God&#39;s character. Furthermore, the &quot;rules&quot; or commandments are understood to describe God&#39;s character, as applied to particular circumstances. Because divine commands are the practical application of divine character, they are not arbitrary. And yet, the nature they describe is inherent to God himself, so they do not appeal to an outside standard which He is &quot;recommending&quot;. The rules provide insight into the overarching Nature behind them; to more general principles which are helpful to interpret specifics that appear contradictory, or vague. For example, this is why many within the christian faith community do not adhere to all of the regulations in the Pentateuch. They see the Laws as falling into three categories: Moral (such as the 10 Commandments), Ceremonial (such as circumcision, animal sacrifice, ritual bathing, etc), and Civil (such as building a rail around one&#39;s roof -- flat roofs were used for extra living space, and could be a safety hazard; or not eating shrimp -- they were often not cooked properly in Ancient Cultures, and carried dangerous bacteria). The Moral laws tell us about God&#39;s nature, and so are still applicable; the ones detailing building codes and FDA style health warnings do not, and are now culturally irrelevant. The idea is understanding and obeying the &quot;spirit&quot; of the law, not just the &quot;letter&quot;. <br>The difference here is subtle, but very important. Version 1 is crushed by the Euthyphro Dilemma, while Version 2 is not. Version 1 can seem to produce conflicting moral duties, and is unhelpful regarding actions not specifically mentioned. Version 2 works off the idea that the prescribed rules describe God&#39;s nature, and so offer a procedure for &quot;grey&quot; areas and conflicts. <br><br>@crashcourse Thank you for your great work on these materials!

They just think they know everything already, and are closed off to being corrected. Will you be?)<br><br>God never actually commanded Abraham to &quot;kill&quot; Isaac.

He &quot;offered&quot; Isaac. And in the Book of Hebrews (in the NT) we learn that Abraham believed God&#39;s promises that through Isaac his seed would be multiplied like the sand of the seashore and the stars in heaven. We further learn that Abraham believed that Isaac would be resurrected if he were to die by Abraham&#39;s hands.<br><br>Why did Abraham believe in a resurrection? Perhaps his time with Melchizedek, King of Salem and Priest of God, who gave bread and wine to Abraham (ring a bell? connect that with Jesus Christ) had a thing or two to do with that.<br>The NT teaches us that Jesus is Priest forever, &quot;after the order of Melchizidek.&quot; (Hebrews <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=7m17s\">7:17</a>)<br><br>During Abraham&#39;s day, all the gods would require human sacrifice.

For Abraham to be told by God what he was was to put Abraham to the ultimate test. &quot;Was YHWY really different from the other gods?&quot; he must have though.<br>Also, Isaac wasn&#39;t Abraham&#39;s only son. God uses this language symbolically for Jesus Christ&#39;s sacrifice. See John <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>.

Evil is the absense of good which is to say that evil is non-existence or &quot;anything&quot; transitioning into non-existenence (ie, decaying, diminishing, dying).  <br><br>Thirdly, a command from God not only grants the permission/authorization to perform the command but also the ABILITY to perform it.  This is because God is in perfect harmony with Himself and thus He would not (1) will/intend for something to be and then (2) permit/authorize for that something to be but then (3) NOT enable/empower that something to be since this would be a contradiction on God&#39;s part.  So when God commands us to do something he authorizes and empowers us to fulfill that command.  <br><br>Fourthly a &quot;right action&quot; is simply a &quot;good action&quot; which is an action that permits harmonious existence with God and thus continued existence period.  So when &quot;God commands&quot; He permits and enables &quot;right action&quot; which results in continued, harmonious existence with God which, by definition, is &quot;good&quot;.  <br><br>So again, the answer to Euthyphro&#39;s first question is yes because &quot;God&#39;s commands&quot; permits and enables &quot;right actions&quot; which results in harmonious existence with God which by definition is &quot;good&quot;.<br><br>The answer to Euthyphro&#39;s second question is yes because &quot;right actions&quot; result in &quot;good&quot; in that they permit harmonious existence with God and harmonious existence with God require &quot;God&#39;s commandments&quot;.", "comment_date": "2016-11-05T00:23:20Z", "likes_count": 20}}}, {"wRHBwxC8b8I": {"Divine Command Theory: Crash Course Philosophy #33": {"channel_id": "Ugihme3aNqa3W3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Smocaine", "comment_text": "The fact still stands that atheists can&#39;t claim to have a system of morality concerning basic things like murder, sexual assault, or things like that without pertaining to the Christian or Judaistic rulebook.

The first thing that I need to clarify is that I hold that first horn, in a sense.  I believe that what is good originates in God&#39;s nature which is unchanging, but is revealed through His words, actions and creation. This does mean that there are things that God cannot do, for instance the bible says that God cannot lie (Titus 1:2).  In this belief, God&#39;s nature is unchanging and He is the perfect source of moral revelation, though that includes what He has revealed in creation through what He has made, not just revelation from the Bible alone.  This does mean that if God came down with new commands that those new commands would be binding, but it also means that those new commands would not contradict the spirit of what He said previously.  In fact, this is exactly what we believe happened with the New Testament.  God had one covenant (on contract if you will) with his followers in the Old Testament.  A part of that contract included a note that it would one day change.  The work of Jesus Christ constituted God&#39;s work in bringing that promised new contract (for reasons outlined most clearly in the letter to the Hebrews).  This brought about a change in the commands that needed to be followed, not because God changed, but because the nature of our relationship with God changed.  <br>This leads to the challenge that you presented on how we know which commands have changed and which remain unchanged.  First the new testament says that the ceremonial laws are gone, because they were only there to symbolize and help God&#39;s followers look forward to (or to meditate on) things that became realities in the new covenant. That is a mouth full and it is explained Paul&#39;s in the letter to the Hebrews (a book of the Bible that is very much about the change of covenants).  <br>Second, the old covenant (or contract) with God&#39;s followers had them acting as a theocratic nation, and it came complete with a legal system. The new contract calls for God&#39;s followers to obey God while living in other nations and generally following their laws (except for when those laws contradict the contract that we have with God and the things that He commands that we do). This means that all the national law stuff is out.  <br>In addition to those two points, it should also be noted that some of the laws are simply specific applications of unchanging principals. For example, the law that forbids wearing clothes made from wool and linen is a specific example of the command not to participate in other religions.  In the time when that command was given, fertility religions were common and people believed that spring came because the gods had sex.  They wanted the gods to have sex early and often and attempted to convince them to do so in interesting ways, mostly by mixing things that weren&#39;t supposed to mix.  For example they would plant alternating vegetables, make their clothes out of alternating wool and linen and several other things that lead to seemingly weird commands in Leviticus and Deuteronomy.  These were common practices.  Like reading a horoscope, they were so common that people were not likely to think anything about them, and like reading a horoscope they violated the command against participating in other religions so these specific examples were given to make it clear that even these common things were not allowed.  Many people in the old testament still worshiped Baal and ashtoreth, thus participating in one of these very fertility religions.  <br>The tattoos for the dead is another reference to a religious practice, not a rule against modern decorative tattoos (whatever you may think of the modern practice).  Modesty looks different in different cultures.  Gossip is just generally bad.  Knowing that some commands only make sense in their historical context means that when you read the Bible you must consider not only which covenant you are reading about, but also the context in which the statement was made.  Very often the Bible will present an unchanging principal and then give specific cultural application.  Understanding this means reading books of the Bible as a whole, not in individual pieces. (BTW we added the chapter and verse headings, and we divided some books into two books when they originally were one.)  It also means looking for consistent principals and thinking deeply about God&#39;s nature, His commands and our relationship and contract with Him.  <br>Fortunately, in america today it is easy to get solid Bible commentaries that explain things related to historical context which does make it easier to understand some of the verses that just are confusing without that context.  Also it is helpful to look for reason statements.  To give an example of this, many racist point out that in the old testament there are verses prohibiting Jews from marrying gentiles. They then say that God opposes interracial marriage.  However, with even the slightest attention to context you will notice that 1. the reason given is that God does not want his followers marring into other religions 2. there are explicate instructions for marrying people from other ethnic backgrounds as long as they convert first, and 3. that God backed Moses&#39; marriage to a Ethiopian (Cushite) woman (a black woman actually) when this caused outrage from Aaron and Miriam.  It also includes other stories of interracial marriage that it approves of where the couple followed God alone (The very short book of Ruth is one such example).  The New Testament maintains this command that Christians not marry people who are not Christians.  The idea that if you are a follower of God that you must not marry someone who does not share your faith is the principle that remains the same because, as the Bible points out, the God of the Bible is a jealous God.  It is because God is a jealous God that this is wrong, and that is also the Biblical reason that in marriage (which the Bible says that God created) adultery is wrong.  God&#39;s creation was designed to reflect His nature and perverting what God made is sin.", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T08:45:08Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"wRHBwxC8b8I": {"Divine Command Theory: Crash Course Philosophy #33": {"channel_id": "UgiasyWjKde8wngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Steven dv", "comment_text": "is it: thou shalt not do --- thou <b>shall</b> do ??!!<br><br>I don&#39;t think so.

Even then, one cannot assured of being right in morality received directly via Holy Spirit because, as I said, everyone is human and therefore imperfect.  Add to that the irony that pride is sinful and humility virtuous, and it becomes quite tricky to humble oneself enough to be faithful to Holy Spirit without lapsing into the self-doubt that leads one to uncritically submit to external authority over authority received directly via Holy Spirit.", "comment_date": "2016-11-03T16:19:27Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"wRHBwxC8b8I": {"Divine Command Theory: Crash Course Philosophy #33": {"channel_id": "Ughu0iMBpzIscHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Anders \u00d6hlund", "comment_text": "God didn&#39;t only command Abraham to kill his son.

This is problematic because it assumes that A) God would want to change his mind, B) God is subject to time and is changing (in the way we understand change) at all, and C) that God changing his commands wouldn&#39;t have far reaching changes on reality, including what we perceive as good.<br>-The video goes to great lengths to separate God and goodness. As a proponent of divine command theory, I reject this idea. Goodness is a subset of God. If God changes, then goodness changes. If we see something in God&#39;s commandments that strikes us as not good, then the problem is not with God but with our interpretation of the commandments and/or our understanding of goodness.<br>-The video suggests that a cursory glance at scripture is all it takes to understand God&#39;s commands. I think this is a huge mistake. Plenty of my interlocutors in the comments have suggested that context is important, and I think this where the video misses the point - and by that I don&#39;t mean that you should read the whole chapter or the whole book or the entire bible to properly understand context. You have to include much more than that. You have to consider the room you&#39;re reading it in, the time of day, the age you are when you read it, the mood you are in when you read it, and the motivation you had for reading it in the first place. Any representation of divine command theory that suggests that scripture is not a living document is a straw man.<br><br>Anyone with a desire to anchor their moral system to Divine Will takes on a much greater responsibility than simply memorizing a few verses of scripture.

Thus, some humans look to a suprahuman source for their moral compass. Whether this supposed source is actually suprahuman is inconclusive, but real to the believer.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=1m14s\">1:14</a> Quite the contrary. The Bible relates the lived experiences of those who obeyed and those who disobeyed and the outcome of each. Note that many examples recorded are of people who found it difficult to listen to the divine commands or questioned the ratonale behind them. Careful consideration of the rules may later reveal the intelligence behind the law. To imply that people who adhere to the laws set in religious texts are either ignorant or passive-thinkers is not necessarily true.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=1m50s\">1:50</a> Christians believe in Christ. Although Christ came not to &quot;abolish the law but to fulfill it, (Matt <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=5m17s\">5:17</a>)&quot; certain aspects of the Mosaic law are no longer in effect, because the Law of the Jews was so radically different from non-Jewish Christians. This is not an example of God changing his mind about morality. The principles set out in the Mosaic law and the personality of God (the law-giver) revealed to us by his law-making, are constant.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=3m41s\">3:41</a> This is a misleading dichotomy. Divine Command Theorists may believe that right actions are right because God commands them, and that God will always command actions that are right. Forcing someone do decide between the two may be unfair. There may be no dilemma.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=4m33s\">4:33</a> Some people may find it disturbing to think that God supported murder (Abraham&#39;s son was never killed) and war, but religious people understand that there was a reason behind such sanctions.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=4m41s\">4:41</a> To suggest that God is fickle and erratic in his morality may be disturbing and uneducated to some people. The reason why we put trust into commands in the Bible from God is because we understand him to be an unchanging, steadfast law-giver whose justice supercedes time. Thus, if someone who claimed to be God came to us and changed all the rules, the prudent religious observer would first question the person&#39;s claim of being God. This is how people distinguish canon from apocrypha.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRHBwxC8b8I&amp;t=6m50s\">6:50</a> This isn&#39;t a standard that God inevitably is slave to. If you believe God created things and knows a lot about his creation, then it shouldn&#39;t be too far of a stretch to assume he knows what works and what doesnt work. If you say, but God can make anything work, then your a hopeless idiot.<br><br>In sum, your whole video&#39;s point is valid if you put God at a level on par with imperfect humans.

Therefore we should not kill anyone without reason because that would be taking away their fundamental right to view the universe and seek new experiences. Nature is generally immoral, but there can be exceptions. Animals helping other animals, we have evolved a sense of morality from these creatures. We have reached a higher plane, so to speak. But since some creatures do not have the mental capacity do perceive what is around I do not consider them &quot;alive.&quot; They are simply organic machines. Once a creature can view the universe and contemplate its beauty I therefore consider it &quot;wholly alive.&quot; I cannot describe beauty but this leads me to believe that their must be some kind of architect.

He then put two main laws that Christians (people who believe Jesus Cjrist is Sovereign, i.e God) follow. They are: Love God, and Love each other. Christians act out of love for other people and love for God. The point of the Old Testament laws was to keep the Ancient Jews apart from other people, distinguished as God&#39;s people. Nowadays, after Christ, all people are called to be God&#39;s people. Nobody is forced into keeping the laws set by Christ, they choose to, out of love for other people, and love for the God who redeems.

God asked Abraham to sacrifice his only son, and Abraham (to whom God promised the fathering of nations) believed that God was a good God, and would raise his promised son from the dead.

Maybe the second horn isn&#39;t so bad, God commands X because X is good. This sounds bad because it means something outside of God determines the rightness or goodness of X, but perhaps that isn&#39;t such a bad thing. The two objections in the video I reply to below:<br><br>Objection (1) it means God is not omnipotent, as there are values and moral rules that God doesn&#39;t create and can&#39;t change.<br>Reply:  Usually, God&#39;s omnipotence is considered to mean that God can do anything that is metaphysically possible, like creating this universe, determining some physical constants, causing a thunderstorm to kill someone, curing an illness etc. A being that can control the entirely of the physical world is omnipotent, at least on a reasonable definition. The fact that SOME things can&#39;t be done, not even by God, is a tangential point. Consider some examples of things that even a die-hard theist may admit God can&#39;t do: <br>-- that God can&#39;t draw a 4-sided triangle, or prove that 3+4 = 10 [cuz logic], <br>-- nor can God do evil [against his own nature], <br>-- nor can God have-not-have made me [he could destroy me, or perhaps rewrite me out of history -- but still at least God would remember having made me before, so I did exist in his eternal timeline]<br>-- nor can God create a rock too heavy for him to lift [because it would be a rock so heavy that an infinitely strong being can&#39;t lift it, which is a self-contradictory, nonsensical concept]<br>These are debatable but MOST people (except e.g. Rene Descartes) would agree with my first example, that God can&#39;t break the laws of logic or maths. So at least the idea of God not being able to do something is not that big a deal. <br>Coming to moral laws, maybe we could say that even though God can&#39;t create or change moral laws, that&#39;s not so bad after all: perhaps the moral laws are really a kind of logic, deducible like maths [this is Kant&#39;s belief about morality for example].<br>And if morality is just a corollary of logic, then the fact that God can&#39;t change it is no more an problem than the fact that God can&#39;t draw a 4-sided triangle,.<br><br>Objection (2) it means we don&#39;t need God, he is a pointless middleman and we could just go straight to morality (e.g. by working it out ourselves). <br>Reply: That doesn&#39;t follow. God is smarter, wiser and has more experience than us (e.g. by observing the history of this and other possible universes). As such, God may just be in a far better position to know about morality than we are. For example, people can deduce maths for themselves, but that DOESN&#39;T mean that maths teachers are just pointless middlemen for learning about maths. <br><br><br>For me, the main objection to Divine Command theory - hinted at in the flash philosophy - is that it is impossible for humans to know that God DOES command X in the first place. I can read the Bible, or Quran, or listen to the Pope or some random vicar. Or I can have a vision under drugs, tiredness or desperation. Or I can pray and feel God&#39;s word. These are all potentially valid ways to learn God&#39;s word: BUT, how do I chose between them, especially when these sources of information may give conflicting instructions? <br><br>Even if I had the God-guy in the video visit me tonight, with lightning and a booming, glorious voice, telling me to do X, how do I know I&#39;m not just hallucinating? God MIGHT have told Abraham to kill his only son, but then again perhaps Abraham should have thought &quot;maybe I&#39;m just hallucinating&quot;.

Those rules are pretty much everything except killing a non countryman is cool, don&#39;t treat your possesions from the same country badly at all.
