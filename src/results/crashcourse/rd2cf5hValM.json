But that way I learned it was that Helper T cells have to be activated first by binding to an APC (macrophage) that has an antigen bound to an MHCII receptor. Once the Helper T cell is activate, the Helper cell itself is the one that presents the antigen to a matching B cell. Once the Helper T cell with the specific antigen finds the right B cell, then it secrets ILs to activate the B cell to make plasma and memory cells. It seems logical to think that naive B cells with the correct B cell receptors can bind antigens themselves, but do they or can only memory B cells bind directly to the antigen?<br><br>Also, for how our immune cells to recognize self from nonself, I&#39;ve learned that it is because each B/T cell before it gets fully release is basically screened and passed through auto-antigen presenting cells that present all possible self antigens, and any immune cell that are produced that can bind to self antigens are stimulated to undergo apoptosis. So from my understanding, the reason our immune system doesn&#39;t attack our own cells is that any immune cell that can potentially target our own cells are destroyed before it can be released. Can someone confirm this?<br><br>Also wished these episodes talked about interferons.

I went back to school this year for the first time since 2012. I started the year with some introductory math and biology courses before taking Microbiology and Anatomy &amp; Physiology this Fall. For me, these two classes were quite demanding, but this entire series of videos truly helped and guided me through A&amp;P. Hank&#39;s delivery, intelligence, and overall passion for what he&#39;s presenting really help the information stick with you long after you&#39;ve watched these videos. It&#39;s seriously amazing; the LUXURY of having forty-seven 10min A&amp;P presentations in your pocket (i.e. smartphone) wherever you go, 24/7, is incredible. Before going back to school this year, I was always one of those &quot;I&#39;ll just learn what I need to for the test&quot; students. And honestly, when I first started watching Crash Course, I didn&#39;t think that would change. But after doing very well this year (I never was a good student prior) I&#39;ve come to love watching these videos so much that even though school is now done for me this year I&#39;m STILL waking up every morning and going back through some of these videos out of habit and out of simply looking forward to learning. I actually care about learning now-<del>it&#39;s rewarding and enjoyable. Doing well on tests turned into a by-product of my desire to spend time learning. I deeply appreciate the content that Crash Course offers to everyone. Hank, your voice was in my head for every A&amp;P test this semester. And it worked :</del>)<br><br>This comment goes for the entire team at Crash Course, of course. The graphics are stellar, the content is excellent, the whole channel is tremendous.
