My suspicioun is that they&#39;re not supported enough by the local policies and just see that it would not be a good move financially, even if they&#39;d like too.

In Egypt of 1960&#39;s the population was 30M . The state launched propaganda campaigns to use birth control, but the clergy stood firmly against! They argued that birth control meant weak faith and a crusade against Islamic nations. And why would Europeans not resort to such methods?! Also, farmers needed help from their children on the field and considered education a loss of time and money. Such rhetoric brought about the dire situation we have in Egypt now with a population around 100M ! The president has relinquished all responsibility to improve the economic situation, blaming it all on the people who &#39;keep breeding&#39;. Of course he affords to say so in the (free democracy &amp; elections) that we so much enjoy in Egypt", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T20:39:25Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Abell Seyfu", "comment_text": "Narrative of Self is the result of a feedback loop between \u201cSeparate Self\u201d &amp; Cosmos.\ud83c\udf88", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T20:33:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sizano Green", "comment_text": "Also boosting (ideally skilled) immigrants as a stage 4 country, without it germany would look like japan in that regard by now.", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T20:17:39Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Vitamin Sage", "comment_text": "The economic impact of having versus not having children is something to consider.
