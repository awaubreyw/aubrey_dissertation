However, as far as I am aware, you&#39;re in error of when the film industry moved to California. The western film industry was not established in 1902 -- Hollywood wasn&#39;t even incorporated until a year later. For shooting in warmer climates, the film industry first tried Jacksonville, Florida in 1908. For the next decade, the film industry centered around the northeast and Florida. I know that my home city, Ithaca New York, was a big silent film center as well. In the early 1910s, studios did begin to move to California and create the Hollywood we know today, becoming the dominant force by 1918. But as far as I am aware, the claim that the film industry was already in the west in 1902 is entirely incorrect.<br><br>EDIT: I believe the issue is the appeal mentioned probably refers to the 1915 case against the Motion Picture Patent Company, a corporate trust set up to manage the film patents and was found violating the antitrust acts, thus freeing the film industry -- but by this point, it was already a big force in the west, and still growing. This lines up a lot better with my previously mentioned dates, and follows the narrative set forth in this video. But I am still not sure where the date 1902 came from.", "comment_date": "2018-11-27T08:15:18Z", "likes_count": 15}}}, {"go3AwYghhdI": {"Cinema, Radio, and Television: Crash Course History of Science #29": {"channel_id": "Ugw9U4ZDFqZmKrf9Kxp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Cheglik 13", "comment_text": "What about Popov?
