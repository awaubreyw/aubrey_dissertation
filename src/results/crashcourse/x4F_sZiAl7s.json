Some key points:<br><br>- Atari Pacman was well received and sold well despite being a terrible port. (A prototype in fact.) The problem was that Atari management manufactured more carts than consoles thinking the game would cause a massive surge in console sales!<br><br>- ET was not a bad game, despite its rushed development. It was actually an early puzzle adventure game. It was definitely ahead of its time, though, and did not play well to the action-craving children of the time.  If you take the time to learn the game (i.e. read the manual) you&#39;ll find that most of the complaints vaporize.<br><br>- ET did not cause the downfall of the industry, though a similar overproduction problem to Pacman did not help Atari&#39;s situation. <br><br>- By 1983 the market was oversaturated with product and competitors. This would have caused a normal recession (and subsequent correction) in the market, except for one thing...<br><br>- Jack Tramiel had a price war with Texas Instruments at exactly the wrong time. The Commodore 64 with its high-margin software came crashing through the price ceiling that separated computers from game consoles. Retailers flushed their stock of console games at ridiculously low prices and replaced it all with computer systems and software.<br><br>- Nintendo did relatively few things to keep quality high. They actually focused on maintaining a limited supply of exclusive product to ensure prices remained high. This also strangled competitors and prevented another industry crash.<br><br>- Nintendo&#39;s genius was actually marketing the NES as a toy rather than a game console. This put the system on different shelves than the Atari had been and convinced retailers to take on a &quot;video game console&quot;. This pretense was dropped once the NES was a runaway success.<br><br>That&#39;s just a few points. Guys like Marty Goldberg and Curt Vendel can give you a far more detailed scoop.
