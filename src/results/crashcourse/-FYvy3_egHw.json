That comes from a series of &quot;just so&quot; stories made popular in the early to mid-twentieth century. In actuality, the whole thing is a lot more complicated. At the risk of this being too late for anyone to notice, I&#39;ll go ahead and explain what I mean below:<br><br>To be clear, this does NOT mean that Galileo wasn&#39;t persecuted by the Church, but in pre-Napoleonic Europe the Church was a mix of both religious and political force. In other words, sometimes activities done by the church were solely driven by politics and power and less so than personal belief (even less so, religiously held belief). This is, in part, a reason that Enlightenment philosophies, particularly those of Locke (and thus the influence upon the USA) emphasized a separation of church and state (that&#39;s not the only reason, but it is part of the reason).<br><br>In fact, the work of Galileo had considerable support from many different groups within the Church at the time. The problem is that Galileo&#39;s ideas disproved Aristotle&#39;s principles. Aristotle&#39;s most famous and well liked (in Europe at the time) disciple was none other than the &quot;dumb Ox&quot; Thomas Aquinas. Thomas Aquinas was a Dominican, and though Aquinas was no longer alive at the time of Galileo, the Dominicans were a formidable religious and (more important for our purposes) political force within the church (and thus within Roman Catholic territories). There is no way they would stand by and let their beloved St Aquinas be tarnished, even if only by association, by some non-Dominican who disproved Aristotle. To be clear, others who were not Dominican did, at the time of Galileo, argue that a geo-centric model of the universe was not a tenant of any faith. Since as early as Augustine (mid-late 300s), there were strong arguments that, in his words, &quot;only a fool would take Genesis literally.&quot; In fact the primary argument against Galileo from the Dominicans (other than their opposition to rejecting Aristotle) was to point to Joshua where he commanded the sun to be still. They argued that this was a Scriptural basis for saying that it was the sun and not the earth (for the record, the debate partner with this particular Dominican who initially used this argument literally laughed at such an absurd interpretation of the language). Eventually the Dominicans, over the objections of a respectable number of non-Dominican priests, canons, bishops, etc, convinced the Pope. <br><br>The rest, as they say, is history. Don&#39;t believe, necessarily, the writings of one Andrew Dickson White (first President of Cornell), who in the late 19th century pushed hard for a narrative that saw Christianity as the great enemy of intellectual progress. That&#39;s where a lot of these theories began. It&#39;s not true (or at best, much more complicated), and many of the best pushes forward in physics and biology were funded, directly or indirectly, by the Church.
