Orwell described a man with `negriod lips`. which they changed in the American version because at least they had the presence of mind to recognize the history of slavery and the continuance (i would assume) of systemic racism and discrimination in America. They didn&#39;t care about other countries though. they are too impoverished or colonized to have opinions anyways, right?<br><br> we also need to talk about how old white men are conveniently the father of western literature and let&#39;s be realistic father of literature because white supremacy doesn&#39;t sleep...even in 2022.", "comment_date": "2022-08-19T07:41:29Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"H9ipRaLa4Jw": {"1984 by George Orwell, Part 1: Crash Course Literature 401": {"channel_id": "UgxbHmHRDgog5OcD_4h4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Adam Weishaupt", "comment_text": "Could someone please explain the point made at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9ipRaLa4Jw&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a> to me?

Read the newspaper, and it agrees with what God said in his holy word.  History is &quot;His Story&quot; from Genesis to Revelation.  Fear is often times said to be:  False Evidence Appearing Real.  For God hath not given us a spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.  2 Timothy 1:7 (KJB).  Only those that are born again bible believing Christians have HOPE for where their soul will spend eternity.  Most false religions like Catholicism, Mormonism, Jehovah Witnesses, 7th Day Adventist, Freemasonry, Hinduism, Muslims, etc., ... sends people to hell because it falsely teaches that YOU have to DO certain things to earn your way into heaven.  How would you ever know if you&#39;ve done enough good deeds to EARN your way into heaven?  True biblical Christianity is all about what Christ did (DONE) upon the cross of Calvary to atone (pay) for the sin of the world.  NO sin can stand in the presence of a holy and just God.  For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.  Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9ipRaLa4Jw&amp;t=3m23s\">3:23</a>.  BELIEVE on the LORD Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved;....  Acts <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9ipRaLa4Jw&amp;t=16m31s\">16:31</a>.  The only sin that sends a person to hell is UNBELIEF in what Christ has done for sinful mankind.  Ephesians 2:8-9, John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9ipRaLa4Jw&amp;t=1m12s\">1:12</a>, John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9ipRaLa4Jw&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>-18, 36, John 14:6.   People act on what they believe.  Many believe Satan&#39;s lies.  Jesus is the way, the truth and the life; no man cometh unto the Father (GOD) but by me (Jesus).  John 14:6.  Jesus is not &quot;a&quot; way to God.  He is &quot;the&quot; only way to God.  Only JESUS was without sin.  He alone is the only one that has ever lived that was without sin.  God accepted his sacrifice upon the cross of Calvary as a pure and sinless &quot;Lamb of God&quot; that taketh away the sin of the world.  JESUS paid my sin debt that I owed.  He paid a debt he did not owe because he was without sin.  God accepted his sacrificial blood that was shed for mankind to make a way for sinful mankind to be reconciled to a holy and just God.  Adam sinned against God.  We have all inherited a sin nature.  We deserve God&#39;s justice and wrath.  Hell is a very real place.  I&#39;m thankful I was saved from going to hell the moment I BELIEVED that Jesus died in my place to pay for my sin debt.  I&#39;m guilty of breaking all of the 10 Commandments.  NO sin can be in the presence of a holy and just God.  Thankfully, Jesus was willing to lay down his life and pay my sin debt.  I am saved from spending eternity in the Lake of Fire because I understood my need to be saved from going to hell.  People can have HOPE in this world that is oppressed by Satan and his demons.  Jesus died, was buried, and rose again the 3rd day to have victory over the grave.  JESUS is LORD.

For example in the movie &#39;Gods Must Be Crazy&#39; they don&#39;t have word for glass bottle but their usage and the object&#39;s impact on the life of bushmen made them to think the bottle as an &quot;evil thing&quot; and that was totally useful for them. <br>However in today there are too many words in languages can mean the same thing which breaks the bond between realty and language. In most dictionaries meaning of a word is simply provisioned with another word which has appearently the same meaning. Why do you think this is a problem?

This improper usage leads some unskilled language users to make demological philosophy. <br>Idiocratic questions have been asked because of this broken string of words and language. So in the end Noone really thinks on the meanings or expressing what they really think, they simply love to use some unorthodox words, so this would make them feel unique.

It is scary up-to-date for instance in a country like Brazil, where the &quot;Socialists&quot; have a plan to found a great Cuba. They call themselves Foro de S\u00e3o Paulo. Is interesting to see how many similarities with the book and the way the &quot;socialists&quot; act in Brazil. <br><br>Although they do not exclude words from the vocabulary their idol, the ex president Lula is known to be illiterate and can hardly speak Portuguese. Since he has been elected he said may times that he does not like to read, and a big portion of the Brazilian society sees this as a good example not to read as well. <br><br>The public schools and universities have been turned into an official HQ for the labor party where Teachers and Students who do not agree with &quot;socialism&quot; have really hard time going on with their activities. The only big difference between 1984 and the &quot;socialist&quot; Brazil is that instead having every single citizen thinking alike the &quot;socialist&quot; government broke the society in many little groups and put them to fight each other, which is also a clever way to weaken the opposition. <br><br>What we have in Brazil now is civil war between blacks, (or people who believe tho be black), poor, whites, fat, gays, heteros, religious, non religious, feminists and so on. All hate each other and all fight for a little slice of the cake, while the government keeps everything for him self. The &quot;socialists&quot; in Brazil seduced the population with some kind of race or financial based support.

To have been given this way of think due to our language is affecting us a big deal and very much how we see the world. The chances of us finding out things in the same way is very restricted by our language and the chances of us finding out certain things is lowered due to our language. He also points out why we say &quot;my arm&quot; instead of &quot;me arm&quot; it is saying that my body is owned by me in the same way that I have a fork I have my hand and therefore my hand is a tool.

There&#39;s also people who have aphasia and have lost the ability to communicate or understand language, but who still are able to have thoughts, or human babies who understand the concept of math and number or develop facial associations before they are able to form linguistic based thoughts. The point of all this is, is that though oppressive governments can restrict language and suppress freedoms by limiting communication capacity through language, language and thought might not be as deterministic as Sapir and Whor thought.

It was a delightful decision to make but it raises the question - why did I avoid them in the first place? <br><br>Bear with me for a moment, it&#39;s after all 2 in the morning and my thoughts are as clear as a cloudy sky. <br><br>I believe to enjoy art, regardless of its type, origin, presentation, etc. , it doesn&#39;t take much if any effort. It&#39;s there, it exists, I can blankly stare at it and receive pleasure. It doesn&#39;t have to be an involved activity. This can be extrapolated to all areas of life. We can always stay at the sidelines but will get something in return, whether it will be a slight ray of hope or a tear rolling down our eye. It doesn&#39;t have to be an involved activity. It doesn&#39;t.<br><br>So, if we don&#39;t seemingly obtain anything extra when we bring ourselves to our life, why ever waste any time on anything, the thinking goes, at least it did for me. What is the point of ever going through the efforts?<br><br>I&#39;m on the verge of adulthood, just 22 days until my legal transformation into a responsible part of society, which is why (probably, talking objectively about your current thoughts is bound to failure) I feel lost at times. I don&#39;t know what lies ahead and whether I will like it or not. You can say it&#39;s the same for everyone but interrupting people is considered rude so keep your comments for the end. As I was saying, the future scares me, and in the lack-of-control way. I might be choosing the wrong occupation. I might be cutting relationships I will later regret. I might be closing myself into a box labeled &quot;Your entirety&quot; and leaving at that. And if the previous, although possibly unrelated paragraphs are to be trusted, my interests cannot give me the tool to escape this situation. Fin.<br><br>As I discovered recently, though, conflicting thoughts in your limited skull can cause severe existential anxiety but can also lead to epiphanies. I am studying quite a bit for the national exam in my mother tongue, Bulgarian, which was the reason I have read more about literature than actual works of literature. During this, however, I discovered an interesting side to myself - I enjoy analysing works of literature. Connecting content with ideas through metaphors and similes (I&#39;d use more precise terminology if I had a translation dictionary by my side and a desire to spend extra time on this lengthy post) is my fort\u00e8. The more time I spent reading up, the more I understood not only about a particular piece of writing but also about the time period itself. And let me tell you, modernism in the post liberation period of Bulgarian literature didn&#39;t seem all that exciting until it became thrilling. <br><br>That is the link between all the points up until now and the very reason this video sparked such a thought. I brought myself to literature and it became much more rewarding than it ever had been in the 12 years of formal education I&#39;ve had. That was the cause of my discomfort whenever I saw a Crash Course Literature, past horrible experience with literature in general. All it took was effort, and the rest came by itself. <br><br>Wow, dystopian novels really can dig deep.

This is illustrated by his statement &quot;It&#39;s not quite accurate for the contemporary left or right to claim George Orwell&quot;. Orwell was anti-capitalist, a leftist standpoint, and also anti-authoritarian, a libertarian standpoint. This, then would reasonably mean that Orwell was a libertarian leftist. Libertarian leftism, to no one&#39;s surprise, is still leftism.<br><br>Conveniently, Green in his very next sentence conflates communism with authoritarianism while alluding to the fact that Orwell was opposed to Stalin&#39;s USSR. Understandably, this misstep was most likely fueled by the cultural conditioning the US has been exposed to since the 1950s which tells you that communism is authoritarian and that Stalin is the face of communism. Now, a passing knowledge of communism will tell you that this isn&#39;t the case, unfortunately in the US there is much more misinformation than education about the topic of communism. Communism requires the abolishment of the state (very obviously anti-authoritarian), the workers of society to control the means of production and not employers or the state (meaning the factories, the tools, how things are distributed, etc.), and horizontal democracy along with the elimination of profit motives in favor of need-based production. As we can plainly see by looking at the actions of Stalin&#39;s USSR rather than by what it claimed itself to be, we can see that never gave it&#39;s citizens the means of production and that it always remained an undemocratic, totalitarian state. That is the complete inverse of communism. Stalin never sought to provide for the needs of his citizenry, his goal was to establish Russia as a super power via uniting the country as a machine focused on competing with the rest of the world. That isn&#39;t communism. At best, that&#39;s nationalism.
