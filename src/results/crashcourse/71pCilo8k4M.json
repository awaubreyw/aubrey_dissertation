This is the OLD model of the ANS. For 2+ decades, Dr. Stephen Porges has been presenting the POLYVAGAL THEORY of the ANS, which remedies an important omission in the anatomy presented in your video. The parasympathetic has an evolutionarily old (&quot;dorsal&quot;) branch as noted here, but also a newer, MYELINATED branch (&quot;ventral&quot;) that is responsible for the positve capacities known as the social engagement system. Leaving that part out, as you and other uninformed presenters do, results in a very incorrect picture. The social engagement system has the capacity to monitor SAFETY in teh environment and especially another person. IFF it satisfies the safety question, the positive qualities of relaxation and openness can take over; without safety, the sympathetic or dorsal parasympathetic will activate.

This may apply to other parts of the body as well that haven&#39;t been running at their optimal level.
