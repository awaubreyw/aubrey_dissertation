with two whole ass tables?? no, im gonna write a rule for that. simple one line, rule p &gt; f. dunno if thats a PIE &gt; Proto germanic but whatever.", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T21:16:21Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"imH7hdOgxrU": {"Phonology: Crash Course Linguistics #10": {"channel_id": "UgxDPFbiwkIg5tDQkZ54AaABAg", "comment_by": "Lakrids Pibe", "comment_text": "Yonder lies the castle of my fodder. <br>Could you getme a glas of wadder?<br>It&#39;s funny when americans say &quot;addams&quot; for &quot;atoms&quot;, &quot;data&quot; becomes &quot;dadda&quot;, etc..", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T20:54:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"imH7hdOgxrU": {"Phonology: Crash Course Linguistics #10": {"channel_id": "Ugx5z8AJ2r5AOQPJgvp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Kalman Linietsky", "comment_text": "Philadelphian  water: [w\u028ad\u0279\u0329]", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T20:53:33Z", "likes_count": 61}}}, {"imH7hdOgxrU": {"Phonology: Crash Course Linguistics #10": {"channel_id": "Ugx9VQw1QcdXi7p7ujB4AaABAg", "comment_by": "\u674e\u9550\u6c5f Wil", "comment_text": "My native languages are modern Mandarin, Cantonese, and an ancient dialect \u201cAi.\u201d Since high school, I learnt English in Canada, then German in Germany.
