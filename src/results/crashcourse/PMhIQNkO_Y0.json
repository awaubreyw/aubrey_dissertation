They are two different facets or levers of power and while the two have to work together, they serve completely different functions (hard power vs. soft power). You also glossed over the National Security Council which is an important interagency process, technically led by the executive (or President). But this is as it pertains to peace and security. When you talk about purely &quot;peacetime&quot; civilian functions, which is much of our foreign policy, like trade, human rights, etc it&#39;s all State Department.
