Neither were really caused by economic downturns.  In both cases, traditional conservatives (with the support of corporate interests) in unstable governments essentially cut deals with nationalists/fascists to help stabilize things and stop the spread of Socialism and/or Communism- and then were in turn unwittingly consumed by the dictators they unleashed.  Japan had a long and rather interesting road to their own version of totalitarianism, going as far back as the Meiji Reformation in the late 1800s.  It&#39;s not simply that poor economic conditions caused the rise of Japan&#39;s version of fascism- they had <b>much</b> deeper issues. The video even touches on how Spain went fascist because of their notoriously fractured society in the mid-1930s, but leaves out that their problems go way further back- Spain has had &quot;issues&quot; with making their government function going as far back as the early 1700s.<br><br>Countries like Austria, Romania, Croatia, and Hungary went fascist after the Depression.  While economic conditions played a role (especially in Austria&#39;s case- but their economic problems went back to the collapse of their empire near the end of World War I), again, it was more that traditional conservatives in weak governments essentially tried to cut deals with fascists and wound up being dominated by them (OK, Croatia basically got conquered by Nazi Germany and a pro-Nazi government was installed...).  Additionally, there was the perception by that point that fascism truly worked- after all, by the mid-1930s Italy had been fascist for over a decade and seemed to be doing pretty well (it wasn&#39;t, but Mussolini was pretty good at hiding it).  Austria for example, was afraid of being absorbed by then-newly Nazi-ruled Germany, and in 1933 Engelbert Dolfuss decided to copy Mussolini, who was seen at the time as the powerhouse dictator of Europe, to gain his favor and get him to guarantee their independence- and it worked for a while, until Hitler got cozy with Mussolini in 1938.   When Dollfuss was assassinated by Nazis in 1934 (his successor Schuschnigg continued the &quot;Austrofascist&quot; government), Mussolini actually tried to convince England and France to join an alliance with him to fight Germany in the event that Germany tried to annex Austria.  It was called the Stresa Front and it was (briefly) a thing!<br><br>Even Nazi Germany had that effect; look at how Hitler actually came to power.  Traditional conservatives like Papen and the DNVP- with the support of business interests- tried to cut a deal with him because they feared socialists and communists more than they feared Hitler&#39;s brand of insane, populist nationalism.  And as soon as Hitler got into office, he masterfully manipulated events (and cut a deal with another moderately conservative party, the Centre) to have Germany turned into a dictatorship- the Nazi takeover took less than two months from Hitler&#39;s appointment to chancellor to the passage of the Enabling Act.<br><br>Including Stalin here is a bit curious too.  Stalin didn&#39;t ride into power on a wave of discontent regarding economic conditions, he more or less manipulated the already-established Soviet bureaucracy to his advantage, defeated/exiled his political opponents, and stepped into the power vacuum that Lenin&#39;s death caused.  There were many factors in Lenin&#39;s seizure of power, which yes included- but was far from limited to- economic conditions.  Soviet Russia, like Imperial Japan, was its own special type of animal.<br><br>So while the basic premise that economic conditions can contribute to the rise of dictators has some validity, I would argue that weak governments and wealthy corporate interests allowing nationalist demagogues into positions of power is a far bigger concern.", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T12:55:45Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"Ojo8-GhhQcA": {"Economic Depression and Dictators: Crash Course European History #37": {"channel_id": "UgxoPanmxVBLEp_WEI94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Vigilant Sycamore", "comment_text": "Oh wow, this is a very interesting video that certainly has no similarities to what&#39;s going on right now in my own country, Poland, where a populist government uses tax cuts and welfare to appeal to the unemployed and young people while spreading hatred and propaganda and threatening, or outright taking, legal action against those who speak out against rising authoritarianism<br><br>Definitely doesn&#39;t remind me of how worried I am about how things will go if we don&#39;t change something soon", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T10:48:49Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"Ojo8-GhhQcA": {"Economic Depression and Dictators: Crash Course European History #37": {"channel_id": "Ugw8FtiXfwV7nf_h8NV4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Bob Smit", "comment_text": "Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli - Il Principe", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T10:38:23Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"Ojo8-GhhQcA": {"Economic Depression and Dictators: Crash Course European History #37": {"channel_id": "UgzwewTlC1etJzxwwTl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Americussian", "comment_text": "I remember this moment of transitioning from russian school to college when I realized that Stalin is actually historically comparable to Hitler and not the \u2018guy who won the Great Patriotic War\u2019 and my teenage brain going whhhat", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T07:44:34Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"Ojo8-GhhQcA": {"Economic Depression and Dictators: Crash Course European History #37": {"channel_id": "Ugwp-qDnRUvZKDjMuKp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "AngryHateMusic", "comment_text": "Statism defined.", "comment_date": "2020-03-08T04:43:57Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"Ojo8-GhhQcA": {"Economic Depression and Dictators: Crash Course European History #37": {"channel_id": "Ugx23dkRm4_XvkdLGw14AaABAg", "comment_by": "saima alam", "comment_text": "Dear John I enjoy your history lessons.

Frankly, most women of that era loved factory and fabrication work and in my personal experience id say their arts and crafts tendencies are perfectly suited to industrial fabrication. Women find solutions guys miss and vice versa, and because of that i would consider women necessary personnel to have in a machine shop. Some things are so fun it sounds like propaganda but i swear lathes make you feel something special and creative and expressive. And that young woman simply got lucky and found a great outlet for art, crafting, aesthetics, engineering and design that probably didnt otherwise exist in those areas before the factory work came to town. Im not ignoring or excusing the evil just pointing out that people still found their passion and explored themselves with all that going on around them.

One should debate the merits of revolutionary change over reformative change, especially given the current climate of legislative impasse in the US for example. What happened in Germany that led to the rise of Hitler was baked into the Versailles treaty, the perceived blame of WW1 on the German people entirely and the inherent instability and unpopularity of the Weimar republic among other reasons. <br>It should also be noted that when facing radicalism from both the left and right, power always chooses the right to further in face of the left. Perhaps it is because at the heart of communism is the belief in the equality of man, in all its forms and a criticism of the structures of power in capitalism. These structural arguments can often mask the human side of these relationships and blind the &#39;revolutionaries&#39; to the awful means that can be invoked to achieve laudable ends (democracy, equality on the one hand, gulags and lawlessness on the other). It should also be noted that despite the mistakes of the early Stalinist russia it basically won WW2 and became one of the two great superpowers of the world. So there&#39;s that. And the US and Europe are guilty of many evils, the former in the oppression of the latin america, later in the Middle East and the latter in the long history of colonialism, including of the former. Nazism and the system of fascism has no redeeming qualities and no high ideals beyond the brazen adulation of the masculine dictator and the oppression of convenient scapegoats as well as overt militarism and war-mongering (something Lenin and then Stalin were keen to avoid in the interwar years, even to their loss). The fact that socialist idealists and workers of the world were inspired by the ideals of soviet communism at the time whilst rich businessmen and royalty were sympathetic to fascism suggests the moving of class interests from the democratic arena to the dictatorial one. Interest groups for either side were simply fed-up with relying on democratic systems of representative government to provide for/keep the people in line (depending if you were poor/rich, proletariat/bourgeoisie). It&#39;s a warning to democratic systems everywhere that you are there but by the consent of the governed and special interests willing to play by the rules. If you fail to deliver a sustainable social contract, that society is likely to erode, sometimes in an alarmingly rapid fashion. I believe in democracy and free speech first and foremost for this reason, and in that sense the ultimate anti-fascist/socialist whatever label you want to give me. I believe that more democracy is always better, that speech should always be defended, no matter how taboo but I cannot deny that sometimes voting and talking is not enough. Sometimes you need armed revolution or where the law protects and the media shows to the public you can instead resort to non-violent peaceful protest (civil rights movement, antiwar movement). <br>I will never pick up a gun, but would I condemn anyone who fought Nazism or in the Spanish Civil War against Franco? No. Sometimes armed struggle is necessary, like in the American war of independence, or the French revolution. Or even the American Civil War. Sometimes violence is the only option left.

But seeing the open hate against muslims and jews, seeing how much people want to get rid of our liberal democracy, how fanatic people can get within their world view? That&#39;s sadly helped me understand the situation back then.
