Being from the UK, we are taught about the slave trade to some extent but very little about how the laws in the US developed.  (Under the framework laid out by the British monarchy and legal systems until the US gained independence, I might add).  I knew nothing of how the laws were literally made up on the hoof to be discriminatory.  <br>We can&#39;t go back in time and we can&#39;t correct every wrong from the past but it&#39;s never been clearer to me that the legacy of colonialism impacts an individual&#39;s life chances and opportunities today.  Until there is a level of cultural acceptance as to the history of the US and that it&#39;s rise as a world power owed an awful lot to the work of the enslaved, appropriate restitution is unlikely to happen.

If I remember correctly, the Virginia Slave Codes of 1705 were specifically written to also drive a wedge between the servants and slaves by even stipulating that servants (typically white) would have access to better food and clothing, they also had the legal right to redress by a local magistrate for unfair punishment or having their indenture extended for illegal reasons (uncommon, but happened), whereas slaves had no such protection. It&#39;s been posited that this was directly linked to Bacon&#39;s Rebellion, in and of itself, is a complicated issue.
