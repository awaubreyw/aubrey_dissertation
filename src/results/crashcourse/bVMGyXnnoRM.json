A lot of people believe that Kurtz wasn&#39;t insane but enlightened. Some kind of damaged genius. I think they are wrong and here is why. Kurtz was definitely insane but he was also enlightened at the same time. The reason why I think he is insane because he kills pretty indiscriminately, like the part where the reporter says that he threatened to kill him for taking his picture. And the grotesque hanging naked bodies etc etc. See, the River was the journey - almost like a long obstacle course - and Kurtz made it through it. He achieved enlightenment were he saw the absurdity of it all and he also embraces the horror as his friend, just like he described in the monologue about the Cadres. The problem is that it broke him and he embraced it to the point that he lost all sense of right and wrong. Willard, went down the same River journey, achieved the same enlightened understanding as Kurtz, embraced horror as a friend, but did not break as Kurtz did. He was the perfect soldier that Kurtz described. For this reason, Kurtz recognized that Willard was the greater man than himself and determined that he was worthy enough to allow him to end his life. After Willard kills him, he is greeted with the same worship from the followers as Kurtz received, which further shows that Willard was greater. And when Willard rejects it, grabs Lance and leaves, he shows my earlier point: He was strong enough to endure all of that, embraced horror as a friend etc, but still come back from the edge that Kurtz went over.

He said so in the beginning that he feels not at home either in the jungle or out of it,  well he basically said when he is in the jungle he doesn&#39;t want to be there but when he is off duty he wants to be back in the jungle which seems sort of logical when you suffer from severe PTSD.  I never saw Willard as an evil guy or someone who is losing it,  well not more than he already did. All through out he made pragmatic choices. when he killed the woman on the boat it wasn&#39;t because of annoyance or spite it was out of necessity.  They didn&#39;t have the means to save her, since she was already bleeding to death and his mission took priority.  He made also very clear that they shouldn&#39;t have checked the boat and warned against it before.  I just would call him an extreme pragmatist.  When he is kept prisoner at kurtz s compound he gets to understand Kurtz a bit better and is a bit more sympathetic towards what he has become but ultimately since chef got beheaded and because of the mission he was waiting for the perfect opportunity to strike. Redux is also bit different in that explores more facets of Willard that makes him a bit less ruthless and calculating.

A psychoanalytical model means turning recognizable events into spectres of delusions and insisting on the depreciating the value, the <i>consequences</i> of character&#39;s actions into being symbolic.<br><br>The audience is tacitly invited to turn anything truly disturbing into a kind of shadow play. They&#39;re not seeing a nakedly brutal depiction of the arbitrary cruelty of war, they&#39;re seeing sock puppets wagging back and forth over the limbs of very alive, very abstract puppeteers.<br><br>I think it&#39;s a kind of guilt response, a kind of denial mechanism. &quot;You <i>metaphorically</i> shot up that sampan. You didn&#39;t slaughter a family, you bloodlessly confronted an inner ugliness.&quot; Funny how that pulls the fangs from the power of a war narrative. Imagining that scenario is a distant, pathetic second to <i>seeing it</i>  when you can just tell yourself something like that &quot;might have happened&quot; instead allowing the viewer the blissful escape of innocence.<br><br>There are cases where psychoanalysis is appropriate, but they far fewer than their audience might wish. Take Fight Club which ends with something that should be readily psychoanalyzed but is in fact a direct literalization of some inner process and that scene&#39;s impact is in the literal-minded insanity of the act, not in Jack &quot;talking&quot; Tyler Durden to death.<br><br>Introspection has value, but only when paired to action. Otherwise what meaning is there in having a profoundly personal &quot;transformation&quot; that changes nothing about how you live? What stakes are there in an extended daydreaming session?
