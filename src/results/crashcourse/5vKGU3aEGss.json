It was the North American theatre of the Seven Years&#39; War, not the war itself.  IIRC, the fighting in North America began two years before the larger war, which is explains the discrepancy of the Seven Years&#39; War &quot;actually lasting nine years.&quot;<br><br>Second, another factor in the Revolution, perhaps the biggest one, was the fact that the British Parliament tried to tax the colonies in order to pay off its debts from the Seven Years&#39; War.  But  of course, the Patriots argued that this violated their rights as Englishmen because it was done without their consent (hence &quot;taxation without representation.&quot;)  This is an error by omisson, focusing on the secondary causes of the Revolution while ignoring the cause that was by far the biggest and most important one.<br><br>Third, the Patriots certainly DID believe in equality for all, at least more than the British did.  In an early draft of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson attacked King George III for permitting the slave trade and referred to slave auctions as places &quot;where men should be bought and sold.&quot;  The fact that he called them &quot;men&quot; clearly indicates he intended to include blacks when he said that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; earlier in the document.  It was only at the insistence of Southern delegates at the Second Continental Congress that he removed this section.  <br><br>And yes, I realize that Jefferson was a slaveowner himself, but not everyone who opposed the Atlantic slave trade was necessarily against slavery itself.  The slave trade was actually banned in the US in 1808, nearly 60 years before the Thirteenth Amendment fully abolished slavery,  and Congress passed this legislation with little controversy, as even many who were not necessarily anti-slavery were still horrified by the conditions on slave ships and the cruelty of traders to their captives.

Great video for the night before a test. I subscribed to this video because I need it for my tests. So yeah I love this channel. It is my secret wepon to passing tests. Fist of all it is not boring. Other videos suck and make me sooooo bored. Its easy to remember. 2nd of all it talks about the main idea and details are sorted out. 3rd of all it gives answers to important questions and posabilaties to wrong and right answers. So that is my thought on crash courses. So if you need to pass a test come to crash courses. If anyone hates this channel keep your thoughts to yourself cause no one wants to hear a complainer. I love this channel and hope everyone else does to. And also check out this channel every one its XxCoolKids21xX and please comment on it or subscribe.
