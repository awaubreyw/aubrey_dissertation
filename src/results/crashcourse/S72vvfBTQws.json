WHY did slavery exist?  Western Europe at the beginning of the slave trade didn&#39;t really even have serfs anymore, though it did have indentured servants.  The idea of human rights was certainly not yet well developed.  But, as far as I know, it didn&#39;t have slavery, and specifically it had no concept of race-based slavery (that is, the concept that while it&#39;s obviously not okay to enslave a white person, it becomes okay if the person is black).  WHY, why, why, did it ever occur to that first white person, when he saw a black person, to think &quot;I can treat this person not as a person but as property, as if he were a horse or ox&quot;?  Where did that noxious, irrational idea ever come from?  Was it the first white traders arriving in Africa and being offered prisoners to buy?  &quot;If the Africans think other Africans are property, why shouldn&#39;t we&quot;?  That seems too easy.  To use current slang, what ever made those first white Europeans think race-based slavery was a thing?
