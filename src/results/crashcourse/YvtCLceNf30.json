I await to watch further episodes to see how they do in fact develop the history of science. It is important though to keep in mind that science is a set of  culturally invariant propositions (and therefore incommensurability is nonsense) and that religion belongs in the subset of the social and psychological sciences, the purpose of which is to bring every individual to achieve their final end as psychological creatures, in a way that is ecologically sustainable.", "comment_date": "2019-07-17T21:00:00Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"YvtCLceNf30": {"Intro to History of Science: Crash Course History of Science #1": {"channel_id": "UgxmZc_7SigcSV7UbKd4AaABAg", "comment_by": "DR.

After she commented on this, I put on Crash Course&#39;s video about Marie Curie and a few others, and watched her face light up as I introduced her to women who I&#39;m hoping will be her role models in the future. <br>It&#39;s crazy to me that an 8 year old born in today&#39;s world could still have reason to internalize the message that they can&#39;t be something they want to be based on gender or any other arbitrary measure of ability. Until something quitely subverts that message.<br>Thanks Crash Course  (and SciShow) for being the place I can rely on to accurately represent all the demographics of your viewership, and thanks for just doing the little things you can that prove to a little girl that being a part of the STEM fields isn&#39;t a pipe dream.

But problem is when you stick with the term &#39;science&#39; rather than tendency of knowledge gaining of not just material world but immaterial world too.  Of course, science was derived from the Latin word scientia (knowledge) in 16th century and the term scientist was coined in 19th century. And this is was the time when according to Thomas Kuhn science revolutionized. More over, many claim that before 16th or 17th century, there was no science but just natural philosophy. Another problem is when your history becomes eurocentric, what about the non-european equivalent terms of science? For me, science begun right from the emergence of humanity. Many scientific revolutions occurred between stone age tool making and Artificial intelligence. All these are the products of knowledge. When our ancestors invented civilization, there the basic scientific tools like observational, empirical, rational knowledge were used. For example, gastronomy; a kitchen was itself a scientific lab. By the age of 2nd millenium BCE, our ancestors started to write down the knowledge in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Hindu Vedas means knowledge, by the era of 6th century BCE, our ancestors started to find the laws of nature. It happened in India first, then in Greece and then in China. Logic and philosophy originated in India in 8th century BCE in Upanishadic period. Greece was heavily influenced by Egypt and Babylon in sense of material culture and with India in immaterial culture. French anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss rightly said that Totemism is a sort of logic.", "comment_date": "2018-04-03T13:52:06Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"YvtCLceNf30": {"Intro to History of Science: Crash Course History of Science #1": {"channel_id": "UgymV2Qt7qZOg80HmX94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Al Couz", "comment_text": "all that seems really interesting.

You have a whole cast of people using scientific language to subvert and bastardize legitimate scientific explanations and achievements. Even the very unscientific hard creationist movement of men like Ken Ham uses scientific language with an air of mistrust for the word of legitimate scientists, and this extends to politicians who dispute evidence of climate change with a simple dismissal.

I hope it doesn&#39;t fall into techno-optimism too deeply and approaches science with a healthy skepticism despite having to be careful around those who abuse science like anti-vaxxers, those against GMOs, or flat Earthers / creationists. These positions generally can&#39;t really be reasoned with - so a better approach is always to shatter faith and religiosity within science than those who irrationally fear or reject it.
