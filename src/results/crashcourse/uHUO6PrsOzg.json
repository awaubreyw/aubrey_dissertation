Visuals are important, and incorrect visuals can have a counterproductive effect on learning. While that misplaced pH meter was so blatantly wrong that it shouldn&#39;t have confused that many people, there have been many moments in this series where I&#39;ve been drawn to wonder if the animators were just left to imagine what they were supposed to draw based on the script and a storyboard or whatever.</b><br><br><b>Just as I am a bit shaky on the correct words to express where I assume the animation process is breaking down, artists generally have only a superficial idea of how the physical world works. They need to be given explicit sketches or other models of what they&#39;re supposed to portray, or misleading impossibilities will creep into their portrayals. This is (arguably) acceptable in media intended purely for entertainment, but... in a series devoted to portraying how things work? Yikes.</b><br><br><b>Perhaps this also ties into my complaint that bundling &quot;engineering&quot; into one series is a bit over-generalized, akin to having a single &quot;Crash Course Arts and Music&quot; series instead of the plethora of art-related series that already exist.
