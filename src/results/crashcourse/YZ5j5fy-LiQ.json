I think it left a lot on the cutting room floor.  For one, MMORPGS have a special kind of staying power compared to the young upstarts in casual gaming. WoW, EveOnline, Elder Scrolls and the rest are built around a community of a few hundred thousand and can sustain itself for years.  Casual games like Farmville and Candy Crush need to constantly expand. Its why even though Farmville and its spinoffs had tens of millions of players at its height, they still burn out in a couple of years. <br><br>I think the community aspect could have used some more time too. Online communities became a thing because games were initially designed to be hard. In Vanilla Wow, the end levels were raids and raids took hours and NASA level of coordination.  That difficulty and also the lack of in game tutorials to direct you on your own, created the communities that made WoW and gaming famous. WoW indirectly forced players who wanted to improve to meet other players, learn tricks and exploits.  Along the way, you meet artists and musicians and stories spread.  Again comparing it to casual games, the community there is big but shallow. There just isn&#39;t as much you can bond with on even the most difficult level of Candy Crush.", "comment_date": "2016-06-24T23:15:50Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"YZ5j5fy-LiQ": {"MMORPGs - Crash Course Games #12": {"channel_id": "UgjSmEiVE_Y_2HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "JJ Evans", "comment_text": "Guild Wars 2 rep", "comment_date": "2016-06-24T23:12:17Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"YZ5j5fy-LiQ": {"MMORPGs - Crash Course Games #12": {"channel_id": "Ugi7FBOQLGhZcHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Laurent Griot", "comment_text": "Did he say that one of the game&#39;s GDP was higher than that of China&#39;s?", "comment_date": "2016-06-24T23:10:51Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"YZ5j5fy-LiQ": {"MMORPGs - Crash Course Games #12": {"channel_id": "Ugg9eIq84SuOxHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Hercados P.", "comment_text": "Baraka, Baraka Obama... <br>Seriously, no Tera?
