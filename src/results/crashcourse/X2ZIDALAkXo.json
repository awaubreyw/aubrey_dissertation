Markets existed in almost all societies, from the Empires of antiquity to the Kingdoms of the middle ages to Slave markets, it&#39;s not linked to Capitalism. Capitalism is the privatisation of means of production. It means someone owning the machines worked by others, and trying to maximize the profits (the part of YOUR labor that the Capitalist puts in his own pockets after paying what&#39;s necessary to keep the business going). <br><br>But thank you to recognize that Stalinian control of the economy is a far ideal from what Marx suggested (he had surprisingly little prescriptions from his economical analysis of Capitalism, and it was mostly others, like Lenin, who fleshed out what the logical next steps were based on the situation at the time, but the structures necessary to centralize the revolution defence against the White Army, and other Capitalists also made it prone to be co-opted by the bureaucratic elite supported by Stalin, and later by Mao, and copy-pasted in most &quot;communist&quot; states afterward). <br><br>Yet, planned economies were almost doomed to develop this bureacucracy, supporting the government above the people, because of an anti-democratic structure (as opposed to the &quot;all powers to the Soviets&quot; slogan of Lenin), and the fact that technologically, it was harder to coordinate production. Now, Amazon, Walmart and others showed us very well that  a planned economy could work. In &quot;The People&#39;s Republic of Walmart&quot;, the argument is layed out that these companies already manage more employees and money than entire countries, leveraging A.I. and automation to even guess what the demand will be. The only difference is that it&#39;s a whole machine geared toward the maximisation of profit for shareholders and the people on top. The tech exist, but it could be managed by all of us, directly. <br><br>Also, going over East and West Germany and Bulgaria, you omitted the economic consequences faced by the people in those countries AFTER becoming Capitalists. Their life-standard went down dramatically, their national industries and services became privatized (going to the corrupt elite already in place), leading to incredible levels of inequality, and a reduction in life-standard. Same in most Socialist countries that either had a CIA backed coup against them to bring in Neo-Liberal dictatorships (read &quot;The Jakarta method&quot;, and &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot;).", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T10:34:33Z", "likes_count": 58}, {"comment_by": "Delfina Gabriela Borrelli Sarmiento", "comment_text": "The Gravity falls reference made me cry", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T04:35:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daryl V.", "comment_text": "Nothing&#39;s perfect, but one way gave us smartphones and youtube, the other gave us communism.", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T03:14:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anderson Andrighi", "comment_text": "I was expecting people to argue about this video.
