Great video, as always, thank you very much for that. I do have a question thought. You mentioned Pasteur&#39;s questionable ethics, which may not be that surprising given what we know others did back then. However we also know that Pasteur was a rather human guy, althought he used animal models, he wrote several letters where he states that he didn&#39;t like it and made some arrangements to make it easier for the animals. When it comes to human deaths due to the rabies vaccine, I never heard that he covered any deaths. I&#39;m in no way saying it&#39;s not true, but we also know from letters he didn&#39;t want to use the vaccine at first. He wasn&#39;t confident enough to vaccinate Joseph Meister (the first kid to be saved), and only agreed because of the mother&#39;s insistance and the fact that the kid was going to die of rabies anyway. Other sources that reported on that event confirm that Pasteur was very concerned and cared a lot for the boy&#39;s safety. That&#39;s why I&#39;m a bit confused, again I&#39;m in no way saying you&#39;re wrong, I&#39;m just curious about something I never heard before.
