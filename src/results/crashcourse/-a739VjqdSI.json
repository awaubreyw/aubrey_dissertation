Unfortunately this didn&#39;t fix the problem, as any means, however terrible, could still potentially be justified in the pursuit of a &quot;loving&quot; goal.<br><br>There has never been a political system, whether secular or not, whether democratic or not, that is\u00a0immune from abuse, immune from developing within itself systemic injustice. Nor is it\u00a0true to say that only theists can live morally upright lives. There are certainly many non-theists who are deeply committed to the well-being of humanity, to environmental responsibility, and who live exemplary lives of service and compassion, just as there are many self-described theists who do not. But it is true that, once a society&#39;s values, as embodied in its legislation, have become essentially disconnected from any reference to absolute moral authority (such as God), there follows a cultural drift towards moral relativism and the kind of utilitarian ethics exemplified in the writings of the philosopher Peter Singer.<br>\u00a0<br>Commendable as the stated goals of utilitarianism may be, in a morally relativistic secular society governed according to utilitarian principles the definition of &quot;the greater good&quot; is in effect determined by those who have the greatest influence. This necessarily ends up devolving essentially into the rule of the strong over the weak, however much the society might wish either to avoid this outcome or try to make it appear otherwise. In a secular capitalist society, the &quot;greater good&quot; is inevitably measured in economic terms, automatically casting needy individuals as &quot;liabilities&quot;, as having net negative value to society.

Today, technology dictates almost every aspect of our lives, and our technology is both increasingly &quot;spectator&quot;-based and centralized. These two things are a match made in hell, in my opinion. One side of the coin separates us further and further from the direct experience of a shared reality and the other side forces us into smaller and smaller ideological niches. We are being programmed for a new kind of technological regime that reduces every aspect of our lives to algorithms making incredibly complex utilitarian decisions without our conscious input or consent. The technocrats argue that it is OUR data, after all, that allows these new cybernetic systems to grow in reach and power, so theoretically, these utilitarian decisions should be super democratic... however, because this data is being filtered through a largely spectator-based technology, it bears little connection to our individual lives--and in fact, by its function, data-mining strips the individual of their true identity and reduces that identity to quantum points in a dragnet...", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T04:38:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "007kingifrit", "comment_text": "utilitarians: whatever works is justified", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T02:06:04Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Gem Gem", "comment_text": "thanks.

While it&#39;s a sufficient example to poke at act utilitarianism, it actually pokes far deeper than the patching to rule utilitariansim can cover.  To see how, all you have to do is imagine the same scenario in a desert-island type setting.  There&#39;s a robot doctor present, capable of performing the organ transplant.  Imagine there are only 3 people - 2 patients who need vital organs and 1 who could give them to both.  Do the 2 ethically order the robot doctor to harvest organs? <br><br>Rule-utilitarianisms&#39; appeal doesn&#39;t seem to me to apply (much) here.  Because there&#39;s no greater society, and hence no precedent is set at large.  Moreover, only 2 humans remain afterwards.  So there&#39;s no further possibility of killing some to save more.  Suppose they are both the same sex so no future society will emerge.  <br><br>While a rather elaborate example, it seems to me that this points to a deeper issue with act utilitarianism that rule utilitarianisms&#39; rationale doesn&#39;t apply to.  For me, what comes up is issues around self-sovereignty, which are deeply violated when a society or individual deems you should die for a greater good.  It just seems wrong to violate someone&#39;s self-sovereignty to this degree.  <br><br>I guess rule utilitarianism could attempt to make a play on those grounds - self-sovereignty is a rule that contributes in an important way to well-being.  Violating it does real damage to the ability to believe it will hold in the future (even in the society of 2), and hence does real harm to well-being.  <br><br>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m being a moral realist here.  I don&#39;t have the view that others should necessarily share this view about self-sovereignty, bc I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything sufficiently objective about it.  It&#39;s more of a moral subjective stance.  Operationally, I value my self-sovereignty so much that it&#39;s hard to make it OK for me to violate someone else&#39;s in a deep way like this.  It&#39;s quite possible that other people in other societies don&#39;t value self-sovereignty to this degree.  So it would be OK for them.  <br><br>Well...at least this one really made me think hard.

The problem with Utilitarianism is that it presupposes that you KNOW what is going to have the biggest benefit. What is going to cause the greatest pleasure. And it creates problems such as, &quot;Is it then ethically alright to enslave a small segment of the population to bring great rewards to the majority?&quot; and so on. <br><br>The strengths of Deontological ethical theories is that it weighs the right or wrong of the action apart from an outcome which can not be known until after the fact. To weigh the right or wrong of an action based upon the future benefits of said action is to know those future outcomes of said actions. Even if you know the immediate outcome you don&#39;t know what follows.<br><br>I mentioned the problems with Utilitarianism and Slavery earlier but I&#39;m going to touch on this again. For Deontological ethical theories Slavery is wrong. I think it&#39;d be a hard thing to argue today that Slavery isn&#39;t wrong. I believe that we have drawn the conclusion that slavery is wrong. However for the Utilitarian ethics subscriber the question comes to at what level of pain and suffering on the part of what portion of the population does the pleasure and benefit to the majority begin to make Slavery ethical? If the population of slaves is small enough or their suffering minimal enough, would it be ethical?<br><br>Basing an ethical theory on things that are unknown or on pleasure is problematic because it presupposes that these things are in some way quantifiable and measurable and they simply aren&#39;t. Pleasure and pain are evolution&#39;s way of telling you, &quot;no danger&quot; or &quot;yes safe&quot; and letting your body know if you can and or should do a thing or if you can&#39;t or should not do a thing. Don&#39;t put your hand on the hot stove or it will damage us. Do eat the apple it is full of nutrition. And so on.. So back to batman...<br><br>Is batman responsible for the deaths of the Joker&#39;s victims after he escapes the prison that Batman put him into? NO, the Joker is responsible for those deaths, Batman can not know the Joker is going to escape a maximum security prison. He can not know that the court system is going to just keep sticking him in that prison over and over again. Allowing the rule of law to sentence the Joker is Batman&#39;s moral imperative and thus his own actions are clean in this respect. He has one job. To stop the Joker and allow the authorities to take the Joker into custody and what they do with him (the Joker) is their own business. Batman has fulfilled his function and thus he&#39;s done.<br><br>Batman can not KNOW what the Joker is going to do after he is arrested. After all convicts have done things that were beneficial to society while in prison. Immediately the development of the M1 carbine in WWII comes to mind where a prisoner actually developed the rifle for the US military while he was serving time. It was beneficial to the war effort and helped the US win the war.<br><br>The Joker might change, or perhaps he might continue to be a sadistic psychopath but it&#39;s not known. Unless you have a future prediction machine and know with 100 percent accuracy what is going to happen given a given action you can NOT rely on a Utilitarian construct for ethics. You might as well just say, &quot;I did it because it feels good and that&#39;s what makes it right.&quot; and no adult with a grasp of basic understanding would argue that that&#39;s alright.<br><br>Ethics is supposed to weigh the action and if your basis for if that action is ethical or unethical is based on the outcome of that action or worse yet the benefit to the most (taking away that there could be an inherent violation on others) creates a guessing game that only if you know the most beneficial outcome can you know if your action is just.<br><br>Besides what&#39;s to stop you from murdering a child and then arguing that you knew that that child was going to become the next Adolf Hitler and thus you were acting ethically. Who&#39;s to say that you are wrong in such a system? Your action is wrong but if the outcome you&#39;re presupposing is more beneficial then it suddenly becomes right. Nazi doctors experimenting on Jews in concentration camps weren&#39;t evil or wrong. We have so many new medical advances because of their unethical actions so it&#39;s suddenly OK.<br><br>You can NOT base an ethical theory on the future out comes of your actions because you&#39;re not &quot;the Doctor&quot; and do not know what is going to happen in the future when you take a certain action. You can guess but you don&#39;t know. Your choices have to be weight on the ethical actions apart from their outcome based on the merits of the action itself and not what you think will make for the most happiness.", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T18:10:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Irisatyro", "comment_text": "yeah batman&#39;s logic never made sense", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T03:24:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The_Radioman_is_Bleeding", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a739VjqdSI&amp;t=3m39s\">3:39</a> &#39;we should act always so as to produce the greatest good for the greatest number&#39; .... this may have held up back when there were &lt;2 billion people on the planet but now that there are so many disgusting and morally bankrupt people (by most standards, not to their own kinds i guess) it matters more about propagating kind folk rather than a sample size of all types. imo.", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T01:48:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Opinunate ted", "comment_text": "As a liver donor recipient, I don&#39;t want innocent people killed to give organs to people who need them, but---our current system where organs can be taken ONLY from people who have a card in their pocket saying that they can be is wrong.

We should do things to achieve the best outcomes because...that will lead to the best outcome. But the thought experiments proposed don&#39;t consider the whole outcome, only selected parts of it. If we were to live in a society where doctors could kill us to save many other lives, while more people might survive, it might result in perpetual fear throughout society, and that fear might lower total happiness. It might also result in a decreased incentive to find alternative methods to sustain human life, and such a finding would result in even more happiness (I don&#39;t like using happiness, let&#39;s replace it with the fulfillment of values). If you can just kill random lonely people when you need to save a bunch of other people, then there would be less motivation to find a solution that will save those people without relying on the death of another. <br><br>Another problem with utilitarianism is that it contains a principle that holds it back from fulfilling its stated goal &quot;the greatest happiness for the greatest amount of people&quot; or using my preferred language &quot;the maximization of the fulfillment of values.&quot; This principle is the one that we shouldn&#39;t prioritize ourselves over others, we are no different. But if we are seeking the maximization of the fulfillment of values, then the best person who is the most equipped to fulfill your values IS YOU.  When we work to fulfill our own values, we are increasing the total happiness in the world. If your life is going well, then others will have less reason to devote resources like time and energy on you and they can either allocate that towards other people or themselves. <br><br>Obviously if a murder is trying to satiate his/her desire to murder, that is something that does not result in the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

If you kill one of these people, that basically means that you are increasing their worth since they will be worth the price of each bullet it takes to kill them with.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve probably scared them enough anyways, if they care enough about their lives, they will probably scatter off and never even interfere with you again for that.&quot;<br><br>If they STILL insist on killing, I have only won more information (remember, my goal is to let everyone live prosperous here).<br><br>I would say in that case that the person is some kind of psycho, and I could just assume that the chances of the other soldiers being the same are low enough to make a death choice at this point, but I&#39;m not going to waste any opportunity.<br><br>&quot;What is forcing you to do this?&quot;<br><br>If there is an exterior force, I would deal with that.<br><br>If I can&#39;t for some reason, I would probably either kill myself, that way I&#39;m not more mean to anyone else than I am to myself.

Say the world is over populated. We need to feed everyone, house everyone and everyone should have access to technology and science and other resources. So if keeping more people alive makes it harder to do this why would we keep them alive. Would they suffer or are these people better off. I\u2019d say that there are too many people alive, keeping as many people alive would do more damage than good. Say we manage to get all these resources to everyone alive, they\u2019ll create more pollution, more damage to nature and deplete resources at a faster rate than if only half the people alive had access to these resources. So would killing a lot of people actually benefit the rest of the world or even other people ? Well yes, doing so can in theory eradicate poverty, world hunger, lessen pollution and the green house effect and will lessen the need for resources. On top of all that more job would be available and the people remaining on the Earth would overall have a better life. So why would we sacrifice a better life soo that more people can have a less better life ? Am I the only one that\u2019s thought about this ? Wouldn\u2019t that be the best thing to do morally. Ethically of course not but why do ethics need to get in the way of making things better. The issue is that we don\u2019t necessarily have a natural enemy that can keep our population under control like in nature. We have mass killings, natural disasters and war but those things are still limited and do not fully solve this issue. Morally we shouldn\u2019t have more people alive and rather try to keep the best of our species (survival of the fittest) alive and try to make our species better off.

Also, Mill explicitly argues against tyranny of the majority in &quot;On Liberty&quot; (chapter 2).

If you want a happy society, follow these instructions; if you want to bake a cake, do as listed in the recipe book. However, it begs the question: why are these objectives desired, or even there, in the first place? These objectives are certainly outside the field of reason itself to be justified solely by it. Wanting to bake a cake is as much a subjective purpose or want as is wanting a more utilitarian society. This is the essence of the kantian morality: kant justified his ethic not in an external purpose or objective, subjective in nature, but justified in reason itself.

Furthermore, The Joker wants Batman encourages Batman to kill him in order to cause chaos - it would taint what Batman stands for, he would be killer just like The Joker. It would be like Batman taking over The Joker&#39;s role, whether he wants to or not. The Joker is arguably the greatest evil that Gotham has ever experienced, and for Batman to kill that evil, not only would Batman be breaking his morals/rules, but he would be taking over The Joker&#39;s reputation, ultimately making his purpose as Batman invalid or tainted, and arguably then becomes that greatest evil.<br><br>Similarly to Two-Face&#39;s want for fairness and chance, it could be argued that Batman believes that by not killing the root of the problem, and allowing chance to decide who dies at the hands of The Joker, depending on their actions leading up to the event that caused their death is the most moral way to live. This luck can also be supported by my previous point: that The Joker has no ultimate plan (as stated in The Dark Knight) and thus he just causes chaos without the thought of any particular people being hurt, and if they are hurt for a purpose (instead of his usual want of chaos) e.g if they are a person with great political power, it could be argued it was the victim&#39;s fault for being in a vulnerable situation that The Joker took advantage of (by chance on purpose), and it was their actions/their peers&#39; actions that lead to that person gaining that particular occupation and thus allowing The Joker to take advantage of said occupation.

Finally, by not killing The Joker, it also doesn&#39;t provoke people to take up Batman&#39;s role of &quot;no killing&quot; and come after Batman for murdering people - it prevents a chain reaction of greater evil from happening, as each &quot;Joker&quot; tries to outdo the last.", "comment_date": "2017-06-10T09:37:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Gardner", "comment_text": "&quot;Should Bateman kill the Joker...?&quot; <br>I can just hear Jason Todd screaming in the distance.", "comment_date": "2017-06-08T14:39:31Z", "likes_count": 159}, {"comment_by": "Not really?", "comment_text": "You misspelled &quot;Contant&quot;, It should be &quot;Constant&quot; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-a739VjqdSI&amp;t=8m57s\">8:57</a>", "comment_date": "2017-06-07T16:13:50Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Omar Perez", "comment_text": "These videos are the best.

It is the same final conclusion, but the argument is different.<br><br>Second, when you say that you as an owner of organs should prefer to live in a world where people are not to be harvested for their organs, you are wrong. Let&#39;s say that S people need transplants and for simplification reasons we will assume each person needs only one organ. Let H be the number of people who can provide organs. Assuming good enough management at least a few organs can be extracted from each healthy person, let&#39;s say that is N (N&gt;1). If we do not harvest people for organs the total number of people who survive is T1=H. If we do harvest people for their organs the total number of people who survive is T2=(H-S/N)+S=H+S-S/N=H+S(N-1)/N. T2&gt;T1 Assuming each person has an approximately equal chance of needing organs your chance of survival in the first case is P1=T1/(H+S) and in the second case it is P2=T2/(H+S). T2&gt;T1 =&gt; P2&gt;P1. Therefore you have higher chances of survival in the case where we do harvest people for their organs. Another benefit in that scenario is that we can choose which people are harvested for their organs, while we cannot choose which people need transplants. This means that we can further maximize utility.<br><br>I am not proposing following act utilitarianism, but rather correcting the &quot;rules&quot; for the rule utilitarianism you &quot;propose&quot;. An example would be: firstly, it is not allowed to not be an organ donor when you die (Why do we even allow that nowadays?); secondly, the worst criminals get their organs harvested and given to people in need.

It also seems to reduce consequences and options to unrealistic binaries, forcing the active participant down a specific route as the scenario is framed in such a way as to make only one route possible and moral.

It also recognizes that consequence as a result of a utilitarian action is really unknowable. Sure, by utilitarian logic your choice could result in positive change, but it could also lead to unforeseen disaster. If that were the case, the utilitarian outcome has been compromised by the ignorance of its performer, who assumed his own omnipotence and omniscience.

That being said, drug A also has a minor chance of causing a patient&#39;s death through colapse of his immune system. This is a low chance that doesn&#39;t offset the 8% improved survival.<br>Drug B on the other hand increases 5-year survival rate by 4%, but doesn&#39;t present dangerous side effects.<br>So the prescriber convinces the patient to go through with treatment A.

This makes it perfectly acceptable for you personally to be morally egoistic in the hedonistic sense, i.e. seek pleasure for yourself foremost, because with the machinery of utilitarian moral society running in the background this will automatically mean that you will take actions that do not neglect others entirely since in a society<br> with laws when you do something that harms others too much you will be punished (either by law or because you are shunned by others and &quot;punished&quot; with social isolation) and therefore it is no longer the option that brings you the most pleasure. <br><br>This is a very efficient way of doing things since it means you no longer need to enforce morality on an individual level but you have a self regulating system that compensates for the natural tendency of each animal towards egoistic hedonism. In many cases evolution has created emotional pleasure/pain responses for when you do things that benefit your group or species like protecting your kin, being social and reproducing. For modern humans our &quot;tribe&quot; is global, but evolution has not had time to adapt to the change and thus we are not equipped to optimize the well-being of such a large number of humans. Therefore we need to construct our society ourselves according to utilitarian principles in order to achieve this.<br><br>The point where it becomes complicated is when you start considering how to estimate a quantitative measure of world well-being from each person&#39;s individual level of happiness. An arithmetic average is susceptible to showing skewed results when a small number of people are very well off while large numbers are suffering. So the formula must contain weighting factors that make sure the bottom is not neglected, to ensure that even the ones worst off are still doing as well as possible within reason. Meaning the laws and the economy and the social order must be built as to ensure that the discrepancy between top and bottom is kept within certain limits so that not only is the average lifted but also the people at the very bottom are still doing reasonably well and do not live in misery even if this means you have to redistribute, to take off the top to give to the bottom. <br><br>This philosophy is i feel very well captured by the system of social democracy where capitalism is used as a tool to increase economic well-being but its amoral tendencies are mitigated by state regulation and social safety nets, while at the same time valuing personal freedom and the right to self-determination.", "comment_date": "2016-11-23T19:22:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TOP DOG", "comment_text": "I&#39;m I in the spooky part of YouTube  Again", "comment_date": "2016-11-23T19:19:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Artur Rheinboldt", "comment_text": "no trolley problem?", "comment_date": "2016-11-23T18:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eden", "comment_text": "Your lack of Red Hood concerns me.", "comment_date": "2016-11-23T18:24:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Revolution", "comment_text": "Seems to me to be pushing an agenda on people, it&#39;s not morally right to kill.

But I believe that killing the joker only seems like its the best thing for gotham in the long term. If you don&#39;t consider the long LONG term.<br><br>You see, if batman kills the joker, that opens the door for Super Heroes to just kill criminals who get in the way. Now you might say that batman should only kill the worst criminals, but the thing is Bruce Wayne&#39;s judgment may seem really good most of the time, but when it comes to the subject of him thinking about people like the guy who killed his parents, he often lets his emotions get the better of him. I believe it would be only a matter of time before batman ended up killing someone who could probably be reformed. The super hero community is a rather tight nit group, and batman is one of the most respected members.<br><br>Lets go back to the example of shooting the one guy or the soldiers will kill everyone. What if a person were to take the gun and fight back and kill the soldiers? Now utilitarians would say that this would be a moral evil because the soldiers would surely win and kill everyone. But what if you succeed in killing all the soldiers or escaping with your life and somehow help aid others in escaping as well? Then all the sudden the utilitarians would call this a moral good. This is where utilitarianism is limited for me. You are only doing good based in part on your luck and your judgment. I don&#39;t think that choosing to shoot the one person to save 20 is wrong, but I also don&#39;t think that not shooting anyone is wrong. Maybe this person always does this to their victims and then kills them anyways. Maybe not.<br><br>I don&#39;t agree with Kant on doing things for the sake of some imaginary moral purity, but I also believe that good and evil are not always diametrically opposed. I don&#39;t think all actions fall into the category of entirely morally good or evil. I think both the results of your actions and the intentions matter, because they both exist.

However, for most, utilitarianism only goes down so deep; if most had to choose between burning themselves at the stake or letting 10 others get shot, they would rather the 10 others get shot. Some, however, will sacrifice themselves under any circumstance to cause happiness for others over yourself, due to\u00a0a moral code that prohibits them from letting others die while they go scot free.

It would be acceptable to place a computer-chip inside everyone&#39;s brains, that place them in a perpetual state of bliss, no matter what is happening to them, and controlling their bodies like puppets. Maximum pleasure, Maximum productivity, Minimum damages. Ultimate utility. we become the borg on ecstasy. There&#39;s no &quot;Created fear&quot; involved. no fear of sudden death for being &quot;harvested&quot;. you still live a productive and happy life, and in fact you are less likely to have anything &quot;bad&quot; happen to you. if everyone gets chipped, there are no murderers or rapists. <br><br>The end result of all forms of utilitarianism, Is the death of free will. <br><br>Next, There are actually two classes of utilitarianism itself, Both Rule and Act utilitarianism as described here, are a part of &quot;Positive Utilitarianism&quot;, which is maximizing Positive results. There is also &quot;Negative Utilitarianism&quot;, Which is the Inverse, You are attempting to Minimize the Negative in the world. You are not concerned with producing pleasure, Only removing pain and suffering. <br><br>Painkillers result from Negative Utilitarianism. Someone is suffering extreme pain? Give them a drug that will make them nolonger feel, or care, about that pain.<br>Euthanasia. Someone is going to be suffering and degrading for a long time before they die, and painkillers won&#39;t work, and there is no treatment. Give them the option to die by choice, thus minimizing their personal suffering.<br><br>Another historical result of Negative Utilitarianism, is effectively an expanded form of Euthanasia, for the scale of civilization, and that, is Eugenics. Minimizing the suffering of society itself, by minimizing the number of people in society who are suffering. Everyone who is sick, or crippled, or otherwise unwell, is euthanized, so that only healthy people survive. This is the negative form of rule-utilitarianism, as it is concerned with long term. If everyone with a hereditary disease dies, then that hereditary disease also dies, and noone will ever suffer from it in the future. Maximum benefit. This is what the NAZIs did both before and during world war two. the perversion of negative rule utilitarianism also resulted in the holocaust itself, because they regarded the jewish people, to be one form of suffering, and that without them, there would have been less suffering in the world. This is of course, really, REALLY bad. but it is far from the worst result of Negative utilitarianism.<br><br>The absolute worst part of Negative utilitarianism, is on the longest scale we can conceive of. when I mentioned positive utilitarianism drugging the water and turning everyone into drones? This one is that level of extreme. It is also super-villain bad. If you exterminate all life on earth, Every single human, plant and animal, including yourself, Then No suffering can ever happen, for all of time going forward. No more war, No more hate, no fear, no addiction, no disease, no abuse, no violence, no depression. nothing. <br><br>In both of these ultimate expressions of utilitarianism, They both have an INFINITE NET GAIN, and therefor, a FAILURE TO COMMIT TO THEM, Is an INFINITE WRONG, and a failure to do so, becomes morally objectionable, according to the absolute rules, of utilitarianism, positive or negative. If you are a positive rule utilitarian, and you have the ability to borg the entire human species and drug them, you HAVE to do it, it is morally wrong not to. If you are a Negative rule utilitarian and have the opportunity to exterminate all life, then you HAVE to do it, it is morally wrong not to. <br><br>Ultimately Utilitarianism is ALWAYS wrong, in the absolute, because it is absolute, and no exception may be made, Ever.

So when the people who are supposed to protect us fail in their job, what are we supposed to do?<br><br>That&#39;s why he&#39;s such an imposing yet admirable hero: he&#39;s straddling the line of citizen activism without crossing over into full on vigilantism that could see the rule of law go up in (possibly quite literal) flames. And in so doing, he&#39;s modeling the essence of Rule Utilitarianism&#39;s future-seeing ethics: if he keeps throwing enough of them in prison and keeps them off the streets long enough, then maybe the police will have time to recover and strengthen enough to take the streets back; maybe good people will eventually get elected to positions of power instead of being bribed or intimidated into submission because nobody will be left to do said bribing or intimidating; maybe his city will stop being cowed and beaten down long enough to fight back LEGALLY and win the streets of Gotham.<br><br>Sadly, the upper crust of Gotham tend to all be snooty assholes who don&#39;t care about the rest of Gotham since it doesn&#39;t affect them, and that&#39;s one of Batman&#39;s greatest problems: since the super-villains take care to avoid affecting the rich too much until they&#39;re ready to take the city whole-cloth, Batman can&#39;t show those people the truth like he can the poor and downtrodden. And Bruce can&#39;t do too much too quickly without making himself a target and exposing Batman. So the rich only see Batman as a criminal who&#39;s not <b>as</b> bad as Joker or Two-Face. And since they&#39;re largely paid by said upper-crust (and since he&#39;s interfering with their work and breaking established laws to do it), the Police as a whole see him as a criminal, as well, taking the stance that &quot;If he really wants to help, he&#39;d take off the mask and put on a badge like we did; sooner or later, he&#39;s going to slip up and kill someone this way&quot;.<br><br>So to sum up: Batman won&#39;t kill the Joker because he doesn&#39;t want others to then follow in his footsteps and start killing all the criminals in Gotham, which would leave the rule of law burning along with the city. He&#39;s trying to find the best outcome for the long-term, when the short-term good would be to kill Joker and Two-Face and all the rest. And that&#39;s Rule Utilitarianism at its core. HE isn&#39;t the one at fault for the Joker getting out and killing again: it&#39;s the law-makers for not changing the laws to have Joker thrown in a <b>real</b> prison when Batman brings them in; it&#39;s those in charge of Arkum Asylum for not spending the money to beef up security to ensure their charges don&#39;t escape (or better yet, rebuild the place from scratch); and it&#39;s those in powers&#39; fault for letting the city continue to rot so that Joker continues to have desperate underlings who want the power and money he promises in exchange for helping him bust out yet again.<br><br>Writing this while eating a Chom Chom and sick in bed.", "comment_date": "2016-11-22T00:39:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felipe Martins", "comment_text": "No trolley problem?
