Don&#39;t wait for orders or official calls. <br>If the quake was minor, but the waters noticeably and rapidly retire from the beach, same, and faster if possible. <br>Same, if the waters just retire and it&#39;s not the time for the low tide. Even more so if there are news of an earthquake in a neighboring place. <br>Don&#39;t stop to get your things. A tsunami can arrive in 15 minutes or even less. Some water and a blanket is all what you&#39;ll immediately need.<br>When in a safe place, stay there for about 8 to 24 hours. After that, whatever could happen will have happened. Before that, it might be still risky to go back.<br>Experience: In Chilean 2010 major earthquake and tsunami, most people in the affected coast, trusting our national instinct and lore, run to the hills. The government, at the moment badly informed about the quake&#39;s magnitude, told people there was no risk of tsunami, so they could go back to their houses. Many did. The tsunami got them. <br>So, with all due respect toward all elected or not elected authorities, don&#39;t go back at least for a few hours. <br>That was a bit of very hardly earned experience for you.", "comment_date": "2021-09-22T13:18:37Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Mar\u00eda Mart\u00ednez", "comment_text": "Chilean here.
