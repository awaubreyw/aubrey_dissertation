Smith, Keynes, Marx are not really in opposition to each other in terms of the mechanics of economics where the same knowledge is shared (there are long time gaps between the men&#39;s works).<br><br>1a. Smith codified the basic supply/demand interaction and stated he thought that supply drove demand due to his experience of living in the massive English industrial boom. It turned out to be only partially correct.<br>1b. Keynes refined the supply/demand mechanic noting that demand creates the capacity that attracts supply. It rounded out the basic structure but still lacked the rigour of science had for analysing data sets.<br>1c. Marx didn&#39;t like distilling of economic force and wealth into the hands of a minority so he tried to come up with a managed system to counter the effect of market capture and capital monopoly that tried to democratise market forces. It turned out to be an impractical approach.<br><br>2. Read studies (including their methodologies and preferably the data) not slogans and try to avoid anything that makes economics sound like there are simple one perspective fixes to large, complex problems.<br><br>3.

My sad story. It all started many years ago, in the land of Butslapia, I was only five years old when I took my mighty sword and went into the forest to gather shrooms for my mother, who had a deadly disease. While in the forest, I found a hut that looked very old. A man came out and offered me candy. Obviously I accepted, because I was told that you always do what adults tell you to do, especially when they give you candy! He led me inside and then took this weird looking object from his shelf. He pointed it at me and muttered some strange words I had never heard before. Then a bright light zapped from the object and pain like never before washed all over my body! He then laughed insanely as I ran out of the building. I ran all the way until I was at my village I went inside my house to see my family, but \u00a0when they looked at me the screamed and threw me out of the house. I landed on the dirt with a thud, and I saw my reflection in a puddle. I was shocked with what I saw. My body had transformed into a wierd creature black in color with a scaly texture. I had one red eye that emitted a dull red glow. My other eye didn&#39;t seem to change. I was so shocked that I didn&#39;t notice the villagers coming up behind me. They yelled and screamed at me. They told me I &quot;wasn&#39;t normal&quot;, and &quot;I didn&#39;t belong here.&quot; I ran out of the village, tears dripping from my eyes. I didn&#39;t stop running for what felt like forever. When I stopped running, I collapsed from exhaustion. When I woke up, I saw a bunch of people that looked a lot like me with spears. I stared at them, they stared at me. I noticed the only major difference between me and them was that they all had eyes that were white with a black center. No color in any of their eyes at all. After they examined me, they noticed the difference in eyes too. When they did, they bowed to me. They took me to their camp, where I was greeted with happy faces and many gifts. I realized that all of them had red eyes that were tattooed to their backs. They brought me into a small tent with a table in it. Sitting at one side of the table was a very muscular man that wore heavy battle armour that looked like it had been used for years. He told me to sit down, so I did. He told me I had been given \u201cthe gift\u201d and that they worshipped the Mighty Red Eye. He said that once I was trained I would become the ruler of the tribe. He asked me if I wanted this. I thought about this for a second. I needed a family, so I agreed. It was the best decision I made at the time. The tribe treated me like a family. They filled me with knowledge of the world around me. I learned mathematics, literature, science and, the most important in my adult life, strategy. When I wasn\u2019t learning, I would be taught how to fight. The tribe was mostly peaceful, but if anyone attacked the tribe they needed to be prepared. I learned hand - to - hand, spears, swords, archery, all the weapons we had back then. By the time I was 17 (The age of adulthood) I had mastered everything the tribe had to teach me. A year later, the crown of leadership was given to me. I was so proud to see the faces of everyone I held so dear to my heart give me the most precious gift that could be given, Trust. Of course, hardship was sure to follow me, it always did. Many creatures attacked the tribe. I thought we should enslave the creatures, so that no one would dare cross us. It worked, but many people died. The first tragedy. Even with the beasts, many powerful clans wanted us dead, who knows why. Of course, none of them had the power of the eye to stand behind them, so they always lost. Over the years, all of the people that had welcomed me into the tribe had died in battle, or even just old age. I, however, didn\u2019t look a day over 25. Perhaps that was part of the Eye\u2019s gift. But, as the Eye planned, the tribe wasn\u2019t a tribe anymore. It was an empire! When I realized how massive the small tribe had become, I was so happy. But, after that, many people hated our ways. They thought we worshipped an evil cause and were satanists. That made me so angry! Many people went to war against us because of it. The worst was the Savior Massacre. A religious group thought that they had to \u201csave the people from the eye.\u201d They did this by sneaking in to our cities and killing people. That supposedly \u201crescued them from the eye\u201d. One day, a whole group snuck into the capitol and set fire to our gunpowder storage house. The following explosion wiped out half our city. When I walked down from my castle to see what was wrong, I was greeted with thousands of dead corpses. Some so mutilated you wouldn\u2019t know they were humanoids(we aren\u2019t exactly humans). Others looked to be children. People all over place were screaming for their loved ones, hoping that they had somehow survived! Not many were given that gift of happiness. That day, my eye throbbed and my heart turned cold with hatred. Hatred for all stupid people in the world. I swore that no one that cruel should be allowed to live. I gathered my armies and burned villages to the ground, anyone that I thought had betrayed life itself. Whenever I ended the lives of another creature, my red eye throbbed and I got a surge of happiness that I had avenged the death of my people. Then one day, I stabbed a man trying to put up a stand to me. I then looked in his house, and found a women holding a baby. She was crying for the death of the man. The man I killed was a father. \u00a0That was the day I realised, I was evil. I wasn\u2019t someone doing good, I was doing wrong. I gave the family one gold coin, then left. I didn\u2019t burn the village, I just left. Me and my army left. When I got back, I was so sad I knew I had gone to far, and couldn\u2019t turn around now. I had gone to far down the wrong path. I wanted so hard to be the good guy, but I couldn\u2019t, so I continued to be the same. I burned villages, slaughtered innocents, ended civilizations. I hated myself for a while, but then I thought \u201cIf their is no one else in the world, I can stop being evil.\u201d So that is my goal. As long as I am still standing, I will continue to be me. The man with the gift of the Eye.", "comment_date": "2015-07-01T22:35:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Miller", "comment_text": "Well at least their honest about their biases.", "comment_date": "2015-07-01T22:31:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Elvis Ardon", "comment_text": "All hail Adam Smith", "comment_date": "2015-07-01T22:30:55Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "BlazingBassman", "comment_text": "Finally all of my\u00a0 questions and roadblocks in economic classes will be answered.
