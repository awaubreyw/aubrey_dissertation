You are your own worst enemy when it comes to burnout.  You have these internal voices telling yourself that something HAS to be done, that you NEED this job, or that is just the way things work.  Some of those internal voices may be truthful, but you cannot KNOW this unless you confirm it.  Talk to your coworkers, bosses, other freelancers, other business owners.  Those internal voices may be lying to you or preying on your insecurities without you knowing it.  If there are outside voices telling you some or all of those things, either times are extraordinary or its a red flag.  Again, communication is key.  Talk to your boss and coworkers to understand why, talk to other bosses to confirm the why.  Once you understand where they are coming from, you can make the best decision for you.  Which might not be with your current boss or company.<br><br>Notice that I never included HR in this.  They are there for the company, not the employee.  They will only act if sufficient evidence is presented that this could be a long term problem for the company.  Most of the time, without a cost-benefit analysis in your favor, you could be the long term problem for going to HR.  If the company has a whistleblower hotline that is generally safer, but again the problem has to be &#39;worth it&#39;.  &#39;Worth it&#39; is generally smaller than most people expect, as re-training can be cheaper than increasing employee churn but for some companies it isn&#39;t.  My first employer out of college loved new college graduates, so did their best to weed people out by their fourth year with the company.  I stayed through till my fourth year, then left because they started stacking the responsibilities without increasing the incentives, salary, or positional power.
