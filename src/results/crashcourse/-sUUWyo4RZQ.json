Something similar happened to Chinese characters in printing, with the forms becoming more and more regular with straight lines until they looked very different from the forms written with a brush.

It is a prototypical example of an abugida, a category that has features of both an alphabet and a syllabary and is contrasted with both by specialists.

But I have never seen the Indic scripts referred to as syllabaries. Abugidas are also called alphasyllabaries, so maybe that&#39;s where the confusion came from.

Just take the standard version of English of the specific country and change its spelling. Dialect speakers can figure out how to spell their dialects on their own. I&#39;m German, and we had our last spelling reform in 2006. There are other countries that have German as one official language and they partly made other spelling reforms, like Switzerland that completely dropped the \u00df (it makes a ss-sound), unlike Germany German that just made a rule for when to use it, so you don&#39;t have to learn by heart when to put it, resulting in its use in partly other words than before. Speakers of other German dialects than the standard one are making rules to write their dialect, and there&#39;s even a Bavarian Wikipedia. So yeah, even if you just reform the spelling of standard English (of one country), it would already be great for learners. And who cares about small differences like runnin/running? We have something similar with verbs. E.g. fliegen (its means to fly). It&#39;s said as fliegn, so no one pronounces the second e, apart from cases like rennen (to run) where you have to use it to separate the nn and n.

Just looking at it is already so beautiful, but perhaps even cooler is how it works, and its flexibility.  Graphemes are arranged into word blocks, and most syllabograms have many different ways to write them.  What this means is that there are so many different ways to write the same thing, and they&#39;re all correct!  It&#39;s almost like making artistic choices, which probably isn&#39;t too far from the truth, historically speaking.  Ahtzib means both scribe and artist in (Classical?) Mayan.  There are also varying degrees of &quot;fanciness&quot; or formality you can write with.  Writing on stone (the most common surviving type iirc) is really a work of art, while more practical styles exist on pottery and somewhat in the 3 remaining codices.  Tho bc of this, it&#39;s been a slow process to digitize the system and make it typable, but eventually (I&#39;d guess certainly within our lifetimes) it should be possible!<br><br>Idk where to better fit this and don&#39;t like to end on a bad note, but it&#39;s important to acknowledge that conquistadors burning literally entire libraries of Maya writing, to the point that only 3 Mayan codices survive.  Even tho the Mayan civ(s) were already in decline by the time Europeans arrived, they are also the reason why Maya writing had to be deciphered in the first place.  Among other awful language policies, made sure that Maya scribes/scholars couldn&#39;t pass on how to write to following generations (tho in old Maya society only a small sliver of the population was literate, as often was the case in old literate societies, but ofc this doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s justified).

But a really important point: Whoa, you skipped right over Proto-Sinaitic. Phoenician wasn&#39;t where the letter B started. I get kind of miffed when people only go as far back as Phoenician. It also is dangerous to say that linguists are more focused on <i>how</i> people say something that being focused on <i>what</i> they&#39;re saying, because linguistics absolutely includes focus on understanding <i>meaning.</i> :/ In fact, I would say it is <i>more</i> important and more like a linguist to focus on meaning and nuances of language than on superficial form. I mean, otherwise, you get middle-school English teachers saying &quot;I don&#39;t know &#39;can&#39; you got to the bathroom&quot;, because they don&#39;t know what deontic modality is, nor than &quot;can&quot; has it. :s", "comment_date": "2021-01-22T21:55:25Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"-sUUWyo4RZQ": {"Writing Systems: Crash Course Linguistics #16": {"channel_id": "UgxEltia0EdJz8PntFV4AaABAg", "comment_by": "IsaacBTTF", "comment_text": "This was a really good and informative series.
