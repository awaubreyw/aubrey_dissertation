To start off, it is important to know that the further down a group you go, the larger the atomic radius of tment will be. That makes sense because there are more energy levels. Going across a period however, the atomic radius decreases. If you think about it, that makes sense too because the nucleus is increasing as you go further across because there are more protons and so the positive charge is getting stronger and therefore the relative size of the radius is smaller. Now, because the radius gets larger going downwards, that also means that the Ionization energy (the energy it takes to rip away an electron) as well as the electronegativity (how much an element wants an electron) will both decrease because the force of attraction is weaker with a larger radius and so it is easier to rip away electrons and the crave for electrons decreases. Therefore, the opposite happens going across a period because the radius is getting smaller and therefore the attraction force is stronger and it becomes harder to rip away electrons and elements crave electrons more. That is why in a reaction, the nonmetals always gain electrons rather than lose them. Because they have small radius with a large force of attraction to pull in electrons from other elements. Obviously metallic characteristics decrease going across because they go from being metals to metalloids to nonmetals and it increases going down, following the properties of the atomic radius. Now an ionic radius is different because when metals, for example, form bonds with nonmetals, because metals tend to give their electrons to the nonmetals, they form ions with a positive charge because they have lost electrons and have more protons now, and therefore they form smaller ionic radiuses because of the loss of electrons. The nonmetal that receives the electrons become larger in radius (the ionic radius) because it forms a negative ion since it has more electrons now. Another important idea to have is that the elements that are the most reactive are the ones that either really want electrons or really want to give up electrons. Therefore, the elements that have one valance electrons, which really want to give it up, and the elements that have seven valance electrons, which really want another one, are the most reactive of all the elements.That is the basic sense of the trends of the periodic table. It is all based upon the radius and you can make a lot of conclusions with that knowledge.", "comment_date": "2013-11-27T18:36:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Reda Koraichi", "comment_text": "Could you make a video on the trends of the periodic table?
