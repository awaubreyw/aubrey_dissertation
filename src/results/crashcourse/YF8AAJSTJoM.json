This set a record here because we&#39;re six weeks early for this kind of weather where I live. What happened to global warming? Since the Earth has been cooling every year in the last five or ten years the term global warming doesn&#39;t fit that narrative. Now it&#39;s called climate change. Notice that even after this bloggers video started by saying that the warm spells and cold spells our planet has cycled through for as long as we&#39;ve been on the Earth is normal. Notice he&#39;s careful to say that THIS cold spell that is beginning now is our fault. Stop being brainwashed! The Sun is now in a phase where there is low sun spot activity. This has happened for millions of years. There&#39;s years of high sun spot activity which makes our planet warmer until the sun cycles into low sun spot activity that cools our plant down. This is where we are now. It&#39;s normal and not the fault of humans living on the planet now. Global warming and or climate change is part of the elites agenda. They want to tax all the oil products we use to line their own pockets, using the excuse that the state of the climate is our fault. This makes the tax hike more palatable for people who have been spoon fed this global warming BS for the past twenty years or more. Look at France right now. Their President is very progressive and began taxing the people on their energy use including gasoline prices. The tax on gas in France is so high regular people can&#39;t afford to drive themselves to work along with heating their homes. The French people have been demonstrating for months since the taxes were implemented. It&#39;s been kept quiet in our USA news because their goal is for all people pay these ridiculous taxes.

In the 17th century britian began to monopalise in our colonialism in the americas and in east India. We also brought about better agricultural techniques and created a new agricultural revolution. We also had a huge increase in population. Our population doubled from 2.5 million in 1600 to 5 million in 1688. We also found a decrease in disease and a better isolation of disease to stop any epidemics. The lesser gentry (the middle class) were also on the rise in this period with the rise of merchants and professions who became MP (members of parliament) later on in life showing their gain in power and influence. In fact in 1649 we decided that we wanted a republic and got rid of our King in favour of the gentry. In 1653 Cromwell a member of the lesser gentry became the lord protector of britian. Britian enjoyed a stable economy through out the 17th century. This completely contrasts to the evidence you show in this video. I believe the reason for this is that britian was able to fall back on imperialism to secure the economy when many other countries were unable to.", "comment_date": "2016-05-19T23:03:51Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "Charlie Wilson", "comment_text": "Did anyone see the avatar go across the screen at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF8AAJSTJoM&amp;t=5m12s\">5:12</a>", "comment_date": "2016-05-19T13:53:01Z", "likes_count": 133}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Drum", "comment_text": "Ahem, the Gulf Stream, ahem.", "comment_date": "2016-05-15T16:38:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kori114", "comment_text": "Ehhhhhhh!!", "comment_date": "2016-05-12T07:13:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Louis Mastrangelo", "comment_text": "It&#39;s a good thing they had all those gas sucking, CO2 producing cars back in the little ice age so they could drive to places where there was more food and better climate.

Yes humans are compounding the problem with carbon and methane emissions etc   but I think it is also because it is just part of nature. We always experience Little Ice Ages and Warm Periods and go back and forth between the two. But we haven&#39;t had super accurate temperature records over the last 2,000 years and we are used to the &quot;cooler&quot; temperatures of the times of the Little Ice Age and the in-between periods, which is where we have been over the last 300 years or so and now we are moving more and more into this warm period. But we do not remember the last time we was in a Warm Period because that happened in the Medieval times, from 950-1250.<br><br>Then there was a fluxing period in-between for 50-100 years and then there was the Little Ice Age from 1350-1850....  then there was another 100 year flux that we lived in and are used to, but we are now moving further into another 300 year Warm Period and everyone is freaking out. In short, we are probably assigning too much blame on human activity because humans like to think we are number 1 at everything, including destroying the planet. Temperatures will likely rise for the next 100 years, then they will level off over the next 100, and then start to drop again 100 years after this. So by 2200 we will be back to the same temperatures we were used to pre-1990&#39;s.

But when wasn\u2019t much of Europe plagued by hunger, war or rebellion (or plague)? 1520-60 was hardly a time of peace either (German peasant and religious wars, Valois vs Habsburgs in Italy, Habsburgs vs Ottomans in Hungary, uprisings in England, coups in Scotland), or 1420-60 (last phase of the Hundred Years War, the Hussite war in Bohemia, fall of Constantinople, the Thirteen Years war in Prussia \u2013 we\u2019re going to use up all the multiples of years eventually). As for 1320-60, the less said the better: now that\u2019s a general crisis.<br><br>China of course had it especially bad in the century\u2019s middle decades, as did Germany in the second quarter and Poland in the third, but Europe\u2019s trade with Asia surged to 1680 after slumping in 1620-40, when we might expect it to have languished in the doldrums throughout. The commercially-sensitive business capitals of London and Amsterdam added 200,000 between them, and Lisbon, Nantes and Stockholm shared in the good times: even Dublin grew amid successive national traumas. Away with this &quot;general crisis&quot;! There were crises aplenty, but none was &quot;general&quot;. We might as well speak of a &quot;general crisis&quot; of conflict, instability, famine and disease extending from the Bronze Age to the 20th century.<br><br>I don\u2019t know where that claim about half of Scots men (that\u2019s around 150,000 people) emigrating in the first half the 17th century comes from: it sounds a bit over the top to me. There were many Scots on the Continent, it\u2019s true \u2013 as many as 50,000 of them fighting in the 30 Years War (many of whom doubtless returned to relate their adventures), perhaps a similar number (including some of the same former soldiers) engaged in trade, others just fleeing hunger at home, notably in the 1620s \u2013 and doubtless a good number in England (besides the odd military foray into England or Ireland). But\u00a0the Plantation of Ulster was a rather slow affair until the &quot;ill years&quot; of the 1690s (when something of the order of 50,000 moved), and emigration to the Americas only took off from the 1760s.

The Little Ice Age greatly \u00a0impacted human social orders, especially during the 17th century. When the climate changed, and weather became unpredictable, the world changed profoundly. Poor harvests led to hunger, which led to even less productivity, which even resulted in violent upheaval in a lot of places. All this from a little change in the temperature?

No Deluge ? :C Man that thing was directly influenced by The Little Ice Age and quite a big deal in itself, shifting the balance of that part of Europe (kudos for mentioning Asian troubles). The Swedes faced a diminishing crop yields and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was one (if not the) biggest crop producers (in Europe) of that time. Look at the treaties: ceding control of Polish and Prussian ports to the Swedes - places where crops were sold. And Baltic froze so you could travel, by horse, through it (they even made small taverns along the way). Changing prices of crops led indirectly to Ukrainian uprisings.<br>Side-note : Global Warming is a scam. We, humans, have a big influence on our planet, but not that big. The cycles of solar activity (sun spots) are indifferent to human activity. Technology behind controlling the emission of warming fumes, and alternate energy is in hands of the Western countries. Thus it can be cashed for. Kyoto protocols were not signed by neither the US or China, wonder why... Also one eruption of a volcano (such as those in Iceland) releases more gases than humanity can in couple of years. And volcanos are still emitting gases when they are &quot;sleeping&quot;. Not to mention, and excuse me but I must say this, cattle farts.<br>Still a great video.
