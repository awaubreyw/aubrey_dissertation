Conservatives are classic liberals or more accurate Locke liberals. The father of Liberalism and Republicanism. They believe in individualism. They started in the 30s as opposition to FDR&#39;S New Deal and Alphabet soup seeing it as Marxism. Marx was a student of Rousseau and Hegel the rivals of Locke and Smith.<br><br>The abortion is not simply due to religion. Conservatives trace their ideology from Thomas Paine (student of Locke), John Locke and Adam Smith. For the most part Conservatives believe in securing the blessings of liberty. <br><br>Thomas Paine gave Americans the goal of no government as progressive. The day society would no longer need government.  When FDR called him a filthy little Athiest (Paine&#39;s policies were getting popular again since the Revolution), Conservatives rallied behind it. This is why they are also big on Americanism and why 90% of the military is or becomes conservative when they are veterans.<br><br>Paine gives the Conservatives the idea of a small government and strong defense (he rallied the colonies). This is why the conservatives aim to slash or reduce spending and love the military and veterans. It is Also a key reason why they are for state and individual sovereignty.<br><br>John Locke wrote the 2 treatises of government and the laws of Natural Rights that gives us the role of government and the best way to recognize what is a right:<br><br>Life: All have the right to live; only murderers forfeit their right.<br>Liberty: All have the right to expression uncoerced; as long as it doesn&#39;t  violate the first.<br>Estate: All have the rights of property from the fruits of thier own labors, by gift  or mutual trade, uncoerced; as long as it doesn&#39;t violate the first two.<br><br>He is also the father of modern Republicanism. This alone is why Conservatives are against abortion  as it is life and wrong to take using scientific evidence to life to protect the unborn under Article 1 section 8, clause 8 to enact laws to protect them. After Roe v Wade, Christians and other religious groups rallied to Conservatives and is why McGovern lost (His former running mate claimed he was for &quot;Acid [drugs], Amnesty[draft dodger pardons], and Abortions&quot;). But it would be Raegan that made the south Republican. They also believe that the right of expression is paramount and that morality has a purpose. This is often misleading for being for Theocracy. They also believe in the concept &quot;I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend your right to say it, as long as you don&#39;t violate the rights of others. This is often why they are mistaken for racists. They fear the concept of dictated speech. Its tricky here because there are times when the ultrareligious conservatives do tend to blur the line when it comes to violence and vulgarity restrictions. They are concerned with the possibility of it being a call to violence.<br><br>Adam Smith is the Father of Capitalism and free markets. Smith taught a poor man can dream and make something of himself under a free  market. Voluntary Charity, not altruism, is the proper way to fight poverty. Charity is a investment in the life of someone who is trying to better themselves and should be helped. Not all will do so.<br><br>Here Smith gives the value of hard work Conservatives believe in. They see taxes as an investment and payment for services only the government can do. It makes them seem cruel to the poor and favor the rich. It was Conservatives who gave tax breaks for giving to charity (401c). They believe that the market should be free to run itself and also with Locke&#39;s philosophy, believe this is the best way to fight environmental problems. It makes them seem like climate deniers when in reality with the principles of the other two the do not believe that the government is effective at it and a poor investment.<br><br>Conservatives used to see Liberals as friends with a different view. They were similar and craved a chance to debate and strengthen their beliefs. Conservatives however do not like Progressives seeing them as Authoritarian or worse Totalitarians. As Liberals grew more towards Progressive, the Conservatives began to lose compassion for them.<br><br>I&#39;m a Comanche and a Libertarian Conservative. Mainly because I&#39;m a veteran but also because of the fact government didn&#39;t help my tribe and when I left the reservation I was able to get out of poverty and am now a business owner. Not because of my parents.

Currently the average leverage rate among the 5 main banks producing 90% of the country&#39;s money supply is at 35 to one; and at the FED it is between 70 and 80 to one.  These rates are not sustainable and will either water down the money supply making for high inflation; or they will make for a scarcity or an unavailability for many items like housing, food, automobiles, college tuition, and so on. To bad leverage is not part of their discussions; because to high of a leverage rate under any political philosophy from either the conservative right or the liberal left will blow either philosophy right out of  the water.", "comment_date": "2018-12-31T04:42:50Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"j_k_k-bHigM": {"Political Ideology: Crash Course Government and Politics #35": {"channel_id": "Ugx-l_11V80xFksDS8Z4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Jess", "comment_text": "Great video", "comment_date": "2018-12-31T01:09:09Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"j_k_k-bHigM": {"Political Ideology: Crash Course Government and Politics #35": {"channel_id": "UgwVk_ywKvG8xX1QRWp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "rAdHominem", "comment_text": "Sowell &gt; Chomsky", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T22:42:38Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"j_k_k-bHigM": {"Political Ideology: Crash Course Government and Politics #35": {"channel_id": "UgwSUbF6QQXhuXFYKUR4AaABAg", "comment_by": "donkey", "comment_text": "I feel like the Left argues actual points where the Right is much more intent on destroying the Lefts points rather than making there own that&#39;s why i&#39;m more left", "comment_date": "2018-12-30T04:29:48Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"j_k_k-bHigM": {"Political Ideology: Crash Course Government and Politics #35": {"channel_id": "UgyQWwj7_MDM98rwGTl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Giorno Giovanna", "comment_text": "Liberals: The nation needs more state control and equality.<br>Conservatives: The nation needs less government control and individual rights.<br>Me: <b>Upset the established order, and everything becomes CHAOS.</b>", "comment_date": "2018-12-29T07:59:31Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"j_k_k-bHigM": {"Political Ideology: Crash Course Government and Politics #35": {"channel_id": "UgxNUGmYOc8Wbq_GKo14AaABAg", "comment_by": "Lisa Wood", "comment_text": "My Daughter\u2019s 4th grade teacher said Trump was keeping bad people out with the wall: being children in the PNW they all argued with her\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd73. <br>And I grew up in the 80\u2019s I thought Regan was a dope the whole time I still shake my head at America choosing Regan over Carter", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T05:48:05Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"j_k_k-bHigM": {"Political Ideology: Crash Course Government and Politics #35": {"channel_id": "UgwdSa95ztrddm-fgs94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Kalle Lellac\u00e9vej", "comment_text": "So why would I want taxes to be higher than they already are?

So a progressive would be completely on board with liberals in making Detroit schools better. They would also take affirmative action even further, and would support quotas demanding a certain amount of people based on their identity to be accepted into a school.<br><br>The train of thought on where these two areas of thought disagree relates to the concept of the American dream itself.

Instead of spreading the help out to the symptoms or the outcome, more effort to even out the opportunity would make the American dream alive again. <br><br>Imagine a world with completely equal quality of schools for all. Crime rates the same in rich and poor communities, and programs given to the less fortunate to allow poorer kids the same <b>*opportunities*</b> as their richer peers. <br><br>America would be based on hard work and character.

Both Democrats and Republicans (in practice) fall into the right-authoritarian quadrant, there is pretty much no representation of left, or libertarian, values in our government, even though much of the country would support these ideas.

You can test this hypothesis. The liberal coalition government added $8 trillion in debt during Obama&#39;s\u200b two terms. Did $8 trillion dollars of government spending create universal equality? If not, did it bring us measurably closer to it? Did it solve any major social issue? How much more money should be spent? Is unlimited spending sustainable? Now ask yourself the following: Can government be accountable to spend money in an effective and responsible way and be trusted not to waste it or reward themselves? What are the conditions which, when met, will mean that the goal of equality has been reached? Do different people perform and strive for different things with different levels of success?

In conclusion, my personal opinion on legalizing marijuana for recreational use is a rather skeptical one however, if individual states wish to follow such a path then those states should be free to do so. All the same, if other states wish to ban recreational use then the wishes of those states should be respected as well. As for medical reasons, if research provides sufficient evidence that using marijuana helps to benefit individuals who suffer from various ailments, then I would be in favor of legalization of marijuana as a prescription drug as everyone deserves fast and effective medical treatment to fight off whatever sickness they may have so that these same people can continue to live normal everyday lives not being confined to a hospital bed.", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T14:59:29Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"j_k_k-bHigM": {"Political Ideology: Crash Course Government and Politics #35": {"channel_id": "Ugj-tO6pq7Emy3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Domenico Saviano", "comment_text": "he only listed white Catholics on the conservative side.

There&#39;s no reason that someone who supports social welfare has to be pro-choice. Political ideology is just a lie created by political parties to divide society and rally support to win elections. The ideas of &quot;liberalism&quot; and &quot;conservatism&quot; is just a method political parties use to manipulate people into becoming permanent supporters in order to get people from their party elected into a position of power. Liberals and conservatives are quick to call each other close-minded and intolerant, but they fail to recognise that their own inability to attempt to understand the motives of the other and are quick to label the other as &quot;wrong&quot;, &quot;racist&quot;, &quot;immoral&quot;. They do everything they can to prove that they are right while the other is wrong. They love it whenever the other does something they feel is wrong. This is what I would expect from 5 year olds, not grown adults given the power to make the decisions for their country. The founding fathers warned about the potential dangers of two powerful opposing parties as well as the danger of sectionalism. The two major parties should have been able to co-exist peacefully, the way a democracy should. But no. Less than a century later, a civil war erupted between two opposing beliefs, each dominated by a powerful party. And in the present, we have two factions, using fear the brainwash people into antagonising the opposing party. The country is called the <b>United</b> States and its flag has 50 identical stars, one for each state. Yet its map has 30 red states and 20 blue states. Colours which often represent opponents are now being applied to a nation that is supposed to be united, yet its divided. The purpose of democracy is to make people happy, but it&#39;s created so much hate. To be clear, I don&#39;t dislike the idea of political parties, but the labels &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;conservative&quot; don&#39;t give us real freedom. We can&#39;t vote for different parties every four years because then we&#39;ll have no friends because people can&#39;t accept others who don&#39;t vote for their party.

Is it like with everything that you Americans tend to just do your own thing concerning definitions and units for a basis of discussion? Because as far as I am informed, those definitions of political ideologys given in the video are completely wrong, since they are confused with each other. There are actually three basic political ideologies:<br><br>1) Conservative/Right: The main principle is maintaining traditions and old values. Therefore conservatives propose strong authorities and a more or less free market with some regulations. They often oppose immigrations, multiculturalism and basically all form of radical &quot;new thinking&quot;, since it does not fit with the <b>supposed</b> national and hierachic nature of humans. <br><br>2) Liberal/Libertarian: The main principle is aiming for a maximum of economical and individual freedom. Therfore liberals propose a minimalistic state government not intervening in the dynamics of the free market, but securing law and order towards both, the inside and the outside of the country. Libertarians even propose the absecence of a state in general and imagine a society fully shaped and kept in order  by the principle of the &quot;invisible hand&quot; of the radical free market. <br><br>3) Socialist/Communist/Left: The main principle is aiming for justice and/or equality. Therefore the state should be empowered to enable a more just society by regulating the free market by, for example, regulating big corperations, imposing taxes on the rich, enabling social health care and other social policies etc. etc. Capitalism is seen as the root for inequality and must therefore be regulated or, for communists, even be abolished and replaced by a classless society without private property. <br>While some socialists aim for a planned economy, others aim for a anarchic type of &quot;share-economy&quot;. <br><br>Basically there are different variations for each ideology, but these are the three general ideologies, on which one can build on further political and philsophical positions. <br><br>Could someone explain to me, why this video, or American society in general, has these concepts so confused? They are actually meaning the opposite of what the guy in the video is claiming.

They are on the right side of the economic political spectrum. They are all for Capitalism. Sure Progressives favor regulating the Capitalist system to protect workers, consumers, and the environment from the Market place, while Libertarians, Anarcho-Capitalists, and many Conservatives don&#39;t favor those things, because they favor a more free market system, as all those ideologies are for private ownership of the means of productions. That is one of the main criteria of being right wing. They are not left wing ideologies like Socialism, Communism, and Social Anarchism. Those ideologies that are left wing, or are on the left side of the political spectrum, are political ideologies that are for overthrowing private ownership of the means of production and handing business ownership over to the workers and letting them decide their own industrial economic fate together. Any ideology on the right side of the political spectrum favors some degree of inequality. This includes Progressives, because they support Capitalism, which breeds poverty and an upper class. Also most Conservatives like a large government. They love Social Security and Medicare, and they want the government to increase the minimum wage. Also for conservative reasons Conservatives want the government to be big so they can infringing on the rights of others and they, for conservative reasons, want a strong and large military which means increase the size of government. I will say you didn&#39;t do a terrible job. I just don&#39;t agree with you fully on how you covered these ideologies.

We belong to no bought political party as most Republicans and Democrats do. Socially &quot;Liberal&quot; while we are economically &quot;conservative,&quot; allowing for a flourishing free market society unencumbered from Federal restraint. People really have this ideology misinterpreted saying this type of economic freedom often leads to fixed markets and rigged economies, but Libertarianism&#39;s main creed is based off the &quot;  Non-Agression Principal,&quot; meaning we are allowed to do whatever we like, live how ever we want, so long as we don&#39;t infringe on anyone else&#39;s rights or liberties. Thus, putting some authority in the Federal government to protect those rights and liberties. Unfortunately, we live in a rigged economy where true the free market hasn&#39;t flourished in decades. This has a lot to do with illegal practices and special interests setting legislation for their benefit. If you are unsure what you believe or where you line up politically, I urge you all to give Libertarianism a peak.

We should also spend that money on improving medicine so that midwives are more properly trained to deliver the baby so that the woman is much less likely to die giving birth and also to fund research of better methods of C-sections, especially ones where the woman does not die giving birth (via C-section obviously, since that is the topic) in types of pregnancies where the woman will certainly die without this new C-section (if this already exists, please tell me below and cite a source). I mean, Chile did some or all of these and their maternal mortality rate dropped significantly! I don&#39;t know if they do all of these, but I do know for sure that they funded better training and better [word] education (fun fact: their maternal mortality rate is lower than the maternal mortality rate in the US.

In a rural area, spending would be less and the effects would be more subtle even if people received benefits from government programs and payed taxes in equal proportions. In areas with high population densities more people would equal more money and therefore a greater tangible impact of government spending in the form of large infrastructure projects, large universities, public transportation and public spaces. Also, living in close proximity to people who are of diverse ethnicities, incomes and disability status, you&#39;re more likely to encounter people who have a legitimate need for public assistance and have at least a more nuanced view of how public assistance should work.

Other political leanings include libertarians, who put freedom above all else, being split into the left and right schools based on which they rank second, order or equality (order for right libertarians, equality for left libertarians); socialists, who value equality over order and order over freedom; and communatarians, who value order over equality and equality over freedom. In addition, there are those that believe in only one of these functions of government, ignoring the others: anarchists, who believe in extreme freedom; authoritarians, who only care about maintaining order (this is where most pre-modern governments would fall, especially feudal ones; it is, unsurprisingly, unpopular with everyone except the ruling class), and Marxists, who only care about equality (note: while every &quot;Communist&quot; nation claims to be Marxist, in practice, they invariably end up being authoritarian, or, at best, communatarian.
