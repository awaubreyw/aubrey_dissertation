If a blind person asked me what green was I would say sour or gross, that taste in your mouth after you throw up a little is green. One could agregue that plants aren\u2019t those things but I was a curious kid and grass tastes green for sure and there\u2019s a reason some kids don\u2019t like spinach and not to be repetitive but I think it has to do with the gross (green). If they asked me what red looks like I would say hot, angry, spicy \ud83c\udf36, if blue then I would take them to the beach and let them feel the tide in their feet and say \u201cthat is blue\u201d and if they say \u201cblue is cold\u201d I would say \u201cyes.\u201d The only one I can\u2019t really describe too well is hello. Black would be the easiest. Black is nothing, absence of color, and emptiness. Black is a big room with nothing in it with lights off and all you can tell from what you don\u2019t see is that you exist in this space with no direction. It\u2019s interesting that in pitch black we are consciously aware of ourselves and nothing else but when we sleep and have dreams we become very unaware of our own being until we can lucid dream. In a sense white is everything. If you shine light in something it has color. If you shine an extremely bright light on anything it would look white. So as black is absence white is creation and existence. In a poetic way a person in a dark room is the white because our own consciousness of ourselves intensifies the emptiness around us but also the awareness of ourselves.

Roan", "comment_text": "Before finishing the first minute of  the video I would say that a game is any activity that allows us to engage in using our brain in a different way than we would going throughout our day. After all a game comes with a goal therefore your brain is constantly figuring out how to play that game better and making little adjustments until eventually you get so used to swiping that it no longer matters how fast temple run goes. You just play until you\u2019re board and once you\u2019re board it\u2019s no longer an engaging activity and you need a different game. Just like walking. When we learn to walk and run our body has to have that sense to balance our shift in weight until eventually we don\u2019t even worry about falling anymore and if we start to we immediately know how to adjust and some people go to the next level with sports that require agility or incredible balance like figure skating or maybe dancing. I think games just a way exercise the brain and our human itch to compete wether it be against ourself, others, or the terms out in front of us like a diamond block behind a creeper and skeleton on the other side of a lava lake in Minecraft. Challenge Accepted. And then our brain just kicks into strategy mode if we decide to focus on the goal. So really any activity that you don\u2019t do instinctively can\u2019t be turned into a game if that\u2019s what you decide to do. For example running is not a game. It\u2019s a sport but humans can already run when they need to so it\u2019s not engaging unless you buy stipulations on it that don\u2019t necessarily have to accompany running like racing to a certain point. Just because you run doesn\u2019t mean you know where you\u2019re going so you can\u2019t compete as if it\u2019s a game but once you lie down the frame work as to what you are competing for then that\u2019s what leads to you trying to figure out how to do it the best you need to in order to get the desired outcome. In humans the staring game is a game although humans look at things all the time we don\u2019t willingly focus on staring longer than someone else for the most part. If you played the staring game with a dog you would be the only one playing because that dog has no idea what it\u2019s apart of but the fact that you\u2019re doing that for entertainment is what makes it a game for you and not for the dog. If you play tug of war with a dog then most people are actually playing a different game. We are trying to get the dog as excited as we can because we think that\u2019s fun. The dog is trying to get the toy. If we were playing tug of war it wouldn\u2019t be much of a game because most humans can hold on to whatever it is no matter what the dog does and all it takes for us is a quick hard yank and the dog loses. That\u2019s not very engaging at all. That\u2019s like saying the goal of the rain game is to get wet by rain. That\u2019s going to happen already. This isn\u2019t a very coherent point Im making and I feel like it could\u2019ve been simpler but this is a comment not a essay for my professor. People don\u2019t have to get it. I know what I mean when I say what a game is.", "comment_date": "2019-10-03T04:36:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hareesh Nair", "comment_text": "Chom choms. Yes.

Some people obviously are literally &amp; figuratively color blind, but the majority of the world agrees on whether certain combinations match or not.  If one&#39;s definition of black is actually magenta to soneone else but their definition of red is the same, then what one perceives as &quot;matching&quot; colors would be non-matching to the other.  This is rarely the case, which suggests that, scientifically,  we all do, in fact, perceive colors in a similar fashion.  This is within a certain spectrum, of course, because the wave nature of light itself demands that we define colors within a band of wavelengths (in nanometers for color).

Someone who recognizes how crazy language is!  The fact we can speak to one another is positively straight up insane.  The more you look into it, the crazier it gets.  Although I would dispute the idea that we can&#39;t know that our subjective experiences are the same, but I don&#39;t believe I could reach the level of proving it.  Brains are not as different as most would suppose.  And our senses directly imprint our experience of reality on our brains in ways which do not differ much.  When you see an &quot;A&quot;, there is a literal pattern of neurons exactly in the shape of an &quot;A&quot; which light up.  That&#39;s just where the optic nerve connects, and it gets more complicated from there, but I think that suggests that the chances our subjective experiences differ significantly (at least for those of us raised in similar environments) are small.<br><br>Back to how crazy language is, though.  I say &quot;apple&quot; to you, and you picture an apple.  I am able to project a pattern of neural activity into your brain.  By vibrating meat parts in my mouth and throat.

The only point I&#39;d wish was covered, though so much was covered it&#39;s easy to see why it might not have been, is the inability to perfectly translate meaning between languages. If meaning is defined by language communities, then there are no objective definitions to pin words down universally with. What I call &quot;leg&quot; in my linguistic community is a limb segment going from my hip to my ankle excluding my foot, while in another linguistic community the word that gets translated to mean &quot;leg&quot; includes the foot or can even be used to refer exclusively to the foot and not the limb it&#39;s attached to, while &quot;hip&quot; is used to mean buttox, not the highest point of the joint that limb is attached to.<br><br>Which probably sounds really pointless and academic, but it&#39;s really important for at least two reasons: 1) it means that computer translation is almost always going to be imperfect for translating between historically-separated language communities, and 2) it means that the ways we take for granted for how the world is defined and organized are really far more culture-bound than most people realize.", "comment_date": "2016-08-30T01:19:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jameson Moore", "comment_text": "Flashbacks to Frindle.", "comment_date": "2016-08-30T01:18:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SomeguynamedMark", "comment_text": "If the rules are changable when aquiring the meaning of something, than does meaning even exist?

I see 1871 Germany&#39;s annexation of Alsace-Lorraine, Nazi Germany&#39;s annexation of Sudetenland, and even the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, all on the backs of some commonality in language as a test for culture/nationality. Noticeably, my top 3 examples are arguably despotic, but these language-based nationalistic accumulations don&#39;t seem flawed on the exterior, except, of course, that they remove self-determination as the primary mechanism of nationality. At first I think of English, but I don&#39;t see the UK trying to rebuild its empire on the backs of every english speaking nation in the world. Same with France. Though, I doubt England will look fondly on Scotland when they try to separate and stay in the EU (i foresee arguments of common language and culture to persuade them). So I come back to: is language the foundational basis of culture and thus nationality? Reflexively, I say no. But that may be my American [multi-cultural loving] bias showing.
