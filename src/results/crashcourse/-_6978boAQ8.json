Of course, with all political elements, the reasons for Brexit are deep and complex (and I am sure will be debated for the rest of time).

Cultures which often have long standing prejudicial, arguably racist, disrespect for European culture.  Europe has been a colony of Asian and African empires in the past, it&#39;s not invincible, and is not immune to slow cultural conquest, the eventual re-writing of it&#39;s history, and the erasure of it&#39;s past. <br><br>As the child of an immigrant, I can still totally understand why Europe would want to secure itself against open displays of colonialism by some immigrants, such as the open promotion of extremist religion.  This unfortunately also gets conflated with anti-Jewish conspiracies and crass unscientific fixations on skin colour by some far right extremists.  But I think the two issues are separate, and are unfortunately rarely addressed separately.  That there might be a good case for cultural conservation, separate from racism.<br><br>Exactly why should Europeans accept immigrants bearing hostile ideologies, ideas and cultural beliefs, who bear a system with an open disregard for their civil rights?  You make it sound like it&#39;s obviously right, but really no culture has any obligation to house another if the other makes no secret of it&#39;s contempt.  If immigrants refuse to respect their fellow citizens or the institutions that are housing and educating them, why should they be uncritically accepted, to the potential damage of those very institutions? <br><br>In game theory, if one player chooses to play dirty, the others are forced to reciprocate, collapsing agreed mutuality.  I think you would find most British voters had no problem with most immigrants.  Just the cultural attitudes that led to the frankly horrific gang violence against British women in Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, etc, or the terrorist attacks that killed hundreds, not over any noble cause of freedom, but simply because the victims were religious untermensch.  Other civilizations like India, China and Japan are equally at risk, and arguably share a common cause with the west.  Some immigrants genuinely want to assimilate, so I hope the far right does not transform this into a race issue, and lock out all those who genuinely wish to participate in the grand enterprise of scientific and philosophical truth that started with Plato and Aristotle.  Sadly I fear Huntington was right; the wars of the 21st century will be a Clash of Civilizations, as ancient rival ethical systems find they cannot abide each other&#39;s most fundamental assumptions on dignity, human freedoms, the nature of reality, the search for truth, or the place of the individual.
