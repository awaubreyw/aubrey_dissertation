I teach Film History and it absolutely aggravates me every time the history of sound-on-film is neglectful.  First off, THANK YOU for mentioning Tri-Ergon -- our German trio was the first successful system (1919).  Everyone else ignores them.  (There was also a Finnish inventor who did something similar.)  Very good.  However, due to concerns that their invention was affected by &#39;Bolshevist&#39; ideas, it was rejected in Germany and they sold their patents to Fox.  Lee De Forest -- yes, the Father of Radio -- was a pirate and a liar.  His idea was strangely similar, yet he DID NOT HAVE the amplification necessary with his audion tube.  It was American inventor THEODORE CASE who shared his VERY successful sound-on-film design with De Forest via CASE&#39;S far better vacuum tube, BUT, De Forest presented his Phonofilm process WITHOUT CREDITING CASE whatsoever, yet all the equipment shown in the film showed Case&#39;s laboratory markings.  CASE was furious and withdrew his collaboration from De Forest and went elsewhere.  De Forest went broke trying to prove it was all his idea.  He spent the rest of his days declaring Sound-On-Film as his invention.  In 1959, the Academy mistakenly gave him a special Award for being the inventor of sound pictures.  BAH!  When Fox went into bankruptcy in the late 1920s, the patents of Tri-Ergon were given back to its inventors by the UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT.  By then, the German populace had gotten over the stupid &#39;Bolshevist&#39; fears and Tri-Ergon enjoyed exclusivity in its home country for more than 10 years.   As with any successful invention, there are always handfuls of claimants for the glory -- the U.S. Patent Office mentions how amazing it can be to have four separate inventors walk in with the same thing.  Henry Ford DID NOT INVENT the automobile -- &#39;twas another German, by the way -- but Ford is who most people mistakenly believe.  Henry Ford DID INVENT the assembly line that made building motorcars better.  Your lesson shown here is excellent EXCEPT for the omission of Theodore Case.
