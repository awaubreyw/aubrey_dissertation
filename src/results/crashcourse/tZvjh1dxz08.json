On the whole I think Marxist thought specifically is something that deserves extra critique when providing basic descriptions of economic schools of thought not the one which should have the most excuses made for it. To be fair not many critiques of supply side were made which is seen somewhat as adverse to Marxist beliefs today. Overall it is a good thing that you\u2019re doing educating people about the theory and my one critique is simply in the light handling of Marxism overall though thank you for taking the time to try to educate people more thoroughly.

He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labor (after deducting his labor for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labor cost.

You wont likely find more generous or philanthropic people within these groups. Voluntaryism in Action and other charities have sprouted from our political beliefs, showing that people working together without coercion can accomplish more in shorter times than what a state entity can do through decades of extortion and theft through taxation.

On this one in particular, I was a bit disappointed that it finished on neoclassical economics, as if this was the latest economic theory that we have developed. One of the comments in the video is that economic theory changes over time. We have moved - as H. Daly calls it - from an empty to a full world; and economic theory has not evolved to recognize this change. Natural resources have become the limiting factor (capital and labour being the limiting factor of the past). Neoclassical economics fails to understand this (since it assumes that natural resources can be substituted with human-made capital) and thus cannot help us allocate resources towards the new limiting factor. Furthermore, neoclassical economics - as well as other economic theories of the past - sees the economy as growing into the void rather than as a sub-system of the ecosystem, and thus fail to account for the opportunity cost of economic growth, i.e. ecosystem services (which, again, are the limiting factor today). My comment builds on ecological economics theory (different from environmental economics), which I was hoping the video would have mentioned. Ecological economics is - in my view - the economic theory of the present and future, as it helps us allocate resources better, which is what economic theory should help us with. Is there any chance you could produce a video on ecological economics?

They aren&#39;t, they work for their own interests. That leads to production which in his times, when people were concerned with the idea of global starvation was &quot;good&quot;, but isn&#39;t any more today. Why? Well environment for first instance. When you have people working egoisticly in their own interests, with priority to maximize their individual revenues, they will end up with neglecting effects of their actions as a whole, on the global level. That is why production does not equal &quot;good&quot;, not in our times at least, when problem is not that we have shortages of products, but that they are only available to rich people, who btw Adam Smith called masters of mankind and have seen as somewhat superior to... you.<br><br>The first question one ought to ask capitalist is whether he believes in democracy. Both Aristotle as well as your founding fathers knew that democracy inevitably ends up in comunism. That is because majority is poor and so they in long enough time will make laws that benefit them... socialism and if that last long enough for people to realise their belongings don&#39;t reflect their value... comunism. That is also why, your founding fathers made system in which it is your parliament that chose the president, not the regular people, but only rich folks. They didn&#39;t belive in the idea that people were equal in their rights to vote or influence policies, but rather that the more belongings you have, the more rights you have. That is of course against the basis of democracy. Equal rights. Maybe that is why slavery wasn&#39;t an isuue either, maybe that is why America today is an oligarchy, where rich, &quot;masters of mankind&quot;, decide for all the rest, (that is according to Princeton University, easy to find online, if one wishes to).<br><br>Going back to the &quot;history&quot;. Please my free market friends, can you tell me, do you think USSR would win the cold war if she was capitalist and USA was dividing her resources more equally among her citizens? Resources which USA had roughly 50% of the whole world&#39;s base, just after second world war, as well as inherited global net of sea strains after British, that let her control world&#39;s trade. As well as a country literally not touched by the second world war. Whereas Soviets had lost more soldiers than all other countries combined, were devastated by Nazi Germany (infrastructure, industry, population), and when it comes to projection of power ... they never even had warm water ocean port to begin with. Had you lost this cold war, you would be the biggest losers in the history of mankind, maybe after Persians losing to Macedonian&#39;s Alexander. They had no chance regardless of how they shared their resources, they simply didn&#39;t have enough to compete with you.<br><br>O and one more thing, my free market, free thinkers from Austrian school. Given it is easier to buy a company rather than start one, when you have money, how in the world wouldn&#39;t we end up in the monopoly if it wasn&#39;t illegal? How? When we all know it is the only end game everyone tries to achive. The only reason you have competition is because of the regulations, that prohibit it. Coke can&#39;t buy Pepsi, Microsoft and Apple will never merge, as long as they are too big, nighter will Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan. Without these restrictions we would already see many of these happening, because from strictly financial point of view advantages of becoming dominant on the market outweighs costs in the long run. Once you are in this position, you don&#39;t want others to come on your market and if you have the resources to stop them (buy, merge) you will. The same holds interindustrialy, meaning we would end up with one company the richest one, for everything. Free market is the monopoly, restraint only by regulations, our will. But then that will is what ends up in socialism, this is the natural direction, that is why your establishment, or &quot;masters of mankind&quot; as Smith would call them, would rather have you think, that it is your will to enjoy your share of YOUR OWN WORK, that is the main problem and never it is their greed.<br><br>Thank you for your time, I&#39;m happy to further discuss, or if I can recommend something of a great value...

Remember the circular flow of money from the first episode? If you examine it closely, you will find that businesses can&#39;t produce goods and services without labor i.e. common people. In a sense, the common people are producers too. Businesses and labor produce goods together and thus businesses compensate the labor for their help in the form of money. The people then use this money to buy the very goods they helped produce, loosely speaking. So what&#39;s happening is that businesses are indirectly sharing their goods with its labor i.e. the people. The whole economy is driven by this indirect sharing of production. But when robots finally replace all labor, businesses will no longer need to employ people i.e. share their produce with the people.

All these economic ideas were developed by private individuals and some were adopted and implemented by governments - but never in the exact form as they were conceived.  Keynes idea was for governments to kick start a stalled economy by injecting money into the system through infrastructure works that the private sector would not do - like roads, libraries etc but when the private economy showed signs of life through investment projects Keynes said the government should withdraw its involvement and increase taxes to repay the debts created by government investment. <br><br> I would say that the second bit - the taxing and repaying hard bit - has never been done because it is a vote loser.  Keynes was an English Liberal which is not like an American liberal.  He wanted people to be left alone to do as they please and only intervene in the economy when it got stuck.  The British Left have no economic heros except Marx, but his ideas frighten normal people so they adopted Keynes because he was English, had great prestige and he said governments should borrow to spend.  The Left have a tendency to ignore the bits they don&#39;t like and because so few people actually bother to understand economics they have been able to adopt Keynes, the &#39;state spender&#39; as their economic mascot.  The man is probably rolling in his grave at the misappropriation of his ideas but the dead, it seems, have no rights. <br><br>I used Keynes as an example of the way that all these ideas have been inappropriately applied and the others in this video could also be contested.  It is sometimes useful to consider what system would be in place if all governments everywhere were constitutionally barred from involvement in the economy [what would they do?].

The idea that that Marxists think society is about about workers and bosses is quite frankly wrong, while it is similar it is still not the correct way to explain the concept. To quote straight from the manifesto: &quot;The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles&quot;, while this is similar to the boss and worker you also have to take into consideration &quot;dialectical materialism&quot; where history is analyzed by that of the economic system of each society. There are two classes today, the bourgeoise and the proletariat. I know I am critiquing a small thing but none of the less it is wrong.<br><br>Furthermore this video explains as if socialism is a good thing and communism is a bad thing which I find quite funny as the goal of (Marxist) revolution is not establish communism, but socialism. Establishing a state that is a tool and weapon of the workers (because a state is and has been for quite some time something to preserve the interested of the &quot;ruling&quot; class). Socialism is a planned economy which has been shown to work and has provided (in the case of the U.S.S.R) &quot;full employment, guaranteed pensions, paid maternity leave, limits on working hours, free healthcare and education (including higher education), subsidized vacations, inexpensive housing, low-cost childcare, subsidized public transportation, and rough income equality.&quot; Most of us want these benefits, but capitalism has not been able to give them to us and won&#39;t. To go to a capitalist system and add more state control (still capitalist, crony or not) is not Marxism because Marxism is the workers owning the means of production. Having some socialistic benefits in a capitalist society is un-Marxist due to where do we get those benefits?

I think it&#39;s important for people to study Islam and see what it really has to offer instead of seeing it just as a religion, it has societal solutions as well like Islamic economic system. I&#39;ve tried to study and some major points underneath about the Islamic economical system <br>- Islam makes a distinction between needs and wants of people. Needs are provided by the state if you don&#39;t have money for it. These are a house, clothes, food/drink. Wants are extra&#39;s like luxurious stuff but people need to work to get these extra&#39;s. <br>- Dirham and dinar are used as currencies that avoids inflation. These are backed by gold and silver. <br>- Interest is forbidden and due to this people will not safe money in banks. Because of that money flow will be higher in the economy, more investments and more jobs. Basically it generates more economic activities.<br>- There is a zakat system(tax) that collects 2.5% every year on all the Muslims on their savings and not on their income comparing to the current system.\u00a0 <br>- If Zakat of 2.5% would be applied in this system on the 1% richest people in the world, this would solve the poverty problem for whole the world.\u00a0 <br>- 2.5% is being applied on unused wealth, not the wealth that has been used for investments because that causes economy to grow.\u00a0 <br>- Zakat is applied on money and goods that are not being used for one year into the economy.\u00a0 <br>- Children and parents are obligated to look after each other in comparison with capitalism they are not after 18 birthday of the child. <br>- Even for death person, society is obligated to pay their depths. Within the Islamic state the state will pay that persons depths if the family is not able to do so. Even if it is in the billions.\u00a0 <br>- Partners within a company (or shareholders) are all responsible for paying back the depth of a company that declared bankruptcy. Within capitalism shareholder will only lose their shares but are not liable for paying back the depth of the company. <br>- Within Islam system, companies will be from small to middle sized. Monopolies or big companies will be really difficult because there is no plc(private liability companies) or stock market. <br>- This causes of increases of competition , decreases the product price, and increases the quality of the product as well because of the competition. <br>- It is not allowed to privatize water, fuel, and other resources because it is the property of the people. Now a days big companies like shell, dp and other go to other countries, take out the resources, sell it and keep the money from it. <br>- The stock market will be eliminated by forbidding interest, privatizing of public resources (oil, gas, water etc..), monopolies etc.", "comment_date": "2016-08-21T08:40:07Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "Ugg-gz9QiQSlaHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "DJ Kin", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a Social Darwinist, I guess I&#39;m completely wrong cause this guy say so...", "comment_date": "2016-08-21T07:45:55Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "Ugh2l6hCuK7M2ngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Alex Zimmermann", "comment_text": "Malthus didn&#39;t say we would all starve and die off.

Everyone talks about the evils of capitalism during the Industrial Revolution, but fails to realize that it was a social, and economic revolution and the value excess provided by the Industrial Revolution VASTLY increased the well-being of the common man. <br><br>It&#39;s also worth mentioning the affect of economic policies such as &quot;protections&quot; which are very clearly demonstrated by the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846, the War on Drugs in the United States and world wide, and taken to their extremes in policies applied by Soviet block countries, and the USSR itself. <br><br>I&#39;ve read The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money and always found Keyne&#39;s original views to be far away to what we consider Keynesian policies now, and also couldn&#39;t help but notice a lack of fixed-pie outlook on value. That said...why could he not reconcile wealth creation as the solution to natural recession?<br><br>The classical example I&#39;ve always hears is A sells 5 units to B, B sells 5 units to C and C sells 5 units to A. A then for whatever reason forecasts a bear market, and decides to hold onto some of his assets. A then only sells 4 units to B, B can then only produce and sell 4 units, etc, etc. A creates a self-fulfilling prophesy, and sells less units next time, and the cycle goes on.<br><br>The problem with this is that there is nothing stopping a new contender from benefiting from the price raises that a stable demand and a lower supply create. That is, unless there is a State around to back up a barrier to entry such as licensing, or even a State backed monopoly. (Think pharmaceuticals or telecommunications.) <br><br>The Keynesian solutions seems to by nature require government to gold excess value in reserve, or use inflation as a way to rapidly acquire value in order to spend strategically. <br><br>I don&#39;t know about you, but I have a serious problem seeing the reserve option being practical. Not only because the value in reserve is just as susceptible to market failures as everyone else&#39;s money is, but also that States seem pretty much incapable of not spending money they have. Plus, slowly pulling money into that reserve is in itself going to put a strain on the market because government doesn&#39;t produce value, they only take it. (Sometimes by purposeful artificial inflation.)<br><br>The other option doesn&#39;t seem that great either. Inflation is a tax you don&#39;t have to vote for. When you inflate a currency to gain value, you&#39;re really just siphoning off value into your new currency from the pool of the old currency. You actually lose value, too, because of the cost of physical currency production, and the levels of bureaucracy that the money has to be funneled through in order to be spent. <br><br>I&#39;m a software engineer. I spend a lot of my time writing things called neural networks which are basic &quot;brains&quot; which learn based on input over time. Some applications of neural networks are search engines, advertisement placement, and stock trading.  One thing I notice about these AIs is that they perform very well within their programmed data-set, but always seem to perform less well than projected. The reason for this is that we&#39;re human, and can only identify so many variables to use as input to the AI. Keynesian spending is no different. Even though the market may not produce what you&#39;re expecting, it will always produce the optimal result based on what it was given. Even in the case of Keynesian spending, you&#39;re only manipulating the market so far as you can understand it&#39;s &quot;algorithm&quot; and you yourselves said that economics is not an exact science. <br><br>Supposing that you had a perfect reserve without these adverse affects, when you spend specifically you produce artificial demand that you will have to continue maintaining forever. It&#39;s a band-aid you can&#39;t take off. You&#39;re just delaying the inevitable failure, and making it worse by siphoning money stolen from other markets to sustain your chosen market.", "comment_date": "2016-07-12T19:56:56Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "Ugj6Bo0P8xjJgHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Oseburuwachukwu Abumchukwu Ezekwesili", "comment_text": "Why no discussion of third-way?", "comment_date": "2016-07-06T17:02:54Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "Ugj83S2MJUflk3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Pigou Hanhil", "comment_text": "Tsk...I guess I&#39;ll step in then<br><br>Main outtakes from the lesson:<br>1.

Austrian School Of Economics: by Friedrich Hayek And Ludwig Vonmises argued heavy state involvement has never produced results and regulations were problems. They rejected  all form of monetary and fiscal policies.<br><br>7. In that same vein, Milton Friedman and the Chicago School Of Economics advocated privatization of many functions which were assumed by the government.<br><br>8.

Politically, I&#39;m a Minarchist Libertarian. I believe the only legitimate role of government is to protect people&#39;s rights to their own person/property and to punish those who infringe on these rights of others These rights include infringements on individuals&#39; person/property such as murder, rape, theft, and fraud. The government protects against such infringements through law enforcement, a justice system, and a military. Everything else should be left to the people to decide for themselves. I do support lower taxes, but only after we get a few things taken care of. 1) Eliminate all illegitimate roles of government (everything except federal law enforcement, justice system, and military) which temporarily keeping taxes constant. 2) Use that additional tax revenue to pay off the national debt. 3) Then, eliminate all federal taxes and replace them with a single flat consumption tax that has one of the least negative impacts on economic growth of any tax, is fair to all, and also has exemptions on certain staple food items so as to not disadvantage the poor. Let me show what I mean with the numbers: The national debt is about $20 trillion. The 2015 budget had a total revenue of $3.8 trillion ($583 billion of which was borrowing). By far the largest of those three legitimate roles of government is military spending at $598 billion. Including the other two roles, let&#39;s say total legitimate expenditures amount to $700 billion. That leaves $2.517 trillion/year to pay off the national debt ($3.8 trillion minus $700 billion in legitimate spending minus $583 billion in additional borrowing; no more adding to the debt). $20 trillion divided by $2.517 trillion\u00a0means we would have the debt paid off in 7.95 years (about 2 presidential terms). Once we eliminated all illegitimate spending and the national debt, now would cut all federal taxes. They would be replaced with a single flat consumption tax. Americans spend about $10.7 trillion per year. The government would need to raise $700 billion. Also, we must account for those exemptions on staple food items. Let&#39;s say that reduces taxable spending to $8 trillion. $700 billion divided by $8 trillion means there would only be a single tax rate of 8.75% for everyone. However, this can be further reduced through making those few legitimate roles more efficient and effective. To start, I don&#39;t believe the military should be involved in any nation that we are currently not at war with. That makes the over $150 billion we spend on foreign military bases illegitimate. That reduces the total government spending from $700 billion down to $550 billion. That reduces that tax rate to 6.88% ($550 billion divided by $8 trillion). Also, though I am skeptical about these legitimate roles being privatized, I am open to trying. I don&#39;t believe they are sufficient, but we do already have private armies, security services, and courts. As for state governments, I would want them to follow the same model, but I would definitely not want the federal government to enforce it.", "comment_date": "2016-07-04T03:02:58Z", "likes_count": 9}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "Ugj4p8Q7OgPNkngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Michael Porter", "comment_text": "North Korea isn&#39;t Communist.", "comment_date": "2016-07-03T22:12:58Z", "likes_count": 13}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "Ugh4YttxRq89mHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Michael Porter", "comment_text": "Denmark isn&#39;t Socialist.", "comment_date": "2016-07-03T22:09:20Z", "likes_count": 1478}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "UggWG-ui7xmxP3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "KAYCEE MILLER", "comment_text": "Crash Course develops such great content!

The problem is that you can&#39;t separate morality from economics.  (Smith was a moral philosopher.)  Whenever you make an exchange with someone, there is an element of trust. This is magnified when you leave the barter economy and exchange a good/service for a little piece of paper with numbers on it.  Those pieces of paper represent promises/claims for other goods/services.  So trust is now key.  At the point of an exchange, you have a meeting of minds about what is fair.  Now enter a third party (likely government) who shows up and tries to alter the the value of what was agreed to in that exchange (monetary policy or some other redistribution).  Likely this third party is using some economic theory to justify the intervention.  The parties involved in the exchange now have a change being made to the value of what they trusted was fair for them at the time of the exchange.  This intervention therefor erodes trust in future exchanges as people become uncertain what they are getting in exchanges.  The promises of paper begin to fail as currency.  This is clearly evident when a country experiences hyper-inflation due to increase in the money supply.  Large misallocations of resources evolve as people try to expediently pedal their broken promises.

No centrally planned economy has demonstrated a consistent ability to predict future demand of goods. Central planning frequently leads to unnecessary production or shortages. This can have tragic consequences if the shortages are for essentials like food. When prices are set by the market, prices automatically adjust to changes in demand. The aggregate actions of individuals set prices more efficiently than central planners.  However governments still believe they know what the price of money should be AKA interest rates. Cutting interest rates effectively cuts wages in real terms and reduces the value of savings. This incentivises spending and can increase economic activity in the short term. However deficit spending and currency devaluation are not without consequences. In the long term, Keynesian manipulation as currently practiced is unsustainable because it allows postponement of fundamental economic problems.

He wanted perfect liberty, not unconditional free markets. The confusion arises from the fact that in his day, the overwhelming majority of the barriers to perfect liberty were regulations that kept the market from being the most efficient, so he is almost always arguing for less regulations. But he says (to paraphrase) &quot;this regulation is bad and this is why perfect liberty is better&quot; and &quot;that regulation is bad and this is why perfect liberty is better&quot;; he never says &quot;all regulations are bad and this is why perfect freedom is better.&quot; He just never does. <br>Admittedly the distinction btw perfect liberty and perfect freedom and natural liberty are extremely murky, possibly because when he was writing he saw no need to make such a distinction.

Conflict naturally exists between classes since some always have more power than others and that conflict played out over time forces the mode of access to become more efficient and eventually the model and the classes to change as a result. Prime example, the shift from feudal agrarian societies built on landownership to industrial capitalist societies built on ownership of industry. Fully rendered it&#39;s a lot more nuanced but the crude example will do for the basics.<br><br>Socialists (who aren&#39;t usually distinct from communists unless you&#39;re talking about social democrats which we&#39;re not) generally assert that capitalism is not the end state of the process of the economic evolution of society, and believe that the tension which exists between the working class which produces wealth and the capitalist class which owns all the industry which is used to produce it will play out along improvements in the efficiency of industry to eventually reach a point where the working class will be able to organise and operate the economy independently of the capitalist class, seizing control of the economy and holding it in common, which is how socialism is defined. Communism is sometimes defined as distinct from socialism as a further mode of economics where ownership is conceptually abolished entirely, which would follow from socialism. That&#39;s still fairly contentious though. It doesn&#39;t easily gel with neoclassical economic theory.<br><br>What&#39;s important to keep in mind is that the common ownership of the economy rarely means state ownership of the economy and is where CCE keeps making an error. The state is thought by some socialists (not all out even necessarily a majority) to be instrumental to protecting the economy&#39;s progress towards socialism. Notably the communist revolutions of the world were led by parties which sought to use the state to rapidly industrialise the economy and forcibly collectivise some parts of it while nationalising others. Full collectivisation being the actual stated objective. At some point some communist parties (criticised by others for &quot;revisionism&quot; and generally being nuts) decided that nationalisation literarily was socialism - which would imply some sort of spiritual supremacy of the state as the literal embodiment of the will of the people, which is a joke if I ever heard one.<br><br>Welfare, regulation, and union enablement are justified by socialists as tools for improving the ability of the working class to advance itself, but are only really thought of as actually socialist economically by liberals and people who like Stalin a lot.

However, as much as the hosts claim to not be pushing an agenda, there is still an obvious bias which is present (which I know is difficult to rid yourself of bias on a strongly opinion based subject), which is of course everything America does is right. Now I&#39;m not some anti-United States person, but it&#39;s not difficult to see that the 08 GFC occurred (and other more complicated or non-specific issues) due to the false expectation of perpetual growth which in itself is a physical impossibility, as well as the ability of the banks and lenders to control the apparently &#39;free&#39; market and dictate policy to the government rather than the other way around.  Now, considering this, the US government did an okay job of fixing some of the problems, but did so through a more &#39;socialist&#39; approach. The hosts here seem to be a little over-congratulatory and under-condemning of the true antagonists of this story and should be looking at examples from around the world to get a true understanding of what actually works. Greece is collapsing due to Austerity, yet the Nordic countries are still going strong due to their strong socialist foundation. Australia weathered the GFC fairly well due to early stimulus packages (although is now having problems due to the mining industry pushing its agenda so hard it caused a leadership spill which in turn created too-much public in-house bickering, which lead to the election of a dim-witted fascist, whom fucked everything in the arse - but it&#39;s ok, there was another leadership spill, but this time the people wanted it - recovery is still needed though).<br>But I digress from my rambling. My point is, I&#39;m glad the hosts are excited about economics, but they need to try a little harder to be unbiased - this episode is proof that they are trying - but they need to look at things from more than one angle. And shut up about North Korea - it&#39;s not a Communist country, it&#39;s an Autocracy disguised as Communism. Also, the only reason true communist countries are poor (e.g. Cuba) is because of sanctions put on it by other countries (e.g. USA).<br>Sorry - I&#39;m rambling again. <br>In my personal biased opinion, the current economic system doesn&#39;t work (well that&#39;s not opinion, that&#39;s fact), due to &quot;perpetual growth theory&quot;, the power of the &quot;banks/lenders/corporations&quot;, and the fact the money is no longer a tangible thing (that&#39;s opinion). While making currency no more than a trading vessel, in the current age of technology, this has given rise to the ability to have more than exists, which is required to fuel the idea of perpetual growth. What needs to happen is basically the abolition of money, so that economics is based in resources and need, rather than power and want. Unfortunately, in this day and age such an idea would need to work on a global scale and have everyone get a long. The rich and powerful don&#39;t want to share with the poor and weak.

A Georgist state collecting the rent is much more moral than a private party doing so if they used the funds to provide public goods or a citizens&#39; dividend for the dispossessed. <br><br><br>Henry George is also noteworthy for being the man who proved Thomas Malthus wrong and showed that Social Darwinism is highly counter-productive.", "comment_date": "2015-11-07T02:12:50Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "UgibN13da4B0HXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Hunter x Hunter 2011 Dickriding Association Backup", "comment_text": "At the end of the day just like with the industrial revolution, the development of agriculture, and even the use of fire, it will be technology that truly changes the world and how people act and think not some belief (RBE FTMFW)", "comment_date": "2015-11-07T02:11:20Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "UgiqThp9QjQTlXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "It's me JT", "comment_text": "If you trust Keynesian economics you clearly just finished introduction to Macroeconomics.

Two main categories of industry/services should be socialized, because profit should not be a concern: Education (K-college) and life-saving services (police, firefighters, healthcare); everything else should be capitalist, though it should also have reasonable regulation as well. By reasonable regulation I mean things like health codes, safety standards, environment codes, etc. Some often say that those regulations are cumbersome or unnecessary (because corporations will do these things on their own), but then I must point to what happened in this country before these regulations were in place, as well as to other countries nowadays that do not have such regulations, and the problems that they face because of that lack of regulation (workplace fires, chemical dumps, etc.). Also, pointing to the Great Depression/Recession as proof that we have too much regulation is problematic, mainly because the lack of regulation is what caused the problems in the first place (most recently, the repealing of Glass-Steagall). I also made a point of saying reasonable regulation, and pointed to specific examples, because I know that some regulations are indeed burdensome and unnecessary. I know that companies have influence over the government and lobby officials, and I am aware of concepts like &quot;barriers of entry&quot;. I am not saying that every regulation is good, merely that a large number of them are vital, and that the idea of eliminating government&#39;s role in the private sector seems ludicrous to me. I am glad that we have health inspectors for food services, that factories are required to have fire-suppression systems, and that there are regulations about how you can dispose of hazardous chemicals and waste. That said, I also realize that these things do cost money, and that some corporations would rather open a factory in a country with cheaper standards, for instance. However, the solution to me seems to me to be that we should help raise the standards in other countries, not lower our standards to rival theirs. Take India, for instance: they have had numerous factories fires in last decade in the textile industry alone, as well as incidents of dumping dyes/chemicals into nearby rivers. The same happened here, before we regulated these industries (and it occasionally still happens, though companies are definitely incentive to have strict standards, rather than lax ones). I understand that we must remain competitive price-wise, but shouldn&#39;t we raise them to our standards, rather than lower our standards to meet theirs? That said, I do not mean to imply that we are the gold standard in terms of regulation; there are industries which are under-regulated in this country, such as mountain-top removal mining and hydraulic fracking, both of which have negative effects on the nearby environment and its inhabitants (both animals and property owners). We also under-regulate some of our more recent and risky financial tools/investments, such as mortgage-backed securities/derivatives. In short, lets not race to the bottom, lets race to the top, in terms of regulatory standards. Also, government should not run the show, but it has its place- protecting the citizens and their environment from the dangerous excesses of profit-seeking (though profit-seeking is a fine concept around which to build an economic system, at its worst extremes it can cause major damage, and the citizens need a referee to look after the public interest).", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T23:49:29Z", "likes_count": 6}}}, {"tZvjh1dxz08": {"Economic Schools of Thought: Crash Course Economics #14": {"channel_id": "UggTnVi70VAgcHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "dangerouslytalented", "comment_text": "Malthus was not exactly wrong, merely inaccurate, from not having enough information at his disposal.
