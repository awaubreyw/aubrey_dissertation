Variations and shifts in the appraisal can occur over time. A murder is a relative concept, a soldier can murder and be both glorified and villainized and afterwards be appraised with personhood, remain without it, or have it taken away. A consumer too can be addressed like this, if you eat meat you accept that a sentient being, that feels pleasure and fear was murdered for that meat. To some that would constitute grounds for having personhood taken away, or not depending on a case by case basis which involved interpretation and an appraisal.

To think that animals like cattle, sheep, and pigs do not feel or are not sentient is not factually accurate and is based on an ignorant understanding of the facts but that doesn&#39;t stop individuals from making conclusions and appraising things in any way they choose, freedom is afforded to many regardless of group think i.e. an appraisal.

I would argue that person that ie commits murder or rape is still a person, however if they do not share our view or like Hank said &#39;surrender their personhood through an inhumane act&#39; then they are no longer in our moral community. Notice that by saying this I&#39;m implying it is possible for multiple moral communities to exist, ones that have different views or ethics, even if they are of the same species. I&#39;d say it is also possible for a being to be part of the same moral community even if they are not human, like AIs or aliens that share in our moral views. It does not make one group right and another wrong however (ie moral community of murderers is not wrong in of itself, just wrong from viewpoint of our community, but that is a topic for later perhaps). <br>Finally, death penalty is still killing and we are killing a person. It is a conscious decision we make in order to protect our own values, morality and community, civilization as a whole even.

In other words: Grow a spine and take some goddamn responsibility. Yes, it is a person. Yes, they have done something that you do not agree with. Yes, you are killing them in order to protect your own values. Saying that you &#39;punish them&#39; is again very self-righteous and I wouldn&#39;t agree with it, but it does make its easier for people to understand and feel better about themselves, and thus upkeep those values in the moral community making it stronger. So strong in fact it has become, that now it seems absolutely dominant. We call our beliefs &#39;Law&#39; these days and use extreme prejudice against members of other moral communities.

So, basically, if a living being (yeah, I know, that&#39;s an individual characteristic, whatever) acts in a beneficial way towards other living beings, then that being is a person. By &quot;beneficial&quot; I mean helping maintain physical and psychological integrity. This, of course, includes animals, who are also capable of helping other living beings maintain their physical and/or psychological integrity. &quot;Beneficial&quot; also needs to be understood as opposite to &quot;detrimental&quot;, i.e. disrupting physical and/or psychological integrity. Beings whose actions are detrimental to other living beings are not persons. Then, of course, you need to judge every single action to determine if a living being is a person or not, which means that we can only be labelled as &quot;person or not person&quot; as long as we are acting. Now, how do you judge an action? You have to think about what it means for the creature (living being) that is performing it, as well as what that creature thinks its action means for other creatures, and then what the natural consequences of that action are. If the answer to at least one of those three questions is &quot;beneficial to other creatures&quot;, then the action is being performed by a person. Now, since humans have a higher intelligence, and therefore a higher level of awareness of their own actions, they are &quot;freer&quot; than animals to choose whether to act like persons or not. And here comes the question: when you are judging an action, are you performing an action? Then, how do you judge the action of &quot;judging an action&quot;? Does it depend on your judgement of the action in question? Are you a person when you are judging an action? Am I helping other living beings maintain their physical and/or psychological integrity by writing all this? I think I&#39;m not, therefore I&#39;m not a person.

On this scale, say 1-10, the moment a human child enters the world it is a 5, where 5 would be the base line for basic human rights such as the right to Food, water, safety, shelter, love, and of course life. Below 5 is mainly reserved for intelligent biological creatures that lack the important marks of higher consciousness who still maintain the right to life in most cases but the murder of one of these would tip the scale of evil and good less than killing a 5+ these are things such as gorillas, dolphins, even dogs. As a human being you advance into life and by the age of say 2 years you are an equal member in this world on par with any adult, say a 9. From 9.1 to 10 is  reserved for intelligent beings that may exist beyond our knowledge such as further advanced aliens and even God. <br><br>Regardless (and this will no doubt make some people upset) of an adult human beings moral short comings no human falls below a 7 after the age of 2. A 7 we will say is the baseline for adult basic rights, those rights being all of the basic human rights granted at 5 + the right to meaningful (if heavily supervised) human contact, and entertainment. people who fall between 7 and 8.9 are people who have committed crimes against their fellow human kind or the planets ability to sustain life.  someone such as hitler would fall into the 7 designation, less person-hood than a two year old and someone who certainly deserves a life in confinement being watched very closely and even being re-educated (but never released) but also not murdered.  I do not believe anyone has the right to take the life of someone else who is at least a 5 and generally not even the life of things below 5 (excluding valid reasons such as food, danger, ect). A rapist or pedophile, those are terrible human beings/ people but they are still people, they do not deserve freedom but they do deserve life even if they have taken it from others. <br><br>Its not a popular opinion but it is the right one i think, all of this also excludes WAR and self defense. If another person is threatening your life, the life of your loved ones, or your way of life, you have the right to defend yourself. It turning into a lethal situation would be very unfortunate but life is not black and white its a diverse world of varying circumstances each deserving their  own consideration.", "comment_date": "2016-07-28T02:52:40Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"GxM9BZeRrUI": {"Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #21": {"channel_id": "UggkgPWIFMMgfHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "OutrunCitizen", "comment_text": "Martha!", "comment_date": "2016-07-28T02:13:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"GxM9BZeRrUI": {"Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #21": {"channel_id": "UggHwj7bQ6aXIngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Kimmy Awesomeness", "comment_text": "Blurting My Opinion:<br>I think a person is someone who would count towards the total deaths of a country or something like that.

If Personhood is defined as the ability to Feel &quot;pleasure&quot; or &quot;pain&quot;, then fully adult humans who have specific nervous system disorder in which they are fully conscious, but lack the ability to feel pain or pleasure, will never be Persons (Such is the case with CIPA). Source: <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6379795/ns/health-childrens_health/t/rare-disease-makes-girl-unable-feel-pain/#.V5kHXzXDnE8\">http://www.nbcnews.com/id/6379795/ns/health-childrens_health/t/rare-disease-makes-girl-unable-feel-pain/#.V5kHXzXDnE8</a> / The Gradient Model of Personhood has its own unique problem in terms of ethics. If growth and decay determine if a being is more or less of a person, and that Persons who are &quot;More Person&quot; than other&#39;s right supersede the rights of less-people, it won&#39;t just apply to pregnant women considering abortion. Example: if a fully grown adult man is more of a person than a young girl, the adult man&#39;s rights trump all rights had by the young girl, and therefore the adult man can do whatever they wish to that young girl without ethical consideration (Rape, murder, and molestation are therefore justified). This would even mean that other people, not just pregnant women, could act without consequence toward the human in the womb. In other words, a person other than the mother (being more of a person) would be able to force a termination of the pregnancy, and only face the consequences of assaulting the woman, because the pregnancy is morally irrelevant. I have my own views on the practice of abortion, and my own definition of personhood (which I am entirely uncomfortable with but have yet to discover or encounter a flaw with it) which I WILL NOT share here. However, for the sake of an educational series, if you are going to adopt a format of showing different definitions of Personhood and the debates surrounding them, the criticisms for each variant should be address (or at least recognized that criticisms do exist and have been raised). The main problems any definition of personhood encounter are threefold: The Over-Inclusivity Problem, The Over-Exclusivity Problem, and the Point-Change Fallacy.

I have a huge problem with philosophy when I&#39;m asked to give my opinion.

Now, that means you&#39;re gonna have...eh,  about 7 billion views on what or who it should include/exclude. I for one, couldn&#39;t tell you what these moral considerations should be, let alone who to grant them to, but still, I&#39;ll go through what I thought on the criteria.<br><br>Genetic criterion isn&#39;t my favorite by one bit thought. There is observable differences in the each human&#39;s DNA, someone could therefore find a genetic marquer to deny moral consideration to a group or individual. I disagree with the &quot;Corpse&quot; argument CrashCourse made against it thought ! We treat corpses with moral consideration I think. We build monuments, we bury and respect them, isn&#39;t that part of the whole shebang ?<br><br>In the Cognitive Criteria, you used the sentence &quot; <b>or</b> isn&#39;t conscious [...] that&#39;s not a being we can call a person&quot;, implying you need all five to be a person. Problem is that you could loose one (ability to communicate for instance) while achieving both four of the other criteria (I&#39;m thinking about the Locked-In Syndrome). Disregarding Personhood in this case is therefore morally wrong. If you meant to say &quot;and isn&#39;t conscious&quot;, then I agree, we should probably give some moral consideration to any being capable of one of those things. Again, what these considerations should be could vary. <br><br>Social Criterion is good as well, although it mentioned society, which isn&#39;t exactly a one way thing. You could f.i. have some part of the world regarding another as &quot;not persons&quot;, just because. You also have individuals that give moral considerations to things that aren&#39;t persons. I think however that the notion of individuality might become important in the euthanasia debate, which I&#39;m not gonna enter now.<br><br>The sentience argument is nice, not much to say about it. If you focus on fact that &quot;unnecessary pain&quot; is morally wrong, but necessary pain isn&#39;t, it may help advance the animal rights debate in a proper way. <br><br>The loss of personhood through misbehavior... hard one. I really don&#39;t know. I tend to be against death sentence, mainly because I couldn&#39;t be the judge. Yet, I still believe some people deserve to die, probably even to suffer.  <br><br>The Gradient Theory could be great if defined reasonably. I think it could help people with impossible choices like choosing which person to save in a medical situation for instance. But, I also think that the subjectivity of this makes it impossible to apply, because these are situations without a right answer. Choosing someone with &quot;rationally&quot; less personhood isn&#39;t morally wrong, it&#39;s a choice that you&#39;ll have to live with, just like the other choice is.<br><br>Conclusion ?  I believe it&#39;s important to talk about what moral considerations we give to what or who. It opens a whole range of debates into which I can&#39;t wait to dive. I believe individual reason and case-by-case approach are often best for the moral questions we are about to face, which is why I can&#39;t really give a definitive opinion.

Whether a &quot;thing&quot; is worth our moral consideration isn&#39;t equivalent to whether a &quot;thing&quot; is a person. I&#39;d argue architectural monuments, personal mementos, the concept of cultural heritage, artefacts of the past and so on are worth our moral consideration, even if they don&#39;t have feelings to hurt. Inversely, just because a &quot;thing&quot; is a person doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that person is worth our moral consideration. I don&#39;t have to &quot;dehumanise&quot; a human in order to agree with stripping them of their rights if I feel they&#39;ve violated whatever code of ethics or morality or legality that happens to be relevant.<br><br>My personal belief is that the personhood of an object is partially or even entirely irrelevant as to whether or not that object deserves our moral consideration. Sentient objects in their entirety deserve moral consideration, though in degrees proportionate to the moral consideration they&#39;re prepared to give other objects worth considering. I see morality as an active system kept working by its participants, where those who do the most to help maintain it - or at the very least do the least to break it down - deserve to benefit from it the most. I don&#39;t see morality as capable of delivering &quot;punishment,&quot; however, merely withdrawing &quot;support&quot; whereupon dire consequences may or may not happen.<br><br>Non-sentient objects can be worth our moral consideration, as well. Objects to which sentient beings have attributed meaning beyond their pure physical properties (a bible, the sphynx, your child&#39;s favourite teddy bear) do get to benefit from our system of morality, though I&#39;d argue to a lesser extent. I do agree that moral consideration is not binary and some objects deserve more of it than others. Exactly where the balance falls is to be determined on a case-by-case basis, but I&#39;d definitely include inanimate objects into morality as their own, separate entity.<br><br>Semi-sentient objects such as clearly intelligent but not fully sentient life forms (including toddlers) do deserve some amount of moral consideration, though again - to a lesser extent than fully-sentient beings. Yes, your one-year-old deserves more moral consideration than your cat, but that&#39;s by proxy of the baby having the potential to grow into a fully-sentient being while your cat does not. Anything with the potential to be fully sentient simply requires more care when dealing with it because of the agency it will one day be capable of wielding. Semi-sentient animals and inanimate objects don&#39;t have agency of their own, but fully sentient beings do, thus they get more moral consideration, both in terms of what they&#39;re allowed to do and what they&#39;re expected to do.<br><br>Basically, an object needs to have some degree of either sentience or importance ascribed to it by sentient beings in order to be worth considering morally. Fully sentient beings deserve the most consideration in general, but case-by-case basis exceptions do apply. Fully-sentient beings are also the only ones ascribed a moral responsibility along with their moral rights. Semi-sentient animals and inanimate objects only have rights, never responsibilities beyond the purely practical ones. You can&#39;t expect your cat to have sympathy for the poor because it lacks the capacity to comprehend that notion, thus you don&#39;t judge it if it demands food even when you can&#39;t afford it - that&#39;s just what it&#39;s capable of. It&#39;s your responsibility as a fully-sentient being to care for the cat and steer it away from causing trouble or - failing that - assign it to someone else who can.<br><br>Basically, sentience begets morality, but extenuating circumstances may apply.
