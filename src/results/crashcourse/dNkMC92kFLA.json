IR is when you have only one language and, based on your knowledge of sound changes (they are for the most part, predictable. maybe something like metathesis isnt as much) to &quot;guess&quot; how the sounds you see in a language came about. However, you might look at /f/ in father and go &quot;what if lenition happened? /p\u0361f/ &gt; /f/?&quot; well, what ends up happening is that you can find technically correct sound changes, but no idea how long ago these sound changes occurred, which isnt helpful if you want to build an evolutionary tree. with language isolates its impossible to do comparative reconstruction (bc something required of CR is that the languages being compared have to be known to be related), so IR is the only thing you have for languages like Basque (Euskara) or Korean.<br><br>last thing i want to mention: as i said before, Historical Linguistics is my primary specialization; its what i want to focus on for grad school. my main interest along those lines is investigating (and if im lucky, finalizing) whether the Na Dene language family (with languages like Navajo, Apache, and the Athabaskan languages) is related to the Yeniseian language family, which is spoken all the way in Siberia and only has one surviving language, Ket, and its endangered. i dont know how realistic language revitalization is, but if i can at least help with documentation then i can at least do some good. also i just want knowledge for its own sake.", "comment_date": "2020-12-18T19:58:25Z", "likes_count": 54}}}, {"dNkMC92kFLA": {"Language Change and Historical Linguistics: Crash Course Linguistics #13": {"channel_id": "Ugwu53xTSbLyFgLtGmp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "ann", "comment_text": "well this would\u2019ve been good to watch before i took my final yesterday", "comment_date": "2020-12-18T19:57:59Z", "likes_count": 22}}}, {"dNkMC92kFLA": {"Language Change and Historical Linguistics: Crash Course Linguistics #13": {"channel_id": "UgxznLNNOAU0ZGRw9zN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Israel Lai - Composer", "comment_text": "Yay my favourite field :D", "comment_date": "2020-12-18T19:46:58Z", "likes_count": 4}}}, {"dNkMC92kFLA": {"Language Change and Historical Linguistics: Crash Course Linguistics #13": {"channel_id": "UgxHmaSUSSGHHeXub1x4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Seth R", "comment_text": "This was so so good.
