Now that whole part was useless, as most people will not know that when adding O2 to a C atom, the mass of CO2 is not 1 C-mass plus 2 O-masses. The FTIR part goes really wrong. The y-axis is in transmittance, so not the intensity of absorption but the inverse. The unit is cm-1 not wavenumber (inverse cm or reciprocal cm). Saying that something has higher wavenumbers is just bad grammar. &#39;this spring has higher forces&#39; or &#39;I measure 300 currents&#39;. I also loved that sometimes parts of the FTIR spectra are cut out and sometimes not. As you are not labeling any peak, CO2/H2O peaks are irrelevant anyway.
