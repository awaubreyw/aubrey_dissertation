[2] Later, in 31 BC, Emperor Augustus, after conquering the Hellenistic Kingdom of Egypt, founded the Roman Empire. [3] with vast expanses stretching from Turkey to Spain, from North Africa to Scotland. The expansion of the Roman empire laid the foundations for a series of empires that had never been seen before in Europe. After the decline of the Western Roman Empire in 476, European history entered a dark period, marked by the decline in education, social organization and by the tearing down of many troops. barbaric aggression, especially the Vikings, Avar, Magyar and Arabs.<br><br><br>Europe in 814.<br>The Middle Ages was marked by organized social reconstruction, mostly under feudalism, and the Northern domination of the Roman Catholic Church. In the east, the Eastern Roman Empire flourished, with talented Emperors like Heraclius, who was an outstanding general who defeated the Persians in the 620s. But it was from this very moment that the Arabs of Islam swept Europe and more or less defeated Heraclius, although the East Romans were still strong under Emperor Basil II, and in the Battle of Tours (732), the Kingdom of Frank (the Germans) defeated the Arab army. . [4] In 800, after the expansion of the thriving Frankish nation, conquering other Germanic tribes, King Karl the Great was conferred by Pope Leo III as the Catholic Emperor in the West against Eastern Rome. Although the Empire disintegrated after the death of Karl the Great, East Frank Kingdom - Germany - under the reigns of Heinrich der Finkler and Otto the Great grew, defeating the Magyar army which led to the Emperor Otto becoming Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. [5] Before the power of Islam, the Crusades erupted, and eventually the Ottoman Turks of the Turks flourished and conquered the city of Constantinople in 1453, causing the Eastern Roman Empire to perish. 6] Meanwhile, Britain since the time of King Edward III fought with France during the brutal Hundred Year War. [7] The Middle Ages was followed by a revival, a rediscovery of classical values \u200b\u200band knowledge, with the revival of the two ancient Greek cultures, [8] and as a springboard for the Reformation movement. Protestantism, a religious and political movement that saw most of Northern Europe abandon the Roman Catholic Church and redefine culture and alliances across the continent, began a religious movement. to German theologian Martin Luther when he condemned the Roman Catholic Church system in 1517. He was determined to defend his thesis, [9] This period was also the foundation for his development. colonization, strengthened the Atlantic countries of the United Kingdom, France, Portugal and Spain and expanded European influence on the Americas, Africa, India and the East. This period was a turning point for the industrial revolution and a period of knowledge called the Enlightenment movement.<br><br>The second half of the 17th century saw Louis XIV&#39;s Kingdom of France rise to a mighty military power, with malicious intent to invade its neighbors, but he was stopped by King William III of England. [10] But in the 18th century, the influence of both England and France in Europe gradually diminished, and the Eastern European dynasties rose to become impotent. [11] With the mighty Emperor Pyotr the Great, the Russian Empire - Europe&#39;s largest country - defeated the Kingdom of Sweden, and became the hegemony of Northern Europe.

I liked the old John Green better. His videos are as much about contemporary America as the subject he&#39;s supposed to cover. Great historic accounts are those that only at a small degree reflects the time they are told/written. A good example of this is &quot;The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; by Gibbon. This book is 250 years old and are still read and seen as a cornerstone for our understanding of the time. <br>I suspect these videos won&#39;t measure well up to time. In twenty years this perspective will be seen as very old fashioned and kind of silly. If you have the view that the Nazi thugs trashed Jewish shops because they &quot;threatened their masculinity&quot; you have a very Freudian view on history. The real drivers were the combination of economic crisis, the ideology of nationalism, traumatized people from WW1 and the very real threat that communism was for the vast middle class, to their economic interests and to the institutions of the nation/state that their well being depended on. <br>By talking about this in the same way as some modern gender study professor would frame it just confuses the real issues. Germany in the 1920s are not like USA in the 2020s. Men did not force women out of the workforce because of &quot;masculinity&quot;, but because of a generation of young men came back from four years in a trenches in the service of the &quot;Fatherland&quot; to an economy with 30% unemployment. This was in a time when the man was expected to be the breadwinner. Without work, they couldn&#39;t start a family. This would create dwindling birthrates and in time threaten the state because they needed taxpayers and soldiers in the future. A state were the population went down was seen as an unacceptable result for the state and for the people. <br>Jews were prominent in the leadership in many communist movement, this was one of the reasons Jews were targeted. The other reason was that anti-semitism had very long traditions in German nationalism going back to the middle ages and Martin Luther. Another reason was that Jews often were more prosperous than many Germans. In times of economic hardship some will try to rob those who are seen as better off. <br>We have to remember that the vast majority of the people supported Nazi policies in the 30s. You can&#39;t just take the popular zingers from modern discourse and use them to explain a very different time filled with people with very different experiences and ideas of what the responsibilities the state had to its people and the people to its state.<br><br><br>This is a very complicated issue.

He completely omitted the 1919 Spartacist uprising of the famed Rosa Luxembourg and Karl Leibtnickt and subsequent Freicorp put down of the revolutionary, very formative in the history of the Nazis. Central Europe was riven by communist-inspired insurrections: Eugine Levin\u00e9 in Bavaria, Bela Kun in Hungary, etc. The Mexican revolution in 1917 any, of course, the October 1917 revolution in Russia. From the perspective of middle-class nationalists, there was a great threat to them. Communist threats against them lead to the formation of rival paramilitary groups: the Sturmabteilinung of the NSDAP was mirrored in the Reichsnbanner of the SPD, the Stahlhelm of the DNVP, Red Fighters Combat league of the KPD. the famous SS, Schutzstaffel (protection unit) was formed to protect Hitler and his leaders from physical attack. Political factionalism would have heightened peoples&#39; paranoia towards leftist groups. think of the ANTIFA of today: many people in the US many feel their free speech threatened and feel justified to retaliate. So that&#39;s why John dodges this issue. Another uncomfortable fact is that some of the communist leaders that lead these uprisings were Jewish, (like Luxembourg, Levine, and Kun, who were migrants to Germany and Hungary, respectively). This would have been a contributory basis for the NSDAP&#39;s attacks on Jews. Not legitimate of course, but diminishing the fear and hostility of the wider population to Marxist revolutionaries and blaming jobless men who felt their &#39;masculinity&#39; threatened is a distortion of history and I think his perspective is coloured by contemporary US political culture.", "comment_date": "2020-02-26T20:31:18Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "HUNdAntae", "comment_text": "The lack of newsboy caps with razor blades sewn in them is disturbing...", "comment_date": "2020-02-26T19:58:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stan Beatlesfan", "comment_text": "Please cover the Spanish Civil War!
