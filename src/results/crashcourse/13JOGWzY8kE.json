If you can\u2019t prevent other people from exploiting the resource, then you have an incentive to exploit it yourself and take as much as you can, as quickly as you can \u2014&gt; Finite resources thus get pillaged. This is a problem found in Environmental economics.<br><br><br><br>3) Externalities: situations when some external costs or benefits accrue to other people or society as a whole. When other people are made worse off that&#39;s called a negative externality. When other people are made better off that&#39;s called a positive externality.<br><br>ex: Let\u2019s look at a TV factory that pollutes a river with toxic chemicals. This is a negative externality. The factory has internal costs: it has to pay its workers, buy raw materials, pay for energy; and uses those costs to determine how many TVs to produce. But there are also external costs associated with polluting the waterways, like dead fish, contaminated drinking water, and people getting sick. Those external costs are paid by people downstream, and they are likely to be ignored by the factory owner.\u00a0<br><br>\u2014&gt; The free market assumes that all the costs associated with producing TVs are accounted for within the price of those TVs, but, in this case, the market is wrong. The result is a market failure because the factory is producing too many TVs.<br><br><br><br>Now in both cases, negative and positive externalities, economists often look to the government to step in and solve the problem.\u00a0<br><br>ex: The government could tax the TV factory or subsidize education.\u00a0<br><br>\u2014&gt; In fact, externalities are the justification for almost everything the government does. When politicians, tax cigarettes, fund education, subsidize fuel-efficient cars or regulate financial markets, it&#39;s because they are convinced that free-markets alone are not adjusting for externalities.<br><br><br><br>When the government tries to fix externalities they can use:<br><br><br>Regulatory policies: rules established by government decree.<br><br><br>ex: Let\u2019s go back to the TV factory example. To help solve the pollution externality, the government could ban the use of certain types of chemicals or set a production quota to limit the production of TVs or regulate what can be dumped in the river. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has pushed for laws to control pollution, and these regulations have worked.<br><br><br>Market-based policies: policies designed to manipulate markets, prices, and incentives to correct<br><br><br>for market failures.<br><br>ex: - The best examples are taxes and subsidies. A tax on the production of TVs or on the chemicals the factory is using will decrease production and limit pollution.<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 - One oft-discussed market-based policy is emissions trading or \u201ccap and trade.\u201d<br><br>The government issues pollution permits and if your factory doesn\u2019t hold one of those permits, it can\u2019t pollute. But companies can buy or sell those permits. This sets up incentives to go green: if you can produce without pollution, you can make money by selling your permits. But if you operate a dirty plant, you have to pay for those extra permits. Individual countries might work to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, but they can\u2019t prevent other countries from polluting. It\u2019s the Tragedy of the Commons.<br><br><br><br>In real life, though, governments often use both policies.\u00a0<br><br>ex: In the US, the government taxes cigarette producers and regulates where people can smoke.<br><br><br><br>\u2014&gt; The question isn\u2019t \u201cwhich is better: free markets or government?\u201d The question is \u201chow can they work together to make our lives better?\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-06-09T08:40:31Z", "likes_count": 114}}}, {"13JOGWzY8kE": {"Market Failures, Taxes, and Subsidies: Crash Course Economics #21": {"channel_id": "UgzC9F2udCzyaE61zM14AaABAg", "comment_by": "Erik Gruber", "comment_text": "Did you ever hear the Tragedy of the commons?

The people who decide which game is the best in town are also the ones who consistently win the one we are playing. These &#39;market failures&#39; cannot be fixed because they are intrinsic to the system and they WONT be fixed because those who are in the position to perpetuate the system don&#39;t see them as failures. As a programmer i would consider this a total failure and try something else, but we seem to generally believe that what we have is the best there is and it just needs to be tweaked. That is unscientific and illogical, and is more about ego and patriotism than anything else. For example maybe something like communism would function better except our political enemies are communist so we wouldn&#39;t even consider it. In fact im sure most people who hear me say that, no matter how educated they are would have an emotional and unreasonable reaction.

Why should it work differently from anything else in the free market? There would surely be a less costly alternative. Also the education we get from public schools is atrocious in america. Some people want to blame a lack of funding but i really cant think of a way that funding would improve education. The only thing that really applies is better paid teachers which would also require them to be better trained which would reduce the pool of potential educators below a manageable level. If grade school teachers were required to have as much training as doctors we wouldn&#39;t have enough of them no matter how much they were paid. We have also demonstrated much less costly and much more effective means of education which don&#39;t even require teachers at all but we don&#39;t make the switch because that would take an immense amount of political power away from governments. If the focus of school was to teach us how to use logic effectively instead of what to believe then there would be fewer belligerent arguments and a more functional society. However it would not benefit the government if we all had critical thinking skills, so they teach what they believe would make us better americans instead, which is not the same thing as being smarter or better people. It is commonly believed that history is taught in school so that we can learn from our mistakes, but unless you are going to become a politician i cant imagine how knowing about the boston tea party helps your average person to be a more productive or valuable citizen. It does, however, inform people on how to be patriotic americans. If you don&#39;t believe me look at an english history book and tell me that one of us isn&#39;t being biased.

Really, it comes down to this. You can have whatever you want; you just can&#39;t use it except maybe in the middle of a desert or ocean. Going back to education, it&#39;s actually the case that poorer African countries have people flocking to private schools and away from the government schools when they are allowed to do so. Private schools must compete by producing higher quality at lower prices. Often they help people pay through more scholarships. The tragedy in America is how so many inner-city kids (often black) are so disadvantaged by their inability to choose private schools over the often horribly low quality public schools. Subsidizing things like education only makes them more expensive. Government spends massive amounts of tax dollars on grants and loans to higher education institutions (universities, colleges, etc.). The result is far higher tuition rates. As a college student, I beg government to please stop with the subsidizing. The more you subsidize the more the institutions can charge. We&#39;re at the point were I literally can&#39;t go to college unless I either accept government money stolen from other people (grants, etc.) or take out loans (often from the government as well) and get into debt for the rest of my life. Stop subsidizing and leave it to the free market. Colleges and universities will then have to compete with one another forcing prices down.", "comment_date": "2016-07-04T18:57:08Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"13JOGWzY8kE": {"Market Failures, Taxes, and Subsidies: Crash Course Economics #21": {"channel_id": "UggVo3nt1CCYSXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "John C", "comment_text": "Street lights and other infrastructure are important and should be paid for by those in the area. For instance, if a business wants people to be able to get to them, then they need to pay for the infrastructure around their location and simply add that to the cost of their good/service. There are also private roads, tolls, and plenty of other privatized options for paying for these things that would be far more efficient. America&#39;s infrastructure is currently crumbling. Give the responsibility to those who use the infrastructure and you have more accountability and more efficiency. Private companies already build pretty much all of it. Just cut out the middle-man called government. The tragedy of the commons is exactly why I don&#39;t want public goods/services. They are common goods that everyone has access to. They are often misused and exploited. There is plenty of corruption and waste in these things with little real accountability. Instead things like education should be in private hands where they are far less easily exploited and far more accountable to the consumer. This produces higher quality and lower prices for such goods/services through free market competition. Just keep the government out of it and let it be truly free. The tragedy of the commons is exactly why we should have less public things and more private things. People take care of things they own themselves, privately. If you own something as a collective, then you generally care less about its maintenance. With environmental issues, the solution is private property. If a business is harming your person/property (polluting the air you breath, your land, your water, etc.), then you should seek legal action against them. You should also boycott them and encourage others to do the same.", "comment_date": "2016-07-04T18:37:52Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"13JOGWzY8kE": {"Market Failures, Taxes, and Subsidies: Crash Course Economics #21": {"channel_id": "UghCmNfpYEVqLngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Sarah1627", "comment_text": "Very helpful thank you.. some teachers need to watch more YT, they need some improvement in their teaching skills!!

It only took me five minutes to imagine a viable business strategy for fire departments, in a completely private way. <br><br>If you own a home, you&#39;d have a choice, pay for fire protection insurance (or basically just a service fee to your local fire department). In which case, you&#39;d be covered if you have a fire in your home. If you don&#39;t pay for coverage and you have a fire, you could still call the fire department for help, however you&#39;d be billed for the costs required to put it out + some profit, whatever the going rate would be. The markets would figure out the proper price. This would obviously be much more than any single month&#39;s worth of fire coverage, probably more than a year&#39;s worth, but it would be up to you the property owner to decide,<br><br>Makes sense, and it would be fair.<br><br>The only caveat to this is, if your home is next to a forest or another person&#39;s property, then the fire department would put it out regardless of your consent in order to protect the other property that is threatened by the fire in your home. In which case you would be billed for their services. <br><br>A much better example, one that follows the fire department in the video, is military protection. If I opt-out of paying for it, there&#39;s no way to limit my benefit. It&#39;s not like if we get invaded, all the non-payers will be shoved up front to be mowed down by drone missiles first. That is obviously ridiculous. So for military protection, not being able to opt-out makes some level of sense. Although it only makes sense defensively. As the military is used to build empires, no one should be forced to support that. <br><br>For regulation of markets, I think a lot of people fail to realize just how many we already have. The cries for more regulation come from, in large part, those who don&#39;t own property or businesses and thus don&#39;t suffer the gargantuan burden that they impose. Perhaps some regulations are sensible, but we&#39;re talking about millions. Literally. Not thousands, but MILLIONs of regulations, laws, mandates... and if you want to get even more specific, this doesn&#39;t account for local municipal and county rules. And IRS tax codes (that&#39;s a different beast altogether) and so on. <br><br>We&#39;ve gone from trying to minimize negative externalities in simple fair ways, to using the tragedy of the commons to justify crony capitalism and dramatic over-regulation. It is killing entrepreneurial spirit. It&#39;s killing the country. <br><br>There&#39;s also a question of personal responsibility when it comes to subsidizing positive eternalities. In the case of education, why should someone else be forced to pay for my kid&#39;s education? The potential good for society shouldn&#39;t be enough justification. It creates a perverse incentive to have kids when you can&#39;t provide for them. <br><br>I created my kid, I am the one responsible for raising and providing for him or her. Not Marry and Bob down the road, or anyone else. <br><br>If you start to look at society only as part of what is best for the collective good, you lose sight of personal character and individual liberty / accountability. That&#39;s dangerous in the long run. <br><br>Finally, as for climate change, the entire example sounds good and is, if one part of it is certain, that climate change will be catastrophic. There&#39;s no doubt that humans are changing the environment, but as to the effects? That is far from certain.

B) there are numerous examples both current and historical of commons managed for centuries to millennia without any governance other than those directly involved, so tragedy is not an inherit property of common goods. C) what was the Department of War called in 1984? MiniPax (Ministry of Peace). The US&#39;s military expenditures have fuck all of nothing to do with defense, so please step out of your double think and stop perpetuating the bullshit notion that US Military expenditure has anything at all to do with defense. To be clear, I am not debating their classification as a public good; though imprisonment for non-payment of taxes would change them to a club good. D) there are many rural communities and small towns with subscription fire service, so though fire service may in most cases be a common good, it can easily be made a private good. E) the supposed need for state funding of schools is based on the belief that parents will let their kids grow up to be retards if the state doesn&#39;t intervene. State intervention in education has been to produce a society that does not get uppity...... though the heroin that has been coming in ever since the US overthrew the Taliban helps a lot with that to. F) if someone dumps poison in the drinking water it should be treated like murder/attempted murder, but we have the nice friendly EPA to make sure they just get slapped with a fine...... The solution to companies dumping poison in drinking water is dead CEOs. Also, abolishing the legal fiction that is the LLC (aka corporate personhood..... and no, I am not talking about a court ruling made this millennia, corporate person hood is a legal fiction established over 125 years prior to Citizens United). G) what the fuck happened to boycotting? This is a credible way of addressing negative externalities. 135-145 years ago or so coordinated strikes and boycotts brought corporations to their knees and where ready to bend them to their whim. But 125 years or so of state involvement in education and people ain&#39;t so uppity anymore.... amazing, though to be fair the anti-communist rhetoric that gets spewed at anyone who even talks of community organization probably helps a lot to make sure that whatever opposition there is is entirely impotent. H) it&#39;s not like global warming is the only way in which we are on a path to making this planet an unlivable hell hole, it isn&#39;t even the fastest, most certain or most devastating; there is also declining pollinator numbers (and not just European honeybees, but almost all pollinator species), and without pollinators our diets will consist pretty much of nothing but grains and tree nuts and fungi and animals that eat those things. Continued loss of pollinators will result in wide spread famine, war and genocide. And what is the leading cause of pollinator deaths? (I am sure some &quot;liberal&quot; will chime in with the answer of &quot;global warming&quot;) LOSS OF HABITAT! Stop mowing your lawns, you dumb fuckers. But perhaps not as imminent of a cause for a mass die off of humans and dramatic degradation of quality of life for the survivors but far more certain, far further reaching and far more related to the content of this channel: the constant quest for economic growth. In many ways this is driving force behind global warming and pollinator deaths, but even if we manage to avoid killing ourselves by either of those two methods the constant push for economic growth will find another way.", "comment_date": "2016-01-25T06:13:09Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"13JOGWzY8kE": {"Market Failures, Taxes, and Subsidies: Crash Course Economics #21": {"channel_id": "Ugjqy4eh0zdDPHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Noah O", "comment_text": "Austrian punks fuck off.", "comment_date": "2016-01-25T03:19:49Z", "likes_count": 9}}}, {"13JOGWzY8kE": {"Market Failures, Taxes, and Subsidies: Crash Course Economics #21": {"channel_id": "UghEIn-As19CIXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jeremiah Mitchell", "comment_text": "Regulations are used more to keep smaller companies from competing than public good.
