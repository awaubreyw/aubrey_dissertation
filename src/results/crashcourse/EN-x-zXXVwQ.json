They do nothing whatsoever to prevent moisture loss and are not emollients.  They were pheromones, chemicals that are picked up in kissing.  Addiction to these secretions is why we fall in love.  Providing this pheromone (minus the aversive sentinel sub-pheromone volatiles) by mouth alleviates behavioral illnesses and conditions as well as ameliorates autoimmune diseases.  100mg p.o. will halt addictive drug appetites without withdrawal symptoms.  Schizophrenics, perverts of all types, borderlines, ADHD, ADD, PTSD, OCD, CD, generalized wasting disease, generalized anxiety disorder, Tourette&#39;s, Alzheimer&#39;s, Hashimoto&#39;s, all just by taking the pheromone by mouth.  Kissing and pheromone communication are essential for good immunity as well.  It is important to kiss one&#39;s father&#39;s cheek on a regular basis while growing up.  Pheromone exchange improves immunity in pair-bonded adults as well.  Collecting pheromone from donors and supplying it to immune-compromised patients should diminish the consequences of coronavirus infection, COVID-19, too.", "comment_date": "2020-05-12T15:33:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Medical Life with John", "comment_text": "Awesome", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T13:32:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ismail  g\u00fcrb\u00fcz", "comment_text": "Ne diyorsunus ya", "comment_date": "2020-05-06T12:32:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Juanita W", "comment_text": "Gross.", "comment_date": "2020-05-05T21:20:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Puddi Milk", "comment_text": "Thank you John Green, after watching you for world history, I come back for biomedical science", "comment_date": "2020-05-01T10:17:58Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Montana Rodriguez", "comment_text": "This guy rocks \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T14:47:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michele Hayes", "comment_text": "Do you have questions as revision for each of these wonderful videos?", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T06:11:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arcangeljp", "comment_text": "Kathleen Yale is my hero.", "comment_date": "2020-03-14T22:13:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wonders of Davis family The davis", "comment_text": "I love you", "comment_date": "2020-03-13T07:21:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jenn D", "comment_text": "New favorite compliment comeback,  &quot;Thanks!

And I am thinking like that: <br>1) We have conscious and unconscious systems in us.<br>2) We started noticing the strong odor coming from our bodies a certain amount of time ago (50-20 thousand years ago).<br>3) My question is &quot;why&quot;? The odor is produced by a totally natural mechanism, so that should feel completely natural to us, right?<br>4) I guess that we are going through some sort of the &quot;growing up&quot; process when an intelligent species kinda tries to suppress the signals that they receive from their natural environment and focus on other signals that come from the unnatural environment. <br><br>Steve Jobs used to avoid showering when he came back from India. So, the boss decided that he would work alone during the nighttime. It&#39;s just that his coworkers weren&#39;t able to concentrate on the work (unnatural signals) with that smell around them (natural signal). <br><br>So, when I get into the train and there&#39;s a filthy homeless person there, the odor is so strong (natural signal) that I move into the opposite part of the train car and continue reading a blog post (unnatural signal). <br><br>So, using a deodorant is similar to using the sunglasses (to mitigate that acuteness of the sun&#39;s signal), boots (to mitigate the acuteness of the snow and what not&#39;s signal) and ear plugs (to mitigate the water&#39;s signal).<br><br>So, no need to feel &quot;unnatural&quot; for using a deodorant. If we were apes, living together with other apes, then using a deodorant would be &quot;unnatural&quot;, but since we are living in this type of society, it&#39;s a norm.<br><br>What do you think about that?", "comment_date": "2019-11-21T20:03:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aiyana Jade", "comment_text": "A &amp; P exam in 2 hours, this is gold for my revision \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-11-19T22:56:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jose Mendoza", "comment_text": "you can lose up to 25 pounds a day then???", "comment_date": "2019-11-18T18:43:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MochaSani", "comment_text": "why weren&#39;t holocrine glands spoken about?", "comment_date": "2019-11-10T01:16:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sonia Gafur", "comment_text": "Put it 0.25 he sounds pretty funny", "comment_date": "2019-11-05T00:07:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cathal Dunne", "comment_text": "Come for the b0ob thumbnail.
