A friend of mine recently recommended your channel since I teach anatomy and physiology labs and he felt your videos might be beneficial to my students. I must admit, I&#39;m impressed. I was expecting grossly over-simplified explanations with borderline inaccurate information which would be misleading and/or confusing, however your presentations are simple, accurate, and engaging. I really like what you all have done! During my labs I like to imagine that I have the energy and charisma that Hank does, but in reality I probably more closely resemble Ben Stein from Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off... Anyway, I digress. <br>Minus a few tidbits here and there, your videos touch on much of the information I present prior to carrying out lab exercises. I have enjoyed your videos and would like to post links to some of your content as supplemental material for my students. If this is possible let me know.
