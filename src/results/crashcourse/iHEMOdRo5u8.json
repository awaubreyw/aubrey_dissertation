However we can both go further back and at the possible/predictable future based on population pressures. In terms of the past; one only needs to think of examples like the Cheddar Man from England; the Indo-European expansion (and what that meant for Dravidian peoples), the lingering traces of what we in the modern day would consider african ancestry, not only in Australia and New Guinea, but further north up into the Indian Subcontinent and South-East Asia; or the expansion of Austronesian peoples out from Taiwan. The world has steadily become less diverse the more interconnected we have become. The rise of Nation-States uniforming and destroying smaller communities such as the Basque peoples in Spain, Celtic derivitives in Brittany and Cornwall, Occitani in Southern France. And even today, we see groups continued destruction in places like Xinjiang; Inner Mongolia and Tibet as China asserts its own control over peoples within its state that were beyond its historical reach and borders.
