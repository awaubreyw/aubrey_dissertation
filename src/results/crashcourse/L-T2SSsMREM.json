If we are all living out of the same narrative, we will get along better.  Another name for this is brainwashing.  I&#39;m a public high school biology teacher, and I&#39;ve come to realize that this is my primary job:  to get young people to buy into this narrative that (a) there is competition for jobs, (b) you need to get a good education to make yourself the best qualified for those jobs and (c) if you don&#39;t, you will have a miserable life.  Education is offered up as the key to success and happiness; it is offered up as a Savior, a God, to be worshiped and adored.  And all those who are educated are superior to those who are not.  For example, if I were to tell you that I don&#39;t believe in the narrative described in this series, many would say that I am an ignorant, uneducated creationist.  I would be labeled, and dismissed.  The arrogance and narcissism of the academic elite is what scares me.  They won&#39;t even admit that all of these facts in their narrative are tentative hypotheses that cannot be verified; they are observations - not conclusions.  So that&#39;s what really gets me; I&#39;m the one who is actually displaying some intellectual virtues by thinking deeply and thoroughly - they&#39;re just regurgitating whatever the scientists say they believe (which in the context of science is a word that should never be used, am I right?  &quot;Believe&quot;... science means &quot;to know&quot;).  The Truth is, that this narrative of atheistic cosmic evolution is just another religion; you don&#39;t know these things, you can&#39;t prove them, so you believe them... that&#39;s a religion.
