That&#39;s why the biggest experts are specialized, because in order to understand any issue both deeply and with a broad view of all the evidence takes most of a person&#39;s studying life.<br><br>This puts us in a predicament with this &quot;epistemic responsibility&quot; because it means that we don&#39;t have time to become experts in most of the things that we consider and about which we must decide.  Many conspiracy theories have lots of evidence.  Wrong conspiracy theories misinterpret the implications of the evidence, accept poorly generated and vetted evidence, and usually dismiss counter evidence as a smokescreen while assuming that partial evidence is only partial because they are clues that miraculously got through the veil of secrecy. But to prove that they are wrong, one must evaluate the hundreds of pieces of evidence, each of which requires understanding surrounding contextual facts in order to evaluate them.

I don&#39;t have the time to sort through all of this, so I default to the consensus expert view, and point out to her some fallacies in her thinking that make her conclusions practically invincible (which is a great fault of any theory).<br><br>Anyway, my big point is that since we cannot thoroughly research even most of our beliefs we cannot be held responsible for adopting beliefs on their social and/or scientific credibility.", "comment_date": "2019-05-12T06:45:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Dark Master The Dark Master", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYkhlXronNk&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> It&#39;s almost as if when women talk down to men they tend to be resented<br>also this has never happened", "comment_date": "2019-05-04T12:12:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Winter Bear", "comment_text": "The words &#39;Anti-vaxxers&#39;, &#39;Climate change deniers&#39; and &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; are all very polarizing and largely incorrect.

If a philosophical argument against or for a God, it would have to include Gods or ancestor worship etc. of non-Eurocentric Gods, etc.  Our &quot;Jew-o-centric&quot; argument claims that belief in God is foolish because there is no rational substance for proof. However, other religious belief systems may be able to offer some rational proof concerning their beliefs. <br><br>Second, the philosophers dis-regard the scientific fact that all cultures, including hunter-gatherers, have some form of religious belief.<br><br>While this doesn&#39;t prove or disprove the existence of a God etc. it does show that such beliefs are an extremely important part of humanity, for either cultural, societal or biological reasons.  This fact is adequate to prove that a belief in a God, etc. is rational.  If it walks like a duck and talks like a duck it&#39;s a duck.  <br><br>And thirdly, we know where monotheism comes from.  God is the Big Lebowski in the Canaanite religious  pantheon.  Known as Elohim, or more often by his nickname El, he kicked the other gods off the cloud upon which they all lived, proceeded to claim all of Canaan to belong to his followers alone.<br><br>There is archeological proof of this.

Its probably more of a question of trusting authority figures. Since the &#39;evidence&#39; to support the idea that vaccines can cause ill effects was &#39;proven wrong&#39; it doesn&#39;t bode well for &#39;evidence&#39; on the matter in general. Since most people are not scientists who can prove or disprove the concept we have to put faith in people who are. Also it is not just paranoia to say that evidence can be and has at times been manipulated to produce a desired result, and it is also true that the amount of money made in the sale of vaccines is a potential motivation to manipulate the evidence in that way. The fact that flu vaccines are being sold at walmart to people who benifit little if at all from them demonstrates to me that profit is more highly valued than public health in a capitalist model. I would say that there is in fact enough logical evidence to at least question whether it is an actual fact that vaccines do not cause autism or if there is too much money in it to admit that it does. There is nothing at all illogical about any of that and there is also nothing logical about taking it for granted that people in authority will tell the truth. That being said if you take the position that vaccines may cause autism you now have a choice between your child possibly getting polio or possibly being born with autism. Since autism is more a part of american life than polio that seems like the more immediate threat to some people. The logic seems pretty sound to me and no real assumptions are required for it to be considered a possibility. However even if it is true that vaccines can cause autism not taking them can cause an epidemic so it may be a risk that we should take. This resolves the problem without muddling around with flimsy hearsay and sense data, and in a way that should appease the conformation bias of those who just find it distasteful or absurdly paranoid to believe that science can be tampered with in the real world. (Speaking of which, the good of humanity is a pretty good reason to keep such a thing secret.) That is when not getting a vaccine becomes illogical. The unfortunate truth is that although science is meant to be a group of people seeking truth it is a bit utopian to believe that all scientists seek truth over a paycheck and it is simply incorrect to believe that someone saying they have evidence is the same as you yourself having evidence.

Is this a belief for which there is any clear evidence? Well, no. Free will is when we decide for ourselves what we will do, free of coercion or other undue influence. Since reliable cause and effect is a rather mundane presumption that we all make, it is neither coercive nor undue. For example, if you ask someone, &quot;Why did you choose A rather than B?&quot;, she will happily give you her reasons why A was the better choice. In other words, her own reasons caused her choice, and she knows it. So the idea that free will implies the lack of reliable cause and effect is false, based upon the evidence. <br><br>Where then did the &quot;hard determinists&quot; get the idea that free will required &quot;freedom from reliable cause and effect&quot;. Well, it&#39;s called a &quot;reification fallacy&quot;. That&#39;s when we get caught up in our metaphors to the extent that we start confusing concepts with actual things that exist. The &quot;hard determinist&quot; claims that causation is causing everything so we must not be causing anything. But causation is simply a concept we use to describe the reliable interaction of objects and forces as they bring about events.

Clifford&#39;s idea of Epistemic Responsibility applies very well. Especially for those who are very outspoken about their beliefs, I think he is correct in saying that it is wrong to believe anything, and subsequently influence others with your beliefs, if you don&#39;t have sufficient evidence that your beliefs are correct. Like Hank mentioned at the beginning of the clip, because of one bogus study that was published without sufficient evidence, now several children are unnecessarily suffering or succumbing to diseases that could probably have been eradicated by now, if that one person hadn&#39;t shared their unjustified belief. I, and Clifford probably would also, say that those who influence others with their beliefs to not vaccinate are committing a morally unethical act. However, as the video continued, and brought up topics such as faith, I began to think a little differently. First of all, if someone believes something strongly enough to share it or live it out in their daily lives, they probably have a reason for it, whether it is &quot;scientifically&quot; justified or not. In the case of anti-vaxxers, I think they are justified in being wary or concerned, as they should be when considering any medical procedure or drug, or when making big decisions that will impact their childrens&#39; lives. However, I would then enact John S. Mill&#39;s no harm principle, which states that you have freedom to think and believe and act however you want, AS LONG AS it doesn&#39;t harm anyone else, or infringe on their freedoms. Following this principle, it would be okay to believe in a God, but it wouldn&#39;t be okay to practice a religion that encourages sacrificing people, because that is bad. Similarly, it is okay to ask questions about vaccines, and discuss your concern, it is not okay refuse to vaccinate your child, because in the long term that will serve to not only harm your own family, but several other families as well, through failing to prevent the transmission of completely unnecessarily but serious diseases (and this has been proven).

He will never advise someone from his church to forgo treatment and opt for prayer  alone. He won&#39;t talk about evolution and convince someone that it doesn&#39;t exist, he won&#39;t make medical decisions that are faith motivated (for instance about contraception) and will just generally keep a barrier between what he &quot;likes to believe because of cultural and personnal reasons&quot;, and what he &quot;knows&quot;, or &quot;believes with evidence&quot;. Some would say it&#39;s hypocritical to do so, but to me it&#39;s not more hypocritical then showering before work, instead of every hour of the day. There are moments where you&#39;re likely to be called to make moral decisions, and where you&#39;re likely to be called to smell good. There are moments where your choices will be trivial and where showering or filtering your beliefs comes at a cost that doesn&#39;t fit the expected benefits.<br>Arguably, it is hard to keep two personas like this, and sometimes your belifs on your day off can affect others in unforseeable ways, like in lending more credibility to coreligionary extremists. Sure.<br>On the other hand a non-evidence-based rose tinted glass can be ethically better than pure evidence based reasoning because even the most thorough medical evidence rests on some unproven principles: namelly that the human life has some sort of value. We don&#39;t have evidence for that. As far as we know the world is a cold uncaring place, humans are animals. Their life is worthless. Other animals are worthless. Humans destroy the ecosystem. Which is also worthless. Why care about anything?<br>So... in the end, unless we agree that pure nihilism is &quot;the best thing&quot;, we&#39;re going to need to believe some unprovable stuff, like the value of human life.<br>So, I believe that epistemological responsability must come within the frame of an ethic model.

I choose to go outside in the hopes of observing the meteor shower, and proceed into my back yard.  While in the backyard looking for meteors, a flying saucer appears directly in front of me with an incredibly bright light.  Exiting the flying saucer by some unseen means an alien being appears in front of me and proceeds to make noises I do not understand, which I interpret as a language.  After a few moments of this noise making without me responding (as I do not speak the language) the alien enters the flying saucer and the flying saucer disappears.  I do not have any scientific evidence with which I may prove the existence of the aliens, however not believing in flying saucers and aliens is no longer possible for me.  This would be a private belief, one that I hold and may share.  How can one argue that a belief may only be held if it may be proven?

Now there are direct correlation to this bloodthirsty religious belief and the killing of the most innocent and defenseless members of society on an industrial scale, that of children. Margaret Sanger used the pseudoscience of embryology to point to the outer , middle and inner ear, on photos of human fetuses claiming they were gill slits, these lies were repeated to millions of school children. 1930&#39;s Germany great fans and disciples of Margaret Sanger used more evolutionary pseudoscience to describe Jews, Gypsies , and Slavs as obsolete evolutionary branches, the classified them as sub or potential humans.

The distincion being that evidence (according to oxford dictionary) is &quot;The available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid.&quot;  The key phrase being indicating not <b>PROOVING</b>.  Proof is defined as &quot;Facts or documents that can be used to show that something is true.&quot;  Obviously to deny proof, you&#39;d be denying facts and would be willfuly ignorant.  But to say you don&#39;t agree with evidence would be fine because nothing has truly been definitively <b>proven</b>, there is only an indication, as in there can still be reasonable doubt.  <br><br>Another example, we don&#39;t have <b>proof</b> that the sun will rise tomorrow i.e. we cannot be <b>certain</b> of it.

NASA has made no groundbreaking discovery that our sun is the path of an errant astrophysical jet, there is no disruption in the orbit of the planets, and it still travels across the Earth sky as it always has.  So, while we cannot say there is proof that the sun will rise tomorrow, as we cannot be certain, there is plenty of evidence to suggest we&#39;ll be fine.  <br><br>I hope this distinction will be made in the future.

Of course, moderate-length-of-time listener, first-time commenter, as until now I have been humbled at how high-end the thoughts and arguments presented have been--both the ones I agree with and disagree with--and this is simply you quoting mostly people who have died hundreds of years ago! Even concepts that I thought myself familiar with, like the Problem of Evil, and the upcoming episode about Pascal&#39;s Wager, you have (and very likely will) take it a level above and beyond my previous understanding of the concept.<br><br>This episode, however, I feel that I may have something to contribute to the discussion. Repeatedly, the premise was given that religious belief must always be held without evidence--the &quot;blind faith&quot; described by Clifford--and is thus epistemically irresponsible. The only counter-argument given is from William James, that epistemic responsibility can somehow have exceptions, implicitly agreeing that a religious belief must inherently be without evidence.<br><br>William James is clearly the weaker philosopher here, and while I cannot blame him for at least trying to level with Clifford, who was essentially calling him an inherently bad person for his beliefs, you basically demolish his premises by pointing out that, in carving out his exception, he simultaneously justifies anti-vaxxers and marginalizes agnostics. I conclude that the more reasonable belief would be that no such magical exception to epistemic responsibility exists.<br><br>This leads me to level with W.K. Clifford myself, with a counter-argument of my own demonstrating that my own beliefs are not epistemically irresponsible. I argue that one can empirically have an experience with the divine (also known as a revelation), and use that as evidence for their beliefs. Of course, the sheer existence of atheism implies that not everybody experiences a revelation, but if you know a trusted person who does, it might be a bit of a stretch to imply that the person has lost their mind, especially if nothing else about their behavior would imply it. Such occurrences are not entirely uncommon throughout the history of religion (again, there is even a word for it), so I feel it is safe to say that I am not talking out my butt.<br><br>This does not mean that religious thinkers--or, by extension, thinkers in general--are free from epistemic responsibility. I would dare say that one who has never questioned their beliefs believes them for all the wrong reasons, and is highly susceptible to dogmatism to boot. This is not even going over the impact such a person has on others. No, one should not necessarily be afraid of having their beliefs called into question, but instead embrace knowledge! One should strive to learn more about the world and why one should or should not have whatever beliefs they might hold.

The two choices are basically 1)No vaccination and 2) Vaccination. Let&#39;s assume 2) is superior to 1).

The other way round everyone would vaccinate and noone would become ill but there&#39;d be a few fatalities and inconveniences due to problems with the vaccination. So if the damage of vaccination is less than the one of the illness (which it mostly is, and thats even empirically backed up which makes argumenting easier) we should go for vaccination and vice versa. However this only applies if we take a look at the whole picture, if we are the only one not vaccinating we dont get the disatvantages of vaccination and the others still get us decent protection from the illness, so at least for the present that can be considered an viable option.

The entire point of intelligence is the ability to solve unfamiliar problems with insufficient data. Human brains are pretty good at recognising patterns and so deducing the way the nature works, but it usually takes many wrong guesses at fictitious patterns before a correct one is found. Often not even that. Look at stuff like quantum physics - all we have at present are best guesses. Far as I&#39;m concerned, the entire field&#39;s existence is a best guess, but it seems to work up to a point.<br><br>Holding a belief with insufficient evidence is how intelligence works. The more &quot;intelligent&quot; a creature is, the more likely it is to hold onto the correct beliefs. To refuse to act unless absolute, perfect certainty exists brings us all the way back to Ren\u00e9 Descartes - absolute certainly doesn&#39;t exist. Sooner or later we need to accept some things to be true or else we can&#39;t function. I don&#39;t need to understand fluid dynamics in order to hold the belief that my car&#39;s brakes will work when I stamp on the pedal, even though my life depends on it and it could very easily not be true some of the time. We work with what we have, or we don&#39;t work at all.<br><br>Inversely, though - arguing that a &quot;live forced momentous&quot; belief is OK to hold without evidence seems the most backwards to me. I&#39;d argue completely the opposite - the less a belief matters, the more you can hold it in the absence of evidence because... It doesn&#39;t matter. Is vanilla ice cream better than chocolate? I say vanilla, but it literally doesn&#39;t matter because my preferences in ice cream matter only to myself. It&#39;s my business which one I buy because I&#39;ll be the one eating it. Unless you&#39;re somehow offended by me eating vanilla instead of chocolate (in which case I don&#39;t care), then my decision doesn&#39;t matter to you.<br><br>Choosing to accept blind faith in a religion - along with choosing to not vaccinate and such - is far too important of a choice to make in the absence of some kind of corroborating evidence either way. It matters, ergo you should demand more assurance that you&#39;re making the right choice. I&#39;m being asked to stick my hand in one of two boxes. One of them contains a candy bar, the other a meat grinder that I for some reason can&#39;t hear or sense ahead of time. I like having a hand, thus I wouldn&#39;t just pick a box at random and stick mine in there.<br><br>Ultimately, we work with what we have. Sometimes - a lot of times - we make uninformed decisions either because being informed is literally impossible or else because it&#39;s not practical, or else still because it doesn&#39;t matter.

Is Man an insignificant microcosmic occurrence, or does its inseparability from Nature somehow grant it purpose? The precedents for the consideration of these opposing inquiries are, first, to identify the definitive qualities of Mankind; then, to determine what is inherent regarding those qualities within Nature; and then, to inquire holistically and existentially about the significance of the existence of Mankind and Nature relative to one another. Certainly, religious doctrine and the supernatural and anthropocentric morality are not the only qualifiers that determine the relevance of spirituality or even theism. Since it cannot be definitively said that God does indeed exist, the argument hereunder is that it is possible to both value spirituality and believe in a God free of irrational dissent.          <br> The defining qualities of Man are mortality, as man is limited in the universe; rationality, as Man seeks to understand the order of things; and consciousness, as individuals are aware of their mortality and their rationality. As these qualities adhere to the laws of Nature, they are expressed in contingency with the omnirelevant &quot;will&quot; of Nature, the human manifestation of which is the will to learn, to attain, and to impart, a sort of will-to-eternity in concert with the laws of Nature.         <br>And, if God and Nature are both described as omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient, then they are in accordance with space-time, matter, energy and the nature of consciousness. So, God and Nature are synonymous in this regard.       <br> It follows that the whole of Humanity, from society to the individual, is but a measure of an unabridged reality. As such, while we perceive ourselves to be separate from one another in space-time, understanding, and consciousness; our perceptions are limited by our measure within Nature. Therefore, we cannot be aware as Nature is aware, understand as Nature understands, nor exist as Nature exists. That is that Nature encompasses all consciousness, is all that can be understood and is all that exists. So, Man can learn the mechanics, physics and related descriptive sciences of Nature, but cannot objectively comprehend Nature in its subjective entirety.<br> That is not to say that Man should not seek knowledge. It is to say, however, that what an individual professes to know regarding what they have observed is, by nature, subjective. That does not diminish the efficacy of empirical data, as the object of empiricism is to determine how we ought to implement and improve upon current knowledge. The object of empiricism is not to determine objective truths. Moreover, and concerning consciousness, while an individual may conceive of different forms of consciousness, they can never experience consciousness in its most fundamental nor its most complex forms. That is because, the self is a manifestation of human consciousness and to experience a separate and unadulterated form of consciousness, one would have to remove themselves from the experience. Thus, rendering the experience indescribable. In relation to this, there is a theory that consciousness is not predicated upon self-awareness and that consciousness can exist in any integrated system. To put it more simply, according to this theory it is currently plausible that everything may retain a level of consciousness (Oizumi), lending a perceivably brighter outlook on Schopenhauer\u2019s \u201cThe World as Will.\u201d<br>Additionally, there are these theories that demonstrate the vastness of the universe. Thus, offering the humbling realization that Man is infinitesimal relative to the rest of existence. And yet, at the very same instance, inseparable and therefore vital to the structure or identity of the universe: M-Theory, the theory that there are dimensions in excess of four or that there are infinite universes (Kaku); supersymmetric string theory, the theory of the fundamental one-dimensional universe comprised of only subatomic vibrations (Kaku); and chaos theory, the theory that some outcomes may be unpredictable (Forshaw) <br> Reason may also permit a concept that shares certain similarities with many theistic concepts of eternal life. Reasoning in accord with the special theory of relativity and the B-theory of time that states that time does not flow but exists as the fourth dimension in space-time (Besnard). As such, all moments in time are immutable. Therefore, every perceived experience in life is also immutable. In so far as human consciousness is concerned, the perceived quality of life in every moment of life ostensibly determines the overall quality of perception that exists within space-time. Therefore, life may, in essence, be eternal.  <br> To conclude, since Mankind is of Nature, rational spirituality is permitted through the consideration that how we perceive the quality of our lives over time is eternal and makes us a necessary measure of the nature of consciousness. Also, natural theism is permitted by replacing the concept of the supernatural with curiosity and reason as a means to understand Nature, or in essence, come closer to God.", "comment_date": "2016-05-17T12:04:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rumer Priestly", "comment_text": "I encourage everyone to pause the video and read the scrolling comments in the rhombus on the left in the first few seconds of the video.", "comment_date": "2016-05-17T12:04:26Z", "likes_count": 64}, {"comment_by": "DaveTheFreak", "comment_text": "This series does continue to amaze me.

It&#39;s something I&#39;ve had since I was a child and I&#39;ve learned to deal with it. Back in October/November, I caught Whooping Cough from one of the kids I teach who wasn&#39;t vaccinated. Now, I WAS vaccinated as a child, so I thought I would be fine. But I apparently hit the unlucky lottery and caught it anyhow.<br>Whooping Cough sucks. Whooping Cough when you have asthma was nearly a death sentence for me. Even after taking the medicine, all it did was make me noncontagious, not better. I had to ride out the full length of it, which took about 4 months to fully recover from. I thought it was a cold at first, but then I hit Stage 2 and started throwing up almost everything I ate during violent coughing fits. I couldn&#39;t sleep much at night since my lungs would fill with mucus. I managed to stay afloat for a few weeks, but then it all went downhill in late December. I lost about 8 pounds in a week just because I couldn&#39;t eat anything without throwing it back up. I almost never slept, but I kept taking my inhaler because it cleared up my lungs for a little while. I OD&#39;d on my inhaler which messed up my heart pretty bad. I spent 3 days without my inhaler just trying to get off of my dependency on it. I spent Christmas with a friend&#39;s family and they instantly were worried because I looked like I was falling apart and I could barely hold down a small bowl of soup. They made it their mission over the next 4 days to get my appetite back, which they definitely helped with. It took awhile longer, but I eventually made it to Stage 3, which is basically just random coughing fits.<br>But yeah, I nearly died a few times during that episode. Like, really. So when people are like, &quot;It&#39;s my business if my kids are vaccinated&quot;, no. It&#39;s not. The kid I got it from is a super awesome girl. She loves painting and singing, but she was pulled out of school while she got better and missed a lot of stuff and has trouble keeping up with the rest of the class now. I hold no grudge against her because it&#39;s not her fault. It&#39;s her irresponsible parents&#39; fault. They not only hurt their child&#39;s education, but they put both her and MY life on the line for their uninformed decision. Even if they argued that it&#39;s their daughter and they&#39;ll do what they see fit with her, that doesn&#39;t change the fact that they affected me. And what if another student caught it? What if that kid visited their elderly grandmother with a weakened immune system. What you&#39;re actively doing by not vaccinating your child is telling the rest of us that our lives don&#39;t matter to you. And that&#39;s messed up.  But maybe it&#39;s because those of us that need protecting are this faceless mass to them. So, for anyone out there who thinks it&#39;s okay to not vaccinate your child because of pseudo-science:<br>Hello, my name is Kristen. I&#39;m an English teacher that works in Japan. I&#39;m 25 and I have a few medical conditions, but it&#39;s nothing I can&#39;t control on a typical day. I&#39;m not perfect, but I try my best to be the best person I can be. I go out of my way to help others and I work in a job with little reward because seeing the kids smiling and learning brings a lot of meaning to my life.<br>I&#39;m one of the people you endanger when you don&#39;t vaccinate your children.

What most people don&#39;t understand is that atheism, agnosticism and theism do not sit on a scale, they do not fade seamlessly into each other. Agnosticism and gnosticism revolve around purporting to have knowledge, while theism and atheism revolve around belief.<br><br>If you are an agnostic, you do not claim to have knowledge over the existence of God; if you are a gnostic, you DO claim to have knowledge over the existence of God. If you are an atheist, you do not have a belief in a god or gods. If you are a theist, you have a belief in a god or gods. A belief is a conviction, so if you lack a conviction in God&#39;s existence, you do not believe in God: you are an atheist. One or the other, nothing in between.<br><br>Thus we get a Punnet  square with atheism and theism at the top and agnosticism and gnosticism along the side: you can believe in God and claim to know there is one, a gnostic theist; you can lack belief in God and claim no knowledge of his existence, an agnostic theist. These two being the most common combinations. So when asked if one BELIEVES in God, saying you don&#39;t know whether there is one, or you are an agnostic, is not an answer. If you lack conviction there is one, you are an atheist. No middle ground, no grey area.<br><br>However, the problem of what we mean by knowledge comes up: without sufficient evidence for the existence of God, or fairies, or Santa, we might say we have no conviction or belief, but does this lack of evidence mean we know there is no God or fairies or Santa? Of course, we can know inductively, without 100% certainty, we do this all the time, it does not mean we lack any certainty, but we rarely base our beliefs on lack of evidence. All our inductive reasoning is based on observation, experimentation, so we can rule out some hypotheses and substantiate another. The fact that no sufficient scientific evidence exists for something means we can be fairly  certain it does not exists, but knowledge is rarely based on lack of evidence.

Eventually you will be forced to make an assumption that either does not have sufficient evidence to back it up, or relies on a logical fallacy or assumption that does not guarantee the position is correct.<br><br>For example, to completely refute the idea that vaccinations are potentially harmful, you would need to prove that they are incapable of causing harm themselves and do not bear the potential to become harmful given the right set of conditions. However, that&#39;s completely unprovable because it&#39;s outright impossible for ANY virus strain- no matter how de-fanged- to avoid tripping up the immune system. Certain people WILL have adverse reactions to vaccinations and there is no way to tell who will and who won&#39;t, and you have to admit it&#39;s awfully convenient to have those rare adverse reactions downplayed to prevent hysteria. Now, that doesn&#39;t mean that vaccinations are anymore harmful to the human race than peanuts- but that doesn&#39;t exactly make them 100% non-toxic, either. Thus, in reality, you are in fact ignoring even more concrete hard evidence to say that vaccinations are harmless than to say than they are harmful. Of course, this lies in contradiction to the millions of people that receive the vaccination with no adverse side effects. The idea that anti-vaxxers are responsible for the resurgence of near-extinct diseases is also a logical fallacy, as the correlation is not causation, and therefore inadmissible as evidence. <br><br><br>I&#39;m not against vaccinations and I&#39;m highly for them, as overall they are a net gain for society, though I think people tend to get rather immoral when it comes to these sorts of things because it basically boils down to people who aren&#39;t able to get vaccinations for a loved one attacking those willingly giving up that protection and presenting a potential threat. Frankly, both sides are being irrational and immoral to their own degrees, and both are holding views that contradict evidence. I&#39;m just using this debate as an example of how it&#39;s impossible to have a 100% &quot;certain&quot; position. The only thing you can really be sure of in life is that you exist, in some form.
