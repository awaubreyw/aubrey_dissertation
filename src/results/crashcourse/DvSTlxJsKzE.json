How? Yes you can regulate media laws so that the FCC has more power, but that is nowhere near the most contentious issue at the moment.

Regulating how much these companies can spy on us will because of this be a direct cut to the companies profits. They will never accept not spying on people since that would virtually mean a loss of all their income. The issue is that we cant leave facebook since it has such a strong hold on the market and it provides a service a lot of people use. There could theoretically be a facebook competitor but if that ended up happening it would likely also be collecting info to sell ads.<br><br>Ownership matters.
