I really hope this sparks conversation for tomorrow because I have a feeling I will need a lot of motivation to progress as a collective asap, so I can start being practical with how I perceive things so we can persevere. 2 trains, one i would presume normal the other very similar to a resent experience I had on my ps4, that I could not just feel but see differently as well, as were those tasks in said simulation. And being able to create instruments with lights and the environment effecting those lights really did feel like the perfect circumstance. Hope everyone has a blessed night and/or evening. The paradox is what was crazy it didn&#39;t just effect light and sounds on my phone and in my environment, and how the two different perceptions made symmetry, I interacted in a very &quot;immature&quot; way. But I can&#39;t get mad just from the beautiful symmetry between nature and how that symmetry doesn&#39;t effect the people around me at that moment. It&#39;s a confusing but exciting time to say the very least cheers. This time I put myself first. But if you figure out you have to do something because of how it effects the people living in the environment you share, and being able to connect the world in a beautiful and sustainable way that encourages growth based off of concepts really restores my faith in myself and I hope by saying that everyone else effected as well.

Ultimately individuals, or individuals cooperating towards a shared objective, will make decisions that compromise the whole of society/humanity to further their singular/limited interests. You hear of this sort of thinking all the time: the steel company wants to dump waste into Lake Michigan because IT needs a place to dispose of it (despite the fact that this would harm millions of other people); the coal company in Kentucky wants to stripmine entire swaths of hills, despite the devastating legacy costs to the surrounding environment and population; and the chemical company wants to emit pollutants into the air in Texas because it would be the easiest (and cheapest) means of releasing industrial byproduct (even though this will cause acid rain and contaminate the water supply). Oh, and in this paradigm the conflicting parties are not big industry vs environmentalist, but rather big industry entity vs other big industry entity....both ultimately harming others in their competition for increased profits (for themselves) with minimized costs (to themselves).\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-14T20:01:42Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"XoTx7Rt4dig": {"Aggression vs. Altruism: Crash Course Psychology #40": {"channel_id": "UgjBV2XP-UQesXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jack H", "comment_text": "Theres nothing wrong with self interest its rational, natural predictiable and has arguably feuled mankinds greatest achievements.

What is the most vicious obscenity ever perpetrated on mankind? Slavery? The Holocaust? Dictatorship? No. It&#39;s the tool with which all that wickedness is built: altruism.

In 1919, I fled a country that had traded in despotism for insanity. The Marxist revolution simply traded one lie for another. Instead of one man, the tsar, owning the work of all the people, <b>all</b> the people owned the work of all the people. So I came to America: where a man could own his own work, where a man could benefit from the brilliance of his own mind, the strength of his own muscles, the <b>might</b> of his own will. I had thought I had left the parasites of Moscow behind me. I had thought I had left the Marxist altruists to their collective farms and their five-year plans. But as the German fools threw themselves on Hitler&#39;s sword &#39;for the good of the Reich,&#39; the Americans drank deeper and deeper of the Bolshevik poison, spoon-fed to them by Roosevelt and his New Dealists. And so, I asked myself: in what country was there a place for men like me--men who refused to say &#39;yes&#39; to the parasites and the doubters, men who believed that work was sacred and property rights inviolate. And then one day, the happy answer came to me, my friends: there was <b>no</b> country for people like me!

Yet his omission of the definition of altruism lets him portray altruism to his target audience as being valiant. Saying altruism is something heroic for &quot;sacrificing oneself for the welfare of others&quot;. Isn&#39;t that harmful to yourself?\u00a0<br><br>If there were 5 people tied to a railroad and you just happened to be walking on a bridge above the tracks; what would you do if you saw a train coming and made the observation that if you pushed this fat guy off the bridge, it would stop the train and save the 5 people. Would you kill that man to save the other 5 people? This is such bullshit how people push their own ideology on kids and they don&#39;t hold themselves to a standard of neutrality when they have a huge influence. Give kids a basic understanding of economics and raise them without seeding an idea of &quot;I need to help as many people as I can because we are all gray ants working in this system to survive&quot;, and I bet that by today&#39;s standards, they&#39;ll be seen as &quot;inhuman&quot;. This is a sad narrow-minded way to look at things.\u00a0<br><br>There are three options: Liberty, Wealth &amp; Income and Security. You will always try to increase all three but when they&#39;re all connected, tipping the current balance calls on physics and basic shit to create an opposite reaction. Take Poland for example... They get to spend about 35% of what they earn. The rest goes to taxes. They may be allowed to do whatever they want. In a sense, have the same freedoms and rights as other countries like the UK, US and Germany but... Are they really able to do what they want? Telling a slave he can leave whenever he wants as long as he&#39;s ok to travel and wander aimlessly through the desert that surrounds the farm he works on. Kids are being taught that safety trumps fun, compassion and cooperation trumps individuality and pride\u2026 Being selfish is not seen as a virtue, but as something wrong with you.<br><br>As an American, I&#39;m given two options; Religiously capitalist, or Science and welfare. People are confusing these two OPTIONS as solutions. Solutions are set in stone options aren&#39;t limited. \u00a0This guy disappoints me. He gives the audience two options... Aggression or Altruism. Both are a suicidal. Only altruism will spare us from anger and aggression would spare us from creativity/identity deprivation. We&#39;ve already seen the true nature of altruism in the USSR, where the people who worked the hardest and longest were told they needed to give up everything they had worked for to help their fellow people. This guy is painting what&#39;s not altruism as aggression when it&#39;s not\u2026 I choose neither of the options because religion is creating a duty for people to feel guilty if they already do not feel obligated to give everything they can, and the other side belittles us by saying we&#39;re nothing more than an easily replaced card in a house of cards\u2026 all working towards a common goal and putting our interests, aspirations, dreams and our personal goals on the shelf. That they don&#39;t matter and all that does, is the common welfare of the people. If we want to become rich, famous, both or a legend; we must remember that there is no reward without risk. We cannot allow something that has become big and powerful to not take a fall if it mismanaged itself/himself/herself.\u00a0<br><br>Most people say they want to give to the poor when what they really mean is, &quot;I&#39;d feel bad if I didn&#39;t.&quot; They&#39;ve been raised this way and once the mind decides something is fact, it&#39;s very difficult to change it. All I want is for Hank not to portray altruism as the only other way. That self-interest is something to be ashamed of. This channel has a younger audience and young kids are easily impressionable. You are doing them no good in teaching they need to sacrifice themselves for their fellow human.\u00a0<br><br><br>Here is what kids should be taught:\u00a0<br><br>&quot;I swear by my life and my love of it that I will never live for the sake of another man, nor ask another man to live for mine.&quot; - Atlas Shrugged<br><br>Here is what&#39;s being used against them:\u00a0<br><br>&quot;Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.&quot; - John <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoTx7Rt4dig&amp;t=15m13s\">15:13</a><br><br>The bible used to be interpreted as helping your family and yourself first.
