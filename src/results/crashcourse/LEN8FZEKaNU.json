I once attended an 8 hours long play that was the first half of a show, by Ariane Mnouchkine &amp; I once attended a day long (12h total) showing of 3 Moli\u00e8re&#39;s plays in le th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l&#39;Od\u00e9on where at one point they completely opened the doors at the back of the stage, so the people in the street behind the theater could see the play &amp; us &amp; vice-versa.<br><br>The most shocking thing I have seen, though, was at a public theater, with my German teacher in attendance, the first play of Bertolt Brecht, Baal, in it&#39;s first version he wrote in his early twenties to shock the bourgeoisie &amp; proceeded to revise twice afterward because it was just too much, even for him. The main character strolled around naked on stage &amp; he peed on the floor.
