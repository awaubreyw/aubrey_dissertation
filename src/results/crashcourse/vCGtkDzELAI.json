Therefore, like any scientific concept that can&#39;t actually be tested to be right or wrong... its not science. I&#39;d argue is not even a valid philosophical argument. Its more on the level of theology... in that it requires belief and faith in a sort of higher power that has ultimate and full control over your actions. <br><br>I find it strange that none of these philosophers and great thinkers failed to draw connections from determinism to god.

However, it&#39;s not actually deterministic... the result was not determined by some initial state... there are random events such as the appearance of virtual particles and cosmic background radiation and the movements of subatomic particles, which bubbles up into mutations and sudden events in the macroscopic world that do have causes, but not all of which can be traced back to one event. <br><br>This principle CAN be tested. We can prove or disprove this idea via mathematical principles (which Everett already did) and also can one day create a device that can perhaps peer into other realities, or create other realities like they do in Devs. <br>Furthermore, quantum physics shows that this is already the case on the smallest level... that all possibilities exist, but that trying to measure/observe a possibility with precision collapses it into a (likely) random result.<br><br>What do you all think?", "comment_date": "2020-05-17T03:42:27Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "Ugwr_xzPC-0fhGjEzZZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Sam", "comment_text": "Even eating oatmeal is deterministic because a sequence of prior events led you to eat it.

I often say either we have free will, or we don&#39;t. It&#39;s just like liberty, either we have it, or we don&#39;t. The other side of liberty nobody likes talking about these days, responsibility is equally important. Guns don&#39;t shoot themselves, and forks don&#39;t make people fat. People do that.

Anything we do just seems to be an effect of many different factors that caused it. We can\u2019t control most of our emotions, such as sadness or anger, or physical aspects, like hormones or blood pumping, but does that mean we can\u2019t control when we hurt someone too? Is it really not our faults for murder or physical harm if our actions were determined from the beginning? Why are we punishing people for the actions they had no real control over? To me this means that we have some sort of free will or this predicament would have no solution. My solution to this is God\u2019s intervention into our seemingly static lives. (more explanation below)\r<br>\r<br>Do you believe in fate?\r<br> I think our fate is determined from the beginning, but smaller choices in between point A and point Z can be changed with our free will. If God really had every little aspect of all of history planned from beginning to end, we\u2019d all be living a story where God purposely produced pain and suffering into our lives. If we don\u2019t cause bad things to happen, then the only other agent is God. And if the Bible portrays God accurately then that God would not intentionally do that to His creation. Either the Bible is lying that God really cared so much about us that He sent His only son to save us from OUR OWN sin, or God gave us the free will to CHOSE to sin against Him. God would have known we would sin from the start, but by Him adding the option to disobey Him in the first place it reveals His true aspirations of giving us the power of our own personal choice. We can\u2019t ignore all the evidence we find in nature and around us, so perhaps we can\u2019t control every aspect of our bodies or desires (as shown by the video) but a metaphysical agent or something outside this universe influencing our thoughts could break the chain of predetermined actions.

This can only be possible by bestowing to us each different levels of free-will.\u00a0 God knowing the future, deliberately makes certain aspects of our futures capable of &quot;changing&quot; by ourselves, surprising Himself and the celestial host by giving us such different degrees of free-will. We are able to shape our own destinies. The union of predeterminism and free-will, is like a child placed in a sand box supervised by his mother. Child is free to do whatever he wants in the box. This entertains the mother who loves her child. But he is not free to do whatever he likes in the box without consequences, and he can not leave the sand box. Same way, God has us with free-will but this freedom is limited as we grow. And so, in order to receive back love from humankind, God has not made us robots. We are far superior to the animals. We are beings both determined and able to shape our own destinies. As the Ancients have taught, we have souls (life after death), and we determine our own fate, heaven or hell. That special gift has been given to us that we may prove we are ready for the next life, blessed or cursed. <b>That&#39;s why we have &quot;feelings&quot; of moral obligations and responsibility, we feel we must have a control of ourselves, and we sense a conscience that haunts us when we do wrong or abstain from doing right. It is in a way, God talking to us !</b> \ud83e\udd14 Regards", "comment_date": "2020-02-21T20:52:24Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "Ugylg60Ij3KTLjBUisZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "TheReccher", "comment_text": "Determinism is an illusion.

There would be no valid ground on which one could be blamed for anything. As said in the video, determinism doesn&#39;t leave room for responsibility, cause that can only make sense within the free-will concept. Thus, by acting as if free will is something valid and real, we deterministically act better, not just individually, but collectively, because we want for the others to hold us responsible for the good things we do and the bad things we don&#39;t do.

In the physical world there is something called the Heisenberg principle which essentially means you cannot be 100% certain of anything, only 99.999999,,,,% sure, at most. If determinism is made out of the physical world, then it must also adhere to the mentioned principle. Also using reductionism is incomplete. There are factors that we do not truly know just yet so they have to be taken into account. The unknown factor/s are how the world of the small is different to the world of the large. We don&#39;t have a complete explanation of how this occurs just yet aka the theory of everything. Such that an atom can quantum tunnel through an object, yet large objects don&#39;t seem to have this ability, why? This is my only real refutation of Determinism: that we do not know enough to reduce determinism to the smallest possible thing.<br>Example: We know that space dust clumped together to form stars and planets, on which humans eventually evolved on. We know that atoms attract one another and also repel each other when they get to close. But we don&#39;t know how clumping rocks and clumping atoms relate to each other. Because space dust clumps under gravity, but oddly atoms clump because gravity doesn&#39;t exist for them. As you get bigger i.e atoms become molecules, become a gathering of molecules and so on, at what point does gravity start to exist for clusters of atoms? <br>This is at odds because black holes and neutron stars are formed because of immense gravity collapsing atoms into each other. So how can this be if atoms don&#39;t &quot;feel&quot; gravity? <br>We don&#39;t know. And could free will stem from this point or area of don&#39;t know?

The set of conditions C is no longer complete, for there is now an additional condition - my knowledge of the theory &quot;C causes a&quot; - and so we need a new theory, according to which we can predict action a1, from the new set of conditions, C1 (C plus the fact that I know C causes a and the complications that brings about). Now let&#39;s suppose that one of the conditions included in C1 is the fact that I am a dishonest person, Accordingly we can be sure that in our new theory, a1 will be a different act from a, precisely its opposite where it is possible. But now we have a new theory, C1 causes a1,&quot; which takes into account this dishonesty and includes it as a variable in the theory. But suppose I come to know this new theory, thus adding a new condition to the set of condictions C1(C2), Out of dishonesty, I will now act in such a way as to falsify that theory, too. But, of course, a new theory would would predict that also, (as long as I don&#39;t find out about it.) Even if determinism is true, no one can know in advance what they are going to choose, not even a sufficiently &quot;powerfull intellect.&quot; Determinism, then, is not an intelligble thesis.

There is however a triad of logical impossibility common to most Christian reasoning, and that is that three incompatible precepts happily coexist. (Hang in there; free will pops up in a moment...) The three are 1. God is good; 2. God created everything; and 3. God knows past, present, and future.<br>Here&#39;s the difficulty: if God created everything, then God also created Hell. If God knows the future, then even before he created humans, he knew some of them would end up in Hell. This raises the issue of whether this is compatible with his being good.<br>The strongest (yet futile) argument against this is that God gave humans free will, and we get to decide how we will behave. Unfortunately for their reasoning, the question is not whether humans have free will here, but is whether God does. After all, if he knows the future, then he knows which of his creations will freely choose good over evil. Suddenly God&#39;s omnipresence becomes a curse instead of a blessing for Christian religious logic.<br>This brings up the concept of faith: faith is acceptance of something that cannot be logically determined. (There&#39;s that word (determined!&quot;) Thus it is possible for Mormons and other Evangelists to believe within an illogical framework; a possible difficulty for them is to recognize that it is indeed faith and not logic that is the basis for their beliefs.<br>Just to be fair, they are not alone in their faith: all of science and thus all scientists predicate their entire study and profession upon the unprovable assumption that the real world is knowable. This is an assumption, because there is simply no way to prove it, just as there is no ultimate way to prove or disprove determinism. Basing their lives on pure faith is truly a bane for scientists. With this understanding, we get to logically acknowledge that, if nothing else, the one thing both Evangelists and scientists have in common is a faith in unprovable assumptions!", "comment_date": "2019-06-10T08:59:36Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "Ugzb0n5_K-TsjkgJKdR4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Justin Bear Attack", "comment_text": "This is just the &quot;fine tuning&quot; argument that theists use to help themselves understand the concept of the deity they worship reworked to help us understand the concept of the future. The future, like a deity, is just a concept. &quot;Look at all the things that had to happen in order for me to be right here, right now, experience the things I&#39;m experiencing at this exact moment!&quot; is a fun high idea that comes from over-analyzing the past. Since hindsight is 20/20 and regret can ruin our present, the idea that the future has already been written is can be comforting. That way we don&#39;t feel bad about our decisions that don&#39;t go our way. If we just did what we were going to do regardless of any ability to do something else, then why regret that decision? <br><br>The truth is, though, that the future doesn&#39;t exist in any form other than conceptual. The past is also conceptual. We have nothing but now. We have ways of describing the past and capturing it on video even, but when we were recording it, it was still just the present. If someone could go back in time and observe us throughout our yesterday, they would likely see us making the same choices that they (being from the future) already knew we would be making. For us, though, it wouldn&#39;t be yesterday all over again, it would be our present still. We wouldn&#39;t make the same decisions because we have no choice in the matter, but because we would be using our past experiences and knowledge to act as we do and make the choices that we do. If you were to go to the future and watch my tomorrow, it wouldn&#39;t be tomorrow to me, it would be my future&#39;s present. Going back to your present with knowledge of my future wouldn&#39;t matter. I might do the things you saw when you visited the future, but I might do something different.

Determinism is based on the BELIEF that everything is determined and materialistic to the core. The belief that there\u2019s no soul and that our thoughts are nothing but a chemical/neurological reaction that leads to the ideas and arguments I have such as this. However, not all beliefs are true.  So there\u2019s a possibility that This deterministic Belief is wrong. The ideas that the mind is nothing but a tool for a soul with utter free will. A god that is the initial constant/causer of everything is utterly free to do whatever it wants to do and therefore isn\u2019t obligated to do one act over the other. Because there\u2019s no chain reaction before him that leads him or his decisions or actions to a deterministic outcome. But a being totally free from causation but it\u2019s the cause of everything else. The initial uncaused causer.  This being WILL NOT be bounded by any form of determinism because there\u2019s nothing else that bounds him or effects him to act a certain way. A truly free being with a truly free will that is not made of simpler components but he\u2019s himself one and whole in entity. And this being is capable of creating souls (from/by him and his power) that can ALSO think freely with free will.   <br>Free will begin \u2014&gt; gives freewill souls to other beings (humans).   <br><br>And since god exits by logical necessity (as the uncaused causer)  and his attributes (like his free will) exist without any obligatory deterministic means by logical necessity,  then, humans souls (which he created with free will) has the possibility that they exist with a true free will of thoughts (not actions), free will of thoughts means we can think whatever we want and that the mind/brain is the only tool that we use to manifest from our souls our free will/ideas.  The brain is nothing but a machine the soul uses to think free willy, legs are nothing but a machine that the soul uses to walk in this physical realm.  The eyes is nothing but a tool (bio machine) the soul uses to see.  The arms are nothing but a tool/bio machine the brain uses to grab things and do things with it.  The same applies to everything in our bodies.  It\u2019s nothing but a flesh robot that the soul wears so it can act quasi-freely from his free will of mind.  <br>Free will is the idea that we decide our decisions (which comes from our souls) and that brain/body is nothing but a tool which the soul uses. This tool doesn\u2019t control our thoughts even if it effects it directly when there are neurological or chemical malfunctions.  This may conclude that the machine (to think freely  is flawed) but doesn\u2019t mean the ideas from the souls are, or in anyway less free from its utter free will. <br>For example.  If i have the verbal FREEDOM of speech,  but, my mouth/tongue  is flawed and dysfunctional, this doesn\u2019t conclude that I don\u2019t have the freedom of speech, I just have to use other means, like a robotic voice instead of a biological ones like Steven Hawkins did.  <br>The same concept applies with free will. If I have a flawed/dysfunctional brain that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have the free will (in the soul) to think freely.  I do, but it\u2019s not expressed or manifested in the physical realm. Only in the metaphysical realm. This means, the ones that are sane are going to be judged by their sanity. And the ones that are biological insane will not be judged for the lack of their insanity. And this conforms with the Islamic Belief. That the mad man which has a dysfunctional brain will not be judged by god between heaven and hell, for he didn\u2019t have the means to express his free will which exists in his soul, and will go straight to heaven,  or..  be tested by other (metaphysical) means. <br><br>Ps. We can still have determinism and free will.  Just don\u2019t confuse determinism and pre-determinism.   In the theistic argument I presented above. One can have free will and be determined (and this determination comes with his decisions). The idea that everything that is happening is supposed to happen this way, and its supposed to happen BY YOUR FREE WILL.  So if everything leads to a specific determinate incident in time by determinism.   This determinism includes all humanities\u2019 FREE WILL ideas as well.   <br><br>We all live however we like by our free will and all these FREE will decisions will lead to a specific determined outcome.

If like I do you do believe that absolutely nothing is determined then you can believe in free will.

The concept of causality would then have been created by mankind to explain a world that in itself neither need to nor can be explained. Same goes for basically every abstract concept such as order, truth, moral to only name a few. What is really interesting about this theory is that it is in itself more scientific than the determinism on which is based science. The falsifiability of a theory is essential for it to be considered a scientific theory (Karl Popper). Yet, it is impossible to refute the determinism of all things since not knowing the cause of a specific event doesn\u2019t prove that it doesn\u2019t exist. When the theory of existentialism could be proven wrong by finding the primary cause that would the existence of everything. The idea that human existence preceded meaning, logic, and causality would then be the most plausible scientific theory which has yet to be refuted.

I think its quite important to say this, because Libertarianism is often put off as having no serious basis.  Before i researched fo my essay i also thought in this way. It is actually not necessarily the case that Libertarians think that 1) Only our feelings are a good reason to  believe that we are free. 2) A Libertarian does not have to believe in body-mind-dualism. 3) A Libertarian is not necesarily somebody who believes in agent causation. <br><br>1) Some Libertarians justify their view by saying, that there are no good reasons to think Determinism has to be true. For example they might say, that the laws of  nature are not supporting the idea of it or that in neurosciences there might only be a korrelation of mental (feeling, belives....) and neuronal states, but not a causal one . So there is not only the emotion-releted justification of this thesis. They might say that, as long there is no good reason to think Determinism is true, we can stick to our feeling.<br><br>3) There are also Libertarians believing in event causation instead of agent causation. Libertarians do not necesserily say that it is wrong, that f.ex. a person might be formed by socialisation or sth. Also they do not necessarily deny causation - but just a deterministic version of it. So accoridng to some of them causation does not necessarily mean that if event A happens, B necesssarily has to follow. They might interprete it f.ex. rather as a probabilistic relation. According to this understanding, a decision can be changed til the action actually happens. That means also that indeterminism has not to be thought of as lacking of causes and as  only being set into relation with cases of luck. You do not have to deny causation to deny determinism - they are two differant things. <br><br>2) Again, Libertarians do not have to compleeetely deny the results of scientific research - they can just interprete them differently than a determinist would do. Since they do not have to be agant causalists there is also no reason for them to necessarily be a mind-body-dualist.", "comment_date": "2019-04-22T23:01:13Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "UgyHM-baAhRa0ETAEtx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Wade Tisthammer", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCGtkDzELAI&amp;t=4m42s\">4:42</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCGtkDzELAI&amp;t=5m03s\">5:03</a>.

If we are made in the image of God why are we selfish and why do we lie and steal and cheat from our mother&#39;s womb? If we were born in the image of God why did Jesus say that we must be born again? That is because we are created in the image of the devil, and this is why we must be born again or we cannot see the kingdom of heaven! <br>                 Adam and Eve &quot;were&quot; created in the image of God in the beginning before the fall of Man into sin! But ever since the fall of Man into sin, every son and daughter born from Adam until now, is Born Into the image of the devil... When you become born again through genuine repentance and faith alone in Jesus Christ, then and only then is the image of God restored within the soul through the regenerating power of the Holy Spirit, and this in turn crucifies and kills the image of the Devil Within our flesh and conforms it to the image of Christ within the spirit...<br><br>             Sinners do not have free will... Sinners are bound by iniquity... Enslaved to sin! Only those who have been born again by God have been given a free will.  Jesus Christ told the Jews in John chapter 8, that if they had continued in Christ&#39;s word, they would be his disciples and the truth would make them free.  The Jews asked Jesus saying; &quot;how shall we be made free? we have never been in bondage to anyone&quot; ...  Jesus Christ replied; &quot;whoever sins is a slave to sin; and a slave does not abide on God&#39;s green earth forever!  But a son or a daughter abides forever.. therefore if the Son of God sets you free, you shall be free indeed&quot;.....John chapter 8 nkjv<br><br>              2nd Timothy Chapter 2 declares that;  <br>         Sinners are held captive and bound by sin enslaved by the devil taken captive by Satan to do his will... In other words, Sinners do not have free will, but there will is bound by Satan and they are enslaved to sin and iniquity!<br><br>              Did Lazarus raised himself from the dead? Did Lazarus make a decision for Jesus? Not at all... Jesus Christ by his own eternal power and choosing raised Lazarus from the dead... in just the same way, this is how the power and authority and sovereignty of God works in a sinner&#39;s life it is by God&#39;s Own will and choosing... <br>           Jesus Christ told his disciples in John chapter 15v16 that they did not choose him but that Christ has chosen them... The scriptures declare through Jesus Christ Our Lord that many are called but few are chosen... Matthew chapter 22 nkjv... <br>               The book of 1st John declares that for those who genuinely love God through Jesus Christ Our Lord, we only love him because he first loved us!

Which means that x and y depend on each other and are the cause of each other. In a deterministic view, the past is cause of the future, but the future is also cause of the past.<br>A good argument against determinism is the humean argument : we never observe causality.We see actions following other actions. And we interpret this as if the following actions are the necessary <i>result</i> of the previous actions. But this interpretation doesn&#39;t seem to be logically necessary.

I will emphasize here that we can interact with and influence the minds of others and potentially cause them to substitute one belief for another, and treat others a certain way so as to influence their desires and/or temperament. Once we know this, if we agree with Kant and W.K. Clifford about our moral duty and epistemic responsibility, then we can recognize that changing people&#39;s beliefs (from incorrect beliefs to true beliefs learned from evidence-based science) and properly interacting with them (in ways that don&#39;t cause their desires or temperaments to be hostile or antagonistic toward you and your goals) are actions we can and even should consider ourselves responsible to take.<br><br>Even in a deterministic world, this seems to be the correct conclusion. We know that we can change their brains in ways that cause physical changes, so we know our actions could make people and the world better. Note: none of this changes the physical circumstances of the recipients before they receive this attention; they will either be mentally (aka physically) open for these positive changes, or they won&#39;t be. But if they are, and if you happen to be the only person who can or will be able to help them, is that not your duty? And, since you don&#39;t know exactly who will need your help in order to improve their lives, and you don&#39;t even know exactly what all the true beliefs are (if they can be known or numbered), we are called to action. At any given time, you only know what you currently know, so actively rout your ignorance and increase your knowledge. Experience what you can and increase your wisdom. Observe those around you and the beliefs they express and act upon, pay attention for exhibitions of false beliefs and see if you can identify the exact part of their beliefs that are false; see how these false beliefs impact those around them or even themselves.<br><br>Clearly we can see the potential here for improving something less that is currently than ideal. Some false beliefs are harmful to humans, other living beings, and the environment, like being against modern medicine when ill or injured, or refusing to learn the proper way to use weapons or drive a car or handle fire or anything dangerous, or dehumanizing others, or taking advantage of the weak, or causing fear and distrust by being afraid and distrustful of others different from you, or by practicing social behaviors that damage relationships and perceptions of the selves and the others, or by being greedy and ignoring externalities caused by selfishness (e.g. pollution from energy and transportation, cruel animal treatment for cheap and accessible meat), etc etc.<br><br>So, to me, this tells us that we have a responsibility and duty to further our own knowledge, reach out to others, interact with them in healthy ways, and help educate them to reach further knowledge for themselves as well. I mean...once we know this, we&#39;re either gonna do it or we aren&#39;t (&#39;cuz determinism), but if I can successfully argue that it is our responsibility, whether or not we end up actually deterministically being caused to do it or not, learning of the duty and accepting the duty is still something that could cause any of us to take upon ourselves that duty and act on it and, thereby, possibly make the world a better place. Meaning I feel compelled to share this with all of you, some of whom may be convinced and then feel the same compulsion themselves and act on it, spreading the message further. It continues to spread to all who can be reached by it, changing whom it will along the way. It acts like a virus, goes viral, and becomes a meme (the original Dawkins definition).<br><br>Why do we want this? The more people who understand that we are not ultimately responsible for either who we are nor our current state that leads to our actions, and that troubled people who act at odds with society and/or the law can potentially be rehabilitated to help shape their minds closer to a state where they can more easily behave in a manner safe for reintegration back into society, then the more harmony and understanding we can spread, the more work will be done to help the unfortunate (it seems more fitting to use this term in a deterministic universe than, say, &quot;evil&quot;), the more crime we will end, the more impoverished we will uplift, the more peace we will substitute for violence, the more true knowledge we can acquire and achievements we can accomplish.<br><br>...kudos to anyone getting through all this.", "comment_date": "2018-12-01T10:20:41Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "UgyRamt55KtyBygP1Ox4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Dan Scannell", "comment_text": "Randomness fits into all this somehow.

Didn&#39;t we already have the discussion of whether the universe was cause and effect when we discussed God? In my opinion, the free will debate is very similar to the God debate. We&#39;d discussed &quot;infinite regress&quot;- which is exactly what cause and effect is. If an effect requires cause, wouldn&#39;t that have to go back to infinity? And we know that, as science stands now, the universe is 13.8 billion years old, not infinite. Most observable effects do require causes.

Someone went out and discovered, experimented, then organized their thoughts into a book. They&#39;ve used their minds to decide how the data they&#39;re reviewing fits into the world. In other words, knowledge originates in the mind. Writing a fiction novel is a similar idea. We have a vast, <b>huge</b> amount of character, plot, setting, and writing style options to choose from. And the ones I choose can be chosen at random or based on my preferences.<br><br>This argument could probably be easily picked apart, and I welcome interlocutors to do so, but in sum my argument is as follows:<br><br>Hard determinism is based on cause and effect. Cause and effect would be considered an infinite regress. Infinite regresses are impossible because the universe is finite years old. Therefore, hard determinism can&#39;t possibly be true.<br><br>In addition:<br>God created us in his image. This could mean he implanted in us his ability to change fate. If God created the universe and started the chain of cause and effect, and he implanted in us a far less powerful but similar ability, then we have the ability to create effects without cause.

That is, since we are all just a bunch of atoms and molecules interacting and combining according to very arcane and abstruse mathematical rules, our very thoughts, being a function of our brains, are merely the pre-determined side effects of these rules. (And since mathematical rules/laws of physics are absolute and absolutely infinite, everything is these rules; there are no distinctions between the rules and the objects which are said to act and interact according to these rules because everything is a direct and utter function of the laws of physics\u2026in which case, how is it possible to claim the laws of physics actually govern anything?  To say they govern themselves is pointless redundancy. )\r<br>\r<br>And this completely destroys the deterministic argument against free will.  Because what this means is that there is no such thing as truth.  All ideas are equally valid, since according to deterministic protocol all ideas, being a function of brains governed by the inexorable laws of physics, are a function of the same mathematical rules.  This being the case, it is impossible to make the claim \u201cthere is no such thing as free will, is true\u201d or \u201cthere is such a thing as free will, is false\u201d since both ideas are a function of brains governed by the exact same rules.  And this is why they must and do appeal to a \u201csuperior enlightenment\u201d based upon their elevated mathematical prowess.

But, again, according to the very argument against free will, itself, there is no such thing as a true thing versus a false thing since every idea is the product of the same deterministic rules.  When people are not actually free to learn, because their minds are entirely governed by the laws of physics, then by definition they cannot actually know anything.  To learn is to presuppose a difference between knowing and not knowing, and to presuppose a difference between a good idea (rational, or true) and a bad one (irrational, or false).  If there is no such thing as free will (the individual application of perceived knowledge\u2026between a true thing/good thing and a false thing/bad thing, either based upon contextual circumstance or upon foundational philosophical assumptions), and all beliefs and actions are merely a function of brains which are all equally and absolutely governed by mathematical rules, then there can be no difference.  There can be no real ideas, which means there can be no real thought.  Which means there can be no thought at all.  Which means there can be no consciousness.  Which means that people like Stephen Hawking and Sam Harris cannot claim that free will is an illusion, as though this is some truth that they can actually know, and know as true, and of which they should seek to convince others, as though making the point is anything but a colossal waste of time.

If a man is free and chose to break an rule of conduct, it&#39;s the right of the man who was harmed to demand that the man in charge of punishing crime punish the perpetrator. If a man is not free, however, the beliefs, thoughts and actions of all the men involved in the previous scenario are also determined. The old joke come to mind.

The thing that determines the perception of free will, is whether or not the individual perceives their conscious experience as a product of the physical world, or the physical world as a product of consciousness. I am humble enough to know that my entire perception of the physical world, is a conscious projection. I never actually interact with a physical world outside of this subjective experience. Conscious experience of the universe is the only thing we are actually sure of. There doesn&#39;t even need to be a physical universe. If the physical universe is a projection of consciousness, then all the limitations that predetermine outcomes, are a choice made through free Will.<br><br>So why would a singular consciousness or collective consciousness impose limitations? The simple answer is that unlimited consciousness is undefined without limitation. Without being defined, conscious experience ceases to exist, returning the collective consciousness to a singular consciousness, which instantaneously limits itself, expanding conscious experience simultaneously. This is why in physics, we find proof of both nothing before everything,  and everything from nothing; at the same time, we find evidence that the universe is layers of limited possibilities, with the only thing anchoring reality being individual and the shared conscious perspective. Essentially, we are simply unaware that we always have free Will, because the true choice is the perspective, and not between the limited actions we can take within our perspective. <br><br>There is a conscious experience where we are all aware of this truth. In that place, individuals see themselves as part of the shared conscious experience, and limit themselves in a way where everyone is cared for as if they are caring for themselves. There is also a place where there is no perception of the collective experience, and it&#39;s full of suffering.

Everything we do is due to prior causes/our genetics/our brain structure/brain and body chemistry. <br><br>So how can people be held accountable for their actions? Well actually they cant be but..... if someone cant fit into our society eg a murderer they must be separated for the greater good of everyone else. They shouldnt be punished apart from being separated. They should be treated properly as scientifically accurate as possible. For example say a serial killer. He should be treated as though he just has a different brain than most other people and treated almost like a wild animal who terrorises a town. If there was a wild tiger on the loose in a town we wouldnt want the tiger punished if it killed people, we would want it moved to a safe location or put in a nice zoo if necessary where it can be safe and roam freely and be happy. Worst case scenario is we put a bullet in its head if we cant capture it. <br><br>Humans are the same only as they are not wild animals many humans can also be rehabilitated. So someone who commits robbery should be separated and our best efforts should be put in to try teach them that stealing is not the best way to go about things and that if everyone stole it would cause utter chaos. We try teach them/rehabilitate them and get them back into society again. <br><br>Some people may never be able to be rehabilitated such as a serial killer just like the tiger cant be taught to be friendly to people in the street, it\u2019s a wild animal and the serial killer is more than likely impossible to change. So we should set up a prison but have it as nice as possible for them, where they can live life as best they can in there and try make them feel as free as possible without actually being a danger to anyone. Not lock them up in a dark small cell and handcuff them all the time and throw away the key but treat them as humans, bring them on trips in a very safe manner, give them psychologists and psychiatrists. Talk to them and try see if they can explain their behaviour and see if they can give tips on how to make the prison more comfortable for them etc. Let friends and family visit whenever they want in a safe way. Treat them almost like they are in a hospital situation but they arent \u201csick\u201d they are just different than other people and were unlucky to have that brain. Let them paint and watch movies and play sports and we can even study them with their permission and learn about the neuroscience of psychopaths so we can try prevent it in the future.

Free will is real, not an illusion.  The feeling OF free will is likely an illusion due to the delay between sub-neural computations and binding to a single faked moment of physical experience of the external world.  <br>It&#39;s most important to understand that fuzzy logic is a process that imagines competing outcomes then sets course.  This is similar to a friend telling you to &quot;do something&quot; as mentioned in the video.  Yet in fuzzy logic, &quot;you&quot; are telling yourself to &quot;do something&quot;.  Free will is provided across this space between formed intent for a future outcome, then backing and filling between fuzzy and classicalization while encountering interference and competition from the external world.  <br>The &quot;I&quot; is a oneness and centralization of the destinations, and previous criteria, goals, likes, etc. This is not reducible. <br>No part of the brain points to it being a deterministic information processor until reaching the auto/motor.

But this account proffered by strict materialism is reductive and cannot yet (and may never) account in a satisfactory way for consciousness, deep ethical realism, mystery and the mystical, and more. You can find robust intellectuals offering an alternative metaphysics (to strict materialism) \u2013 they are reasonable, deeply realistic, wise, not reductive in the least, and they are completely open to evolution and everything else which is truly scientific. You can find them especially in the Aristotelian / Thomistic tradition, although more generally you will find the same sort of sanity and capaciousness from within the great Classical tradition which is so much the bedrock of our Western Civilization. (If you&#39;re interested I can throw out a few specific thinkers.) <br><br>The widespread intuition about free will \u2013 the (almost) ineradicable instinct that we are in fact free in at least some of our actions \u2013 may be a type of evidence. When taken together with deep structures of society like language and even thought itself, the realism of free will is reflected with remarkable force and consistency across and throughout our experiences, intuitions, institutions, and traditions of thought, diffused and dispersed so immanently as to be almost imperceptible at first. But without the ontological reality of free will, so much as we know it becomes actually unintelligible \u2013 until deniers inevitably and unselfconsciously smuggle free-will right back into the conversation! To take the claim seriously is to be more cautions and maybe agnostic about free will until we have more and better evidence, both from empirical science as well as rigorous philosophical thought and the integration thereof.

The problem is the insistence to add &quot;all things are thid way&quot; to the end of philosophies. To say we have no free will is crazy, but to say we have full control of ourselves is ignorance. Though my body may use chemicals to tell me I&#39;m hungry, i can choose not to eat. Though my body may give me a craving for a specific type of food, i can choose to eat something different. On the other hand, if you are hit by a sudden uncontrollable wave of emotion and act on it, did you have free will? Not entirely, and that&#39;s proven.

While we still experience the physical, we are elevating our physical mental structures and forming logical thoughts on higher subject matter. While I am not outrightly an opponent to naturalistic evolution (this is a subject which can be extensively debated in my opinion), to conclude that such a high level of thinking and mental processes is simply a matter of the evolution of man&#39;s body and mind from a primordial species seems to be a bit rash. While evidence may seem to point (to some extent) towards a common ancestry between man and ape, it would seem to me that such a high level of intelligence which goes far beyond man&#39;s ability to merely rationalize solely on sensory experience. In other words, man&#39;s ability for elevated thought processes seems disconnected from mere physical creation and bespeaks of some sort of higher, intelligent existence. <br>     Now, you might be asking where this is going or how this connects to the subject of free will or determinism. In this way a connection is made: as rational creatures, able to comprehend physical experiences and contemplate higher thoughts and use abstract thinking, a trait dissimilar to any other creature, this seems to lead to the logical conclusion that we are innately born with the ability to judge and discern. What purpose would that ability serve if it means we cannot actually use it? If we are products of evolution without any higher intelligence being involved, is this a flaw in nature? More clearly put, is our natural ability to think and reason essentially worthless, despite the fact that we have it? Of course, one could argue that our ability to reason is really just an illusion, and that since our physical capabilities are contingent on physical reality (such as mental processes), we are essentially predisposed to act a certain way, regardless of our desire to have governance over ourselves. Yet this argument fails in my opinion. Ultimately, a thing is true or it is not. Everything is subject to reality in some way, this concept is the idea of fact. So that the world has its courses and obeisance to natural law, yet it cannot be known for certain exactly in which way it will follow it, even if we can very closely predict its path. A tornado has a million different direction it could go, and we may be able to accurately predict which way it goes. Yet despite this, we are still unable to PROVE or declare with absolute certainty which path it will take. This slight bit of uncertainty is enough to show that objects, while subject to set laws, do not necessarily have to follow any given path. As there is no way to tell for absolute certainty what an object will do or which path it will follow, one cannot say with certainty that it&#39;s path was determined. Same for humans. While we may be predictable and predisposed to certain behavior due to biological or genetic influences, our actions are ultimately not physically determined because we cannot claim with absolute certainty what we will do or the exact consequences of our actions. It only seems reasonable, then, to believe that we are definitely in control of what we do, how, and why, despite many influential factors.From a creationist perspective ( I am a creationist, Roman Catholic), it is believed that God foresees our fate, but He ultimately allows our fate to be put in our hands by means of our actions (which are ultimately governed by our reason, intellect, and will). <br>     In sum, I think the idea that we are not ultimately in control of ourselves is a concept set on a very tenuous foundation, and I might even add it is an attempt to excuse ourselves from misdeeds and guilt. This is a subject which does require a bit more in-depth dialectic discussion, but I feel strongly that there is little in the way of substance to support the fundamental views of determinism.", "comment_date": "2017-11-22T05:07:32Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "UgwKosE-acYW1-yKiTt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Juan Carlos", "comment_text": "Why I&#39;m I single?

If you had made a decision, and you went back to watch yourself make the decision a hundred thousand times, would you ever choose differently. Logic would say no, but experimentally we have no way of knowing unless it happens.

The source of this notion in the West is a of adequate understanding of the concept, particularly as it is expounded in Islamic teachings. In the East, it has gained influence because of decline and backwardness.<br><br>It is fairly well-known that whenever individuals or historical communities fail to reach its goals and ideals, for whatever reason, they console themselves with words such as &#39;luck &quot;accident,&quot; &quot;destiny,&quot; &quot;fate.&quot;<br><br>The Most Noble Messenger, peace and blessings be upon him, expressed himself eloquently on this matter An age will come for the people of my community when they will commit sin and inequity, and in order to justify their corruption and pollution, they will say: &#39;God&#39;s fate and destiny decreed that we act thus.&#39; If you encounter such people, tell them I disown them.<br><br>Belief in fate and destiny does not prevent man from striving to reach his goals in life. As those who have the necessary religious knowledge realize, Islam calls on human beings to strive to the utmost in improving their lives, both morally and materially. This is, in itself, a powerful factor in intensifying the efforts man makes.<br><br>One of the Western thinkers who has an inadequate understanding of fate and destiny is Jean-Paul Sartre. He imagines it is impossible simultaneously to believe in a fate and destiny determined by God and in the freedom of man, and that it is, therefore, necessary to choose either belief in God or the freedom of man: Because I believe in freedom, I cannot believe in God, because if I believe in God, I will have to accept the concept of fate, and if I accept fate, I will have to renounce freedom. Since I am attached to freedom, I do not believe in God.<br><br>However, there is no contradiction between belief in fate, on the one hand, and the freedom of man, on the other. While regarding God&#39;s will to be universal in scope, the Noble Qur\u2019an also ascribes a free and active role to man, describing him as capable of consciously fashioning his own destiny with a knowledge of good and bad, ugly and beautiful, and the capacity to choose between them.<br><br>We have shown the path to man, and he is free to choose the right path and be thankful or to choose the path of ingratitude. (76:3)<br><br>Whoever wishes for the eternal abode and strives for it as needed will find his efforts rewarded. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCGtkDzELAI&amp;t=17m19s\">17:19</a>)<br><br>Those who on the Day of Judgment seek refuge in determinism and say:<br><br>If God wished, we would not worship other than Him (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCGtkDzELAI&amp;t=16m35s\">16:35</a>)<br><br>are rebuked for attributing their own sinfulness and error to divine will and fate.<br><br>In none of the verses of the Qur\u2019an are the corrupt and evil deeds of individuals or societies attributed to fate and destiny. Equally, fate and destiny are not depicted as obstacles to a corrupt and polluted society&#39;s reforming itself. Not a single verse can be found in which God&#39;s will has supplanted man&#39;s will, or in which it is said that men started to suffer because of fate and destiny.<br><br>The Qur\u2019an repeatedly mentions the wrath of God that will overtake the tyrannical and corrupt, bringing painful punishment in its wake.<br><br>Since God is extremely loving and merciful to His servants, having bestowed countless bounties on them, and is, at the same time, clement and ready to accept repentance, He always keeps open for the sinner the path of return to purity and rectitude. God&#39;s acceptance of repentance is, in itself, a great instance of His mercy.<br><br>Although the scope of man&#39;s will is greater and more extensive than that of all other known living creatures and plays a more creative role, his will has effect only in areas delimited for his activity and deeds by God. He cannot, therefore, accomplish everything he wants throughout his life.<br><br>It often happens that man decides to do something but however hard he tries, he is unable to accomplish it. The reason for this is not that God&#39;s will opposes itself to man&#39;s will and prevents him from doing what he wishes. It is rather that in such cases some unknown external factor which lies beyond the scope of man&#39;s knowledge and control creates obstacles in his way and prevents him from attaining his goals.<br><br>Both individuals and societies constantly encounter such obstacles. Considering the fact that in the natural realm there is no cause without an effect and no effect without a cause, and that our means of perception are limited to this world and to the human realm, it should not be difficult for us to accept that our aspirations may not be fulfilled as we desire.<br><br>God has set billions of factors to work in the order of being. Sometimes those factors are apparent to man, at other times they remain unknown to him and cannot be incorporated in his calculations. This, too, relates to fate and destiny, but not only does it not result in depriving man of free will or prevent him from striving to attain satisfaction in life; it also guides him in both thought and activity and imbues the very depths of his being with greater vitality. He seeks to augment his knowledge and identify, as precisely as possible, the factors that pave the way for attaining greater success in life. Belief in fate and destiny is then a potent factor in advancing man toward his aims and ideals.<br><br>For further research - click &gt;&gt;&gt;  <a href=\"https://www.al-islam.org/god-and-his-attributes-sayyid-mujtaba-musawi-lari/lesson-21-improper-interpretation-faith-and\">https://www.al-islam.org/god-and-his-attributes-sayyid-mujtaba-musawi-lari/lesson-21-improper-interpretation-faith-and</a>", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T19:21:25Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "Ugw4_MTUxdgP52ucjlZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Timex 17", "comment_text": "It was determined that I would write this comment", "comment_date": "2017-09-12T12:56:19Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "UgxgnUJhLYnsuGRPMOJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "VIAl", "comment_text": "Most privilege theory is determinist.", "comment_date": "2017-09-11T06:48:28Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "UgzfGefEjNs8D1TWarZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Tappy", "comment_text": "Sorry to burst your bubbles @crashcourse but the fact that libertarian free will feels good is not it&#39;s best argument.

Plus, it is not even necessary for an agent to physically act in order to be free. At minimum an agent has to AT LEAST will to do X or refrain from doing X in order to be free. So if someone pushes me down the stairs it is not the case that I need to defy gravity to be free, but to at least will not to fall even though I am subject to physical laws.

Sarah in her first trip travels into the future but she does not know when. When she arrives, the first thing she sees is a very straight alley with a bar to the right and a pink house in the end of the alley. Sarah decides she is going to investigate the bar to the right. When she looks in into the window, Sarah spots a pair of eyes very similar to hers, there is a Sarah inside the bar ordering a cup of water and while she was waiting she looked into the window to then see her past self. Sarah that is not in the bar just like the other version of herself assumes that that must be herself, but from a different time.<br> Now, in her second trip, she travels to the past. She lands in a garden property of a new house that&#39;s getting painted pink. Sarah approaches the man that&#39;s painting it and she&#39;s told to get more paint. Unfortunately, the place where Sarah gows to buy the paint has ran out of pink paint and zo Sarah has to buy a lot of yellow paint. So then the house is painted yellow. <br>Five years later Sarah finds herself very thirsti so she spots a bar in an alley and goes to order water. As she looks into the window she sees herself, her past self, an encounter she had completely forgotten during the five years of time travel. When she had finished the cup of water, she stepped out of the bar and looked at the beautiful house in the end of the alley, a beautiful yellow house. <br>Right, story time over. In my interpretation of time, I see the future in a superposition, therefore you must get to that specific moment in time for it to lock down into something. In the case of Sarah, seeing herself in the bar accidentally locked that place in time, meaning, that Sarah had to be there in the bar at that time (Unless you want to create different and parallel timelines). Yet the house, even though the young Sarah saw it pink, it&#39;s now yellow. That&#39;s because when Sarah traveled back in time and changed the color of the house that too was in superposition and it got locked to the fact that the house was yellow. Of course that is all if timetravel was posible. But all this hasnt answered the question, are we free or not? The answer is that if the theory is right, we are free. Since the future can be anything and is everything at the same time depending on what you do while you measure it, a chain of actions of cause to effect (everybody&#39;s favorite way of understanding time, except, maybe whovians) is generated by your action, that could have been any other but yet you decided it was that.

Ants, for instances, are one most perfectly controlled type of creature, but does a worker ant have any discretion in it actions? You can see ants making choices very clearly, they move a bit, then stop check all the things that ants check, but still seem to act slightly confused, then a choice is made and off they go again. Now, we know there are lots of factors determining their actions, so why do they ever show any &#39;doubt&#39;? <br>Well, its a good guess that they have come across an anomaly of some kind, there is no one predetermined course of action available. This means that there needs to be a tie breaker. So, for that tiny instance the ant has free will, before returning its happier state following its predetermined path. <br>I think it is much the same with us, most of what we do is pre determined one way or another until something crops up that we have either more than one or  no per-determined path to follow. Then we have to stop and think. Most people distinctly prefer not to think and make decisions, so they leave as much as possible to the default. Watch the ant it noticeably stress when it is perplexed, us too, we stress when have to make decisions, our brains hurt from trying to encompasses too many variables, our eyes go slitty, wrinkles appear around them and the face grows pale <br>Most of us don&#39;t choose our breakfast specially everyday, and so no free will is required. If say, Hank had run out of oats, and had no predetermined plan &#39;b&#39; to fall back on, then he would have to make choice, forget breakfast?, go to store? Eat whatever is in the fridge? Free will an expensive quality, requiring time and energy. However, it is necessary as some choices cannot be made by predetermination, too many unfamiliar variables. I think to prove free will all that needed is an experiment that demonstrates that some anomalies cannot be dealt with any other way.

Determinism is a conceptual model we use to understand how things work.  We want to do that because we want to influence or even change how things work.  Why?  We want them to work better for us.  But determinism demands that we desire this as part of a necessary causal chain that began before we were born.  How we want things to change is just as determined as the existing state of affairs.  If we realize this in a desperate moment of panic and try to change directions, we panic again in the realization that this too has been determined.  In fact, anything that we do avoid the what prior conditions have deemed to be inevitable will simply prove how determined we really are.  There is only one thing we can do to avoid becoming a minor cog in the great universal machine.  <br><br>What&#39;s that?  We live in an empirical world.  We use models to help explain and manage that world.  But the models are never the same as that real world.  At best, they are useful oversimplifications of reality.  Often, they are simply distortions.  When we deceive ourselves that our models are the reality, we walk into a prison and toss away the key.  Rather than using our models to achieve objectives, we rely upon our models to tell us what is real.  But models can only reflect an image of reality.  The history of science teaches us that quite often our models don&#39;t even do that terribly well.  They may be useful to a point but not totally reliable.  Though a globe might be useful to understand something of the earth&#39;s geography, no one would confuse it with the real thing.  <br><br>That may seem too obvious, but our concepts are like that globe.  Determinism and libertarian free will are simply conceptual models of reality.  When our concepts begin tying us into knots, we should relax for a moment.  We created our conceptual models.  It is the physical reality that we did not create, despite what the solipsists among us might say.  When our thoughts about the real world--that is, our conceptions of it--give us indigestion and an existential crisis, it&#39;s not the real world we should be worrying about.  Our conceptual thinking is probably the culprit.  It is always a mistake to sacrifice the real world as an act of worship to our ideas.  As human beings, we have a tendency to do that.  What we need, however, are better ideas.

I wouldn&#39;t say so. A common thread among LFWers is that imagination/reflection can create more possibilities from which one can actually choose, but if they do not choose to ponder what else they can do then their actions are effectively determined, in that instance. For example, I am tired. I want to sleep, but if I stay awake a little longer I get the idea to eat the banana on my bedside table to keep me up and to keep me writing this ramblely response defending free will. If I had just shut my eyes I would be subject to direct causation and would be asleep. Sure, one could argue that that could be further reduced, but it&#39;s just as unprovable as it is provable: not. Instead, LFW philosophers might argue that fundamentally there is only one choice--(rational &amp;or imaginative) thought or action. And from thought arises more possibilities.

As an analogy, a pianist would be the mind and the piano would be the brain. The pianist chooses the music he wants to play and the piano responds with music. The piano cannot produce music without the pianist and the pianist cannot conduct music unless he has a piano and hears sound emanating from it so that he may continue. <br><br>Now of course, if you&#39;re not a dualist-interactionist then forget everything and determinism is true.

If you put it in an other way, something appears to be quite obvious: what would it truly mean to have free will? I think it is simply unthinkable! We cannot be what we are not, and what are we? I think we are what Schopenhauer calls the Will, and we could not want to be something else, it is not possible to be what we are not.. Everything is determined which means we had to be this way because everything follows the will, but now, we, humans, think that we are seperated from <br>the will, as if we were detached from a sort of survival instinct, but in fact i think that it is still the case exepted that we got more and more complex and invented tons of beliefs and concepts... We make one with everything in the universe, because we are the same thing, we are the will itself but it is like we don&#39;t know it because we invented more and more words and more and more concepts , as we evoluated which drove us away from our primal animal will.. did i make my point? so whatever we choose is to be choosen because it responds to the will, and we cannot complain about it because it is unthinkable that we could want to be something else. And what is now arising within us would be the will recognizing itself through all of our humans sensations and thoughts etc... Things are the way they are because they could not be otherwise, as if it responds to a necessity... and it is normal that we humans think that it is unfair because we invented concepts of morality and justice. A deer who sees her dead mom may feel in danger and hurt but does not think it is unfair... In the other hand i think that knowledge <br>still drives us away from a primitive will and that it can extend our possibilities of choices, even if we don&#39;t choose, by experiencing life and learning every sort of things we bring to our brain all kind of experiences that offers the will various possibilities... so it is not : our self is determined by the will, but rather : our self is the will and cannot be nor want to be something else. because if we say that we are trapped in a body and mind determined by all sort of causes and effects, then we suppose that there is something that is not and which undergoes the will..i think we are the will itself, what could we be otherwise?", "comment_date": "2017-01-26T22:41:51Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "UggCykuavlYRM3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Bitcoin Artist", "comment_text": "Within the axiom of cause and effect lies deterministic parameters and variables that seek to carry out a specific task, agenda and outcome.

Were they not choices/ calculated evaluations?  I don&#39;t know if determinism addresses this, but it was not mentioned in this overview.  I imagine they might say that the beliefs are determined by what you are exposed to and by logic and reasoning.  It is evident that each person thinks differently, so logic and reasoning are not exactly determined generally.  But, the circumstances of your birth (who your family is, where you live, what/how you are taught in school, etc) determine what you are exposed to and how you develop your sense of logic and reasoning. <br>I had ham and cheese for lunch because I bought ham and cheese at the store.  I bought ham and cheese at the store because being cheap and quick to prepare, it is perfect for a student.  Reasoning.  Why might I choose something different?  Price?  Change in status (no longer a student = more time to cook)?  So, if something else where cheaper but also relatively healthy and easier to prepare, I might buy it instead.  But that comes down to an outside event (setting the price), not to a change in my decision/decision factors. <br>I&#39;ve thus taken what Hank said and framed it thus:  the beliefs and tendencies in my mind are like formulas, and the outside events are like variables which, when plugged into these formulas, produce an outcome, which is by extension, pre-determined by the formula.  <br>Looked at this way, Determinism doesn&#39;t exactly mean that you don&#39;t make choices.  It means the choices that you make aren&#39;t entirely, individually, free, but are instead governed by set rules inside of you and outside of you.  Those rules can sometimes change.  Being exposed to new information can change your beliefs.  Whether you&#39;re exposed to new information can be determined, for example, by whether you step out of your comfort zone.  <br>The point that my thinking through this here makes is that this does not necessarily mean that everything is set in stone (like the Oedipus prophecy example), but simply that everything happens for/ can be traced back to specific reasons.  It makes sense that, all factors the same, you would not have made a different choice, because clearly you used your same reasoning and faculties to make the choice that you did.

First, accept the dilemma that either hard determinism or libertarian free will. This video made a case for rejecting the latter but didn&#39;t give any evidence in favor of the former--it just explained and boldly offered to accept the implications. But first, take our subjective experience as actual data that needs to be accounted for and not simply explained away. Second, how do we deal with the problem with a deterministic physical universe? Simple. We deny that premise. Heisenberg&#39;s Uncertainty Principle isn&#39;t describing an epistemological problem but rather is getting at an ontological description of the fundamental nature of reality. That is, the physical universe is <b>fundamentally</b> indeterministic. The reason we can so accurately predict causes and effects with fine precision on the large scale is that, when you start adding physical particles together, you get narrower and narrower fields of probability to work with. So, while it is <b>possible</b> that when I light a match all of the molecules could move in just such a way that the match would freeze, the chances are so astronomically small (about 1 in 10^80, I think) that it&#39;s practically impossible.<br><br>Anyway, the point here is that it is just false that the physical universe is fundamentally deterministic. At the smallest levels we can most clearly see this. A may cause B or it may case C. We simply don&#39;t know, nor can we, because there is literally no cause for it being B or C. Sometimes it is B and sometimes it is C. Now, if B, then it was caused by A. Or if C, it was caused by B. But the B or C is itself indeterminate (even if we can weight the probability of one against another with relative accuracy). All that fits very nicely with an Aritotelian notion of teleology, which really fits well with the entire scientific enterprise today, anyway.<br><br>Given all that, we actually can propose agent causality to be a real thing. The will is that which determines B or C in an indeterministic manner. Some factors (beliefs + desire + temperament) may <b>weight</b> one outcome as more likely than another, but in the end, the will is indeterminately related to B and C, and which it chooses really free.<br><br>Now, to be clear, you can still have this whole view without agent causality. You can propose that the choice is finally random within those probabilities, but what is the motivating premise for accepting <b>that</b>? Seems an implicit commitment to an outdated Newtonian, mechanistic view of the world already undermined by both the premise that the universe is fundamentally indeterministic on the one hand and our subjective data on the other. So better to allow for agent causality. Even grant that agent causality is an emergent property of some sort somehow related to the Uncertainty Principle (which could be argued to take the observer as an actual cause). Science is still out on that. Or take the Aristotelian notion of the soul as an explanatory mechanism. Point is, there are options here, and we don&#39;t have to be hard determinists.", "comment_date": "2016-12-22T03:34:55Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "UggN6Z7CDYMTo3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Tyler Jungbauer", "comment_text": "The evidence Hank gives for determinism in this video is very hard to refute\u2014indeed, the very fact that I (or at least the conceptual identity that has arisen from various physical and biological processes within my brain to develop into such an idea as &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot;) see the necessity in responding to it is probably determined in itself.  However, there are also a couple of arguments in refutation that I think are necessary to raise here.  There are two big arguments, so I will lay them out below.  However, I also doubt that these arguments have any sort of ability to actually refute the larger argument that determinism is true.<br><br>First, the argument from consciousness of determinism.  If determinism is true, and as we have seen in this video it is very likely that it is, then that means that our very understanding of determinism as being true, and whatever neurological and physical reactions are occurring within the brain to create this sense of knowing that determinism is true, was predetermined to occur.  We were meant to understand that everything has a cause as everything is the effect of some cause or other, and every cause or other is in effect the result of the original causation to the universe, the big bang.  But this also means that the universe resulted in such a way that it was meant to understand itself from the very beginning.  Indeed, whatever physical and biological processes within the brain occur to create this sensation of consciousness and knowing, are also reducible to atomic and quantum terms.  So on an atomic level, the universe is all the same to some degree or other.  But given that the human brain has the ability to conceptualize self-awareness and self-identity, does this mean that the universe itself is self-identifying and self-aware on an atomic level?  Because when a human brain studies an atom and understands that an atom is composed of neutrons, protons, and electrons, well, this also means that atoms are studying themselves... understanding themselves... and that simply doesn&#39;t seem to make sense. (Note the use of the verb &quot;seem,&quot; implying uncertainty.) So, extrapolating this sense of understanding and knowing from the fact that atoms do indeed seem to understand themselves, we can also assume logically that whatever cognitive processes happen to create the sensation of understanding what determinism is were predetermined to happen.  All in all, this seems to mean that the universe itself was made to understand itself.  But why?  Maybe God made it and intended for us to understand the universe... or maybe the universe itself is conscious, one massive entity composed of smaller constituent beings with a sense of awareness.<br><br>However, it has also been posited by many physicists that the universe isn&#39;t very predetermined.  Hank alludes to the scientific assumption that every effect has a causation, and that each causation itself can be reduced to being an effect of some other cause, on and on and on, until the original causation, the big bang, which should itself be the effect of some other cause.  On a quantum level, electrons exist at different locations or velocities\u2014but never simultaneously.  We cannot observe without first breaking down the very thing being observed, and so what should be doubted here is the credibility of the claim that everything has a cause.  Perhaps it is our understanding of cause and effect that should be revised, and not this argument of whether we are &quot;free&quot; or not.  Indeed, quantum entanglement\u2014or as Einstein dubbed it, &quot;Spooky action at a distance&quot;\u2014has been verified experimentally to show that particles on a quantum level have effect on each other at extremely large distances, which does not seem possible of itself.  This seems to violate the principle of local realism, the theory that posits values exist objectively and independently of observers before the act of observation, and that all causation occurs at the speed of light.  However, we have proven through scientific experiment that Einstein was wrong at least in one sense: the speed of light may be slowed, and therefore information may move at a rate faster than the speed of light.  It appears that our understanding of causation and effect may be a bit flawed, then.<br><br>Any reaction to determinism should address these concepts, then, i.e. those of causation and effect.  Determinists argue that all physical states have a physical cause, as these states are themselves physical effects, but are they right in assuming this?  Science has assumed that every piece of information we process subjectively as knowledge is the effect of some cause or other, as indeed the very cause of our visual interpretation of information is based entirely on the fact that what we observe is the radiating light from the original cause, the big bang.  But if information can move faster than the speed of light, there may exist certain values or qualities that we are not capable of observing and therefore cannot know about.  Therefore, in conclusion, I think that what we must first do is clarify whether cause and effect do actually exist\u2014or, as Hume would suppose, whether they are merely illusions based on our past experience of the world.", "comment_date": "2016-12-21T23:13:32Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "UggdY6XZFRTt1HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "goatneck", "comment_text": "so if we made an exact copy of our universe, with the exact same atoms, energy etc. arranged in the exact same order so that they are perfectly identical and then let both universes run during 1000 years, will both universes still be identical after that time?", "comment_date": "2016-12-21T19:27:49Z", "likes_count": 39}}}, {"vCGtkDzELAI": {"Determinism vs Free Will: Crash Course Philosophy #24": {"channel_id": "UgiXUniPZhNV-XgCoAEC", "comment_by": "ganondorfchampin", "comment_text": "Determinism is dead.

However this is not an example of being determined, as there were still different courses of action for Oedipus to choose from. In order for it to be an example of determinism, any kind of choice has to be an illusion, and this does not seem to be the case in the Oedipus example. <br>Secondly, you say that the view that every event has a cause, or that every event that happens now is the necessary result of events in the past, is called hard determinism.

In discussions of philosophy, at least if you wish to be educational and not be preaching, you must stay objective. Philosophy isn&#39;t a natural science, thus empiricism doesn&#39;t apply to it ultimately as philosophy studies the nature of knowing itself, thus meaning that an evidence based assertion, a posteriori arguments, are not necessarly true. The whole purpose of the philosophically ideal debate is to point out that no 2 people ever in the history of mankind will ever see and interpret the world in the same way. There is no, according to humans, any objective world that we can agree upon, but rather, all our various interpretations as a whole determine what our reality is in the end is in the end, for who determines what the Real reality is? Who determines which characteristics in nature are of objective importance and not merely features made important by the human perspective? <br><br>Determinism is tempting simply because it agrees with (almost) all science as we know it. The problem is that its interpretation makes our methodology of reaching answers very limited when it comes to the abstract, such as the quarrels of Einstein, arguably a materialist, and the fathers of Quantum mechanics, such as Niels Bohr.

Taking the coin example: lets say I chose oatmeal for heads and cream of wheat for tails; the most important thing the video ignores here is that while your decision to flip the coin to make a choice for you could be considered pre-determined, as well as the possible choices of breakfast of heads or tails, the OUTCOME of the flip is truly random. So, you made the choice to choose either oatmeal or cream of wheat for either heads or tails, but the coin made the final choice and none of the previous unbroken chain of events had any influence in the outcome of the flip, thus making it truly random. You can say that maybe the air conditions in the room, the weight of the coin, the strength of my flip determine the outcome of the flip even before i do it, but none of those things was influenced by either belief, desire, or temperament, and the chain of events that lead me to being in such circumstances, in that room, with that coin etc, were not influenced by belief desire or temperament (for example whether i put my wallet close to my desk or far from my desk is an event that just as randomly could have been different).

It was a very interesting discussion. But it gets even more complex if you add God and the soul into the discussion. <br><br>My argument was that our thoughts are largely made up of what ever chemical reactions and such were happening in our brains at that moment and what contributed to those were just a combination of things like food, medication, genetics, factors like learning and what we&#39;ve been exposed to which would increase the strength of various connections in our brains making us think a certain way and such. Even though we don&#39;t fully understand everything that happens in the brain yet this seems to be the direction that what we&#39;ve researched so far is heading to. I suppose my opinion of this was greatly swayed by my experience with medication that I&#39;m on for mental health issues (bipolar, anxiety &amp; adult ADD) and just how much these chemicals have changed the way that I think. In addition to that I&#39;ve been using various forms of cognitive-behavioural therapy, part of which is reprogramming the brain through various exercises to strengthen certain thinking habits and lessen others. This also has also had a profound impact on the way I think and behave. I feel like I&#39;m almost a completely different person to who I was a few years ago before this. I&#39;ve also had another experience that I feel changed me in a dramatic way which was to move from England to South Africa in my teenage years. This changed so much of my outlook on life and my personal values, things that are often just attributed to who you are as a person. I felt like I had previously been brainwashed but then I realised that I was probably just brainwashed again. This lead to the uncomfortable thought of wondering if I have any control over my personal beliefs and values that make up a huge part of my identity. This also means that no one could have any control over their personal beliefs and feelings. I have a pretty strong concept of what&#39;s right and wrong but this idea means that there&#39;s no such thing, only what we think is right and wrong. It does make it easier not to be angry at other people. <br><br>My boyfriend however argued that we don&#39;t know exactly what it is that makes the brain act in certain ways which leaves room for God and the soul. If everything around us is sparked by God&#39;s plan and the initial start of where our thoughts, emotions and decisions come from the soul then we do have free choice as it&#39;s the soul (which is who we are) does make the decisions which makes our brains function in various ways.  He believes that (although they did help) my medicines didn&#39;t have that much of an affect on the way I&#39;ve changed but rather it was my decision to work to fix my situation and to seek help that has changed my circumstances and that who I was is the same as who I am now, I just decided that different things matter in life. He thinks that everyone is born with a vague concept of what is right and wrong that the soul provides and we make our own decisions from that. <br><br>Now I&#39;m not really sure what to think... but I still lean towards determinism although maybe this does leave the possibility for a bit of both.

In this video you stated that Oedipus was fated to Kill his Father and Marry his mother, and then you went to list the causal chain p\u2283q, q\u2283r, r\u2283s...  \u2234 p\u2283s, however, the key word which is the Fatal flaw is the inclusion of the term Fated. Many people mistake Hard-Determinism for Fatalism and much of this video has made this error.<br><br>The best example I can think of is when you literally threw personal responsibility at one point during the monologue about Hard-Determinism. Let us use Oedipus as an example in name. For example, if Oedipus had been taught his entire life that killing was bad yet still ended up someone, then, in respects to the social contract, i.e., the governmental bodies which have agree on the laws that the people of the land have agreed on, e.g., killing is wrong, then knowing this rule he killed a man, then yes, he has a personal responsibility in regards to the social contract, and he should be prosecuted for the murder; however, if we remove the social contract, then we have a much more difficult time understanding personal responsibility at all, even in the libertarian sense of the word. If we were to agree that the first responsibility a person has to themselves is to keep themselves alive, are they morally bad, or irresponsible when they die? What if the only way to survive was to steal? In this sense, I am making a callback to Aristotle&#39;s Mixed Actions in his argument, which in itself is neither of the presented opinions because it relies on alternate possibilities, I have the options to steal and live longer, or not and die. Being a Determinist, I would steal food to live longer, and if I was a Libertarian, I believe the choice to eat sounds more reasonable that to let myself starve to death. This would satisfy his mixed actions, which is why this is the third view compatibilist. I disagree with Aristotle, and I believe the system to be Deterministic, yet, I believe the Determinist would claim that, at the most base level, they have a personal responsibility to keep themselves alive. This example shows that even without the social contract, a person has some sort of responsibility, unless you like Nietzsche and would just give into Nihilism - although Absurdism is fun to, Looking at you Camus. Now Fatalism would say that you are fated to steal and leave it at that; however, Fatalism does not care about the causal chain in the actions. This is the problem with your video Fatalism leaves no room for personal responsibility where, I hope, I gave a Valid, which I check some rules, and can show you that Determinism does not remove personal responsibility. <br><br>Also, it&#39;s late, and I will leave any errors for others to critique.

If all events are caused by past events, then what was the cause of the very first event?

One of these was the argument from motion, where everything that is set in motion must have been set in motion by something else. This cannot extend ad infinitum and thus there was the need for an unmoved mover, God, to set things in motion. The counterargument to this was that the argument was self defeating: why was God exempt from the rule of everything needing to be set in motion from something else, and nothing else was? <br><br>I ask the same about hard determinism proposing that all of our choices are a result of the past events. Why must we be subjected to past events, when there was a first event that could not have been caused by any other?

That it actually matches our definition of free will, which is basically a chain of causation that is too complex to fully observe.<br><br>If, say, the most optimized computer made with all the atoms and all the energy of the universe couldn&#39;t predict perfectly, at the atomic level, what is about to happen, despite knowing 100% of the parameters of an action... Then that action, despite being ruled by hard determinism, being impossible to determine, amounts to free will. Take a big enough action, or a big enough precision level, and that impossible to determine result can be obtained.<br><br>Or alternatively, if a chain of causation is too complex for a human brain to physically process, then it is &quot;complex enough&quot; to be called free will.<br><br>\u00a02- At a quantum level, there is some degree of probability rather than determinism. Since this degree of probability has an influence over what we consider the physical world, then our biological states are in fact impossible to fully attribute to determinism, which in turn means that our mental states cannot be fully attributed to determinism either.<br><br>One could argue that everything is also determined at the quantum level, just that measuring it will influence the result... But if there is physically no way to observe an action without influencing its result, it means that determinism is actually UNABLE to predict anything, because the very act of prediction will necessarily change the result, which invalidates the act of prediction and is a paradox.

Quantum uncertainty, at least certain theories pertaining to it, offer factual basis for refuting determinism. And really, the almost dualistic appearance of much of the natural world isn&#39;t much different. They two sides aren&#39;t separate, they exist with and because of the other.

The reason it cannot be easily refuted or proven is the same reason we cannot tell if anything but our own thoughts actually exist. We have no actual, first hand insight. The thoughts of others, the effects of choice would require testing with controls that cannot exist. A control free from all influence, which would simply be nonexistence. Ultimately, we are shaped by everything around us, but likewise, we shape them. Our thoughts are fueled by chemicals, but our thoughts, if we decide to alter them, can alter the chemistry. I also wonder as to why thinking would would even exist in a deterministic world, why sentience would even happen over mindless instinctive non-thought. I haven&#39;t seen an argument that has made the reconciliation of a limited choice system ( limited certain factors, notions, identities, constraints of possibility) with the deterministic.

A deterministic universe is a universe in which every event in the FUTURE is pre-determined, and can only happen in one particular way, and there is zero possibility for divergence. However every single quantum event, every nuclear decay, every photon, every free electron, adds a tiny little variable that&#39;s based on probability, not deterministic law, and can have a cascading effect on events. For instance I perform the double-slit experiment, one photon at a time, the location the photon lands looks deterministic, but the double slit experiment has actually proven that this is not the case, the photon is in fact functioning as a wave, and therefor its final position is a random distribution on an interference pattern. the pattern is deterministic, but the location and distribution within the pattern, is based on probability and randomness, not any deterministic cause. If I then translate that photon&#39;s landing point into a value that is used for a decision, then there would be branching out futures, based on the different probable locations that particular photon could have landed, and therefor the result of the experiment is non-deterministic. That said, radioactive decay functions on these same lines, and our BRAINS contain radioactive elements, such as Potassium, and Iodine, reactions with which will be influenced by whether or not that atom or molecule has decayed or not, and therefor the processes of our very thoughts, are influenced by default by the same probability. <br><br>This means that on one hand, the universe is not deterministic, but on the other hand, we are not in true control of our thoughts, but neither is a purely deterministic system, instead, a random number generator is.

This is fine if you&#39;re doing science and need a non-subjective perspective; but this is philosophy and we don&#39;t need to stick to those rules here.

I am a white male- I could not be black or a woman (barring surgery that I would personally avoid). I will never have superpowers. Though I can change many things about myself, and have many options in terms of employment and lifestyle, I am nonetheless limited in those options (free will interacting with determinism). <br>You really run into this problem though with theology. If god is omniscient, and knows everything that will ever happen, then it cannot be said that he gave us free will, because we will always be acting in accordance with his plan. If we do have free will, then it is impossible to say that god knows what we will do before we make the decision.

While cells are incredibly larger than atoms and subject to less probability fluctuations, they too have probability determined by the atoms, namely brownian motion and ETC (electron-transport chain) reactions. Larger still is an organism, subject to even less probability fluctuations, but still based at some level on the probability of the lowest level. So you see our actions are not perfectly pre-determined, but let us not jump to the conclusion that we are free. This just means that our actions cannot be 100% determined. Embracing freedom would mean that we have control over the random fluctuations of the atoms in our body which is preposterous.

It is exactly identical to you being you, doing what you do, and choosing what you choose. (Anyone want to try\u00a0to prove otherwise?)Oh, and, of course, you could have done otherwise. The practical meaning of &quot;I could have done A rather than B&quot; is that, at the time of my deliberation, both A and B were available to me to choose from. The restaurant had steak and\u00a0lobster dinners on the menu. So, I could have chosen either one. One of them was the causally inevitable choice. But both of them were real possibilities available to me at the time. The fact of inevitability does not cancel the fact that I had two real possibilities to choose from. And, as it happens, inevitability will immediately conform to the one I choose. There is no point in disputing that one of the choices was inevitable. However, the only way I could determine which choice was inevitable was to go through a mental process where I estimated which option would best satisfy my needs and desires. As it turns out, the fact of universal causal inevitability is about the most useless fact in the physical universe. And it is this lack of relevance and utility\u00a0that causes the practical mind to ignore it. It is also a fact that 2 + 2 = 4 and that a clear sky appears blue. However, those facts do me no good in choosing between the steak and the lobster. The fact that my choice will be inevitable is also useless. Now if you could tell me in advance what my choice would be, then that would be useful. But you can&#39;t. I still have to make the choice myself, for my own purpose and to satisfy my own reasons. And that is all that free will is: a person deciding for themselves what they WILL do. The &quot;free&quot; part has nothing to do with freedom from causal inevitability. The &quot;free&quot; part refers to &quot;freedom from coercion or other undue influence&quot;.
