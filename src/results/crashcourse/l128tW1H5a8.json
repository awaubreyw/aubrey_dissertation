Let\u2019s see what I understood. Kidneys bring blood in to remove cellular  waste produced by the rest of the body. Then they put good stuff back into the blood. Like a double filtration. It\u2019s like a coffee filter, but two ways. They are centrally located within the body, so that helps to conserve energy used to pump the massive amount of blood to them that they need to filter (at any given time, 20% of your blood is in your kidneys, making pee). After the double filtration, the waste is sent to the bladder. When the bladder fills, you have to pee it out. It seems like it would be more efficient to pump the water back into the body, but I guess this is not possible since the urea must be dissolved in something in order to be expelled? But if there is excess water, why doesn\u2019t some of it get pumped back into the body? I guess evolution isn\u2019t perfect? Or is there a reason for this?<br><br>Beyond that? Yea that technical jargon went way over my head.
