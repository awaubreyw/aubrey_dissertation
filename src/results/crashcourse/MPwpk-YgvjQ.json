For example, if I say &#39;I had a latte in the new cafe next door&#39;, the collocutor/hearer understands without me saying that I entered, ordered with a waiter/barista, paid, etc. Different frames &#39;require&#39; different ways of speaking (formal/informal, recognized formulas) and establish relations between interlocutors. So it is not only about being cooperative when communicating but also about the kind of situation we are in (does the situation allow flouting Gricean Maxims, for example?).<br>Another problem with the Cooperative Principle is the fact that it kind of ignores non-communicative aspects of language, such as social bonding or the expression of emotions (like cursing).
