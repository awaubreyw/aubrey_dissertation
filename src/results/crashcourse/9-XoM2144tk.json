However, it seems to be a little bit contradictory. For what I understand, red blood cells are seen as &quot;transports&quot; of oxygen throughout the body, and lets say the oxygen is the &quot;passengers&quot;.  You say that when oxygen levels in blood are low, means there is few oxygen molecules there, so, since there is less &quot;passengers&quot;, it would be required less &quot;transport&quot;, so logic dictates that in this case less red blood cells are needed since there is not that much oxygen to carry around. On the other side, if there was more oxygen in the body, then it would be required more red blood cells to carry all that oxygen. I know this is wrong since professional athletes train in high altitudes to increase their red blood cells level in the blood. It just seems ilogical to me. Can you tell me what am I thinking wrong what am I missing?
