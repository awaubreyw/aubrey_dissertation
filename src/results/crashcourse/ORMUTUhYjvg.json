First of all a lot of the structures are not great: molecular geometries were wrong  for sulfuric acid and H3O+, and there\u2019s the tendency to show square-planar-type structures for organic molecules - obviously people do this for the purpose of teaching, but then when you want to show a mechanism, e.g. an elimination, you need to introduce another method of representation for it to make sense. Speaking of which, the reversible hydration/dehydration would surely give the E alkene as the major alkene component, very quickly. As presented in the video, it makes it look like you would have a mixture of the Z alkene and the alcohol, which effectively would not be true. Also the reference to pKa was quite odd: why state that the protonated alcohol has a low pKa if it\u2019s not going to be compared to H3O+ in the forward direction?", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T08:03:46Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "Ugw_se10hJdwaMJq1554AaABAg", "comment_by": "marie martinez", "comment_text": "Me watching their videos from 2013...", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T18:03:41Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "Ugy7BXHjFJkjczg3DQx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Erin Aldrich", "comment_text": "When can we expect more episodes?", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T15:17:13Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "Ugxt0abK5Uvhc0BM6_B4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Manoharlal Kamboj", "comment_text": "Thanks so much", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T09:49:33Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "UgwNoZpbQef05uADQt94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Diego", "comment_text": "It would be so great if after this classes we had some exercises...", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T23:51:35Z", "likes_count": 20}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "UgyrW0fjGEIAlj1gEa54AaABAg", "comment_by": "Angus Julie", "comment_text": "When will crash course Asian and African history come.", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T19:18:53Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "UgzldUCfUEVayZHZvtJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Justin Anderson", "comment_text": "Oy<br>You lost me at electrophilic additions of a protein to an alkaline.<br>I need to go back over my high school chemistry lol", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T16:41:49Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "Ugym_r1PZ0KhT4DI3314AaABAg", "comment_by": "Mark_till Till", "comment_text": "Really like arrow pushing!", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T09:14:43Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "UgxF8WtUcJVEI1iQyb54AaABAg", "comment_by": "little chemist", "comment_text": "I invite you to learn chemistry together plz subscribe my chanel", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T06:54:35Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "Ugw-bSBUIGauorgsJzl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Believer", "comment_text": "Wow \ud83e\udd29\ud83d\ude32very informative video!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T06:13:48Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"ORMUTUhYjvg": {"Intro to Reaction Mechanisms: Crash Course Organic Chemistry #13": {"channel_id": "UgyFMu6gMM2ToOQyKIt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "gymfsmathfincoding", "comment_text": "I lost track of what&#39;s happening 10 episodes ago.
