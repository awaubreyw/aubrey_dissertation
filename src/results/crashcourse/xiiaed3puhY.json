How the door closes is up to the director. It wasn&#39;t until the feminist movement of the mid-20th century that it more popularly became a slam. While Ibsen did write some of the earliest depictions of complex female characters, Nora&#39;s departure is not this bold feminist statement. It is just as easy to see it as Nora leaving into a world of frightening uncertainty. She has no marketable skills. She has no family to return to. Women didn&#39;t have the kinds of opportunities we have now. She just as well could be going out there to a life of misery on the streets. It IS a brave decision, but it&#39;s also one that is probably scary as hell for her. <br><br>Speaking of Chekhov next week (SO EXCITED!) and translations, in college, I directed one of his short farces, The Bear. It&#39;s an opposites attract romantic comedy, which ends in an argument that culminates in a kiss. As a feminist, I really hate the trope of the man who kisses the protesting woman who melts into his arms. So I checked a bunch of different translations and even consulted a Russian speaker on how it reads in the original Russian. All confirmed that the stage direction is simply, &quot;A long/prolonged kiss.&quot; Not which character initiates it (though the dialog implies the man does). So I decided to turn it around and have her successfully fend off his attempt to kiss her only to have her abruptly pull the surprised man in for a kiss after all.<br><br>Tl;dr: stage directions often allow for a lot more directorial influence than some might expect.
