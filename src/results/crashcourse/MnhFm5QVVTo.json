Of course more liberals live in cities, but that doesn&#39;t mean they shouldn&#39;t receive accurate representation lol. Cities tend to breed liberals because you are exposed to people of many ideas, ethnicities, religions, races, etc. Because you are exposed to more of these things, you tend to be more open to change, and more open to things that benefit these people and their cultures, since you see yourself as a part of a group in some way. Conservatives are much more likely to be out in the middle of nowhere or in towns of under 10k that consist of highly homogeneous populations like 90% white and christian, so they are only exposed to their ideas and only care about their problems. But there is a very easy way to create fair and representative districts. Here&#39;s how you do it. Take a state where say 60% of ppl are democrats and 40% are republicans. You would then create districts in which at least 60% of people are of one party, and democrats would get as close to 60% of the districts as was possible, and republicans 40%. This doesn&#39;t really effect majority-minority districts either since groups tend to vote similarly, for example most LGBT vote democrat. Just because the construct of cities tend to breed/lure liberals doesn&#39;t mean they should be punished with misrepresentation. Right now in America, the one person, one vote statement isn&#39;t accurate at all. Republicans received 52% of the vote in the 2014 congressional election, but 57% of the seats up for grab. In Pennsylvania, democrats only secured 27 percent of congressional seats even though they won almost half of the votes. In North Carolina, they won 3 out of the 13 seats, but they had 44% of the vote.
