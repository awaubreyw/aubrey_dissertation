Human beings are physical beings and they are shaped by their senses and physical needs.

I don&#39;t quite agree with that because where I can easily go beyond my programming (from all those years of getting biased historical education, religious teachings to still being a humanist peaceful person) how does Harry do that? I believe there you would need intentionality, not only &quot;displaying&quot; intentionality (which is a different thing). I do not think Harry could choose to do something that he was not programmed to do because it wouldn&#39;t be in his scope of understanding. Yes, you could program him to learn from new experiences and from the things that he reads to draw new conclusions but those things would still be a part of his programming (if even watching this video is part of us being programmed which I totally agree). Overall, I think maybe what Harry lacks would be the subconscious. Things that would affect you in-directly and make you favor options without any visible logical reason or statistics with which you could back it up. For example, choosing to learn German as a new language instead of French. The way Harry does this would probably be by analysing how many people in the world speak it, or maybe totally in a human way he would decide on German because his girlfriend has Germanic roots. But as a human, in the same setting, you might still want to learn French, just &quot;because&quot;. Without any reason (or without any reason that you can know of consciously). You have the possibility to want something as a human totally out of thin air. I guess, the hip word would be the gut feeling. I am not 100% sure if this seemingly random decision of ours is based merely on subconscious or if we have the ability to come up with random things by ourselves but I doubt that Harry would have this. (I do not mean the soul though, that is another discussion.) Well in order to understand if this is ever going to be implementable to a piece of software probably we would need to know all the ways our brains work.

We attribute understanding not to the individual man, but to the entire room. <br>Well Searle responds by saying: why is it that the person in the room doesn\u2019t understand Chinese? Because the person has no way to attach meaning to symbols. So in this regard, the room has no resources that the person doesn\u2019t have. So if the person has no way to attach meaning to the symbols, how could the room as a whole possibly have a way to do this? Searle himself suggests an extension to the thought experiment: imagine the person in the room memorises the database and the rule book. This means he now doesn\u2019t need to the room anymore. He goes out and converses with people face-to-face in Chinese, but he still doesn\u2019t understand Chinese, because all he\u2019s doing is manipulating symbols. Yet in this case he is the entire system. <br>Now of course an obvious objection to this is that if you can go out and converse with people in Chinese, you must be able to converse in Chinese and thus understand it. <br>This objection the functionalist could make doesn\u2019t actually addresses Searle\u2019s point though. The whole point of the Chinese Room Thought Experiment is that you can\u2019t generate understanding simply by running the right program. <br>You can\u2019t get semantics merely from the right syntax. Now granted you surely would understand Chinese if you could converse perfectly with Chinese people, but I think Searle can hold that this understanding arises not from manipulating symbols in the right way, but also from all the various things that can go on in face-to-face interactions.", "comment_date": "2017-04-22T20:51:30Z", "likes_count": 11}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UghP6kdjMJJfa3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "The Piper Report", "comment_text": "Interesting..

If the meaning of the words &quot;machine&quot; and &quot;think&quot; are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, &quot;Can machines think?&quot; is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll.

We have to remember that Turing had taken at least one class with Wittgenstein and had certainly read his works and the works of his followers.

Three points from my side.<br>- Firstly, Searle has a very good response to the argument of the whole system and not just the cpu/&quot;man in the room&quot; understanding Chinese, a response which Searle calls the Systems Reply. Searle suggests that the person in the room memorize the rule book and symbols, thus internalizing the whole system. That person now goes outside, gets handed a piece of paper with some symbols on it, remembers the rules for those symbols, and then writes a reply in front of the Chinese person. He can do all this yet still have no idea what those symbols mean. Only if someone shows him a hamburger with the symbol for hamburger next to it, will he understand what that symbol means. Until then, its all squiggles and squaggles. <br>- Secondly, it is interesting to note that in Searle&#39;s 1980 paper &quot;Minds, Brains and Programs&quot;, the original Chinese Room paper, he defines &#39;Strong AI&#39; in a slightly different way from how it has come to be used since. Searle says that Strong AI is the view that &quot;...the appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states.&quot; and later in the MIT Encyclopedia of Cognitive Science, he says, &quot;\u201cStrong AI\u201d is defined as the view that an appropriately programmed digital computer with the right inputs and outputs, one that satisfies the Turing test, would necessarily have a mind. The idea of Strong AI is that the implemented program by itself is constitutive of having a mind.&quot; Thus Strong AI is not a property that a robot may or may not have, nor is it the idea that computers can think. Since Searle is the guy who coined the term, I believe he has to right to decide its meaning. This distinction is demonstrated by the next point.<br>- Thirdly, he never says that a computer can&#39;t think. In fact, in the MIT encyclopedia, he states, &quot; The Chinese room does not show that \u201ccomputers can\u2019t think.\u201d On the contrary, something can be a computer and can think. If a computer is any machine capable of carrying out a computation, then all normal human beings are computers and they think. The Chinese room shows that  COMPUTATION , as defined by Alan  TURING and others as formal symbol manipulation, is not by itself constitutive of thinking.&quot;<br>Also, the Turing Test might have been passed recently: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27762088\">http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27762088</a><br>Thank you!", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T16:25:32Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "Ughp0m-7OLTnKngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Annaelle Jacques-Morel", "comment_text": "Searle has heard and replied to the system argument that Hank could theoretically memorize the code in the chinese room&#39;s codebook (it&#39;s not more implausible than the Chinese room thought experiment in the first place), making Hank or Hank&#39;s brain the entirety of \u00abthe system\u00bb, and it would still be false to say that Hank \u00abunderstands\u00bb Chinese. <br><br>However, the consequence of this reply is that we can&#39;t be sure that other humans are people who have \u00abtrue understanding\u00bb of what&#39;s going on, and I think it&#39;s a price too heavy to pay to maintain doubts about strong AI theory.", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T16:24:43Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UghQjt6l9HjVjngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Katherine Sanderson", "comment_text": "Presuming we all have souls and disregarding what exactly a soul consists of we&#39;d still have to be able to say how having a soul affects us and how we&#39;d be different without it if we want to be able to say that a machine couldn&#39;t have one because if having a soul changes nothing then we wouldn&#39;t be able to tell if anything has one.", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T15:26:05Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "Ugj19NCRm_mCqngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Aadit Bhatia", "comment_text": "We&#39;re all hunted by ... wait for it...", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T15:04:39Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UgigSG23hKlxdHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Pixelatedude6", "comment_text": "God could just play Ensoul Artifact anyways", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T15:03:29Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UghjSfyD2b9wR3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Hammad Usmani", "comment_text": "you didn&#39;t mention the bi-centennial man", "comment_date": "2016-08-10T14:37:05Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "Ugh00G2Lz72congCoAEC", "comment_by": "Lincoln Noronha", "comment_text": "Hey Hank.

Let&#39;s start with &quot;Is John just a human or a really intelligent machine&quot;. Well, I would argue that the answer is that he can be both. Not from the angle of granting personhood to machines, although I believe that is inevitable, but because we are also machines. Later on Hank makes a point about machines being &quot;inorganic&quot;. Many people would say that there&#39;s no difference between the different types of substrate an intelligence happens to be running on. As Arthur C. Clarke says in 2010 - &quot;Whether we are based on carbon or on silicon makes no fundamental difference; we should each be treated with appropriate respect.&quot; There&#39;s nothing special about being built out of hyper-fancy carbon based nanotechnology (like humans are).<br><br>Some people are bound to bring up the idea of qualia, as referenced previously in Crash Course Philosophy. The problem with that argument is that qualia are definitionally unavailable for examination except via self-reporting and are therefore profoundly unscientific. Until we fully understand how the brain works we will have to rely on external observation to judge the &#39;person-ness&#39; of an individual.<br><br>A couple more things. Hank mentions the notion of &quot;going beyond our programming&quot;. Which is a phrase that makes no sense. Humans brains are deterministic machines, as I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll go into next week. Actions are a result of a combination of stimulation and current state. The idea that we can &quot;go beyond&quot; that model in some way makes no sense.<br><br>Finally, it would be interesting to know what was meant in the quote that contained the phrase &quot;achieve actual understanding&quot; as, again externally, it doesn&#39;t sound like something that could ever be measured.<br><br>I honestly believe that the middle of the 21st century will have two overlapping major themes that will have profound impacts on everything. The first will be the emergence of the first set of AIs that can begin to consistently pass the Turning test. The second will be the start of general acceptance that we are deterministic machines just the same as any product we build.

But the thing is that for example you can pass in an input with a typo, for example(after talking about some aspects of life): &quot;Do you enjoy you lie*&quot; , to any human that would be an obvious typo considering the fact that a few moments ago you talked about life (job, hobbies etc). Even if you have an appropriate answer such as &quot;What do you mean by saying lie?&quot;, or &quot;I love my lies&quot; , it would be a failure to pass the typo test. If the book answer with a reply such as &quot;Did you mean life?&quot;, then I&#39;m sure you can find a counter example with dual or maybe even triple meaning. If lets say you do have all the possible answers so that you can even fool a human who typed typo, then that would mean your &quot;book&quot; had to process the entire conversation prior to the sentence with the typo.

The system of The Chinese Room contains a book recording a sufficient number of details about how to construct a conversation and maybe even how to generate novel responses that it can fool any human into believing that it is human, and that&#39;s the principle under which chatbots operate, in a nutshell. But those chatbots don&#39;t verifiably have semantics, or knowledge of the meaning associated with its responses, and neither does the room system. If a perfect chatbot is possible, then what we have is either a philosophical zombie or an emergent strong AI (a strong AI which appeared by accident, incidentally, or perhaps antithetically to its design. <br><br>Modeling semantics is a hard job in science, partially because we can&#39;t pull apart a brain and observe &quot;aha yes this is semantics and we can clearly see the algorithm that represents it&quot;. A promising idea is statistical correlation between representations of concepts, developed through experience (learning, pretty much). Could you say for certain that a rules-based chatbot does not have semantics, somehow emergently represented, if it can perfectly fool a human? Rather, the problem of The Chinese Room (I think the phrase &quot;real understanding&quot; is used here) is if we can actually know whether a system possesses emergent semantics. In science, we&#39;ve made a lot of progress in explicitly representing semantics, but it&#39;s still an open question whether emergent representation of semantics in an explicitly non-semantic system designed to superficially emulate semantics is even possible, or if there&#39;s even such a thing as a perfect chatbot. One perhaps more rigourous test is to have an explicit model we know is right, and test the robot for roughly equivalent outcomes on various tests of semanticity against it (although that&#39;s essentially a generalisation from the basic conceit of the Turing Test). Another method might be to evaluate the robot algorithmically and see if we can generate a higher-order algorithm using it which performs roughly the same tasks as our known algorithm, although it is potentially more limited in scope.<br><br>I&#39;d obviously disagree that robots can&#39;t think. A Turing machine can do anything mathematical, so saying that robots can&#39;t think implies that the mind is non-mathematical, which even if magic were real is just not possible, since math is just a symbolic system for representing any sort of rule. Whether a system of synthetic rules for mimicking conversation that is explicitly not symantic can represent semantics emergently, though, is a more interesting question. How we&#39;d measure it is a more interesting question still, although thus far no such system has appeared and it may never. Personally, I don&#39;t believe in true philosophical zombies, and I do think that a perfect chatbot would necessarily have real semantics, although a very good chatbot doesn&#39;t need to. This is philosophy, but it&#39;s neat to consider we could identify that a chatbot could be very good without being perfect. <br><br>More broadly, such emergent semanticity is the question of whether weak AI can make the leap into strong AI by accident, and I don&#39;t really believe in that either, but it&#39;s also interesting to imagine how we could divide weak algorithms from strong, and how much of a continuum there is between them.<br><br>And in here at the very bottom I&#39;d like to include a minor complaint about the distinction between strong and weak AI. The actual distinction as I understand it is that weak AI is task-specific and doesn&#39;t possess any discernable ability to understand, whereas strong AI is very capable of generating meaning and acting on it. From that perspective, a strong AI could be emulating a rat or be an unfathomably great superintelligence just as easily as it could be trying to be human.", "comment_date": "2016-08-09T01:19:33Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UgiBDLDP2Phq0HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Dard 151", "comment_text": "God damned synths!", "comment_date": "2016-08-09T01:17:56Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UgirwUk3u4l2_3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Robert S.", "comment_text": "naw, im leading the android genocide", "comment_date": "2016-08-09T01:15:57Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "Ugg1InLmBqvMkXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Dewey", "comment_text": "I like how some of these comments are referencing this course with fallout 4 synths.", "comment_date": "2016-08-09T01:15:00Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UgizldNKvQmfYHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "TheWolfoftheStars", "comment_text": "You know, I think that any AI that displayed a degree of laziness would probably pass as a person.", "comment_date": "2016-08-09T01:07:15Z", "likes_count": 942}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UghFzkTGEoJF13gCoAEC", "comment_by": "fx()sparrow$", "comment_text": "which language is &quot;Chinese&quot;?  there is mandrin and cantonese, and fukanese. or are you limiting &quot;Chinese&quot; to the symbols only?", "comment_date": "2016-08-09T01:06:16Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "Ugjv2bdowj0x53gCoAEC", "comment_by": "JetTheGuy", "comment_text": "I got my dry sense of humor from my grandpa!

If there is another aspect, called cognitive phenomenology, which involves the qualitative aspect of having a thought, i.e. there is something it is like to understand an equation, then we have reason to think that a machine could not understand.", "comment_date": "2016-08-08T23:31:13Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "Ugj7IzcHeus3nngCoAEC", "comment_by": "2hlwf8", "comment_text": "hell yeah, silverchair reference at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39EdqUbj92U&amp;t=6m01s\">6:01</a>.", "comment_date": "2016-08-08T23:29:56Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UggO-aWIW1YmpXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "B/EACH", "comment_text": "Hank fighting robot racism before it even exists", "comment_date": "2016-08-08T23:24:41Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "Ugj1ZeuIkhe_VngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Simone", "comment_text": "Can someone describe to me what conscious really mean?

If we (a) believe that humans can truly understand things, and (b) do not believe this understanding comes from an external soul, and (c) believe that humans are composed entirely of a special arrangement of aroms, then we must conclude that it is <b>possible</b> for things which have no understanding (atoms) to be arranged in a way which do have understanding. This follows directly from the premises.<br><br>Having established it <b>is</b> possible for dead things to be conscious when arranged correctly, there is no <i>a priori</i> reason to believe that we have the only possible arrangement. Thus it is at least <b>conceivable</b> that computers could be made to have understanding, and Searle is wrong to dismiss the possibility out of hand.

Put simply: <b>we do not act like neurons</b>. We act like people, despite the fact that neurons are the basis for our brains. Therefore we would not expect a computer intelligence to act like a computer. We would expect that it would have emotion; it could get tired, bored, or distracted; it would forget things; it would confabulate stories in place of memories, etc. It would do all these things and more because those are features of consciousness, not features of neurons or computers. The substance of consciousness is nothing like the substrate of whatever is implementing the intelligence. I don&#39;t really have space here to argue why I believe those are necessary features of consciousness - heck, I don&#39;t really have space for the argument I am making (which is wasted on being placed in a poor venue), but I do believe that a Strong AI can be a &quot;person,&quot; and that science fiction has done us a disservice in how it portrays Strong AI.", "comment_date": "2016-08-08T23:04:34Z", "likes_count": 7}}}, {"39EdqUbj92U": {"Artificial Intelligence & Personhood: Crash Course Philosophy #23": {"channel_id": "UgjG9IN2vlvBR3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "SchiferlED", "comment_text": "The chinese room does a great job of showing that the Turing test is insufficient to prove a strong AI.
