A Henry George reference!!! He was and still is the only pre-eminent scholar on political economy. He argued that land speculation and monopolization leads directly to wage slavery because land rents absorb all increases in profits of both capital and labor when it comes to technology that improves business and general society. He argues for the COMPLETE removal of taxes from both capital and labor and placing it directly on real-estate land rents thereby causing a boom to the growth of American business and jobs. In theory, everything will cost a fraction due to the removal of taxes that add up on the creation of goods and services. Consequently, people will spend more. Further, business will not have to lobby governments to pass tax laws that only favor corporations, and corporations can start to use their hard earned money again on growth, infrastructure, and product development. Plus, governments can be left to worry about the only things they should be concerned about--land and borders, education, and public safety. They will collect taxes as business and society grows without placing an undue burden on the working man. Land that was once held for speculation will be auctioned off to anyone in the public who wishes to &quot;work&quot; the land since the taxes will be the same whether the land is being used or not. Thus, it would not make sense to invest in land if you did not wish to use it.

It\u2019s fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I\u2019m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It\u2019s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, \u201cthe more you learn, the more you earn.\u201d<br>Now maybe you\u2019ve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it\u2019s again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it\u2019s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn\u2019t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn\u2019t have a college degree, I had no opportunities.<br>But you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it\u2019s not just about money, it\u2019s about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. And so I record a little video, it\u2019s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it\u2019ll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are.<br>Now, this isn\u2019t a \u201cget rich quick\u201d scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I\u2019m not promising you that tomorrow you\u2019re gonna be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it\u2019s not the most professional I just shot it here with my iPhone, but it\u2019s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I\u2019m going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it\u2019s completely free to watch it it\u2019s just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don\u2019t be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say \u201cAh that\u2019s not real that\u2019s for somebody else.\u201d<br>Don\u2019t listen, don\u2019t listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the man who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he read a book by Helen Keller, and that book changed his life. Books can change your life. And in that book, Helen Keller said \u201coptimism\u201d so if you\u2019re a cynic, if you\u2019re a pessimist you don\u2019t need to click here. Don\u2019t worry about it, I don\u2019t need to talk to everybody. But if you\u2019re somebody who knows that there\u2019s something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it\u2019s not necessarily a Lamborghini, maybe it\u2019s a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company.<br>Maybe it\u2019s a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you\u2019re destined to do. You can do those unless you understand finances. Money, I don\u2019t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I\u2019ll see you on my website, it\u2019s a quick video and you\u2019ll see there absolutely free.<br>So just click this video and you\u2019ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I\u2019m excited to share this amazing stuff. You\u2019ll see, not because of anything of me but because I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to learn from mentors many years ahead of me. Not just in books like these, although I love books but also real in-person mentors. So let me share with you these three tips that have made all the difference in my life. They\u2019re practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right?

That stolen generation has now made up a large number of well educated Aborigines standing up for aboriginal rights as well as health and social reforms in their own communities, the stolen generation should not have happened because we shouldn&#39;t have put them on land with everything supplied by the government and with no real jobs and nothing to do but drink alcohol and sniff petrol and paint fumes, we messed up really bad.

What&#39;s notable is that it was substantially motivated by a misguided view of &#39;protecting&#39; them, and it was a patronising elite that most promoted it.
