I\u2019m 25 now and barely a functioning adult. It sucks, it takes away all your energy. The thing about addiction being a coping mechanism for trauma is that it\u2019s not just substance abuse. I\u2019ve always been cautious about substance abuse and I\u2019ve been sober all my life but my addiction is based on approval from others. I constantly need to be validated and liked by others which ultimately resulted into a cell phone addiction. The thing about growth is that it has to be reinforced daily, you can\u2019t just go to a therapy session and expect magic to happen. My experience of being a corporate trainer is that the human psyche tends to gravitate back to its original state and default settings. Taking a workshop will only have short term results. If you really want to change your toxic patterns, you have to reinforce the change every single day and stick to it till it becomes your default setting.", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T10:15:38Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "ilovetb4life1988", "comment_text": "As someone who lives and is treated for PTSD, this is very accurate.

I always say that video games used to be the medicine I took to get away from all the bad things and so it was especially painful the way everything on the internet has changed, become so popular and a direct mirror of the things i was trying to avoid. I know to some extent it&#39;s normal to relax etc but some unhealthy habits are sounding a lot like the same sort of addiction, especially because in my case, I do not have a support system I just try to work through my problems at whatever pace I can. When you talked about things speeding up/slowing down, feeling that things are numb/or very surreal, that all fits and not that I don&#39;t know better now but when I was younger it was hard for me to take things seriously when either things seemed completely out of my control as far as how fast things were going no matter how hard I tried, or how fake some things seemed. In reality many of the things we see and experience are a mixture of both and that understanding is also surreal. I didn&#39;t think it was depression because of my ability to rationalize things but that numb feeling and that feeling of not being able to do anything is very similar to what other people describe. Though... in this case I don&#39;t have episodes of remembering the trauma, instead I have... the memory of things I&#39;ve liked that I no longer can see or enjoy or have changed permanently and it usually bothers me in my dreams. I also can sometimes be put into a sour mood when something specific related to an event that has happened to me occurs again and unfortunately it&#39;s made a lot of the more positive views on life seem foolish because I&#39;ve been in situations where had I not had that demeanor going in, it would&#39;ve been for the better.

When having multiple personality disorders, it can be extremely effective in coping with trauma from the past. When a personality takes over, you do not have to deal with your current situation. You dissociate because your brain knows you cannot handle this trauma, especially if it is a repeated trauma. Maybe you&#39;re too young to handle it at the time so another personality, supernatural, inanimate object, or animal alter takes over and handles it for you. I&#39;m saying this from personal experience from someone very close to me and from others who have this disorder and shared their stories online. And from researching, I found that PTSD can also be a huge factor as to why a person would want to change their gender. Hear me out, I am also open to the belief that someone is born trans aka they grew up knowing they were born in the wrong body. BUT! I want to also share what I&#39;ve learned from others. A lot of people who are reportedly trans and regret their transition have said that they were sexually abused in their childhood, therefore believing that if they changed their gender, they could have stopped what happened to them, or that it would rid their disgust and guilt from the past (the body they were born in may disgust them because of that horrible event). They thought that if were born the opposite gender, they wouldn&#39;t have been violated. I was violated in my childhood as well (biologically I am female) and I had trouble with my own gender growing up. Now I refer to myself as gender fluid, but there was a point in time where I wanted to be male and nothing else. I think those who think the same and have gone through similar situations should think deeply about what they think will make them feel better so that they don&#39;t feel worse later on. I&#39;m so sad that so many people can relate to such atrocities, but it&#39;s important to talk about so we can help others.

I have no damn clue why I didn&#39;t check on her sooner than I did, but eventually, I went to the bathroom door and knocked. There was no response, so I opened the door. My mom was unconscious, hunched over the sink, with no pulse or breath, ice cold. I went and called 911. The lady on the phone told me to try and get my mom onto the floor and attempt CPR. I couldn&#39;t get her off the sink, she felt too heavy. The 911 operator told me that paramedics were on the way, so I hung up. I went into the living room and just sat down and cried. It felt like I was sitting there for hours. Eventually, the paramedics came and got a very, very weak pulse out of her. They got my mom to a hospital, and when my grandparents and I got there, they said that my mom was in a coma and would most likely never wake up. They said that if for some reason she did wake up, she would be in a vegetative state. A day or two later, my family decided to pull the plug on her. Not a day goes by where I don&#39;t think about my mom, and I&#39;m always reliving that day and thinking of things I could have done to save her.

As someone who deals with PTSD and substance abuse, I can tell you that it&#39;s definitely a combination of genetics and trauma that produced my alcoholism.<br><br>I recently had a DNA test from GeneSight, to help my doctors know what medications my liver can and can&#39;t process. Turns out I have a genetic mutation that not only ruled out a whole class of medications, but is also highly correlated with alcoholism. So, there&#39;s that genetic component that&#39;s been passed on through the generations.<br><br>And you were right on the money when you talked about the debate between it being a biological drive or an obsession of the mind. It&#39;s something that&#39;s been debated since AA got started, back in 1935. The conclusion back then was that it was both, and based on my experience, I agree with that.<br><br>Like I said, genetically, I&#39;m set up to be an alcoholic, but I didn&#39;t trigger the disease of alcoholism until I had that first drink. But that first drink also sparks an obsession in my mind, where I can never stop with just one. With PTSD, and the numbness and misery that comes with it, it&#39;s hard to turn down anything that makes you feel good for a change. The pleasurable effect is just too strong. <br><br>I agree that both need to be treated concurrently. I tried therapy before I got sober, but I didn&#39;t get anything out of it because I was still drinking. It wasn&#39;t until I entered recovery that I could start making the changes that therapy encourages.<br><br>I&#39;m about to start EMDR therapy, and my therapist explained the science behind it. She talked about how trauma increases the size of the amygdala, which is part of the reason people become sensitive to triggers. Then, with each subsequent trauma or depression, the hippo-campus gets smaller. So, like you said, those memories aren&#39;t being filed away into long-term memory, which means that the intensity of the experience is relived, over and over again. It&#39;s the difference between &quot;This sucks&quot; and &quot;That sucked&quot; - like it&#39;s a clogged pipe.<br><br>She said that there&#39;s nothing we can currently do to decrease the size of the amygdala, but EMDR therapy does increase the size of the hippo-campus. By doing EMDR, the traumatic memories can get properly filed away, which decreases the sensitivity to triggers and flashbacks.

Whereas PTSD arises from relatively short, very acute trauma, DTD comes about from chronic, low levels of trauma that aren&#39;t usually seen to be traumatic (social isolation is a very good example of such an instance), but does have a very pervasive, insidious influence on one&#39;s self (indeed, it&#39;s &#39;developmental&#39; trauma because it badly and continually damages how that person develops over time). It&#39;s important to be aware that one can suffer trauma and not be aware of the seriousness of the damage done. Those single, parsed instances of pain that we try to construct our emotional narrative out of might appear trite if we haven&#39;t suffered war or rape or an abusive parent, but that doesn&#39;t change that pain can still exist, and can be debilitating.

First off, I feel like you missed a lot of opportunities to talk about treatments other than traditional 12-step programs. Programs like AA are not suitable for everyone and for those who are alcohol dependent going completely sober without going through medical detox is life-threatening. There are many other harm-reduction treatments - mostly outside of the US - that have much higher success rates (depending on how you define &quot;success&quot;). I&#39;m not saying 12-step problems don&#39;t work - they do for many - but it is not the only method of &quot;curing&quot; addiction. Further, there is also the &quot;social&quot; view of addiction which isn&#39;t a mental illness or a physical disease, but rather more of a learned behavior model. I&#39;ve glad you bring up the idea of dual diagnoses; one of the most important thing I&#39;ve learned from our studies is that most people will tell you they don&#39;t have a problem with alcohol, they have a problem with the underlying trauma.

As far as I can tell, there was no premarital &quot;relations&quot;.<br>This is interesting because JRR Tolkien chose to write conservatively - and what is conservatism but a yearning for a solid foundation, good morals, values, permanence, etc.?

In this context is seems negative and positive have the meaning that&#39;s inherently a value judgement of good and bad respectively.

The reason why I think physiology has a reputation as being a soft science as opposed to hard is due largely to subjective criteria. For example, maladaptive (part of the criteria for a disorder) is largely dependent on circumstance. Is that obsession maladaptive if it&#39;s your livelihood to make the thing you&#39;re obsessed with?
