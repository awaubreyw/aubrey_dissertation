She offered the judiciary branch unlimited power to pursue greed. In return, she gets kickbacks on arms deals. Judges are immune. They declared that there is no liability associated with attorney conduct. A divorce in Colorado is a quarter million to judges and attorneys. No need to give the entitled party anything. If statutes were enforced no one would ever litigate. Colorado Constitution and statutes are enough to stop 99% of domestic assaults. So judges don&#39;t record hearings and prevent the victim from entering the courtroom when they seal the case. Expecting the domestic assailant to bring more money next time. Maybe a juicy domestic murder. The Clintons open endless private prisons, turning people into billionaires off of slave labor. The Sheriff&#39;s departments are paid per-head so they can&#39;t really stop crime and make sure to maintain it. Judges abuse their discretion in misapplying laws of Oral Agreements unto all other parts of the law, even criminal law. So the judge will say something. If the defendant answers they are in contempt of court and will go to prison. If the defendant doesn&#39;t instantly interrupt than he has entered an oral agreement with the DA and will go to prison. It helps keeping criminals out. Washington is the capitol of murders - if you figured out what politicians are about you&#39;ll get murdered. After several appeals, the judge will simply change the Register of Action on the case repeatedly, making it impossible to appeal in Colorado. The case is referred to the Federal Supreme Court, where the person is declared insane for not &quot;remembering&quot; his own pleadings and is put in incarceration where the drug companies can make more money on them. Innocent people are prosecuted for profit. Attorneys take advantage of confusion during foreclosures and simply file fraudulent QuitClaim Deeds in anyone&#39;s name for no reason. Judges endorse their own arbitrary rulings as the clerks are &quot;supervised&quot; by chief judges. Clinton has now renewed her kickbacks deals by opening more private prisons. People in the Middle East are pushed to violence in order to justify spending on arms. Australia is also on its way to become a tyranny centered around the judiciary. That would make most of the world a tyranny - and the leaders will always try to control all other countries. Three new amendments to the U.S. Constitution can change the course of history: 29 - state employee, DORA regulated judges. No appeals. No need to botch the case. Work from the constitution up. Simple. 30 - Clerks supervised by Sheriff&#39;s office &amp; DORA. No justice department. No chief judges. No justices. 31- No attorneys ever elected with the legislative branch. No legislators eligible for attorney license.", "comment_date": "2015-11-05T18:03:34Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"0bf3CwYCxXw": {"Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances: Crash Course Government and Politics #3": {"channel_id": "UgjRNWTpWOtp33gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Mani Mae Gomes", "comment_text": "ur so fallible", "comment_date": "2015-11-04T07:16:48Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"0bf3CwYCxXw": {"Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances: Crash Course Government and Politics #3": {"channel_id": "UghvP6M8cyQQuXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Sigal Stein", "comment_text": "Three branches of government don&#39;t check eachother anymore than three board members of an Owner Association. If you own a condo you know what I mean. The judicial branch is not only self-regulating, it is also self-legislating. They are tyrannical and waste billions hourly without upholding anyone&#39;s civil rights. We need them disassembled. I&#39;m a lay person and I don&#39;t give legal advice. All I can tell you is that the Supreme Court <br>changes the law weekly to respond to constituents trying to uphold their legal rights. If the statutes and constitution were upheld people would settle out of court or they would go pro-se. The law is easy and simple. I read the West Law Practice Series - a book costs as much as one hour of &quot;consultation&quot; with an attorney. The attorney to the entitled party typically stays quiet and tries to sell her out based on whatever the judge and the attorney to the wealthier party decides. I wouldn&#39;t hire an attorney unless they communicated with me very clearly. Bonnie Shields did. She was hired unbundled but entered general representation anyway. I later read at the LexisNexis Introduction to the Rules of Professional Conduct that attorneys can do that. They don&#39;t have to represent the party&#39;s interests and any two attorneys can agree on anything - regarding of the law - based on C.R.C.P 15(4).  I was told that I can read this rule in any state if I replace the C for Colorado with the first letter of their state. Based on what I hear attorneys will persecute an innocent party that consulted with them in a position of an Attorney of Record. When I had an Attorney of Record I couldn&#39;t communicate with the court at all - only them. They misrepresented the case so I learned how to file an Appeal with the Colorado Court of Appeals and that allowed me to file a copy with my case in District Court. Magistrate Moss would have fired my attorney based on the constitution - it makes sense that if I&#39;m a party that I can represent my own interests in a case, right? But the two attorneys agreed to move the case to Judge Angela Arkin&#39;s court - because she practices misconduct. I therefore designated her as the Appellee in an appeal. She then put me in jail illegally and had an attorney hire a locksmith and break into my house. You could see it in the Register of Action for Douglas County, CO case 13DR30128, but the judge declared it confidential. The attorney stole my social security card, Xeroxes of I.D.s, passport photos, financial and medical information, titles, etc. If I tried appealing again someone would have claimed that I gave them power of attorney. They would have hijacked the litigation so that the public doesn&#39;t realize what&#39;s going on. If I file my own documents the public gets to look at them and study the law. I would have also become homeless due to attorney bills. The Supreme Court changes the law weekly but I&#39;m giving out copies of my outdated appeals to anyone. Ask me for a copy, they are free. Please write congress to disassemble the independent judicial branch. Replace with supervised magistrates. No judge, no justices, no attorney of record. Separation of authorities. Everything the judges and attorneys hate! And please vote NO to Judge Angela Arkin in 2016 if you are a taxpayer - she appoints everything state funded just for kickbacks.", "comment_date": "2015-10-30T18:15:10Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"0bf3CwYCxXw": {"Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances: Crash Course Government and Politics #3": {"channel_id": "UgiVVw1NBSEa93gCoAEC", "comment_by": "faith garcia", "comment_text": "Who&#39;s here from mr de la garza?", "comment_date": "2015-10-29T05:50:18Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"0bf3CwYCxXw": {"Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances: Crash Course Government and Politics #3": {"channel_id": "UghBdUaKdvyXtngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Alexis Hale", "comment_text": "technically, shouldn&#39;t his clones share the same accent/voice?", "comment_date": "2015-10-27T01:11:35Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"0bf3CwYCxXw": {"Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances: Crash Course Government and Politics #3": {"channel_id": "UghS1b41DIJLAngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Peter Connelly", "comment_text": "Are you trying to be cute, or trying to teach something important?
