The shape of your daily electricity consumption of a particular month compared to same month last year. It may not be exactly the same, but can you say it&#39;s similar enough, or is there a big spike/ difference for some reason<br>The distribution of data can be normal, left/right skewed, bi/multi-modal<br>The normal distribution (also called bell curve) is symmetric, where mean, median and mode is the same and data folds in exact halfs around it. The standard deviation is the average distance of a data point from the mean. 68% of all data falls within one standard deviation on either side of the mean. So smaller the standard deviation, skinnier is the normal distribution.<br>The distribution can also be skewed, with the peak being towards the left (positive skewed) or right (negative skewed) with longer tails on either side of the box plot. The std dev is higher in these cases as the mean is pulled towards the higher values of the range. Box plots of these can help us visually predict the std dev, range and mean.<br>The data can also be bi/multi-modal having two or more peaks. These look like two/multiple unimodal distributions pasted side by side. Often times they are two separate processes producing these distributions being measured as together eg. Times of geyser eruptions, completion times of a marathon ( Professionals/participants)<br>A final kind of distribution is the uniform distribution where wach value has an equal chance of occuring eg. Dice. This may be true theoretically, but the distribution of a die roll may not be uniform for all values when plotted. Though our machine/process is set for it. Does this mean we need to keep rolling the die ? Or do we want to investigate if the die is loaded ?<br>Statistics is all about answering questions when we are not sure. And shapes of distribution give a lot of information in helping us do the same.", "comment_date": "2020-04-25T06:54:48Z", "likes_count": 20}}}, {"bPFNxD3Yg6U": {"The Shape of Data: Distributions: Crash Course Statistics #7": {"channel_id": "Ugx5dhNAyAHSvx2fEO14AaABAg", "comment_by": "Rohit Sagar", "comment_text": "Great video - really helpful.
