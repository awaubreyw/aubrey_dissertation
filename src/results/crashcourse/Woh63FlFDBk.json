I talk about the Great Migration in my mass media class specifically because it was so difficult to condense. Despite being one of the most important occurrences in the 20th century United States, almost nobody knows about it because it could not be distilled to a single article or clipping. There was no singular  &quot;event&quot; that could be pointed to, so it slipped through the cracks of the old Bennett Model for news rooms. A combination of racism, attitudes, and the traits of the available mass media of the day have made this a badly overlooked and undertreated subject. We use it as a platform to discuss the values and limits of various media, and how they may impact our understanding of history and the present. I really appreciate your distilling of this information, and I hope that it gets the attention it deserves.
