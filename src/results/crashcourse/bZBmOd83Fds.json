First, Sal is not a racist because he puts pictures of famous Italians on his wall. It&#39;s his business and he has the right to decorate it however he pleases. If he was racist against black people, why would he open up a shop in a black neighborhood? He is constantly challenging Pino&#39;s racism throughout the film, including in his very first scene. There is a scene toward the end where Pino is trying to convince Sal to leave the neighborhood, because he&#39;s ashamed of working in a black community and Sal shuts him down. Sal outright tells Pino that anyone who would make fun of him for that isn&#39;t really his friend, that his real friends are the black community that support their business. Sal tells him that he&#39;s &quot;proud of as hell&quot; to be part of a  black community, and he shows affection and friendship toward black characters at several points. (Da Mayor, Mookie&#39;s sister)<br><br> Buggin&#39; Out is a compulsive race baiter who uses very real, very legitimate causes to start petty fights that don&#39;t have anything to do with the larger struggle. He&#39;s insecure and materialistic (The initial fight with Sal was because Sal charged him extra for cheese, and then again when the white guy on the bike accidentally steps on his shoe, which the guy immediately apologizes for) and uses race as an excuse to lash out. The ending scene involved him and Radio Raheem barging into Sal&#39;s shouting and making threats after the business is closed. What owner wouldn&#39;t refuse service? If you barge into a business blasting extremely loud music and being rude and combative after the business is closed, you&#39;re going to get kicked out no matter what race you are. I don&#39;t agree with Sal destroying the boombox, and I don&#39;t agree with his use of The N Word, but if you&#39;re going to claim Sal is an unsympathetic racist for that reason alone, then you have to say the same thing about nearly every character in the movie.<br><br>And that, ultimately, is the entire point of the movie, that racism is a deeply toxic thing that is embedded in all sides of the community. Don&#39;t forget that one of the Jamaican characters goes on a rant about how much he resents successful Korean immigrants, despite being an immigrant himself. That same Korean immigrants then go on a rant against Jewish people, right before a rant by a white police officer against Puerto Ricans. Nearly every character in this movie engages in some degree of stereotyping and slur words, every character is racist to some extent, and the film demonizes all of it. Race is portrayed as something that allows people to act on anger that ultimately comes from other sources. Buggin&#39; Out thinks Sal is cheap and feels slighted, (Despite the fact that Buggin&#39; Out himself was extremely rude in asking for more cheese) and then uses race as a justification for his anger. Notice that his &quot;boycott&quot; is completely unsuccessful and practically everybody tells him that Sal&#39;s is a hallmark of the community. The only person who joins him is Radio Raheem, who is himself extremely rude and entitled, both to Sal and the Korean storeowners. <br><br>Crash Course completely missed the point of this movie. It&#39;s not a simple tale of white racism and black victim-hood, it&#39;s a multifaceted story where all people of all races are simultaneously victim and victimizer. It shows us that racism exists everywhere, and that is often an excuse for people to be petty and rude to another, to dehumanize them and accuse them of the worst crimes when their motivations are much more mundane (Is Sal really a hateful bigot because he tells Radio Raheem to shut off his music, or does he just want a quiet atmosphere in his restaurant so his customers can enjoy themselves and talk?) The real tragedy of racism is that it blows misunderstandings and grievances between individuals out of proportion, leading to horrible consequences that wouldn&#39;t have happened if it werent for this underlying distrust of each other. Sal didn&#39;t deserve to lose his pizzeria, but more importantly, Radio Raheem didn&#39;t deserve to lose his life. Nobody comes out of this story perfectly innocent or perfectly guilty, and that was Spike Lee&#39;s intention. The genius of this movie is that does not offer us easy answers that make us feel good about ourselves, it shows us the difficult, painful, and complicated truth beyond race relations. You can&#39;t boil a brilliant film like this down to &quot;Sal is initially sympathetic but he was really the Big Bad all along!&quot; Poor show, Crash Course.", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T20:44:26Z", "likes_count": 312}, {"comment_by": "Jay Bee", "comment_text": "This movie has been one of my favorites since I was young. <br>I was curious to see how it would be summarized in this video.
