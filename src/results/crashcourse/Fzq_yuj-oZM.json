Now nuclear, currently modular reactors that we have seen similar to on military vessels are buried  on every military base, we might be able to meet baseload power with nuclear technology. Currently there are efforts by corporations like Microsoft to get these modular reactors to power large data centers but if part of you has doubts about burying reactors all over the USA, you are not wrong. Currently, we are in the process of decommissioning nuclear plants. We have cooling ponds all over the USA where if just 1 were to explode it would be a exetencial event. It&#39;s a great cold war idea to ensure if the grid fails the world ends but we have made little to no progress with the way nuclear power is done since then. Everything is still theoretical and until mankind needs a way to produce power domestically and not produce plutonium or atleast use it for domestic power, we will forever be stuck in the cold war era for nuclear.", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T20:41:49Z", "likes_count": 2}}}, {"Fzq_yuj-oZM": {"The Biggest Problems We're Facing Today & The Future of Engineering: Crash Course Engineering #46": {"channel_id": "UgwjGXDci_v-KxqNqMl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "VitruvianSasquatch", "comment_text": "Increased automation is also likely to be a focus, even if it makes people uncomfortable...", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T20:36:10Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"Fzq_yuj-oZM": {"The Biggest Problems We're Facing Today & The Future of Engineering: Crash Course Engineering #46": {"channel_id": "UgzLrhTSPrsTZScCwVF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "DougOfTheAntarctic", "comment_text": "We need more Shini Somara.
