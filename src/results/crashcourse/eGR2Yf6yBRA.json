I just did it again and then again again (it&#39;s rarely too late to modify your plan if you find the need/want). So, the balancing classes and life is particularly important, but also knowing how to plan your desired college experience is important... though I imagine that it&#39;s simpler when you&#39;re taking less complex majors. Also, it&#39;s important to note that not all majors have equal course loads and the type of assignments can differ from major to major (I haven&#39;t really had tests in my majors, instead being paper and project heavy... but other majors have a lot more tests).", "comment_date": "2022-05-06T01:43:12Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Firebeard Longfellow", "comment_text": "Depending on your specific colleges legal credentials also comes into what you can reasonably do, and also their learning curriculum as well.<br><br>Say for my college that I attended. You are able to be very flexible in your minors, but your primary major is rather rigid. So I have a mechanical engineering technology major at the Bachelors level.<br><br>HOWEVER if I wanted to I could and could&#39;ve had a minor in materials with a focus on stainless steels due to having a materials course within the realm of stainless steels, and if I took a secondary even more niche course on stainless steels on top of the first required class I could have a main major and a materials minor.<br><br>This can also be spun to expand your main major as well. Instead of simply going all in for a Masters level of a realm of study you can simply build with your main majors base to also have another major as well. For me personally I could go full in Mechanical Engineering which is more heavily theory based engineering (more drafting, theory, and desk work) simply by attending for another semester or 2 classes wise at my university because my MET degree goes right into the core building blocks of an ME degree minus the higher level chemistry and physics.<br><br>So you can flex your degrees and majors via how your school does them. My school is smart in that they outright differ from being engineering using the crutch of calculus to weed out the riff raff with instead being algebra oriented. This allows for more focus on core problem solving that can be applied to many realms of study while still also having calculus being a core but not a make or break major facet of the learning curriculum. On top of this they can have a sort of built in filtering setup for how their classes are oriented.<br><br>My school has it to where all lower courses for the realm of engineering touch base on electrical, computer, engineering, and technology realms of learning. Depending on what you love, or excel at is where my mentors/professors would chime in in saying &quot;hey you do well in this would you want to pursue it?&quot; Along with setting up talks or discussions with previous or current students both studying, and working to let you get glimpses of the field of work to make better decisions.<br><br>ALSO THERE IS NO SHAME OR STIGMA IN TAKING LOWER COURSES AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES BEFORE GOING TO THE PERCIEVED &quot;BIG NAME SCHOOLS&quot;!!!<br><br>ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE SCHOOL IS ACCREDITED AND ALSO THAT YOUR CREDIT HOURS TRANSFER!!!!!!!!<br><br>May any and all who pursue higher education excel, and prosper!<br><br>(Also for those currently in the grind.
