My 2016 book was all new material that I wrote between 2015 and 2016 and presented the results of my research in an entirely different presentation than what my website presented. The scope of my 2016 book was vastly different in expression than what I copyrighted in 2014.

She told me I would need to file for a new copyright registration for my 2016 book, even though the theme of it was derived from\u00a0the material I copyrighted from my 2014 website. So I filed for a special handling copyright application for my 2016 book and now the US Copyright Office is giving me a hard time, claiming the material I am now trying to copyright\u00a0was basically copied from the 2014 material but it was not copied\u00a0as they claim but rather, written anew in non fiction book form, with chapters and is close to\u00a0300 pages long whereas the website material was nowhere near that length.

I tried asking in the\u00a0discussion area, but never got an answer: Here:\u00a0There&#39;s a big question I&#39;ve been curious about on copyright and trademark. It&#39;s when people try put copyright on a common everyday thing that everyone uses and has been around for years. Like say for example, someone tries to copyright sidewalks cause there product uses or is part of there product. I ask this cause I remember a few years ago the company who made candy crush try to copyright the words candy crush saga, but I hear it failed. I know when it comes to the series itself, they know the idea, the art style, and the game itself, but they cant own the words of the title; much like how marvel knows the rights to the characters in the avengers, but not the word. Or, same for the BBCs avenger, which might be public domain by now so it might not matter, but this is just a example. BBC could try to file lawsuit against marvel for the name, but obviously, these are two different shows, but, I know something like this does happen in modern world. But, back to my question, here&#39;s another example, i believe it was restaurant impossible, where a owner copyrighted the word hun, which means no one is allowed to use a common word in anything not owned by her, but when she did it alienated alot of people. So, is there a limit to what can be copyrighted when it comes to words?", "comment_date": "2015-06-04T13:19:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OneOfTheLostOnes", "comment_text": "Love the daredevil reference in this one.", "comment_date": "2015-06-04T09:56:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ctraver", "comment_text": "That&#39;s the de jure copyright time limit. \u00a0The de facto limit is last time Disney complained + years proportional to how loudly Disney complained.", "comment_date": "2015-06-04T01:07:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Syed Hassan", "comment_text": "Originality does not exsost INA completely objective sense", "comment_date": "2015-06-02T22:02:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Ward", "comment_text": "Stan Muller is doing great!
