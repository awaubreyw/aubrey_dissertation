What we learn from this video are how is proper lab attire, how to disposing chemical safely, how to avoiding common lab accident properly, what is hazmat diamond, and what is MSDS. The first important thing that must you keep on laboratory is your hair. If your hair is long, it shall always be up in the lab because if is not, it will catch on fire, it also will knock stuff over and intrude your vision. The second one is about our clothes. Clothes must be covered on all your body much as possible usualy we use lab coat and we must use socks and gloves. As we know that our eyes are the most vulnerable organs, we must protect it with eye protector but is not an eyeglasses. And when you feel like something must gotten in your eyes, you might wash your eyes with eye washer. Next is do not eat or drink in the lab because the chemical probably gets in your foods, or you accidentally pick up in the wrong cup, it will be danger for your body. If you are working with any machinery or hazardous substances, you must know about the chemical and you must know about Hazmat Diamond and it good some useful information in its each little box. It\u2019s rated 0 to 4 blue is for healt, red is for flamability, and yellow is for chemical reactivity. If you ever need to know more about a chemical and what it might due to you or to the world. The is a good MSDS that it means the material safety things that it might due to you. If you ever need to find one really fast you dont need to go to the cabinet anymore you can just google friend there will be information on how best to threat the person who got exposed. Always read the MSDS before you even touch a chemical. Also you should probably assumed that every liquid in the lab that is not water and is flammable. From this video we also can learn about a fume hoods. The fuction is to sucks all the air in there out so you dont have to breathe whatever going on in there it is also why its impossible to heating units are constanly pumping in controlled air and and these are contstantly sucking it out. So if you doing some chemistry that might containt goes on in here. Dont try to sucking air that contain in this thing, because it can make headache, nausea, disorientation, dizziness, pulmonary edema and death. Also never test something by testing it. And we must avoid pipete chemical by mouth. Pipetting is one way to move a substance from one testing tube to another. If you want to pour you can pour, you will not overcome the surface tension and it dribble down the side of container, so just commit. Next thing is about cleaning broken glass. We must cleaning up broken glass with a broom, do not with your hands and then deposit the result into a bin specifically for sharp stuff. When your done with an experiment do not approved by the person in a charge of chemical safety. If we throw it on sink it will be dangerous to environment.
