A component of UG is Generative Grammar, which postulates that grammatical sentences are generated in the brain (in a designated region of the brain) according to specific rules. This is the theory which sees a human brain as a computer with a pre-programmed software.<br><br>Usage-based language theories take different positions to Chomskyan UG/GG. Usage-based linguistics looks at such things as frequency or entrenchment and does not postulate &#39;rules&#39; generating sentences. It is interested in the whole human cognition and treats language as interconnected with the general knowledge in the mind. That means that grammar will be bound with the meaning (UG separates syntax and semantics), and also with non-linguistics perceps, like visual or motosensor ones (see also: embodied cognition). <br><br>There is no tangible evidence for Generative Grammar postulates and many languages, also many grammatical instances in English do not &#39;fit&#39; the theory (linguistics is generally extremely English-centred, btw). Psycholinguistics, for example, does not follow their postulates, as experimental evidence is not in line with UG. They still use GG terminology, though, unfortunately (probably from the lack of the alternative), which leads many linguistic students into thinking that Chomskyan theories are the only ones that we have. <br><br>Other grammars might not be so neat and mathematically pleasing (the horror of Word Grammar dependencies!) and they do not claim to have a ready-to-go formulas (like the omnipotent movement in GG) to explain syntactic &#39;structures&#39;/syntax.
