It is three dimensional.  More like a gas with density, pressure, momentum, energy. vorticity, magnetic moment, charge, concentrations of things.  All that is required is a simple 3D visualization like a point cloud.  Please!  a rubber sheet and bowling ball might have been good enough three decades ago, but we certainly can do much better than that now.  If it will help you, then think of the gravitational potential itself, and its associated gradient, the gravitational accelerations. The physical vacuum is not a bad way to remember.  Change the reflectivity, transparency for every voxel according to some reasonable visualization. <br><br><br>We don&#39;t any Internet wide standard for 3D videos.  We should. Then you could change your viewpoint while the 3D video to let you see things from different places, and at different time rates (change over a vast range of frame rates to see details invisible to humans).  If you integrate the gravitational energy density, that value can be calculated for every point in space.  Is it exact or verified?  Not yet. But it is one place to start.  Even simple things like electron densities, axion densities and their respective flows, vorticities and temperature can have complex and beautiful periodic and chaotic structures.  You are representing a complex beautiful field with a cheap visualization.<br><br><br>So this old method is a lot misleading.  At least use the gravitational potential and then color it some way humans can see.  We false color radio telescope pictures and a vast number fields and signals that humans cannot directly see.  There are excellent models for the global gravitational and magnetic fields of the earth at the surface and into space.  They are in spherical harmonic forms, and real time measurement.  It takes a bit of looking to find a decent calculator, then a 3D visualizer.  But not impossible.  Maybe your friendly geophysicist or astrophysicist friends can do it for you.<br><br><br>Most people are not familiar with the gravitational energy density.  I only happened on it back in the 1970&#39;s after I met Joe Weber.  He told me to look at his student, Robert Forward&#39;s, work.  It is g^2/(8 pi G) in SI units, where g is in (meters/second^2), and G is 6.6743E-11 (meters/second^2) per (kilogram/meter^2).  At the surface of the earth the gravitational energy density is the same as a magnetic field of about 380 Tesla, a laser of 1.7E19 Watts/m^2 or a black body at 2.95 million Kelvin (not sure if this to within a factor 2 based on different model assumptions).  My point is that space is not empty by any means.  Even if you do not fill it with gravitons and axions, the gravitational potential itself is extremely stable and well understood.  At least color that in 3D so people can see it. And you will see that the earth&#39;s gravitational potential is dwarfed by the sun.<br><br><br>The gravitational potential changes constantly because of changes in the atmosphere, oceans, and earth on the earth, and changes on the sun and moon and more distant sources of gravitational potential change.  So if you really want to get fancy show how that is changing constantly.  The time dilation equation used for GPS time corrections can be used to show how that changes with time. And it is well defined everywhere in space, so you could plot the rate of clocks, or the vacuum index of refraction, anywhere on earth or in space or on the sun or on the moon - as a function of time.  Many many experiments on earth and in space are now sensitive enough to measure these changes in the potential. And many more can measure the gradient of the gravitational potential, the gravitational acceleration.  Any 3D video would be fine. <br><br><br>Thank you for listening.  Please don&#39;t use that rubber sheet any more. Gravity is not a rubber sheet!!<br><br><br>I have to deal with the gravitational potential every day.  My own view is that it is filled with gravitons, axions, quarks, gluons and neutrinos in different concentrations. These vary in mass and number density, velocity and cross section.  It might be wrong, but that simple step greatly simplified things for me.  And gave me a more concrete thing to &quot;see&quot; with my human mind when I try to visualize the action of the gravitational potential field at atomic, subnuclear and global scales.  I guess I am more a chemist.  I like to count moles of gravitons, and not leave them invisible and transparent, even if my human eyes cannot see them.<br><br><br>Richard  Collins, The Internet Foundation", "comment_date": "2020-02-20T00:29:36Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"9W3RsaWuCuE": {"Dark Matter: Crash Course Astronomy #41": {"channel_id": "UgxPKIrPmXGzqAkSBDx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Jiexi Ai", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3RsaWuCuE&amp;t=5m30s\">5:30</a>. &quot;He is stretching out the heavens like a fine gauze.&quot; The prophet Isaiah, c. 742 B.C.E.", "comment_date": "2020-02-19T20:23:24Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"9W3RsaWuCuE": {"Dark Matter: Crash Course Astronomy #41": {"channel_id": "UgzAKOB1yri-OiT3dx94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Daniel Verberne", "comment_text": "One concept I struggle with when dealing with dark matter is trying to understand at what scale dark matter predominates over local movements such as Andromeda galaxy moving towards us does it need to be a lot larger scale for black dark matter to be effective?", "comment_date": "2020-02-18T06:00:31Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"9W3RsaWuCuE": {"Dark Matter: Crash Course Astronomy #41": {"channel_id": "UgyWg-IppZUbXGPSz1h4AaABAg", "comment_by": "the little astrophysicist", "comment_text": "very helpful i really needed this for idea for my science fair", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T20:56:27Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"9W3RsaWuCuE": {"Dark Matter: Crash Course Astronomy #41": {"channel_id": "UgwHpcWm63cNjx2Ognl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Daniel Rayson", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3RsaWuCuE&amp;t=2m18s\">2:18</a>  &quot;The Only Explanation...&quot;  I turned off at that point.", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T13:09:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"9W3RsaWuCuE": {"Dark Matter: Crash Course Astronomy #41": {"channel_id": "UgzoTWlFBBTlHDBmY094AaABAg", "comment_by": "TheInvshika", "comment_text": "What if the expansion of spacetime itself is what&#39;s causing material further out from a galaxy&#39;s core to move quicker?

It has been put forward that the Earth would continue to move around where the sun was at for that same 8(+) minutes because the gravity from the sun would also last that long... Because of the speed of &#39;C&#39;. But if gravity... The warping of spacetime, moves faster than &#39;C&#39;... The Earth would fling out of orbit faster than the visible light from the sun would vanish. - A gravity wave (or ripple in spacetime) is in effect an Alcubierre-style warp, with no laws of physics limiting it&#39;s speed. - I have some possible consequences to this thought. - Let&#39;s follow the birth and evolution of a particular gravity wave... I&#39;ll call him Gerard. Gerard is formed by the orbits of two massive objects and radiates outward. He behaves as we have learned that he behaves... But at the point where we think that he has expanded (or dissipated) to being ineffective to the matter that he encounters... The actuality of his existence is something different.

The matter that grows in these eddies of gravity &#39;flow&#39; can be seen to move too fast for its own gravity and we think it should be spinning itself apart... But actually, the gravity that keeps the galaxies together is from the outside &#39;flow&#39; - Not the inside mass, or more accurately - both. - Dark matter does not exist... When we map the areas where we see more gravity... and call it dark matter... What we are seeing is the &#39;flow&#39; of all the gravity that was ever birthed.

Black holes are &quot;invisible&quot; to us but they can interact with light through mutual gravitational attraction. This is actually like the light of a distant star passing by a dense star like the sun will cause the light to bend towards the sun due to mutual gravitational pull between them. It is wrong to presume the existence of gravitational waves. Prove it?Einstein&#39;s famous equation, E=mc^2 is wrong otherwise garbage also can be used to make nuclear bombs as long as it is matter or it has mass. Energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photon before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass.

[...] But the number of stars in the galaxy clearly got lower the further out you went.&quot;<br><br>Lets take a look at facts first. Space isnt entirely empty, it still has a number of atoms in it. Though this number in interstellar space is about 50 000 atoms / 0.1 meter. This has been measured with the voyager spacecrafts. The values should also decline when entering intergalactic space.<br><br>And onto my Theory.<br>What if these atoms formed something simular to a accretion disk but in a way less dense way? After all the number of stars decline but not necesserely the number of atomes / meter, it could for as much as we know increase. It would fit the discription of &quot;dark&quot; since there arent enough atoms tho disturb our view. After all we can see through space.<br>So the further out you go in a galaxy the less stars you will find but the more atoms / meter you will find. <br>This could also explain other things such as galactic nebulae, the atoms get attracted by each other and squezee into a smaller and smaller area. The late stages would be seen as the nebulae they are but the earlier stages wouldnt be seen at all. Or would they? after all these would have a gravitational influence... so light from galaxies behind would bend around them and form a exemple of gravitational lensing aka an einsteinring.<br><br>Please leave any question rather then not.
