Of the 7,000 languages identified, including thousands of spoken languages, and hundreds of sign languages, what are the edge cases like and what distinguishes them or makes them a tough call? For example, written language seems to be shaped by its medium in that in hand writing a book, monks used a shorthand that would be nonsensical to pronounce rather than the words they represent. In text messages on flip phones, a new form of shorthand arrived based on the tediousness of input style. Smoke signals are communicative and (I&#39;m guessing I don&#39;t know much about them) have some defined set of symbols but it is heavily reliant on the nature of the medium. Is this one of the symbolic languages? Since the meaning being conveyed in body language is most accurately measured statistically, as specifically people sometimes refuse to express what they want to communicate in body language with any other form and confirmation can be hard to get, does this count as language? If so, does it have higher order structures like grammer (like first I huff and then I stomp my feet, and then I slam a door; or first I smile, and then I wink, and then I lean in for a kiss)?", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T17:15:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ekevoo Pointyhorse", "comment_text": "I am so glad that it&#39;s been like 3 years since I&#39;ve last had to talk to people to order pizza.", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T17:15:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bel\u00e9n Mansilla", "comment_text": "I\u2019VE BEEN PREPARING MY WHOLE INTERNET LIFE FOR THIS", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T16:53:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Midnafan725", "comment_text": "This probably couldn&#39;t have come at a better time for me..As I sit and wait for things to clear a little and figure out how to go about a Bachelors for Art, I am holding myself over with multiple foreign languages on DuoLingo..and I am contending with a grand total of 9 languages..<br><br>German (done once already but redoing..and nearly finished).., Norwegian (Complete), Scottish Gaelic, Finnish (It may see a redo after I&#39;m done because its a recently released course..), Arabic (I have to redo this one because it expanded when I was done with it originally..and it might be several times because it still doesn&#39;t seem like a complete skill tree to me..), Romanian, Czech, Russian, Hindi, and Japanese (I started on it but couldn&#39;t focus on it enough because of Norwegian at the time..)..<br><br>DuoLingo is completely free, for anyone interested..unless you try to get Premium of course..At present time, my DuoLingo day streak is 396 days..I am literally in linguistic hell as a hobby..", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T16:50:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J A", "comment_text": "Fingers crossed that this includes the topic of how technology affects language.
