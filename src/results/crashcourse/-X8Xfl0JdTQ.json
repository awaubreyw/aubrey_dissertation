Eventually one has to get back to an assumption of knowledge, especially concerning the nature of reality, and cease arguing that only evidence-based knowledge through falsifiability is true knowledge.", "comment_date": "2020-01-18T22:00:34Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "UgxtFxnWKN3sqsKKZER4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Treb Jude Tuazon", "comment_text": "i learn better here than my professors", "comment_date": "2020-01-13T11:06:53Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "UgyubdJwdjf06q3eqB94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Deepak Pannu", "comment_text": "Best episode so far.", "comment_date": "2020-01-11T07:38:16Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "UgzWZNFEPadu1MulzGh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Mario Knows It\u2019s God", "comment_text": "Science, only provable through the Scientific method. <br>Other than that, no astrophysicist, Astronomer, cosmologist has ever developed a viable hypothesis in the history of science EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!", "comment_date": "2019-12-28T18:00:54Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "UgyGQqFEH1TSLZamOEh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "AKHIL MARU", "comment_text": "So is &quot;String Theory&quot; non-scientific?

There only one possible solution to this matter. That is excepting an existence beyond this existence as you suggest in episode 29. That means there is an upper kind of reality including our reality and that means our ideas are not genuine they are just different pieces of different layers of existance.<br>What really interests me is if one reject the idea in episode 29 and insists on that this is the only reality existing, than he or she need to face the consequence of &quot;knowledge creation&quot; expecially false knowledge is being created from nothing into our minds, which is total destruction of the rule &quot;nothing comes from nothing&quot; even knowing it is defies itself in that case. <br>Knowledge is not something like an apple if one takes from any other, than that person will loose his or her apple, when we share knowledge, it just multiplies in our mind, either false or true does not matter.<br>What I am gonna imply is truer knowledge about our existence is no different than revelation itself, like saying Einstein is the prophet of relativity and physics in some sence, but he just happens to be very bad at theology and human manner where historical prophets are excell at, because where he stands is nowhere to judge the religion in right direction.

Rather, it&#39;s that falsificationism, even if not entirely satisfactory as an answer to all the philosophical questions it aimed to address, captures something right about the scientific spirit as an attitude toward one&#39;s beliefs. I think there&#39;s a very natural human tendency to cherish our beliefs and want to insulate them from counter-evidence; we see this in confirmation bias, filter bubbles, and related socio-psychological phenomenon. Scientists are human too and exhibit these tendencies, but scientific culture as a whole encourages the intellectual virtue of really seeking out counter-evidence, ideally outright falsification, of your views and putting them through the ringer of the most rigorous tests you can devise. The most saintly in respect of this virtue can even delight in being proven wrong, unlike the rest of us wretches who simmer and seeth at the thought of it. Popper doesn&#39;t have to have nailed the answer to the demarcation problem to have made a positive contribution in his emphasis on falsification as an important aim of scientific inquiry.", "comment_date": "2018-08-24T17:45:31Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "Ugxu-tTy8i35qtnsZVt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Jeremy Shipley", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a Popper fan and I still think that falsificationism is onto something. That said, this video grossly overstates the extent to which Popper&#39;s views have won consensus in the philosophy of science. In fact, it&#39;s widely held that it is generally not possible to decisively test an isolated hypothesis because so many auxiliary hypothesis about the experiment design and conditions are also on the line. Moreover, many philosophers these days are more optimistic about induction than Popper was, following Carnap in thinking that the mathematical science of probability can be applied in the philosophy of science to develop a logic of induction. Still other philosophers, following Thomas Kuhn and often citing the aforementioned problem of auxiliary hypotheses, argue that all confirmation and falsification are relative to a &quot;paradigm&quot;, the acceptance or rejection of which cannot be assessed by logical standards alone or even, according to some radical positions, any rational standard at all.

The article brings up a clear point, can you scientifically prove something so obviously real as consciousness? &quot;Despite the optimistic claims of some (e.g., emergent materialists), continuing struggles with this topic show little evidence of any imminent resolution.&quot; Thousands of years, &amp; we are not really closer to cracking the case. Can we even use his methods to inform our conclusions on such things? I guess as far as to know things like, what an unconscious person is, sure. That is not a definition of what it is to be conscious really, as that is like saying your awake, but then there are things like sleep paralysis. Your conscious &amp; trapped in a dream, kinda, but your awake, sorta. Or what about meditation &amp; altered states due to trances. How about if we were to simulate an entire consciousness on a machine? Do we understand it then? Or just understand our simulation of what we approximate it to be?<br><br>All this to say, I watched this video &amp; it sent me searching. What can I prove? What can I safely apprehend? Lastly, what is beyond apprehension? Most things, I have found fit into the first two questions neatly.

Why am I not surprised?\u201d<br>\u201cBut you are part of the bargain for a lot of this,\u201d said Trurl. \u2018Remember all of those joint projects?\u201d<br> \u201cOh, the ones that you initiated, completed improperly, consulted with me infrequently, and paid me not at all? Yes, I remember.\u201d<br>\u201cWell, at least you have the satisfaction of being held equally accountable.\u201d<br>\u201cI should thank you for that? You stupid bot head! You\u2019ve ignored the countless summons, warrants, invoices, judgements, verdicts, penalties, and fines, and now they are coming after you in a flash. You\u2019ve got it coming!\u201d<br>\u201cWell, you\u2019re in the mix too,\u201d said Trurl. \u201cHurry, we can just make it to my space cruiser before they smash through the door.\u201d<br>The angry bots soon broke the door down, and stormed in only to witness Trurl\u2019s ship disappear into the void in a trail of smoke.<br>\u201cNow where do we go?\u201d asked Klapaucius. \u201cThey will be hot on our metal heels no matter which direction we turn. The background radiation of your reputation spans the universe.\u201d<br>Trurl responded calmly. \u201cWe will go to the single place where my reputation is unsullied, where my accomplishment is perfect yet unsung. To wit Klapaucius, we will visit my true failures.\u201d<br>\u201cOh fine!\u201d said Klapaucius. \u201cFrom the nuclear furnace to the fire!\u201d<br>\u201cIt is a world of the highest possible level of development,\u201d said Trurl. \u201cI should know, after all I got them there. And I guarantee you they won\u2019t raise their voices against me, given my warranty! But you\u2019ll see.\u201d<br>\u201cThere, first planet on the left. You can\u2019t miss it.\u201d<br>The planet was the only one in solar system, and was etched with continental wide yellow letters, HPLD.<br>\u201cIt\u2019s short for the Highest Possible Level of Development,\u201d said Trurl. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not a billboard, but a warning.\u201d<br>\u201cWarning or not,\u201d said Klapaucius.  \u201cI have never heard of such a place.\u201d<br>\u201cAs well you should! It is quite an embarrassment to me.\u201d<br>\u201cBut the title?\u201d<br>\u201cCorrect in every way. The place is a palace of perfection, the highest level of my genius that is, full of satisfied customers, having no wants because long ago I satisfied them, with perfect inventions and a perfect guarantee.\u201d<br>\u201cThen they should embrace you with open arms.\u201d<br>\u201cNeedless to say, they are needless and won\u2019t say, as you will see.\u201d<br>The ship landed in the middle of a botropolis, a dark landscape scattered about with perfect geometrical forms, like a child\u2019s blocks laid askew. And amongst them and betwixt them were myriad bots, all laying down in silence.<br>\u201cThe bots, they are all frozen in place. Are they deactivated?\u201d<br>\u201cHardly,\u201d said Trurl. \u201cThey are in sleep mode, and can be booted up in an instant. But you know programs, you fire them up when you need them, or in their case when they need to, yet here they have hardly a reason or a care. Let me show you.\u201d<br>Trurl reached down and pulled out the fuse of a somnambulant bot. Its circuits immediately lit up, and it stood up and looked at the constructors, appearing somewhat aggrieved.<br>\u201cYou have disturbed my sleep and dreams of a most pleasant upgrade! Could you reset my fuse if you please?\u201d<br>\u201cOf course,\u201d said Trurl, as he popped in the fuse, and the bot immediately powered down.<br>\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Klapaucius. \u201cYou said they were your most satisfied customers.\u201d<br>\u201cAnd indeed they are. As an up and coming constructor, they provided me with a list of wants, which through my invention I quickly satisfied. I fixed them permanently, and they are without a care, and have become mere perpetual mobiles, self-sufficient, independent, un-reliant, and eventually numbed down into nothingness. At that time, I made sure that even their universe was a perfect clockwork, a steady state, and no one wanted to run me off because nothing ever ran down. But that I found was a trap. You see, perfection can only be wrought once, and once founded requires no consciousness for its stay, and as Shakensphere foretold, their little lives became the stuff that dreams are made on, and are rounded with a sleep.\u201d<br>\u201cSo you want doubtful explanations instead to rouse them from their slumber?\u201d<br>\u201cYes, that is the key. It is the perfect way to keep mechanics employed, but the philosophy comes from another! The great bot philosopher Crawl Popler, the patron saint of the limited warranty, had an eye to employment. To him truths can\u2019t be truths unless they can be falsified, so they are best rendered when they are unreliable. Following this basic principle of construction, my inventions and their explanations are fail safe because they fail! I make sure they are faulty in some way large or small, and when they don\u2019t work, I\u2019ll replace them with another machine and larger promises, for a fee. The other bots complain, but that\u2019s their animating principle you see, for without a level of dissatisfaction, they would dissemble into somnambulance. The impossible project is perfection itself. It would be our doom. It is a pitiless thing, and once delivered it delivers our universe into a timeless stasis. Our needs instantly met, perfectly sized, reliably delivered, and with no fault lines to disturb and demarcate a now timeless equilibrium, what is there to do but to sit there and wait for your protons to decay? And so is the fate of the bots on HPLD. They are simply waiting it out, impervious to a fault, and you can\u2019t fault them therefore for just taking a nap. Why do you think that most of the universe is null and void? Perfection, that\u2019s the rub! No need for consciousness even, for awareness exists because of problems, it is a mere artifact of a faulty warranty! At least I give reason to being conscious for our small gathering of bots and our small piece of the universe. We can only survive in this isolated patch of imperfection, perfecting ourselves in due course, and when we do, we run forever and into the ground.\u201d <br>\u201cAnd so what will you say to assuage those bots who have run you off?\u201d<br>\u201cSimple, here I have time to come up with a new invention with a somewhat flawed explanation, backed by a new and better warranty of uncertain issue.\u201d<br>\u201cThat should bring up many questions and doubts,\u201d said Klapaucius.<br>Trurl smiled. \u201cTo that end I am counting!\u201d<br><br>From the Cyberiad2<br><a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/317370297/Cyberiad-Squared-Fables-for-the-Information-Age\">https://www.scribd.com/document/317370297/Cyberiad-Squared-Fables-for-the-Information-Age</a>", "comment_date": "2016-07-09T17:50:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "Ugi-Qvry9TRV-ngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jo\u00e3o Vitor Barros", "comment_text": "vai come\u00e7ar a treta haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa", "comment_date": "2016-07-08T00:14:43Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "UgiBlGT2WxEc0XgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Laura Laurent", "comment_text": "He said that &quot;the birth of psychology&quot; happened with Freud and psychoanalysis.

Darwinian  evolution has been critiqued for the<br>last 40 years as being a pseudo-science for it lack of<br>falsify-ability, and the fields lack of accepting the rigors of the<br>hard sciences. So my premise is, if something is mathematically<br>impossible, we should assume it didn&#39;t happen. The number for<br>impossible I was taught was, if less than 1 chance in 10 to 24th.<br>Power it is impossible, this is how we say it is impossible for a<br>tornado to go through a junkyard and build a working 747. Is this a<br>reasonable premise? If so let&#39;s proceed the simplest stand alone life<br>[does not need a host to reproduce] is candidatus carsenella bacteria<br>, it&#39;s genome is 159,662 asymmetrical amino acids long, it is tied<br>together with a similar number  right handed nuclear-tides. Since we <br>find even numbers of symmetrical and asymmetrical amino acids in<br>inorganic matter, and amino acids form left handed nuclear-tides as<br>easy as right. The statistical probability to have this  genome<br>develop by random chance is 1 in 10 to the 54th. And it<br>only gets worse from there. Pasteur proved spontaneous generation is<br>scientifically impossible, yet this is what a Darwinist  believes<br>started life. The second law of thermodynamics shows that matter<br>tends towards decay, this hold true wherever we look except <br>Darwinism which pro-ports that matter organizes itself.

Most old papers in both of these fields are still useful, as a result of their rigor, and many basic models used in both of these fields are still used. Even experimentation is used in both fields. It makes as much sense to divide science on this line based on how much humans are involved as it does to divide it based on scale, as much illogic as to say that astronomy can&#39;t be a science because it is so big while chemistry and quantum physics obviously would count under this equally absurd notion. The real difference is in whether the science can 1. make accurate predictions for the future and 2. once ideas are established they generally stick for the long run. This tells us whether the methods used by professionals are valid and whether they should be listened to. Using this method we find that economics, astronomy, political science, biology, sociology, and chemistry (among many others) are without a doubt sciences because the ideas established by these fields usually stick for the long run.

It annoys me when people claim &quot;Science says_______&quot; without implying that Popperian Epistemological notion about the Scientific Method.  Science is really all about proving things wrong, showing how something does not work.  We infer what does not work, and get rid of all that does not meet up with experimental results, through the theory being falsifiable in the first place.  In that way no theory can ever really be correct, because a better one can come along and replace it if it makes better predictions which more closely match experimental results. <br><br> QED is the most accurate and precise theory humans have ever come up with, and while we infer that it &quot;seems right&quot; because no part of it that makes predictions that have been proven wrong through experiment.  However, scientists are largely agnostic about it, simply because as Popper pointed out; science is really there to prove what is wrong, and we just fill in the blanks in a narrative way when we decide to state what is right.  So while QED works better than anything we have ever come up with, we only say it is right or correct as a shorthand, instead of saying &quot;it has yet to be proven wrong&quot;.  When that is really all we can say about it if we are being consistent and honest.<br><br>I am so happy when Youtube Science channels talk about that, because I honestly don&#39;t think most people seem to know about it.

This was the episode I was most curious about when I first saw that Crash Course philosophy was going to be a thing. It was the one subject I was afraid would be done incorrectly. Well, to my dismay, it was.<br><br>So let&#39;s break this down a little. The video isn&#39;t completely off, but it&#39;s certainly riddled with oversimplification and misunderstandings.<br><br>Popper was primarily concerned with what he called &quot;falsificationism&quot;. This was less of a response to Freud and more to the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle who espoused &quot;verificationism&quot;. An oversimplified explanation of those terms:<br><br>Verificationism - A scientific theory is confirmed by the collection of data that confirms a hypothesis. It&#39;s worth noting here that Albert Einstein was a close associate of the Vienna circle and espoused a philosophy in line with the logical positivists. In the video, he&#39;s portrayed as doing the opposite, but his attempts to verify his predictions fall well within the line of verificationism. It&#39;s also worth noting that it was the logical positivists who were most concerned with labeling fields of study like psychology as pseudo-science.<br><br>Falsificationism - A scientific theory is accepted so long as none of the data disproves the hypothesis. This is specifically what Popper was about. The white swan example was unfortunate in this video, because Popper uses it to cast doubt not only on verificationism, but also on science itself. That is, Popper argued that one would have to be able to observe every swan in the universe at any point in the past, present, or future to verify that all swans are white. This is impossible. The best that we can do is accept the notion that all swans are white until it&#39;s disproved. For Popper, a scientific theory is either disproved or not yet disproved.<br><br>Final Note:<br><br>This video gives Popper a little too much credit throughout. He was certainly a wonderful thinker who advanced (and in some ways established) the philosophy of science, but he was certainly no end point for understanding the scientific method. This is embarrassingly far from the truth. Not long after Popper, Quine and Wittgenstein would show why falsificationism was naive. Later, Kuhn would write the most widely read book in universities (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) that would itself begin a paradigm shift in our understanding of the sciences. Other major thinkers include Lakatos, Feyerabend, Nagel, and even philosophers from other fields like Foucault, Chomsky, and Rorty. Some of this led to the &quot;science wars&quot; of the 90&#39;s which we are still, to some extent, in the fallout of. The idea that Popper brought upon some kind of doctrine to scientific understanding is not only inaccurate, but betrays the very spirit of philosophy itself.<br><br>Anyway, have fun with your god episode.

Rather you have a system of beliefs that are interconnected that color your interpretation of data (there is no neutral observer). You will change tertiary beliefs to protect secondary ones, and secondary ones to protect primary beliefs (eg the explanation of retrograde motion to avoid heliocentricity). Eventually the system becomes too untenable and must be abandoned. Thomas Kuhn labeled this a paradigm shift. Since then you have two primary methods of observational science. Popper&#39;s null hypothesis (one you try to disprove) and independent confirmation/verification.

However, when it came to applying this philosophy onto sociology and whether it should be considered a science was when a whole centuries worth of worms popped out of the can. But, anyway I really enjoy learning through my faith, science and philosophy. They explain the world that I view in such contrasting yet complimentary ways in my opinion. Science really doesn&#39;t bother me because I learnt that all ideologies are tools used by humanity to do whatever we want, plus to have my faith be wavered by science shows how weak the foundations of my faith in Jesus Christ is. Philosophy caters to my curiosity and allows me to form questions about life, the world and meaning which I take up to God and pray for wisdom and humbleness as I seek the answers to these questions. All 3 of these things, the most important to me is my faith, has helped me as a philosopher and a scientist so much. I am able to have a non binary view thanks to my approach and my faith continues to grow as I study YHWH&#39;s creation. I learn about human relationship, personal development and love through my faith. Science allows me to chase knowledge of the world through falsification and objectivity. Philosophy trains my tongue and thoughts in formulating decisive critiques in an arguement as well as analysing the language I use in an arguement; it feeds my never ending curiousity that science does not fulfill whole heartedly. I&#39;m thankful to God that I am able to balance all of these and continue to serve dutifully and spread love and kindness while on my path for the truth.

In other words, while your idea of Santa being a man in a red suit who rides a magical sleigh and breaks into peoples homes might be wrong, that doesn&#39;t mean that the man himself does not or has not existed. This is all partly why questions like these are generally considered unhelpful as far as science is concerned.

You have these fancy sentences appearing throughout the video, however it doesn&#39;t take more than a superficial knowledge of Karl Poppers philosophy in order to understand that YOU WROTE THEM YOURSELF!!! DO YOU EVEN BOTHER TO READ HIS BOOKS OR ARE YOU SATISFIED BY A QUICK READ OF THE WIKIPEDIA PAGE BECAUSE EVEN THAT IS MORE CORRECT THAN YOU. Please try to just look up quotes from him because they are not complicated and they illustrates his points to grate detail.

It is incredible how you can get through an entire video about Karl <br>Popper without even mentioning logical positivism, Hume, the problem of induction, Kant, Rationalism, Empiricism and critical Rationalism, etc. BECAUSE YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO READ ONLY 30 PAGES OF HIS BOOK &quot;The two fundamental problems of science&quot; IN ORDER TO FIND HIMSELF DESCRIBING IN DETAIL THESE NOTIONS (which by the way forms the formalistic basis for his entire philosophy). Furthermore his mission statement is about solving the two problems of science (in his words) which are the problem of demarcation and the problem of induction. And you have mentioned none of these problems. SHAME ON YOU. <br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X8Xfl0JdTQ&amp;t=5m38s\">5:38</a> Irrefutability has nothing to do with the ability to test a hypothesis and collect empirical data. It has everything to do with whether that test is at all useful in determining the truth of the hypothesis. This point you explain horribly. You should really have said something like: &quot;If you test something that cannot be falsified the result are either inconclusive or positive. If they are positive you interpret it to mean the hypothesis is correct. If it is inconclusive you try again.&quot; SERIOUSLY; DO YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING ABLE TO TEST SOMETHING AND WHETHER THE TEST IS USEFUL IN ANY WAY IN DETERMINING THE TRUTH???? COME ON!!!!!!????<br><br>AND your example throughout this entire video (santa) is bullshit. The claim has no explicit criterion of falsifiability. And no you do not ever earn the right to call &quot;your&quot; theory scientific. It is not your theory!!! And there is no earning anything. The point is to establish knowledge and not to earn some stamp of approval that you can mark your ideas with. <br><br><br>AND THE WORST PART :-(. Fuck you (I am really angry now, please excuse my language) for claiming this to be the modern philosophy of science. It is a philosophy however it really is in no way how science is done. Except for a few cases within physics and chemistry science does not do axiomatic based work. It is much more induction and data-fitting and eventually we might end up with axioms but not when we first discover new knowledge.  There really is no singular method in science. It is simply about what works. :-(<br><br>AND PSYCHOLOGY IS STILL PSEUDO-SCIENCE BECAUSE IT STILL DOES NOT PRODUCE FALSIFIABLE CLAIMS THAT CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE OR BE MEANINGFULLY TESTED AGAINST EMPIRICAL DATA TO DETERMINE THEIR ACCURACY.", "comment_date": "2016-03-29T02:45:47Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "UghH_msgL25_d3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Duck Goes Quack", "comment_text": "can&#39;t wait to see the flame war in episode 9 :D", "comment_date": "2016-03-29T02:45:01Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "Ugi3gmhQRVLfI3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Dayton Diederich", "comment_text": "Was I the only one that noticed E=mc4 (cubed not squared) in the intro???

S. Lewis was making a statement regarding his grand paradigm (contemporary philosophy might call it his metaphysical narrative).  The real problem here is that the more sophisticated paradigms, even if mutually exclusive, are able to offer, for all perceptible purposes, equally viable support for their conclusions.  Thus the inclination of certain veritologies (the study of truth) to coherence theory or consensus theory.<br><br>Preemptively, this is why science disproving God is not possible.  Just because an idea is not falsifiable does not itself make it untrue, it makes it an idea that the scientific method can not assess.  There are even loads of perfectly falsifiable claims that science cannot assess due to time constraints, costs, access constraints...  But getting back to paradigms, if you are to assess a claim with regards to possibility (not certainty), that is a matter of what you fundamentally consider possible.  For those inclined towards atheism, God seems unlikely while the opposite might be true for a theist: its a matter of metaphysics not physics.  True, many claims of a theist can be assessed, but certain claims are untestable and that does not make it untrue, just untestable.", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T23:21:26Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "Ugim83eRauVi0HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "VinDerp", "comment_text": "Where is Crash Course: Physics?", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T23:21:16Z", "likes_count": 7}}}, {"-X8Xfl0JdTQ": {"Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8": {"channel_id": "UggsM5zXlQBqAXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "frencheneesz", "comment_text": "Its so refreshing to hear philosophy like this put in the context of science and practical application.

Science in the sense of being falsifiable, and knowledge in the sense of justified true belief as stated in the previous video. Then he segues into the idea that the rules of science should also be applied to knowledge as a whole, even for those outside of science. In his closing remarks, he implies that something is only &quot;justified&quot; if it is falsifiable in an act of future-predicting. This blocks off a <b>huge</b> proportion of human knowledge, strangles alternate ways of thinking about ideas, and elevates science as a more legitimate method of pursuing the truth above others.<br><br>I don&#39;t think this is emphasized enough, but there is a lot of knowledge outside of science. It makes no sense to apply the scientific method to, say, history or mathematics because the structure of knowledge within those disciplines don&#39;t allow for the tools of science. But just because we can&#39;t apply the scientific method to these areas don&#39;t necessarily make these less &quot;true&quot;. The scientific method is not intended to make any normative statement on what &quot;truth&quot; is as a whole. It&#39;s designed to only answer the question &quot;is the proposition supported by evidence?&quot;, and only among those propositions that qualify as under the purview of science. You can&#39;t replicate history, so you can&#39;t experiment with the past. And mathematics can only be proven with mathematics so there&#39;s no independent truth-value that can be tested true or false. But intuitively we know that these fields of study there are true things and false things. <br><br>I&#39;m going out of my way to bring this up because a lot of people think that if it&#39;s not science then it&#39;s hogwash. A lot of people only believe science to be truth, and dismiss everything else, such as social science, the humanities, and mathematics and philosophy.
