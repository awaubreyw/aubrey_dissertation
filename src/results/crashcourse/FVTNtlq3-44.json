I had the TI-99/4A and it was my intro into programming too! I totally had the cord running to the tape player too to record my BASIC programs. Car Wars, Hunt the Wampus, Chess, Alpiner, and A-Maze-ing were my intro in to computer gaming. Followed into Atari 2600 with my favorites (not including top ten listers) being Berserker, Demon Wars, Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, River Raid, Star Strike, and Circus Atari. When I turned 9 I finally saved up enough for my parents to match my funds and got an NES. My PS1 was the last console I purchased as I got into PC gaming in 99, not long after getting into P&amp;P RPG&#39;s.<br><br>Can&#39;t wait to see what you have in store for us Andre.
