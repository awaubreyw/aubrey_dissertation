I see this as an adaptation to an environment. The reason most of us don&#39;t condemn the Donna party for cannibalism is because that was necessary for the survival of the group. In this way, ethics is just a part of social norms and conventions to maximize the survival and success of a group of species like a colony of honeybees or ants. Even these organisms have some social rules to guide their behavior that maximizes the survival of the group. But most likely the rules differ depending on the environment and the character of the group much like the social rules of us humans. I speculate that we developed our sense of morality because the harmonious and collaborative group was more successful in its survival.

Like most else that has guided human evolution, or much else that humans do, moral philosophy is a memetic tool for survival. Being &quot;good&quot; isn&#39;t even secondary, but tertiary.<br><br>In any proper moral system, the survival of the practitioners&#39; group always has the highest value. Next comes truth, which has a value that overrides everything other than survival. After that come values such as justice, freedom, etc.<br><br>Justice has a value inferior to truth. That&#39;s because the pursuit of justice depends on knowing truth, or more exactly on the ability accurately to distinguish truth from falsehood.<br><br>And likewise for freedom. Without a means by which the truth can be identified after all its imposters have been found and discarded, you can&#39;t even tell whether you really are free, let alone pursue freedom with any confidence.<br><br>Notice also that the only value higher than truth is survival. Nothing matters to the dead \u2014 not even truth. Only to something alive may anything else be good (or have value). A rock doesn&#39;t care whether you hit it with a hammer. But a mouse does.<br><br>Why the group, and not the individual? Because individuals are ephemeral. We can by no means endure as the ages pass. But the group of practitioners, having a moral system in common, which they heed and advance in the world, can indeed endure. And the most natural group is a race, which is strongest when its members hold a moral system in common; i.e. isn&#39;t factionalized, and therefore cannot be induced to attack itself.<br><br>When the group of practitioners is also a race, it gains the ability to replace its dying members with new members who are born compatible with the culture of their fellows. Because inherited are most of the human qualities that determine which memetic qualities the individual can easily acquire, or can acquire at all. Native members have the requisite temperament and innate attributes for engaging in the group&#39;s culture; they&#39;re organic, not grafted in. They belong without having to adapt, as an outsider would have to adapt though continuous exertion. (And the immigrant will in most cases be unwilling to put forth the required effort.)<br><br>What doesn&#39;t exist is worthless. What can&#39;t exist for long because of self-sabotage isn&#39;t worth much. Proper moral codes, which put the survival of the practitioners&#39; group first in value, are therefore always better than improper moral codes, which give the highest value to anything else. A group that puts the highest moral value on anything other than survival will, sooner or later, encounter circumstances in which their survival is in conflict with whatever that other thing is.

I think it&#39;s very apparent that ethics has nothing to do with anything other than emotion, therefore, what I respond to emotionally one way I would consider good and what I respond another way emotionally too I consider bad.  All people share different emotional reactions, so who cares?<br><br>Imo, people should just isolate themselves with like minded individuals.  We are seeing this more and more in politics in the United States.  I personally hate conservatives so much now to the point that I don&#39;t want to live near them anymore. And the reverse seems true as well, except that we&#39;re confined to a finite space under one flag when we should probably separate ourselves to spare ourselves the fatigue of constant fighting.<br><br>Ethics doesn&#39;t have to be so complicated.  The way I see it we have two options: 1) every person for themselves, strongest wins 2) separate into like minded groups diplomatically.   That&#39;s it.  It seems a part of human nature that we will want to fight other people who hold different views naturally.  It doesn&#39;t seem like there is any reason to withhold this natural desire to fight, so why think about morality excessively?  People will push and pull and the strongest force will ultimately take charge.  Yes, if you are not happy about the stronger force it will seem unethical, if you are happy about it will seem ethical, okay, yeah so Nazi Germany believed in WW2, well, I don&#39;t agree with Nazi Germany, but do you think the Nazi&#39;s would have given a sh*t about me?  No.  They wouldn&#39;t.  I didn&#39;t live there during WW2 so I don&#39;t give a sh*t about them either.  <br><br>In this way humans might really benefit from becoming an interplanetary species by putting more distance between those who hate each other, and more space for those who share like minded beliefs. Because ultimately, as multi-cellular organisms we just empirically have desires to be violent sometimes.  It would seem to be a scientific fact, and to try to overthrow this fact with law and ethics seems to be a futile effort.  Evidence for this can be seen in the different political ideologies throughout the world, the presence of borders and different nations, and the presence of militaries.  If what I said were false, we wouldn&#39;t have any need for military or borders, but we do.

So, to take an example from Michael Huemer: killing cats is prima facie wrong. So, an action being an instance of cat-killing counts against that action. However, if the cat has a deadly disease that can only be gotten rid of by burning it, that can override the wrongness and make it okay to kill the cat, although the action is still wrong to some extent, insofar as it is an instance of cat-killing. Also, disagreement isn&#39;t a good argument against moral realism. Consider science. Yeah, right now there are a lot of issues where there is consensus in the scientific community. However, there are also many issues where there&#39;s hot disagreement, and if we look to the past, almost every scientific issue was hotly debated at one point pr another. So it seems like a domain&#39;s being objective doesn&#39;t preclude there being disagreement in that domain, and I don&#39;t see why morality should be any exception. There doesn&#39;t even have to be a way to know what the truth is; to steal another example from Huemer, consider the case of the JFK assassination. Nobody knows, or even could know, what happened that day, but nobody disputes that there is some fact of the matter about what did happen.

Right now, I suspect my personal view on ethics would be seen as a (possibly lazy) side-stepping of the problems with utilitarian ethics if I tried presenting it to academics.  I think the greatest society is the one that creates the greatest chance of happiness among its specific subset of people, by removing as many obstacles to their personal path as is practical.  That method is particularly important because I disagree with the concept of measuring people&#39;s happiness as &quot;pain&quot; and &quot;pleasure&quot;.  I think the measurement for ethical utility should remain a vague and mushy grey-ness because even trying to average out the extreme differences people within the same sub-culture can have would make no one happy.  I agree partially with the idea that there&#39;s morals that can be considered &quot;objective,&quot; but only in the sense that they&#39;re more practical to a herd of living beings (ie.  murder is wrong because it takes away members of the herd that could&#39;ve been useful further down the line, causes lower productivity and fulfillment for the loved ones of the victim, and lowers trust among the herd due to the increased normality of inter-herd killing).  However, I think there&#39;s a very harsh limit on how much wisdom can be gained from strictly objective morality, with the rest having to be glossed from the situation and the people involved.<br><br>My answer to the burglar question is to charge the burglar to the fullest, and let the jury decide if they want to live in a society that would punish said burglar.  Also, the media should be allowed to report it to their hearts content to let the society as a whole think about the issue too.  I&#39;d probably vote guilty myself, because I wouldn&#39;t trust the burglar to get lucky again.<br><br>Oh, and on the off-chance that someone reads this massive wall of text and wants to ask the classic trolley question that plagues utilitarianism (save 5 strangers or save a loved one, or some variation thereof), my answer is that whoever&#39;s responsible has already failed/wronged, and morality no longer is relevant at that point.

The distinction between morality and ethics is important, because morality is the meta-ethics of ethics. The rules serve moral intent.

For example, our laws once supported slavery and protected the slave master&#39;s ownership by requiring that runaway slaves be returned to their owners.
