Cartilaginous joints are connected through cartilage and also don\u2019t move very much.

Before watching this video I did not know the difference between Angular and Rotational movement. Now I know that angular is the motion that increases and decreases the angle between two bones across any plane (flexion, extension, hyper-extension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction are all part of it). Also that Rotational is the motion that turns the bone around on its axis. I had never into consideration that the Ball and Socket joints were so fragile, which now seems to make lots of sense.
