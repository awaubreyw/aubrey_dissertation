The definition does at least highlight that it only applies for an INDEPENDENT and RANDOM variable, but she doesn&#39;t touch on this. Even the strawberry example is questionable because the assumption that the weights of the packages as packed by a single distributor are INDEPENDENT of one another and RANDOM is fairly false and somewhat presupposes what the example is getting at -- i.e. whether that distributor had changed how much they fill the boxes. How much they pack is a choice of the distributor that will apply across packages, so the weights aren&#39;t really INDEPENDENT, and as the distributor gets to choose the target weight, the value isn&#39;t really RANDOM either (though one might reasonably expect the error from the target value to be). The analysis in the video seems to ask whether the weight is possibly arrived at by random perturbations, but that&#39;s arguably not the right question if one suspects foul play. The specifics aside, the importance of the values analyzed actually being INDEPENDENT and RANDOM deserves attention. (It may be this is addressed in a later video?)<br><br>Overall, the video makes the Normal Distribution sound a little too powerful and easy to lean on. Nate Silver at 538 talks about this a lot and how often this sort of mistake leads to dicey analysis and bad statistics.
