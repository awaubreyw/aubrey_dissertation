It&#39;s inviting, informative and just really fun to watch. However, this episode was my least favorite. It just seems like there are too many gaps in the information on African Theater, not only in this video, but in general. My belief is, just as with China, Japan and India (Which i really enjoyed by the way) the information must be shared in such a way that each unique African art form is voiced so as to engage the viewers and help them gain a greater understanding and deeper appreciation.  With all that said, i could see the pain in your eyes Mike when you were giving the summary and as we all understand colonialism sucks. KEEP CRASH COURSE ALIVE!
