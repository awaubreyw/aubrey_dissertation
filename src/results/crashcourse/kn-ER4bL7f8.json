My belief is, just as with China, Japan and India (Which i really enjoyed by the way) the information must be shared in such a way that each unique African art form is voiced so as to engage the viewers and help them gain a greater understanding and deeper appreciation.  With all that said, i could see the pain in your eyes Mike when you were giving the summary and as we all understand colonialism sucks. KEEP CRASH COURSE ALIVE!
