What should replace it? In the case of power plants it should be nuclear fission including fast breeders and other developing technologies, like the Travelling Wave Reactor, TWR for short. There are already huge stockpiles of U-238, aka depleted uranium, more than 1 million tons worldwide. This is a\u00a0ready to use abundant source. Just the US and Russia have 80% of the worlds reserves, distributed roughly equally. The TWR is just one design of many that could make use of this material. Mass scale deployment of the TWR\u00a0could produce 80% of the world&#39;s population energy needs, at the energy usage typical for the average USA human, for over a millenium, and that by using only already stockpiled U-238. The other 20% should be renewables.\u00a0We have the material to power the planet CO2 free for hundreds of years readily available. Plus, we could also get rid of the current &quot;nuclear waste&quot; in that process, as the TWR can make use of what we currently consider nuclear waste as a power source. The internal combustion engine could be replaced depending on application either by batteries, hydrogen or ethanol (wihtout any fossil oil components). Note: I have 79% of electricity from nuclear fission. I wish it would come from some more modern reactor types than second generation PWRs (type VVER-440/213). They work, OK, but they should be replaced by inherently safe and much more efficient nuclear fission power sources. We keep using prehistoric fission technology mainly because it was just a spin-off from military interests. Pure civillian applications for power generation purposes should be funded on a comparable scale to what the military invested in making nuclear fission and fusion weapons.", "comment_date": "2019-01-12T19:19:44Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"v6uRuNboy4A": {"The Future of Clean Energy: Crash Course Engineering #31": {"channel_id": "Ugx5jRTZYHvhYJc4AXt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Joe Lima", "comment_text": "Out of date on your nuclear information.

For example take an ice cube from the freezer and heat it for 15 seconds with a hair dryer. When you take away the source of the heat, you slow down the melting process, but you can&#39;t stop it. In fact, it is very hard top stop an ice cube from melting outside the freezer. We have the same issue with the earth. Taking away the sources of the climate change, will not stop climate change. For multiple reasons. One of the biggest is that climate change is a natural thing. Earth had multiple ice ages in the past and in between them it did heat up and cooled down again. A second important one is that the change has already started..<br><br>Dealing with climate change is politically more a &#39;do as I say, not as I do&#39; kind of thing. Guess how all those European state heads when to the climate summit last november in Paris. Almost all of them came by plane. Electric cars are the future? It might be, but why are governments still buying gasoline powered cars in bulk? Why do civilians have to pay the price and are heavy energy using industries left alone? Why are aircraft carriers nuclear powered, but cruise ships still use tons of diesel? Why o we still allow flight less than 500nm? Those distances can easily be traveled by car, bus or train.This week I watched the Eugenics episode from the science course. Eugenics are considered a bad thing. But there are already 7 billion people on this earth. We don&#39;t have enough agricultural land to feed all those people. Do you know what the CO2 impact of a single person has? There are a lot of areas in this world where living standards are very poor. Is it wise to let these populations continue to grow? China has the one child policy, maybe this should be become the norm for the rest of the world? We send a lot of help, money and resources to Africa, but did that solve anything? Also if everybody would survive in Africa, the continent can&#39;t support all those people. Is it wise to waste land on massive solarparks when it can also be used for agriculture purposes. China even managed to land on the backside of the moon. Nobody ever goes the moon, we busy reaching mars. So why not store the nuclear waste on the moon? <br><br>So far, the only action politics make is charging people on all kind of environment/energy taxes without having a long term plan how to reach the goals.
