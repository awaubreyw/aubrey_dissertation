Basically, the reason my professor did this was to point out the difference between taking a line of genetic code from a bacterial equivalent which had the properties wanted for the plant, i.e., to genetically engineer it, and Genetically Modifying it. Because accordingly and dependent on our definition and inclusivity of Modify, we can include the entire history of agriculture under the heading of GMOs. This is to say, that simply choosing where to plant the plant counts under this modification. This is further to say that Genetic Engineer is merely a subsection of Genetically Modifying and not it in its entirety, and that other things like pollination, irrigation, and pest control counts as Genetically Modifying the Organism which does not involved the technological aspect of DNA splicing. <br><br><br>The reason I mention this is because it seems disingenuous otherwise, that is, if this is the history of science, then you miss the historical agriculture that is the section underneath of which genetic engineering is merely a subsection. In another way, there is this craze for Organically grown food, but that would merely mean to grow it without the genetic engineering or the use of pesticides which would mean that whoever is planting the crops would be choosing where to plant the food and providing other nutrients to the food, or if we consider artificial to mean an arrangement by human hands, then the food that we grow is still done in an artificial manner.", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T23:58:15Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Bob_The_Avenger", "comment_text": "That table must have 1 leg since it wobble so much.", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T23:54:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mick Mickymick", "comment_text": "Some serious horseshit there regarding GMOs, Hank doesn&#39;t go into the science at all, or the controversies or the two sides, he just heavily implies that evil corporations are someone acting badly and making money in an unethical way, without actually mentioning anything wrong they&#39;ve done, I&#39;m guessing the science didn&#39;t agree with his ideology on the matter.", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T23:31:51Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "thinkppl", "comment_text": "HELA cells are part of the oppression of blacks by white supremacy and reminiscent of slavery? <br>I didn&#39;t realize that CC got so woke.", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T22:59:50Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "Pietro Gagliardi", "comment_text": "Glad to see we&#39;re STILL wallowing in the deeply unethical/unjust.
