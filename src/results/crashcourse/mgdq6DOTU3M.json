I hope you people don&#39;t think these videos are anything but stories and fairytales, because they aren&#39;t. From the stories we&#39;ve been told about heliocentric theory, we can easily disprove it. Old Phil did a wonderful job in a previous video explaining moon phases. Even though it&#39;s completely obvious and observable by everyone on Earth, nice job. Let&#39;s examine how heliocentric theory explains (or rather can&#39;t explain) the moon&#39;s phases. Helio theory says the Earth orbits the sun at 67,000 MPH. It says the moon orbits the Earth at 2,288 MPH, giving the moon an actual speed of 69,288 MPH. As the moon orbits the Earth its direction of travel changes relative to that of the Earth&#39;s orbit around the sun. This means while the moon may indeed have a relative speed of 2,288 MPH while traveling the same direction as the Earth, relative motion states that changes exponentially during the course of its orbit. Consistent with relative motion theory, when the moon travels perpendicular to the Earth&#39;s orbit, observers on Earth would no longer see a relative speed of\u00a02,288 MPH, but the actual speed of the moon 69,288 MPH. But wait, there&#39;s more. When the moon and Earth orbits are in opposite directions, the relative speed is moon (69,288 MPH) + Earth (67,000 MPH) = 136,288 MPH! Almost 60x FASTER than when the moon is on the other side of the Earth traveling in the same direction as Earth. This means the new moon phase and phases immediately preceding and following it would all be over in half a day if the moon orbits the Earth in a month! LOL. That doesn&#39;t happen. As Phil indicates in his other video, all the moon phases are present for an equal amount of time.\u00a0Gee Phil, how is this possible if heliocentrism is correct?

I do agree with you on your conclusions: there is probably plenty of life out there, simple life, due to the fact that the conditions required for life to emerge aren\u2019t that hard to find as we thought. There is probably intelligent life somewhere out there. However, as you said, I doubt there have been any green aliens with antennas on their heads on Earth.

Hope we get more down the road.<br><br>On the SETI listening to radio waves; something I thought of a while back is it&#39;s ENTIRELY likely that if other races had discovered radio and had been using it, the signals may have been skewed long long ago.<br><br>Think about it; what&#39;s one of the biggest ways to mess with radio waves: magnets. Per the magnetar episode, one quake on a magnetar was strong enough to disable all the man made satellites in orbit back in the 80s. Something THAT powerful could have easily obliterated any radio waves we could have detected. <br><br>I feel like this is the big X factor missing when evaluating why we haven&#39;t heard aliens. <br><br>Heck, at this point, we have enough ideas to fathom that there are better communication methods out there. Quantum Intangible, for instance, is being heavily researched as a method to have much, much, much greater range on our telephony communication.

Thanks so much for your knowledge, curiosity and enthusiasm in tackling this course. It was a bit to get into at first, but this is by far the most unbiased and interesting CC yet. Pure science and information through and through. You never pushed your personal beliefs and ideology on anyone; that is highly unusual in the CC library and truly a testament to your character. Thanks for making it that way.<br><br>My one question to you is this:<br><br>Why are we as humans (especially we humans in a post-modern, scientific and liberal culture) comfortable with, or at least curious about, the idea of NATURE but not the idea of a deity?<br><br>When I say NATURE I refer to the idea, that even you have alluded to, where the cosmos are an impersonal, all powerful force that rules our every moment and entire lives with physical laws that we are only now just beginning to understand we have know so little about. We say things like &quot;Nature is much smarter than us&quot;. We personify the cosmos and give them a place of ruling over us. We even begin to worship them, submitting to them out of reverence and awe. <br><br>Why are we comfortable with this concept but not the idea of a personified and knowable deity that we can actually interact with? How can we have we thrown the god(s) out with the power of science, only to end this series off with the final few paragraphs you did?<br><br>I&#39;m just a bit puzzled is all. It&#39;s like we think we are so much better than our forefathers for believing in and worshiping a higher power (how silly is that right?), but yet here we find ourselves realizing that our true place in the universe is to be ruled by it. We realize that the universe is the ultimate authority in our existence and worthy of our pursuit, knowledge and resources, though we know for certain that we will never fully understand all of it. How is this any different than the most basic tenants of most major religions? <br><br>What are your personal thoughts on this?", "comment_date": "2016-01-22T02:05:36Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"mgdq6DOTU3M": {"Everything, The Universe...And Life: Crash Course Astronomy #46": {"channel_id": "UgiimP_bBF8u7XgCoAEC", "comment_by": "John Wick", "comment_text": "But.. but what if we are the first aliens having access to communication?

They wouldn&#39;t do it for knowledge, and they wouldn&#39;t do it for seeing how rare life is. They would already know how rare it is via unimaginable powerful universal simulations, so what&#39;s the need? And that&#39;s just if they do exist! Which I don&#39;t think they do, simple life yes, civilisations no, or at very most sprinkled between billions of light years.

That sounds like a curious concept, but wouldn&#39;t speed be an issue? Neutrinos travel slower than light. Even across distances within our own solar system, light speed quickly becomes the limiting factor and I imagine that if advanced alien civilizations exist, they might want communication to be as swift as possible, especially during space missions.
