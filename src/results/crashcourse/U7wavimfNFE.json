Therefore it is a trans molecule. However IUPAC suggest a more advanced way of naming it which is E-Z system. If you are using E-Z system you can just compare the atomic number (if atomic number are the same then compare the mass number)  i.e. I&gt;Br&gt;Cl&gt;S&gt;P&gt;F&gt;O&gt;N&gt;C&gt;T&gt;D&gt;H etc. If the first atoms directly attached to the double bond carbon are the same then compare the atom that has greatest atomic number attached to it and so on and so forth. So in this case the groups with higher priority attached to both end of double bond carbons are on the same side.
