I dont fully get it. It has the Calcium atom become positively charged because the acid reaction from the hydrogen donating its positively charged hydrogen atoms to the Carbonate results in the positive ionization charges to be moved into the Calcium atom as a result of the reaction. Causing the calcium to be separated and replaced by Hydrogen that then further dissolves into CO2 right? Hence why it says CO30.

I keep getting 6E7 tons. Everyone else is getting somewhere around 9E11 or something like that. Do you guys mind helping me? I started off with 30Kg of sulfur/ton of coal. Since there are 1E9 tons of coal burnt/year, I just multiplied those. Here&#39;s what I got: (1E9 tons/year)<b>(30kg/ton)=3E10 kg of sulfur/year. Afterward, I multiplied 3E10 kg of sulfur/year by 1000g/kg and I multiplied the result again by 1 mole of sulfur/32 g of sulfur to get the amount of moles of sulfur produced per year. It looked like this: (3E10 kg/year)</b>(1000g/kg)*(1 mole/32 g)=9E11 moles of sulfur/year. Since there is one significant figure, I there is only one digit. Anyway, there are 9E11 moles of sulfur; therefore there must be 9E11 moles of O2 with that sulfur, so there are 9E11 moles SO2, and so, there should be 9E11 moles of CaCO3, because n(sulfur dioxide)=n(limestone). Next, I multiplied 9E11moles/year by 68.01 g/mole of CaCO3 and again by 1 Kg/1000g and 1 ton/1000 kg. It looked like this:<br>(9E11 moles/year)<b>(68.01 g/mole)</b>(1kg/1000g)*(1 ton/1000 kg)=6E7 tons/year. Therefore, I said that 6E8 tons of limestone would be needed every year to balance out the SO2 produced. Everyone else is getting something different though.
