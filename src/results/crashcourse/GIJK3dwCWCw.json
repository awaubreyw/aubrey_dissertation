They are also very important in performing Chemotaxis  and have a vital role in activating and &quot;recruiting&quot; other neutrphils and white blood cells to the area of infection. In addition, the argument that once they performed phagocytosis they die is simply misleading. The facts of the matter is  The ability of microbes to alter the fate of neutrophils is highly varied, can be microbe-specific, and ranges from prolonging the neutrophil lifespan to causing rapid neutrophil lysis after phagocytosis. In Wikipedia there is a video depicting a Neutrophil perform phagocytosis on several Condida bacteria (I counted around 10) over a period of 2 hours. They usually live 1 - 2 days in the tissues.

Always ask yourself, does it seem reasonable this was designed by random point mutations?   Isn&#39;t it obvious random single letter point mutations could never produce such sublime, ingenious, complex cooperative functions?  Natural Selection is far too crude since it only involves surviving to reproduce.  A sledgehammer rather than a micro-scalpel.<br><br>  How can one see such amazing designs and think they just happened by themselves?  Ridiculous.  This is why huge amounts of time are championed, to obscure that such innovations happening by themselves is impossible and absurd.  Some may mock because they hate the necessity of a Creator; it&#39;s anathema to them.  The body&#39;s fabulously intricate and clever systems are themselves absolute proof of an intelligent and capable designer.  Isn&#39;t it ungrateful to ascribe such wonderful systems as our immune system (or any of our other 44 systems examined in this A &amp; P series) to blind chance and dumb luck?<br><br>  Science is not in conflict with an intelligent designer.  It demonstrates the necessity of such.  Design requires a Designer.  Knowing how something works does not invalidate needing someone to originate it.  Say you saw an advanced race car and learned how it&#39;s mechanical, electrical, exhaust and computer systems function intricately together.  Would you say, &quot;Now that I understand how this works, everything is completely explainable and no designer was required for this car.&quot;  Or would you say, &quot;Wow, that person really did a great job to design and integrate everything so well!  I want to meet them.<br><br> The more I learn what has been arranged and how, the more I appreciate Jehovah God our Creator.  Don&#39;t be an ingrate.
