This video helped me. <br>Look at what I have so far.<br>Educational quality based on gender and socioeconomic status is an issue today because it can involve quality of life qualities as well as the opportunities and privileges afforded to people within society. The World is filled with people with all kinds of socioeconomic backgrounds. A person\u2019s socioeconomic status is determined by their work experience and by their work experience and their individual or family\u2019s economic position which is based on income education and occupation. A child in a low socioeconomic status household is exposed to low-quality child care, poor and distressed schools and economically depressed neighborhoods. There are many factors that can influence a child\u2019s academic success or failure. Those that come from a low socio-economic background have even more challenges to face. Students who came from a low SES are not as academically successful as those who come from higher status. These are major issues faced everywhere in the world and in every school district and will continue to be a problem. To fix these problems I suggest that it is our responsibility to ensure that every student receives an equal education no matter their background and home life.", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T11:11:53Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sanket Singh", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8PEv5SV4sU&amp;t=0m35s\">0:35</a>.
