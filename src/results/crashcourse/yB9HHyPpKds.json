It&#39;s scary to see a man get soo excited about panspermia. Especially one that looks as metroseximals as you! Okay okay... I am just jealous of your sweet dark jean jacket!... You can&#39;t even get mad at me for that joke, cause it would paint you as anti-gay! sooo! let&#39;s get down to business.<br><br><br>Has a computer ever accidentally made mario 1 yet? <br><br>No?<br>Well it&#39;s vastly many magnitudes easier to get by random chance then just 1 working protein machine that somehow knows what to do and when to do it, inside the cell.<br><br><br>Every single part of chemistry is showing no avenue for accidental or self assemblage of life, and we put decades into this problem now, with countless scientists and ever more powerful apparatuses+computers. It doesn&#39;t matter where you punt the problem to, it still wouldn&#39;t make it easier to start life from chemicals. Your fake god panspermia is just bad science. The more we learn about the world of the small the more obvious this is all clearly designed by someone outside the laws of nature.<br><br><br>I sorta used to be a Christian who believes in evolution but the evidence just isn&#39;t there for it. Why are all the bones refined? Why are all the triceratops fossils of the same level of refinement? Where is all the mistakes of evolution that should dominate fossil finds? Darwin said if you don&#39;t find the fossils my theory is bust, yet you people must have skipped over that part... Are you swayed by that pathetic list of transitional fossils on wiki? We find millions of normal fossils but the failures or transitional phases of fossils is only in the thousands? Shouldn&#39;t it be the other way around if intelligent design is fake news? Even with that said, those soo called transitional fossils are pretty lousy evidence at best, often soo full of fake science news claims and even scandal. I was taught in high school LUCY was the smoking proof... the missing link... even though by then it was already known that guy who &quot;discovered&quot; lucy admitted on his death bed it was a fraud and how he did it. The evolution world is full of scams, look into neanderthal skulls scandal!<br><br><br>Nothing if astronomy is working out either for you naturalist origin folks. We constantly hear those atheist scientists saying &quot;surprised&quot; &quot;unexpected&quot; while we creationists are saying &quot;exactly&quot; &quot;expected&quot; with so many findings these days.<br><br><br>The answer for how hydrogen, which is strongly repellent in a vacuum,  could eventually come together to make stars is quite problematic. The incredibly unlikely scenarios that are needed to make stars in such a situation sounds like magic instead of science. We keep finding planets that shouldn&#39;t exist, or in places where they shouldn&#39;t be. And then all the galaxies that are supposed to be young keep looking old and ordered. I honestly wonder how you will all spin it when the james webb telescope is yet another huge win for us creationists, just like your large hadron collider was. <br><br><br>I keep an open mind but the burdon of proof imo is strongly on you Jesus deniers. We have his tomb, we have the records from many sources, more then we have for most emperors, we keep finding the cities you doubt ever existed that the bible talks about. They also appear destroyed how the bible claims... We have computers confirming the story of the star of Bethlehem and the blood moon as Jesus died on the cross, while the constellation of the ram\\lamb shown brightly behind the sun at that time. On and on and on it goes, it would do nothing if we found Noah&#39;s ark, you would all still not believe, no amount of evidence will change that, not even God being before you doing miracles. And if you come to him that way, what happens when you sin again (and you will)? There is strong psychological reasons for him not to intervene more! The price tag for free will is vast and profound but you&#39;d rather just assume he is wrong then to trust him and actually try to give him a chance.<br><br><br><br><br>So put the 20 amino acids needed for life into vials and shake, cook, freeze, shock, whatever to them, and wake me when you create even one tenth of 1 protein machine. We can&#39;t do it, and that is a simple problem compared to what even a simple rna cell would be to accidentally make even 1 time, but 1 out of 1 quintillion trillion billion million times it would be a faulty version of that, so you need to accidentally keep making it over and over and over and over... it needs to be easy to do to even remotely have a chance.... it isn&#39;t. Think about it!<br><br><br>And yes the earth is round... Yes a lot of idiot Christians believe in flat earth theory, and yes most Christians are dumber then dirt, but so are most atheists. And the president of the flat earth society is also pro-evolution so think carefully before responding with the usual insults and gotchya&#39;s.<br><br><br><br>BTW- I watch these crashcourse videos to help me sleep. It&#39;s weird I know, but whatever. Have a nice day.<br><br><br><br>Lol after writing all this I realized this video is already 3 and a half years old!
