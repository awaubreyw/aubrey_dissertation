Most people played text based games on printers that had no graphics or monitors whatsoever, but were a lot of fun. So fun were they that the computer departments of most schools, colleges, and universities would set limits on the amount of paper that students could use, which were intended for their class studies. <br><br>Students had to become resourceful if they intended to continue their new love of computer gaming, and they began to dumpster-drive likely place where people threw out lots of unused paper. One such popular place was the dumpsters of telephone interchanges. They had computers with large fancy, dot-matrix printers, which often only printed out reports on the left side of 17&quot; long graph paper. By taking these used printouts students could just use the back or right side of the paper for their own computer printouts. <br><br>Some more curious student began reading what the telephone company was printing out on these pages, and, because so many of these students were themselves learning to become computer science engineers, learned how the telephone company used and operated the telephone interchanges. This lead to some students hacking into and phone phreaking the entire telephone network.<br><br>Since the telephone company thought that no one outside the company would ever use the system they setup to their own advantage, there were no security or passwords whatsoever. You couldn&#39;t call what some students did &quot;breaking into they system&quot; because the system didn&#39;t have any doors to keep people out. Most school departments of computer science set up student accounts with password. No such beast existed in the telephone company. There was no login. You were always <i>in</i>. And they helpfully supplied the telephone book of operations and codes for anyone in the system to printout and learn how to use and abuse it.", "comment_date": "2016-04-16T17:23:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R4ndomNMBRS", "comment_text": "Please stop trying so hard to be fun, it&#39;s really annoying.", "comment_date": "2016-04-16T17:13:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Chateau", "comment_text": "Lack of research is painfully obvious in this episode.
