These are all great tips, and I think I&#39;m going to start implementing some of the Cornell method into my notes.<br><br>I do think, at least for me, that the number one factor for taking good notes has been reading prior to class. I&#39;ve tried a few different ways, and found I either write too much or too little, and when I review my notes I don&#39;t really have a strong recollection of what I write anyway. It&#39;s like so much energy goes into simply taking the notes. But reading beforehand (seeing slides, or even scanning the headings to be covered in lecture) gives me the opportunity to see the overarching ideas and connect them, it also allows me to know what material is expanded on in text or slides and what is new material presented by the teacher (which often is tested later). One challenge is setting aside the time, but I also find I&#39;m able to focus more when I preread and I think it saves some cramming stress.<br><br>Another tip I might recommend is the audio recording. In class is a really different environment from the study environment (and there&#39;s some evidence linking retention to specific environments) (plus distractions), and if you are allowed to record I would recommend doing so because it gives you the opportunity to catch things you miss, and to actively listen.

(currently an AP high school student, for reference)<br><br>1. during, class, get the information down as quick as you can and as detailed as you can, but make sure you listen to what your teacher is teaching. do not get distracted by formatting your notes in class- just get the words on the paper. (you could also do this step on a computer- then switch to handwritten notes for the next steps!)<br>2. these &quot;first draft&quot; notes, (i call mine ugly notes, bc well, they&#39;re ugly haha), use these to STUDY. at the end of the day, or a few days before your quiz/test, start REWRITING THEM. <br>3. rewrite all the info using your nice handwriting, bubble letters for titles, little doodles, colour coordination, highlighters, GO ALL OUT. i promise this works, here&#39;s why:<br>4. when you rewrite your notes, it forces you to go over the information you learned in class. you&#39;re rewriting them on your own time, not having to worry about your prof changing slides, so you can take your time to review the information, add details, and organize the info in a a way that works with how it looks on the paper.<br>5. by spending time colour coordinating, adding doodles relevant to the info, and adding fancy organized bullet lists, you&#39;ll remember the way the info looks on your page. (i.e,... remembering the 3 main points your teacher told you about x topic, because a was pink, b was purple, c was blue.)<br><br>honestly, putting aside study time to rewrite my notes was i n c r e d i b l y helpful for me, and i seriously had fun doing it. when your notes are neat, fancy, and detailed (which you likely can&#39;t do while in class during a lecture) it&#39;s easy to organize ideas, connect info, and quiz yourself (or get your friends to quiz you!). physically writing down the info more than once makes it stick in your brain, and it&#39;s way more effective than just reading and rereading. personalize your notes and studying won&#39;t be so dreadful.

A couple of ideas were actually inferred in this video that I&#39;d like to &#39;verbalize&#39;.  Firstly, when testing students, we can break questions into three categories: (1) Wrote memorization, (2) Procedural memorization, (3) Critical thinking.  Note taking should cover the last aspect and avoid the first two.  Why?  Because the first two are easy to find via references (i.e. Textbooks, standards, etc.)   Focusing on &quot;how to use the information&quot; is critical.  While this is extremely important in the sciences, it stays true for history, religion, politics and the like.  <br><br>The second idea is that people learn in different ways.\u00a0 We learn by doing (touching), hearing and seeing.  These ultimately add up to &quot;thinking&quot;.  Each person is unique in the needed amount of these senses for concepts to stick.  Therefore, a note taking style needs to supplement the way that you learn.  For example, I am a visual learner; as long as I can visualize a concept, I can learn it.  However, for it to enter long term storage, I need to do it.  In addition, I can only set critical thinking by &#39;using&#39; this information on a new problem.<br><br>My point to this discourse is to supplement your video by providing additional information.  First, good note taking skills start by understanding the concept as the lecture unfolds.  Only then should you write things down and in a manner that supplements the learning materials.  Secondly, note taking style needs to blend with the topic <b>and</b> the individuals learning style.<br><br>Again, this was a great video that teaches an essential study skill!

(for instance, i took my biology notes in pencil, but used blue and red ink pens for diagrams.)<br>2) paper choice is important too!<br> - using the correct line width (aka wide or college ruled) to fit your handwriting makes note taking much easier. <br> - using lined paper isn&#39;t always the best choice either! if your notes are going to be diagram/drawing heavy, unlined might be better. for a math or science class, i always recommend engineering paper, as it is lined like graph paper, but with lighter lines so that its easier to see what is actually written on the page.<br>3) ALWAYS DATE YOUR NOTES.

Also there is a flow in writing (cursive) that is more akin to a flow of thoughts or the flow of speech than is childish printing or  typing. Not only does cursive lead to increased brain activity, it is associated with long-term information retention (the purpose of notes), better thought organization, and increased ability to generate ideas. In other words, people who can&#39;t write in cursive aren&#39;t as... smart? If I were conducting job interviews and people printed their signature on the application... I wouldn&#39;t hire them.

For courses like Discrete Structures II (a type of probability course for CS students) and Information and Data Managament (a course mainly revolving around databases with various stuff like ER diagrams and relational algebra) it was quite difficult because various symbols and designs are difficult to replicate with plain text. However, I feel that for my business courses, typing was better because I could type a lot of information easily.
