It takes Uranus 84 years to orbit the Sun, so this would lead to some really weird seasons.  Imagine if Uranus had a solid surface (it doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s all gas down to where pressure turns it to liquid) and you could stand on it, what would you see... Well, if you were at the equator during the right time of the year, the Sun would rise and set just like on Earth, more or less, but of course much faster due to the shorter day length of 17 hours and 14 minutes.  The Sun would rise over one horizon and set over the opposite horizon, and the orbiting moons would as well, showing phases like Earth&#39;s Moon.  But, as the (Earth) years passed, the Sun would gradually move farther and farther across the sky toward the North Pole, and as you approached 21 years later, standing on the equator, you&#39;d see the Sun gradually get closer and closer to a spot almost directly over Uranus&#39;s north pole, circling around it.  It would be just above the northern horizon, perhaps rising a tiny bit above the horizon and setting just below it, it would be a perpetual sunrise/sunset.  The rings and moons overhead would be lit up beautifully in the sky, in full light, with no shadow from the planet darkening part of them out.  The moons would circle the planet over the equator, brightly lit in half-full phase, but only the northern half of the moons would be lit.  As the years wore on past 21 years, the Sun would appear to start spiraling AWAY from the spot directly above the north pole, getting farther and farther away from it with each passing year.  Over time the Sun would start rising higher and higher in the sky and setting longer at night, until 21 years later (42 years from the start point) it would again be directly overhead at the equator, and you&#39;d have normal day and nights again, and the moons would show their normal phases like Earth&#39;s Moon.  As time passed, you&#39;d notice the Sun moving southward in the sky, getting lower and lower in the sky with each passing year, until 21 years later (63 years after you started), it would spiraling in a near-hover over the south pole of Uranus, with the equatorial region again in a perpetual sunset-sunrise type of twilight, the rings shining overhead, this time in full illumination from the underside.  The moons would also be stuck in the perpetual half-phase again, only this time the southern hemisphere of the moons would be lit.  As time passed, the Sun would begin to spiral away from the point over the south pole, and get higher and higher in the sky until 21 years later, it would again be directly overhead at the equator again and the 84 year cycle would be complete and start again, moving northward.  If you lived near the north pole of Uranus, you&#39;d see the Sun circling low in the sky, always near the horizon, just above it, and as it moved northward you&#39;d be in perpetual daylight for the next 42 years.  The moons would go through their regular phases, and at first you&#39;d see the rings lit during daytime, but you&#39;d see the Uranus&#39;s shadow cross the rings and hide part of them as you approached sunrise/sunset, on the opposite horizon from the Sun.  As the Sun moved ever northward in the sky, eventually the rings would have a &quot;bite&quot; out of them, as the shadow of the planet was moving almost perpendicular to the rings, then that &quot;bite&quot; of shadow would disappear and you&#39;d see the rings lit by full sunlight from above when the Sun was near the north pole in the sky.  The moons would circle near the horizon, over the years going from normal phases to a varying level of gibbous, ever fattening until when the Sun was directly overhead at the north pole, the moons would be perpetually &quot;full&quot; near the horizon, as their northern halves were in perpetual full sunlight.     The Sun would appear to move upward in the sky above the horizon, circling ever higher in the sky year by year until 21 years after you started, the Sun would be circling directly over a point in the sky directly over the north pole, almost motionless in the sky except a slight wobble or small circle around this point as the planet spun with it&#39;s axis pointed almost directly at the Sun.  Then it would start moving southward again, spiraling away from the north pole zenith point in the sky as the years went by, eventually it&#39;d be back where it was, having slowly circled its way down til it was circling all the way around just over the horizon 42 years after you started, but you better enjoy the fading daylight, because it would start setting over the horizon and rising just above it to set again a few hours later (depending how far away from the north pole you were; if you were directly on the north pole, it&#39;d circle the horizon for awhile like a perpetual sunset moving all the way around the ring of the visible horizon in all directions, until it finally set for good and disappeared over the horizon for the next 42 years, while the south pole and southern hemisphere was in perpetual daylight (well, there&#39;d be a narrowing area around the north pole that would still have some daylight, but this ring would move southward toward the equator with each passing year until 42 years later it would be perpetual sunset/sunrise over the equator as the Sun spiraled around the south pole, of course on the north pole you&#39;d never see it, you&#39;d be 42 years of eternal nighttime.  The rings would appear &quot;normal&quot; again with the planet&#39;s shadow cutting a swath across them as the planet rotated, and the moons would go through their phases, but getting ever dimmer as they went through varying crescent phases, never getting &quot;full&quot; again.  The shadow of the planet would again turn into a &quot;bite&quot; in the rings as the planet&#39;s shadow became perpendicular to the ring plane again, as the sun approached zenith over the south pole.  After 21 years of darkness, the rings would be totally dark, lit only by the ghostly light diffracted from their underside, and the moons would only show the &quot;new moon&quot; phase or perhaps a tiny sliver of crescent at most, never getting gibbous or full.  You&#39;d have another 21 years of night until the sun would FINALLY peek over the horizon again, 42 years after you last saw it.  For a few years you&#39;d see a bright glow of twilight circling all the way around the horizon, as you did after the sun set for the last time, hailing the approach of another 42 year long day on Uranus&#39;s north pole, and 42 years of night for the south pole... <br><br><br>Later!
