So, if you have only 1 e-mail to reply to with one or two sentences, do it now. If you have two of those emails, you&#39;re probably going to take more time, so put it on the checklist.<br><br>2). Everything you have to do, say, ~30 times is worth time and money to automate and systematize. Standard email replies, for example. I bought a \u20ac500 scanner that scans up to 50 receipts in 100 seconds and recognizes cost amounts, dates, vendors and buyers.
