Eating disorders are caused by HISTAMINE.  Serotonin and dopamine weirdness may happen, but histamine is literally the cause of eating disorders.  Histamine makes you not hungry.  It also makes you very self-critical.  It causes obsessiveness (it literally causes OCD as well).  People who are perfectionist, overachievers, &quot;highly sensitive children,&quot; and many autistic people have VERY slightly elevated histamine chronically.  People who have eating disorders have a moderate chronic histamine problem.  Many, many foods trigger the release of a teeny amount of histamine and other inflammatory markers, but in some people, MORE histamine is released in response to every single thing that triggers a histamine release (which is actually a great number of things throughout a day in someone&#39;s life; eating, changes in temp and humidity, sexual arousal, circadian rhythms, etc.)  <br>Antihistamines literally cure eating disorders.  Do NOT take an antihistamine without talking to your doctor first if you are already on any meds as there can be interactions.  But I promise you, histamine causes eating disorders, and antihistamines solve eating disorders.<br>The defining feature of anorexia should not be whether you want to lose weight, whether you think you are fat, etc, but whether you actually succeed in a long-term starvation diet.  The only way that people are able to achieve a long-term starvation diet is when there is a physiological reason why starvation is PREFERABLE to eating.  And a constant overdose of inflammatory markers is the most common reason why starvation is BETTER than eating.  I want so badly to help everyone struggling with eating disorders, because I know it is hell.  But it&#39;s not even a psychological disorder at all; doctors are just willfully ignorant about the effects of histamine as a neurotransmitter!", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T05:12:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ash", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve got Body Dysmorphia Disorder (used to have Binge eating disorder and realized I had a problem when I weighed 240 lbs at 16 years old.

Gym culture that&#39;s about becoming fit/toned/muscular, but it&#39;s an artificial way to be physically active, with a focus on the exercise itself, rather than doing physical work, let&#39;s say, outdoors on a farm and the exercise and fitness coming along as a secondary effect. I&#39;m not even going to say anything about the bodybuilding and steroids side of things.

I refuse to accept it as a concern to be on my mind, I refuse the thin standards society pushes on people (especially women) as ideal, since they are actually not, I trust my own aesthetic sense a lot better. And I refuse to count calories, ever. Since I know myself to have an obsessive personality, I&#39;m at higher risk from an obsessive eating disorder I might develop than from anything I might eat.

The idea is that early humans were deprived of food when the environments they were in were depleted, so when you find yourself starving, your body prepares for a long journey to a new region. Part of this response is amping up norepinephrine, cortisol, and glucagon to liberate energy and fuel you on your journey -- resting metabolic rate actually goes up for a week or so before going down if you start fasting. Another part is suppressing hunger so you aren&#39;t distracted by tiny food sources along the way. A third is increasing your urge to exercise so that you&#39;re willing to expend the effort of walking to somewhere where there&#39;s more food.<br>So essentially, this hypothesis says that in anorexia, the &quot;I&#39;m out of food, so I&#39;d better go find a new region with more&quot; response somehow wakes up when it isn&#39;t needed and doesn&#39;t get the signal to go back to sleep, just like how metabolic syndrome is an inappropriate activation of the mechanism that prepares bears to hibernate and allowed early humans to gorge on seasonal fruit.", "comment_date": "2019-09-03T07:02:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ikky", "comment_text": "The binge eating disorder fit me so perfectly, ugh, what I&#39;d give to be skinny \ud83d\ude14", "comment_date": "2019-08-31T20:44:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pinholeputhy", "comment_text": "Anorexia isn\u2019t about body image if you haven\u2019t got bdd, it\u2019s about having control over yourself.", "comment_date": "2019-08-30T23:23:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hunter Ellis", "comment_text": "This popped up right after I purged... whoops \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2019-08-25T20:00:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "qaqwsads sferfdvf", "comment_text": "Discover pschology on mental disorders by Dr Zaid Kasim Ghawazzi.", "comment_date": "2019-08-19T20:07:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lo Jaeger", "comment_text": "I\u2019m diagnosed with EDNOS and it sucks.

Although I was somewhat inelegant, mildly funny &amp; popular I was still overweight as a teen.

Being 240 and never having a girlfriend my junior year I had enough... I changed my diet, but I also became anorexic and sometimes I purged after meals, the weight dropped drastically. By the time I reached my senior graduation I had lost close to 60 pounds, but realized how my lifestyle was affecting my body (Crones, ulcerative colitis, brittle hair &amp; bad skin) So I changed again.

While that is true that the current environment does do that, that isn&#39;t to say other environments would not trigger an eating disorder, simply in a different way. Culture/ environment is show to shape how a mental illness may be expressed, but outside of culture bound illness, do not &quot;cause&quot; it per say. That is for instance, people with AN now in days often have this idea of wanting to be thin to be beautiful or whatever and phobic of gaining weight. In previous times, anorexia nervosa was called anorexia mirabilis, in which the fear of eating was associated with fear of being unpious in ones attempt to &quot;deny the flesh&quot; and so on. There are also studied in which AN occurs at the same percentage in societies where larger body types are desired. EDs also occur in countries such as Asia, but manifest differently at times, though are getting more similar to what we know due to Western influence. The current trend seems to be less around thinness at times and more on this idea of being &quot;healthy&quot; which then gets skewed. EDs also hit more around puberty for females due to hormonal changes. Prior to puberty, EDs occur in males and females at about the same rate. I can&#39;t recall what it is, but males basically have  a protective factor that lessens the likelihood of an ED developing. <br>Which lead me to my last point of eating disorders basically being anxiety disorders. The whole &quot;control&quot; low self worth thing may be a component in sense for some, however the basic underlying pattern is experiencing and/or feeling something (anxiety, anger, frustration, etc.) believing it is in congruent to how one thinks things &quot;should&quot; be then trying to control or reassure oneself in some way, acting based on that fear/ desire to change that and make that feeling go away. It then just makes a giant cycle of constantly just acting on fear for short term relief, often to the detriment of ones long term health. <br>That being said this is a &quot;crash course&quot; so I wouldn&#39;t necessarily expect this all to be in there, but do wish the whole thing about self esteem and such wouldn&#39;t be put as a scape goat.

I have to say i was a bulimic for 7 years. starting when i was 17. it was because i wanted to be thiner. it was because my mother encouraged me to purge and use laxatives. it was because ever since i was little even the school doctor told me i was fat. but it did, in deed, turn into an addction in time. after my folks divorced i started binging and purging more heavily. i switched to vomiting. vomiting itself, doesn&#39;t just cause digestive issues. it also causes hormonal issues in time and more. besides being a little fat, i was and still am anemic. besides being a little fat, i was hypoglycemic, despite binging and eating a lot of snacks and sugars. it is just as a drug addiction, and i am not exactly sure how i manged to get over it. Good news, i did. it&#39;s been 3 years in which vomiting or using laxatives has never crossed my mind. my body finally receives a normal flow of nutrients. the bad part is that being used to that abnormal way of eating.( 6-10 meals a day that i puked them all and left... maybe a third of them in my guts. ) i rapidly gained weight. became obese. good part is that all the anxiety of calculating how much should i eat, when and where and how can i dispose of the over-binge. and hiding it. there were days when i would puke stomach acid. and there were days when i puked freshly chewed bread that would stop in my throat and make it hard to breathe. there were days were my eyes and skin around eyes was bloodshot. there were days where my throat hurt so much i couldn&#39;t even swallow water. There were days were i was simply euphoric from all that excessive vomiting that i would entertain myself with how water tasted sweet in my mouth due to stomach acid. there were days when i&#39;d just eat something just for the purpose of vomiting, because vomiting cured my headaches or gave me a sense of calmness. i didn&#39;t seek professional help. i still don&#39;t know how i managed to convince myself to stop. but i am happy i did. i no longer feel that dizzying anxiety and urge to empty my stomach because it feels unnaturally uncomfortable to have a full stomach after eating. These days i dread i might trick myself to start going back to those days, despite being given diuretic medication, i feel the urge to skip it ever now and then, in fear of not getting caught up in the bulimia trap. being obese is causing me physical pain. it&#39;s not about the image of perfection anymore. (i still don&#39;t know why i had that obsession or how i lost it). one last thing, apparently getting my body used to the certain endorphines that vomiting induces in the bloodstream, the absence of them has also caused a hormonal imbalance and my body no longer has a good hormone production, i am suffering from  policystic ovaries, metrorragie and oligomenorrhea that comes with. being also obese puts me at high risk of diabetes, heart disease and many more. never in my life have a studied the safety of diets and have seeked professional help as i did now.  but it&#39;s good. i am not anxious, i am calm. i am in no rush. i am aware this hasn&#39;t happened over night and it won&#39;t get better over night either. i am determined to succeed. and ever more determined to never slip back in that disorder. looking back at it, it is a very impairing disorder. even bulimia can cause dehydration and fatigue from loosing a lot of liquids. liquids with mineral ions. being drowsy drunk-like is not helpful for staying awake and focused, or for making critical rational decisions.", "comment_date": "2017-12-01T01:02:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miss B Grotto", "comment_text": "Back when I was 13 about 11 years ago I refused to eat due to depression.

When I eat too little (2 toast for breakfast, peanuts for lunch, &amp; maybe soup or more toast for dinner) my mind is in the worst state. I&#39;m replaying moments in my life where people have teased and insulted my weight and body (the common memory is my father always saying &quot;why are you so fat?&quot; or &quot;why do you eat so much?&quot; or even &quot;God, you&#39;re so fat!&quot;). I still take my insulin while eating very little and it&#39;s caused me to have low sugar levels. Swinging back and forth between high and low sugar levels isn&#39;t good, as well as the state of mind going from &#39;I&#39;m perfect&#39; to &#39;I&#39;m too goddamn fat&#39;.<br>so, yeah, I just had to get that out there.<br>I&#39;m getting help for the depression and trying to move away from all the horrible habits and cycles I&#39;ve been on for the past ten years.", "comment_date": "2017-10-22T08:28:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Diplomic", "comment_text": "I see myself as a muscular hunk but my brother always tells me otherwise :(", "comment_date": "2017-10-22T04:04:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katie Babey", "comment_text": "People are afraid of being fat because of people constantly telling them about the high levels of obesity and skipping over eating disorders that kill by being too thin.

Avoidant-Restrictive Food Intake Disorder is a less touched upon but still dangerous and problematic disorder. It&#39;s most common in children, especially paired with other issues such as dissociation and depression in children. It&#39;s characterized by an extremely restrictive diet consisting usually of foods high in carbohydrates, sweet/mild in taste, and often excluding entire food groups like meats vegetables etc. other symptoms are high sensitivity to taste, smell, and texture, and panic anxiety related to eating foods the child usually does not eat, and a lack of hunger when subjected to stressors or triggers. When the disorder goes unrecognized (often brushed off as pickiness) it can progress into adulthood, getting increasingly difficult to treat. The largest problem encountered by ARFID sufferers is a lack of nutrients and routine eating, as appetite can suddenly drop for weeks at a time, making it hard to eat at all. This renders the person fatigued, often iron deficient, thin and malnourished, and excluded in social situations because of their difficult diet, which leads to more stress and in turn more starving. Please, please shed more light on this disorder. As a sufferer, ARFID is just as real and just as painful to live with as other more common eating disorders, yet it goes unknown and forgotten. Treatment is hard to get, too. Please help out your fellow ARFID sufferers, all the &quot;picky eaters&quot;.

What is the line between a BDD and someone who is driven to achieve a healthier or more fit body? In my mind, the difference is clear, but a friend of mine had an experience with her therapist which makes me feel that my view does not match that of general psychology. Basically, I have a friend with a history of anxiety and depression that she has been working on for years. Recently, while she was talking to a therapist she started seeing a couple months before, and said therapist suggested that she may have a BDD. Here&#39;s the problem. She does take her fitness and weight very seriously, but she works toward her goals by balancing her diet and her exercise properly, rather than starving herself or purging. Fitness is something she can control and achieve with fairly rapid results. <br><br>Her issue, in my eyes and her&#39;s (we have some similar struggles and are very open with each other about them), is that she&#39;s not someone who fails well. When she fails, even if only in her eyes, that is one of her strongest triggers for episodes of depression. So, when she looks in the mirror and sees a body that doesn&#39;t meet her desires (or at least where she desires to be at a certain point in the fitness process), she has a high susceptibility to becoming depressed. The therapist heard this and immediately jumped to BDD, but I feel like she&#39;s missing the crucial difference between the phrases, &quot;I&#39;m worthless because I look like this (BDD),&quot; and, &quot;I look like this because I&#39;m worthless (her).&quot; Obviously, neither of these is a healthy outlook, but the former sees appearance as the cause one&#39;s shortcomings while the latter sees it as a result. Am I wrong to see a difference here?<br><br>Secondly, I&#39;m concerned about the knee jerk reaction people seem to have when it comes to responding to someone&#39;s issues with body image, namely, the urge to immediately jump in with praise to counter the self-deprecating nature of the issue. I don&#39;t have a BDD, but I do have anxiety issues which can manifest themselves in some fairly severe self-deprecating thoughts. When someone responds to something horrible I&#39;ve said about myself with a contradictory nicety, my first thought isn&#39;t, &quot;thank you, I really needed to hear that,&quot; it&#39;s, &quot;bull*<b>*</b>.&quot; When I&#39;m in a depressed place and you&#39;re nice to me, I just flat out don&#39;t believe you. Worse, if these niceties are offered by a stranger (see the numerous comments in this thread), I go from brushing the comment off to, &quot;who the <b>**</b> are you to tell me what I am!? What you&#39;re telling me could be said to literally anyone, and you can&#39;t possibly mean it because you couldn&#39;t possibly know!&quot; (Remember in the earlier video when he mentioned that male anxiety and depression often manifests itself as anger...?) What I&#39;m saying is, you do not have the time to out nice the mean going on in my head. <br><br>Anyway, I know my feelings aren&#39;t universal, but people should be aware that throwing platitudes around might make you feel better, but they may not be received as you hoped, and they are, objectively pretty meaningless. Another issue with automatic platitudes is that they&#39;re often offered to counter a perfectly healthy desire for self-improvement. Early in the video, Hank quoted a survey about the percentage of children who felt that they wish they weighed less, the point of which seeming to be to point out how early body image issues can become an issue. However, my mind immediately jumped to the fact that our country (I&#39;m American) is at an all time high with childhood obesity, and surely there is an overlap in this Venn diagram of children who wish they weighed less because they SHOULD. What good does it do to tell an obese child not to think about their weight because they&#39;re already perfect, no matter what? This doesn&#39;t mean that we should be saying, &quot;duh, fatty. Fix your disgusting self.&quot; That would obviously be extremely detrimental, and I&#39;m sure hearing similar sentiments was a catalyst for many people who eventually developed a BDD. <br><br>A proper response to a child who expresses a desire to lose weight might be something along the lines of, &quot;well, why don&#39;t we work together to learn some healthy habits and get more fit?&quot; Notice how the wording of this reply replaces &quot;lose weight&quot; with &quot;get more fit&quot; but doesn&#39;t do it blatantly, which may come across as being dismissive of their original goal. &quot;Healthy habits&quot; helps to highlight what the actual goal of the endeavor should be, but none of these is the most important word. The most important word is &quot;we.&quot; In using it, you are making a promise to that child that they will not be alone in their efforts (SO DON&#39;T LET THEM BE). As you work through the process, learning healthy eating habits, creating an exercise routine, you can create a kind of mantra that &quot;we are getting fit in order to be healthy.&quot; Hopefully, it will eventually sink in and replace, &quot;I am losing weight to be attractive.&quot; Just like you can&#39;t replace a poor physique with a healthy one by doing one curl, you can&#39;t replace a poor mentality with a healthy one by teaching one lesson. Additionally, occasionally remind them that their appearance is in no way connected to their worth as a human being. Don&#39;t do it so much that they feel like you&#39;re beating them over the head with it, but just enough that it will hopefully stick in the back of their mind. There&#39;s a lot of &quot;hopefully&quot; in this process, I know, but that&#39;s because everyone is different. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important that you stick with them. If you see anything that starts to seem like an unhealthy obsession, you will be right there to offer support.<br><br>At this point, I should mention that this response is meant for people who have the kind of relationship with the child that will make such a promise possible. If you do not have such a relationship, either bring up this conversation to someone who does or butt out because it&#39;s not your business. &quot;I bet there are a lot of people in your life who would help you meet your goals,&quot; is a good phrase to learn.<br><br>Thank you to anyone who reached the end of this novel. :)", "comment_date": "2017-01-08T17:33:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jayden O'Farrell", "comment_text": "What&#39;s funny is that I have a friend named Lauryn she&#39;s 15 and had anorexia luckily she is recovered now", "comment_date": "2017-01-05T04:55:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Notta Bear", "comment_text": "This video and all the videos associated with the Psychology has helped me come to an understanding as of why and how I developed an eating disorder and why at times it feels more present than other times.

I&#39;ve suffered from anorexia in the past, and I  know as well as you that starving and over-training won&#39;t remove the stress and anxiety long term, it will only make it worse.  <br>The first step towards getting your life together, and getting rid of the anxiety once for all, is to talk to someone. It&#39;s hard to get rid of the disorder without the support of others. I was stubborn at first, I thought it was my private life, that no one had the right to intervene with. Now afterwords I see that I was afraid that people would judge me, see me as weak. Therefor I kept it to myself. My school teacher even had to force me to sit down with her and talk it through. She wasn&#39;t angry at me, didn&#39;t look down on me, she cared for me and wanted to help me. You&#39;ll find that a lot of people really care for you and are willing to help, even though it dosen&#39;t feel that way right now. <br>The second step, is to recognize the disorder.

I had no idea that the way I felt was such a normal thing. I found people who made videos about the psychological effects on body shaming and others who focused on body positivity. Slowly I felt myself getting better and now I am completely immune to what society&#39;s standards on looks.

My family was already thinking I looked too skinny and had me weighed. When I saw this vid when it was first uploaded I realized how I wasn&#39;t even close to how the video described anorexia except for a couple minor things. Now a month later I realize how wrong I was. My goal before all of this was to get the abs that you seem models have... I started excersising then eventually increasing it to 1 hour and 30 min of ab excerises. Sometimes even 2 hours. Then I started eating healthy because I heard 80% in the food and 20% in the excersising from a credited source to help get abs. Eventually over time this healthy eating ended up in the end getting rid of any type of milk, butter out of my diet, no desserts, etc. When I started cutting things out such as butter and milk I had stopped excersising due to school starting. My meals were basically egg white, 12 grain toast, straberries. Lunch was a turkey sandwich (lettuce, 3 pieces of thin turkey, and some tomatoes) on 12 grain bread and a protein drink (it only have 1/2 cup of milk). Then for dinner, I wouldn&#39;t eat anything fried, etc. I would \u00a0eat shrimp with a salad, turkey salad, or anything along those lines. By that point, my mom didn&#39;t realize I cut out the milk, or butter. So, she asked to weigh me one day and I lost 7 pounds in under a month. Now, this wasn&#39;t really intentional all I wanted was to be healthy and have abs... I was originally 87 and 1/2, then I weighed 80... I thought it was insane. I didn&#39;t look super dead or anything in my eyes. I tried to get back to normal by eating healthy but be less rigid, so I would eat peanut butter and jelly etc. Obviously that wasn&#39;t working because I even dropped to 78. I saw this video and saw all the signs of crackling skin, always being cold, etc. I saw online how anorexics judged their carts in food stores compared to others and other signs. All of them were true about me except losing hair. I didn&#39;t thing much of it. Now, my story is nothing in comparison to the girl in the story with being 5&#39; 7&quot; and only being 82 pounds.

Simple as that; unless you have a terrible parasite or genetic disorder, which I bet isn&#39;t your case (stop lying to yourself).<br>2. How do I know if I&#39;m over- or undereating? Weight yourself every week, measure your body fat percentage (it&#39;s easier than you think; use a body fat caliper) and keep a log. I also highly recommend counting your calories if you have doubts or specific goals (high-protein diet, for example), but after some time you create habits and know your drill.<br>3. There&#39;s not such a thing as &quot;naturally chubby&quot; or &quot;naturally skinny&quot;, you are just not eating in the correct amounts. Breaking bad habits is very hard, I know, but the faster you accept your excesses and lacks are all your fault (unless you are a child and have terrible and/or ignorant parents), the faster you can start getting to do something about it.<br>4.

However, I really do feel the need to point out that Anorexia Nervosa can occur at ANY weight- if the person continues to restrict food for a long period of time it can lead to drastic, and often mortal, weight loss, but the disorder itself can occur at any weight. So can Bulimia. And so can Binge Eating Disorder. A lot of people don&#39;t seek help because they do not feel they are &#39;sick enough&#39;. That no one would take an overweight anorexic seriously, even though they&#39;ve been subsisting on little food and exercising excessively for months. That no one would care about a binge eater that&#39;s underweight, even though they&#39;ve been struggling with binging for years. It&#39;s important to acknowledge that these disorders can occur to anyone regardless of gender, sex, weight, body mass index, of general outward appearance, so that the &#39;not sick enough&#39; mentality is eradicated both from the minds of healthcare professionals and people who are too dubious and afraid to seek help. It has to start with the proper education, which is why I&#39;m saddened that this episode pushed the low body mass index of Anorexia as a definitive and imperative part of the disorder. If anyone out there reading this finds themselves restricting or purging their food intake, or engaging in disordered eating or dieting (you don&#39;t want to eat certain foods because you feel they&#39;re bad and fattening, you exercise until you feel faint, you only eat certain amounts of foods or foods you feel are &#39;safe&#39;, you are obsessed with your weight, etc etc etc) SEEK HELP as soon as possible, no matter your weight.

I lost my appetite due to depression and ate very little to the point where my stomach shrank so I didn&#39;t even have enough room to eat much without feeling bloated even if I tried. I never actively tried to lose weight it just happened. I think people have that misconception sometimes that everyone with an eating disorder is trying to lose massive amounts of weight which in the most common cases they are but there are some that don&#39;t fit that mold. There&#39;s also the fact that, for me, it was really hard to gain weight because I have a high metabolism so I burn fat easily. That mixed with anorexia is a disaster. I don&#39;t struggle with eating at all now, for anyone that cares. Because I wasn&#39;t trying to lose weight it was easier for me to overcome it but I still had to be hospitalized and force fed with an NG tube because it was so difficult for me to get out of it at first. I was hospitalized for half a year and only struggled with it for about a year and a half. To put into perspective I was 13 when I started losing weight, I&#39;m 17 now but only within the past few months have I really started to gain weight.I was at a steady 5 pounds below the recommended weight for myself for two years after being released from the hospital.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-10-07T04:09:44Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "M K", "comment_text": "I like the body positive undertones written into this episode.
