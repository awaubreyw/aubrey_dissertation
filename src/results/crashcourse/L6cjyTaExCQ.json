Please take this as a brief guide than a concrete wording as policies can change:<br><br>FAFSA , AP Courses, and the Pell Grant<br>If you&#39;re looking into college as an undergrad and you are worried about funding please look into your local community colleges first. Through FAFSA, you can get the Federal Pell Grant which can provide a financial aid amount that often will cover tuition for community colleges and give you some money left over to buy supplies you may need. I saved massive amounts in loans compared to other collegues I knew who went to a private for the same level of a degree. Community colleges are a really awesome place to get your footing, check for scholarships, and you can see their transfer programs to other colleges if they do not have your degree. I did a transfer program which ensured my credits transfered based on their articulation agreement, and minimized my tuition payments in the long run for my Bachelors. <br><br>If youre going to do an AP course, make sure it transfers to the school you want to go to before going through the effort. Some schools also give the option to do dual-enrollment, which I personally suggest more as you are directly getting college credits that have <br><br>Concerning filing out the FAFSA if you need. Remember that FAFSA is free to apply, and to ask your Financial Office for deeper and up to date information if you are having issues filling it out. Generally if you are not working you can be claimed by your parents as a dependent, and their tax info would go into FAFSA. If you are, check Publication 501 on the IRS website to see the amount you can make before you have to file as independent, thus requiring you to put your taxes in for FAFSA. (For Law School, which I am doing right now, you will need to file as independent by that point. ) Again, you should visit the Financial Office just for a meeting to make sure everything is filled out! Visiting school departments can save a lot of headaches you would have if you had to try and call or email them to explain issues you come across. <br><br>For more information, FAFSA gov has a guide to Federal Pell Grants. <br>If you have not yet, I suggest just having a folder just for organizing your financial aid documents and your credit progress. <br><br>Scholarships<br>You can check FastWeb, Scholarships, among others to see what is available. DoSomething is great if you are just graduating and have a passion for current issues. I got $1k doing one of their surveys on why voting is important as an example. <br><br>Check your local library! There is a variety of community scholarships available, espeically for STEM majors. They may have the &quot;The Ultimate Scholarship Guidebook&quot; by Gen and Kelly Tanabe. If they don&#39;t you may be able to request it or get it via interlibrary loan. That book in particular has a great introduction I think most people should read before starting their search, and they have categories of scholarships that go from background to major focuses. <br><br>Attending College Without a Major<br><br>If you can attend a college with the Pell Grant paying for it I definitely would give it a try. Most of the students I went to class with were unsure what they wanted to do when pursuing their Associates and Bachelors. Even when I transfered to what would be seen as an Ivy School people had the same challenges. It is fully alright to attend college when you are not 100% set with a major in mind. You will have enough elective slots+ the core classes to get new perspectives and ideas to help you figure out what makes you happy and what you want to do for a career. Many colleges have career prep and graduate prep for that reason, and you should set up appointments with them to help you learn what track you may want to do. I have known people who switch from a JD to a History PhD and people who go from Mathematics as a BA and go to a JD not in Tax Law. The BA/BS is there to really help you figure out those long term questions, and it really is an exciting experience. Trade schools are also of course a great option that some community colleges offer, such as welding or automotive. <br><br>I am wanting to make a video on this since I did make actual guide on this before with a timeline, so I will probably make that soon.<br>I hope this helps for anyone readings and this was a great video as it is difficult to have discussions about this topic without getting a bit lost in the weeds.", "comment_date": "2022-04-23T17:22:11Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "bestLetsplayer", "comment_text": "What an insane and inhumane system.
