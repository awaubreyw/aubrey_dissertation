Even a debt based monetary system hinders our full societal potentiality. People seem to be stuck banging their head trying to make social development fit into archaic ideology. If we do not socially evolve we will not grow with the speed and flexibility that we are capable of, and I would argue that right now we can clearly see the stunted growth in our technological advancement due to our use of a monetary system. We need to evolve and develop into a moneyless sociaty. Of course this is contingent on living through biosphere destruction and mass extinction, so in reality we need to work to maintain a habitable planet and better our social relationships at the same time. We can do the right things but it will take courage.",

The\u00a0ratio of money the upper class is able\u00a0to generate compared to how much they spend is heavily favoring the idea that they earn more money then they can ever hope to spend, therefore this causes uneven wealth distribution which weakens the flow of money in the economy and slows it down. It seems the only way to counter this is through heavy taxation of the upper class then using the tax money to allow the lower classes to generate more wealth for themselves which would strengthen the flow of money creating a strong economy through balanced wealth distribution. There is\u00a0has never been evidence\u00a0suggesting\u00a0trickle down economics strengthens the flow of money necessary for a strong economy.",

The fed is the main cause behind every single economic crash with its money printing and the main reason for why you are broke, the dollar has lost 97% of its purchasing power since the feds creation in 1913.<br><br>If you support fiscal policy it means that you support the stealing of money by government which uses force since taxes arent collected on a voluntary basis. If you support taxes you are basically saying that the government knows how to spend your money better than you do which obviously is impossible, thus the government never has the information to efficiently allocate resources within the marketplace. When you hear that the government must pay its interest payments on the debt it created (to fund all the bullshit re distributive programs) it means that you have to pay since the government has no money of its own. Social security isnt a must pay, its an entitlement not a right, that was only a recent addition, a nice way to offer &quot;free&quot; goods to buy votes from a moronic public who never question the cost. The reason the fed is so important to the government is that it enables government to lie and continue living beyond its means instead of telling the moronic public that the country cant afford the entitlements that they were promised.",

Or their role in stealth unrepresented taxation via inflation.  Or how much money has been channeled into wall st. because of the low rate of savings return which is almost directly controlled by the Fed.  The Fed is crony banking of the worst sort.  Unaccountable, long history of failure, benefits the rich invested in finance at the expense of the poor and everyone else.",

No money issued as debt or a fractional reserve system and not tied to gold either. Fiscally, we should make it illegal (just like Craig punching that eagle) to run deficits and huge debts outside of war and economic recession. If congress cannot make a budget that is balanced, then the difference should come out their pockets. And since we are talking about money and politics, then how about getting money out of politics, eh?",
