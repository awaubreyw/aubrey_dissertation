The most recent prior gathering of the Estates General had each estate casting a single vote as an order.

When the Estates General convened, their first order of business was to take attendence, which was done by order. The Third Estate believed that this meant that all votes would be taken by order and refused to transact any official business as a separate order. The Tennis Court Oath came about when, during this whole deal, the Third Estate was locked out of its meeting room (possibly for non-political reasons like preparing it for another use), which the Third Estate took to mean that it was being disenfranchised because of their refusal to transact business.", "comment_date": "2019-10-21T22:17:27Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"5fJl_ZX91l0": {"The French Revolution: Crash Course European History #21": {"channel_id": "Ugzv1f6AnDlH4OdoW3h4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Adam Frankenberg", "comment_text": "I think you can see parallels now with how CEOs and other members of the super rich are completely out of touch with the lives of the ordinary people, not mention the working poor.

His treason, his fleeing to Varennes, his plotting with European monarchs, all led to the desacralization of the king and then his fall and execution. The situation was very different on July 14th, 1790 during the F\u00eate de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration (which was turned, not &quot;Bastille Day&quot;, into our national holiday)<br><br>2/ You&#39;re being too harsh on Robespierre, who was the first French representative to submit a law to ban capital execution, and to submit a law to abolish slavery. Since his law on capital execution didn&#39;t get the majority of votes, and since law at the time stated that suspects of treason could be sentenced to death, many were, not by his fault.
