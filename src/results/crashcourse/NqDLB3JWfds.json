At the end, he reveals that she passed the test by not sacrificing her brother, and in the second trial, the knife is found in the one she chooses herself, not the one the fairies direct her to. Even the first trial, I believe she was told to \u201cshove the rocks down into the toad\u2019s mouth\u201d which she also ended up not doing, instead tricking it into eating the stones. All that taken into consideration, I think it\u2019s plausible that the faun wanted her to agitate the Pale Man. After all, if you can pass the trials by completing 2 out of 3, it\u2019s not a good test. But why would he want her to anger the Pale Man? I think it, as well as everything else he does, is to teach Ofelia disobedience. He\u2019s preparing her to be a leader, and if she accepts commands without question, she will expect her people to do the same. She has to wake the Pale Man, so that the faun can get angry with her, so they can see if she remains rebellious even when there\u2019s backlash. As we can tell from Vidal, obedience leads to tyranny and fascism, and if Ofelia is obedient without thought, she will be a tyrannical and fascist leader.", "comment_date": "2020-06-02T00:37:44Z", "likes_count": 68}, {"comment_by": "lhpoetry", "comment_text": "This film is inventive, but it&#39;s still super-irresponsible in its lack of ambiguity and its extremely preachy black and white morality that uses historical cyphers as incarnations of pure evil in a not meta way.", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T12:18:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frostdragonbreath", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sorry but I think i&#39;m the only one who doesn&#39;t get what all the fuss is about this movie.

Furthermore, the reason I think it is a made up world (even if Guillermo del Toro claims the contrary) is the fact that Vidal cannot see the faun. Of course, you might just say that it&#39;s because he&#39;s a grown up and only children can see magical creatures, them being purer and all that. But the number one evidence (in my opinion) is this: when she returns to her parents in the underworld to sit by them and rule over the magical land, it is only LATER that she draws her final breath. I think it means that during this whole scene she&#39;s still there with Mercedes, but feeling death slowly creeping on her, she takes one final attempt to retreat to her fantasy world before literally drawing her final breath.

For some reason though, I couldn&#39;t stop watching it. I realised later I was completely infatuated with the story, the monsters didn&#39;t scare me much but I remember first seeing the pale man very clearly, super impressive practical effects. If anything the sheer brutality of the civil war scenes seemed to play off the fantasy scenes really nicely, in a way where both parts of the film drew me in and I really started to care about Ofelia and if the utterly cruel and merciless world she lived in would get the better of her, which it unfortunately does. <br>Such a memorable experience.

I mean, you\u00a0can DEFINE\u00a0every magical act as being in Ophelia&#39;s head, but if that&#39;s the case, then the movie doesn&#39;t make sense in a couple of scenes. <br><br>(EDIT - I think the other scene was her escaping from her room with the magic piece of chalk? I forget.) <br><br>ie, the aforementioned Labyrinth scene - she COULD be climbing under and through the hedge (somehow, with a baby in her hands)\u00a0but we&#39;re not shown that. To do this, you have to define beforehand that it&#39;s an unreliable narrator that&#39;s telling us the story, rather than taking the evidence presented to us on-screen.\u00a0\u00a0And if that&#39;s the case, then you can project whatever meaning you want to. <br><br>(Of course, from what I recall of the film, in the immediate next scene, the stepfather and the faun are in the center of the labyrinth, and he can&#39;t see it - so it really IS just a coping mechanism for Ophilia, or the stepfather is a person that simply can&#39;t perceive the magical realm.)<br><br>So, essentially - it&#39;s either a psychological drama that has some editing problems, or else it&#39;s a subtle supernatural thriller. I would argue that del Toro is too good a director to leave editing issues of that magnitude in his film. <br><br>That being said, I do agree that it&#39;s likely a theme/commentary about blind obedience to authority - in this case, the authority of genre convention.
