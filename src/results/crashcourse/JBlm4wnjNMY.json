It is not thinking originally like humans do; for example, when humans create new data sets out of inductive reasoning.

Generative Adversarial Networks, in my opinion, are not actually creating new data sets in the same way humans do. Computers are stuck forever in the deductive reasoning loop.  Through inductive reasoning, i.e., originally creating brand new postulates, humans can continually and creatively create new data sets. Current AI successes are from more densely related deductive loops, not from true inductive reasoning, which is the essence of human thinking.
