That&#39;s easy to accept. However, the stuff that makes these things are ageless. Scientists like to teach us about many principles. One of these principles is that energy and matter can neither be created nor destroyed - they merely change their state. Planets are not created out of nothing.<br>There is no age to the &quot;universe&quot; its &quot;age&quot; is infinite, therefore trying to measure its age is futile. The &quot;universe&quot; has no limit to size, its size is infinite also. Trying to measure the size of the universe is equally futile. The bothersome concept here, for us, is the concept of infinity. That is a concept that is difficult to comprehend (as far as measuring goes). We humans love to measure things. Mathematicians and scientists take the measuring thing very seriously and that&#39;s okay! We benefit by their efforts. However, there are some things that simply can not be measured. It is difficult to swallow that pill.<br>Simply put the universe is infinite in size and age. It has always been and will go on forever. All of these claims on putting a number to the age or size of the universe is merely a gauge on how we perceive the world around us and how we choose to measure it. It&#39;s that simple. However, some very smart people don&#39;t want to hear that!<br>Math and science is always evolving! Scientists gain new perspectives over time and that&#39;s okay. Don&#39;t forget that the brightest minds of the day said that the earth was at the center of everything, the sun revolved around us; also, the sun and planets moved in orbits; at first these orbits were described by the Greeks as being perfect circles; one last &quot;known&quot; fact was that the Earth was flat... Well, that was the &quot;truth&quot; advocated by the guardians of truth millennia ago,  the mathematicians, scientists and philosophers -- really smart people that we believed in. Well, we &quot;know better&quot; today. The Earth in not at the center, planetary orbits are not perfect circles and the Earth is not flat! We &quot;KNOW&quot; that now. How will science and math have evolved 10, 20, 100 years from now?<br>Well, we will eventually catch up. Someone will come up with a reason to question the age of the universe. My gut feeling is that our understanding about the properties of light and magnetism and gravity will be &quot;updated&quot;. The first step will be to revise the &quot;age&quot; of the universe. Well, it&#39;s a start! But, in reality the concept of &quot;infinity&quot; is something we either choose to ignore or something we simply don&#39;t understand. Regardless, it exists!<br>&quot;Origins of the Universe&quot; that is a false premise. The Big Bang THEORY is also a false premise. There is no &quot;start&quot; to time...Time is infinite in duration...

And if im understanding this correctly, youre essentially saying in the beginning there was matter. But if there was no space where would you put it? No matter how small it is, it has to go somewhere right? Or if there was no time when would you put it? You cant have any one or two of those things (matter, space, time) without the other(whether spacetime is one thing or seperate doesnt really change anything).

Raging heat, constant lightning strikes, the works. It was probably extremely cheap to buy a house then. I\u2019m getting if topic. When this experiment was being performed organic particles were made. This supported the theory of spontaneous generation. Of course we don\u2019t know exactly how life on Earth was started.

I have a personal Theory that the true universe is eternal an infinite containing sub universes within universes infinitely, giving rise to new universes by transferring energy from old ones thus continuing the transfer of energy. The process I see if this transference of energy is eternal and infant containing no beginning or end, because again if we believe that matter can be destroyed then we also believe that matter can be created thus there is no logical reason to believe that there is a beginning to matter. I&#39;m not saying that there wasn&#39;t a birthing in a way of this sub universe just like how when cells die new cells are born from the energy and decaying matter of the old cells. It&#39;s just my personal opinion I may be wrong I really don&#39;t care it&#39;s not that big a deal to me but I think this is more for me a logical conclusion then to believe the contradiction that everything ever possible came about in a single instant from a single local point, which again violates the law that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even if it was two particles so tiny and Compact and dense in matter that combined to form the universe whatever. I think I have a more organic and naturalistic view of how this particular Universe was born possibly from the death of other universes or just like how bubbles arise in the ocean. There&#39;s really no logical reason to conclude that anybody knows anything on this subject anyway, no matter how much data we believe we possess to postulate that we know everything about how the universe was created.

There is no escape from the super ultimate question: Why is there something rather than nothing, and why is the something structured the way it is?&quot; -Martin Gardner.", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T03:23:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D.

This promotes other implausible flat ideas and theories that must give stars a major role in the chemical composition of our tiny planet. This includes the idea that huge stars make all the heavier elements when they supernova, taking hundreds of thousand of years to cycle through each time (not to mention the huge variety of needed to produce the very heaviest elements) all within our local space and allowing gravity the time to slowly gather it all back together near our tiny solar system.<br>How can this fit with our tremendous scale of existence?

In ten billion years our sum will move through space along a relatively small cross section of our galaxies spiral arm, pulling earth along with it, with this motion in mind in the past 4.567 billion years we have never passed the same point in space twice.

Well...GUESS WHAT!!? Steven Hawking doesn&#39;t just think about astro-physics!!!...he thinks about how much he would enjoy having legs, arms...and...get this now....A WORKING PENIS!!! Steven Hawking is a very intelligent person, but he is no different from any MAN who wants to get LAID!! He can puzzle the universe down to...now are you ready for this...THE MOMENT GOD SAID &quot;LET THERE BE LIGHT&quot;. That&#39;s where the &quot;BIG BANG&quot; came from...let&#39;s not be stupid about it. Our universe sprang forth from a thought that our divine creator had...&quot;LET THERE BE LIGHT&quot;...and it was so &amp; it was good. Steven Hawking himself can&#39;t explain why the &quot;BIG BANG&quot; happened. (even though the cause is written in the BIBLE Chapter 1...God said let there be light!!) Steven Hawking&#39;s best reason for why the BIG BANG occured is...&quot;the universe created itself because the universe needed to create itself because the universe wanted to exist so the universe made itself exist&quot;.

I&#39;m sure Richard Dawkins agrees with Steven Hawking, but how many very intelligent astro-phyisists out there agree with &quot;good ole Steve&quot; just to save their jobs? NOBODY knows where that &quot;singularity&quot; came from. Science says that from the big bang til about 400,000 years, the universe was too hot for matter to exist...so there was only &quot;light&quot;. The bible says the FIRST thing created was LIGHT....and...well, science seems to agree with that. Then things get a little fuzzy. 6 days...10 billion years...who cares! Was the bible DICTATED or just INSPIRED?!!

Jesus still loves you even if you think that life evolved over 10 billion years from a rock fart magnificently into life, into a single celled organism, that eventually after positively mutating for another 3.8 billion years, blossomed into a sentient being compiling of roughly 37.2 trillion cells and with a brain so enormously complex you would actually have the capability to hypothesize your way out of believing that you will one day be held to account for the way in which you live your life to the Omnipotent creator of all things....... I guess I can see the appeal in thinking none of this really matters. And come on, I mean just look around at all the scientific proof there is for the theory of evolution. Why I don&#39;t know why it still is just a theory. There are countless examples of positive mutations we see documented in all the peer reviewed x-men papers right. As well look at all the random biological changes observed through the extreme chaos of this mathematically ordered universe. Boo yah! Science man.

The first, is if the Earth is 4.5 billion years and the Big Bang was 13.8, than any star system born less than 4.5 billion but being further away than 4.5 billion light years would eventually be appearing in our night sky. Statistically doesn&#39;t it seem feasible that we should be seeing new stars on a fairly regular basis? In a couple billion years could our night sky be brighter? Is it brighter than when Galileo was looking at it? Are there planets where the night sky has so many stars that night is just as bright as day? If we see more stars will we learn things we never imagined?<br><br>My second thought is more philosophical. I can listen to the same set of facts from 10 different sources, each agreeing on the details of the facts. However each one can put a different spin or emphasis. Each one could connect sets of facts in different ways. Really important; each one has it&#39;s own set of biases. I basically learn 10 views of the same story, then I apply my personal experience and related bits of knowledge, and unfortunately my unconscious bias&#39; and I end up creating my own personal view of the facts everyone is repeating. So same facts but 11 different views of them. A long time ago I recognized this and because of it I try to look for different sources of the same material to hopefully get closer to a real understanding. However that bias thing is an issue. I don&#39;t know how you get around the bias factor unless maybe you acknowledge it and people starting talking more about why you believe instead of what you believe.", "comment_date": "2014-10-11T15:20:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zac candelaria", "comment_text": "Crash course philosophy!", "comment_date": "2014-10-11T13:46:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PrimalCyndaquil", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq6be-CZJ3w&amp;t=1m30s\">1:30</a> Cubone? xD", "comment_date": "2014-10-11T12:43:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fullmetalfunk", "comment_text": "Was that a Reaper in the opening segment?", "comment_date": "2014-10-11T05:10:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arob309", "comment_text": "I just hate when Atheist ask for proof of Christianity, but yet some don&#39;t know proof their own beliefs.

If I told you to walk north, east or west you would tell me that you can&#39;t, you are as far north as you could possibly be, and there&#39;s no frame of reference to walk east or west. If I told you to walk in any direction one foot, then you would be one foot from the north pole. Afterwards, if I told you to walk 2 feet north, you would tell me that&#39;s impossible, but, if I told you to face north, and walk two feet in that direction, you would be on the mirror side of the pole, but once again, one foot away. Now let&#39;s use this concept with time, as space and time are linked up, and my explanation could now be extrapolated to time because of this. The Big Bang is the north pole. Start one minute after the Big Bang, go two minutes towards the Big Bang. Once again, you would be one minute from the Big Bang. The way our species perceives time, if we were to do this, we would be swept up and begin traveling through time in the opposite direction we are now. (This next piece is my interpretation of this) All the antimatter is in that direction. It is the mirror reality. For us, if we were to go to the moment before the Big Bang from our direction, we would be approaching nothingness, just as if the mirror versions of ourselves approached it. Now if you are versed in Calculus, you can see this as we are the right sided limit, and they are the left sided limit. Now I don&#39;t think there can be negative people, but we know that space has three dimensions. Space also must have three dimensions then. The Big Bang is the point from which a concentric sphere bubbles out, with all possible realities contained within it. There is no before a center of a circle, but the diameter would be twice as long as our own Universes time. I would argue that the span of time that our Big Bang currently covers is 13.8 billion years times squared, times pi, but also constantly getting bigger.\u00a0<br><br>Please share the answer with all of your friends, I don&#39;t care who takes credit for it right now, but this has other implications that if you&#39;d like to discuss please message me.", "comment_date": "2014-10-08T21:59:25Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "crnobijeli13", "comment_text": "&quot;There was no then then&quot; - my new favorite quote of all time.", "comment_date": "2014-10-08T21:31:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MEL EILER", "comment_text": "hay", "comment_date": "2014-10-08T13:54:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hahaha01357", "comment_text": "Why would the sky be filled with stars all the time if the universe is static, eternal, and infinite?", "comment_date": "2014-10-07T22:20:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Margaux W", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a nerd fighter but this video may elicit the phrase &quot;I can&#39;t even&quot; because I simply cannot completely grasp the concept of how spacetime was created.

The thing is when ever amy scientist figure out something be more and more years are added to the universe&#39;s age. You don&#39;t have to add all those years. Us Christina ourselves aren&#39;t even sure when the world was created by God but we are sure that it wasn&#39;t trillions open trillions of years ago more like 6-10 thousand. Also how can scientist accurately measure the distance between stars. Although there is mathematical equations that can tell how far apart they are but how can you be sure? You would have to measure it your self by flying in a rocket to that star and measuring how far it is.  Anyways most Big Bang believers also believe in evolution (in my opinion bogus)  so to disprove that let&#39;s go back you what you evolutionist think when life began like some crazy number of years ago. Just an average day on boiling rock soon to be earth then boom it cools than boom again chance combo of non living chemicals out of the blue make a cell. Over time that cell multiplied and became life today. I believe that that is crazy. How would something that isn&#39;t alive become alive instantly? The answer is, it didn&#39;t even happen. Many, many, many evolutionist scientist have attempted to re-create that chance combination in a controlled environment. And yes they did make some of the chemicals that are essential for life, but that is the thing they only made some of them. They were missing almost 3/4 of the entire 16 chemicals! That is no where near what it takes to create life. And now you ask how did life begin. Easy, God started all life! Many evolutionist would say that the Christians have no cold hard proof that God made everything, many would even say that there is more evidence against it than for it. They  are wrong, in fact is the opposite. How would all the living things in the world fit together. God created everything so it can fit perfectly in his constantly wondrous thing that we call life. Even with that many people would still evade the fact that God is real and try to explain invasive species and how they aren&#39;t perfect and messing with this so called puzzle. That is true that things in life aren&#39;t perfect. But it tells us in the Bible that things aren&#39;t perfect at all. They were perfect until sin entered the world. That is when things ecologically started to go down hill. Man traveled and brought invasive life with them. Some are beneficial like horses from the first Spanish settlers. And some aren&#39;t like the yellow ants from Asia invading Australia and there  natural wildlife. God has already foreseen that and he tells his prophets who put it in the Bible. No with that said many more people would say that the Bible has no proofs in it that can be recreated. That also is true but here is an example of something that can be recreated but was recorded by historians. Okay as we may know George Washington was the first president of the USA right. How would you know for sure. Were you there, no you would be super duper old and wouldn&#39;t be able to talk and tell people about it. Also the election of George Washington can not be recreated in a controlled environment. We have to rely on documents recorded by people whom of which were actually there so we take that as fact. Why can&#39;t we rely on the Holy Bible as truth? It was recorded by people who were actually there and were told by God what to right. Why can&#39;t    we take there word for it. The Bible is true because it is consistent from time period to time period, everything matches up with other people who recorded the same events at the same time and that is true accuracy. So why can&#39;t we rely on the Bible and conclude that God is there and he made everything. With all that said I pray that you will rethink what you believe in you evolutionist. I highly suggest you do some more research into God&#39;s presence in the world. If you get here I highly thank you for taking the time to read my claim that God is in fact there and he is here to redeem you and give you salvation so you someday be with Him in Heaven.

As soon as the atoms formed, radiation was free to travel. It was very high energy radiation (like gamma and beyond), and very intense.<br>Now, the universe is expanding, and the expansion is accelerating. Because of that, some of the radiation did not reach us yet, and its waves are constantly being lengthened by the ever-expanding space. The space expansion speed can exceed the speed of light, at which point we will have no way to detect anything coming from a region of space that&#39;s moving away from us at that speed. But before that, we will detect the Electromagnetic waves, at a much longer wave length (lower energy).<br>This is why, the microwave radiation (long wave compared to the original wave length) is the only radiation coming from that distant past, from distant regions of space. It is the very first light to break the opaque electron soup, which marks the birth of the first atoms.<br><br>And we are lucky. Because we are at the brink of detecting it. Had we developed slower, like a few million years slower, we would not have observed this picture, and would have no information about the Big Bang. Our distant descendants will have nothing except our own documented measurements, on this matter.<br><br>And what does this picture really tells us? Well, the background radiation is very uniform, because matter and energy distribution was very uniform at that time. It was the tiny quantum fluctuations that caused instabilities, that formed centers of gravity that attracted ever more matter, to form the galaxies, and eventually the stars, and planets that we have today. So the images we got of those fluctuations have a very high contrast, to highlight those ripples. Because information can only travel with the speed of light, and we know the age of that light, we know how big those clumps of matter should really be, depending on the shape of the universe. This picture, thus, provides us with answers to questions about the shape of the universe, whether it&#39;s infinite or not, and what will happen to it eventually.<br><br>It is one of the most important measurements in cosmology.", "comment_date": "2014-09-22T16:10:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "felixthefox", "comment_text": "ah, i see they have proven themselves to be king of the internet. well done, overly attached and celibate twins.", "comment_date": "2014-09-22T15:59:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zyamaman", "comment_text": "Fuck the pigeons - fuck them all!", "comment_date": "2014-09-22T14:12:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JR", "comment_text": "@CrashCourse\u00a0Are you ever going to do an episode about ME?", "comment_date": "2014-09-22T14:06:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrA", "comment_text": "This is where Bill Gates&#39;s Grant went, correct?

I come from a family of well educated people in the Christian faith. I personally find that many of the things said in the Bible are fairly easily explained by science in a way that makes sense. This does include the Big Bang. In Genesis it says first was the heavens and the earth, so in that sense the Big Bang makes sense in that everything was created at one point in time. Now as to how it happened is up for discussion. Since we can neither prove nor disprove the Big Bang, it remains a theory. I am agreeing with those who have posted before me that it is possible to align science with religion, in my case Christianity.<br><br>Sadly, there is a large number of Evangelical  Christians who do not accept scientific fact simply because they can&#39;t seem to fit it into their world view. These are commonly the Christians who speak out the most, not necessarily the majority. I just ask that before any Christians or otherwise, think of Proverbs <a href=\"http://youtu.be/tq6be-CZJ3w?t=10m14s\">10:14</a>- <br>Wise men store up knowledge, <br>but the mouth of the fool invites ruin.<br>(Yeah I know it&#39;s clich\u00e9 of me to quote the bible, but I think it is good advice for anyone) Anyway, I also want to express my admiration for the nerdfighter community, and it&#39;s tolerance, acceptance, and respect for people of all beliefs and cultures.

If you wanna take it a step further, we can argue that our &quot;experience&quot; is simply neurons going off and that nothing actually exists, it&#39;s all in our imagination. Now that seems silly to me, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if most of the people in the comments agreed with this.\u00a0<br><br>You guys take the fun out of everything.\u00a0<br><br>Here&#39;s what I think, feel free to mock me. We only know what we can experience, and many people claim they only believe in things that they have physical proof for. So then, we have no physical proof of intelligence. We have no physical proof of a number. Numbers are abstract concepts. Good is an abstract concept. The idea of eternal patterns or immortal beings, depending on what you believe? Abstract. Opinions about any of these things? They&#39;re all abstract. You can&#39;t point to an opinion. You can reference a person, a concrete concept, who makes an opinion. You can point to an apple and call it an &quot;apple&quot; or &quot;la manzana&quot; or whatever you call it in your preferred language.\u00a0<br><br>There is nothing wrong with the abstract. It&#39;s awesome. There are whole thought processes that deal with the abstract. There&#39;s a lot that we don&#39;t understand, but we want to know more, so we keep going, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s for naught. But I also don&#39;t think we can for sure say that any of us are right about anything.\u00a0Hell, I don&#39;t even know if everything I said is true. I do know one thing: we can&#39;t know everything, but we can make it easier on ourselves by accepting what we don&#39;t know. Abstractly, I mean. Like, there&#39;s no one definition of &#39;good&#39; or &#39;image&#39; or &#39;blue,&#39; even. Everyone&#39;s a little different, but we&#39;re capable of agreeing on some things or at least talking them over. Rather than bitching at each other about being wrong, offer your opinion and support it with actual evidence.\u00a0<br><br>Calm your tits, guys.\u00a0<br><br>There&#39;s something incredible about what we don&#39;t know. It&#39;s exciting, and we want to be able to learn more and more, but we have to keep in mind that we&#39;re not gonna understand the universe. If we did, it&#39;d be kinda boring. What science does is provide a kind of background.\u00a0&quot;There&#39;s nothing here to argue against, [science] is a process, not an ideology,&quot; said Hank Green himself. It&#39;s. Not. An.

However at about <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tq6be-CZJ3w&amp;t=5m30s\">5:30</a> you say there is no time before the Big Bang, which strictly speaking isn&#39;t true simply because it didn&#39;t exist in the sense it does in our established universe that it didn&#39;t exist. That&#39;s a problem with the tools used to understand it moreso than the concept. Time itself is basically what resolves chance, there is constantly finite causes and several more possible effects (down to quantum mechanical factors) cascading throughout the universe, time in a stream resolves all these. We currently measure time by it&#39;s visible effects on energy and matter because that is the simplest way for us to do so, and for the most part it seems to be constant in it&#39;s procession in a straight line at a steady pace on Earth. To say that is true for the entirety of the universe is false, as is it to say it for outside of it.<br><br>For example light being a brilliant &quot;measurement&quot; of time in that it always travels at the same speed relative to time. Light doesn&#39;t always move at the same &quot;speed&quot; though, we&#39;ve observed that high gravity density can &quot;slow&quot; it down, and that matter that approaches the speed of light will always have light move the speed of the light &quot;faster&quot; than it. Both of these pose problems for the perception that time moves at a fixed pace. Because it either does and the speed of light isn&#39;t the speed of light, or the perception of time is relevant to gravatic density and speed, and more than likely other factors. That all fits with space time because there&#39;s more chances being resolved in an area denser in matter and energy.<br><br>Before the Big Bang supposing actual &quot;nothingness&quot; was ironically and perhaps confusingly &quot;everything&quot; doesn&#39;t mean time didn&#39;t exist, just that our method for measuring it doesn&#39;t work because all of the things and rules we use to measure it before that point didn&#39;t exist. If anything it would&#39;ve moved infinitely faster because anything conceivable (and plenty not) would have been technically possible in infinite nothing for an infinite amount of time, time would still go on deciding which of these many myriad possibilities would occur and from then what. If you draw a continuous line on a piece of paper in whatever fashion you want, straight/squiggly/intricate/whatever as long as it&#39;s continuous. Then continue that line onto a piece of graph paper where (for the purposes of simplifying the analogy) the line now must be straight, continuous, and move from one side of the page to the other. You now have a graph against which to measure the progress of the line, you can now observe the rules by which it&#39;s now following and make assumptions within the graph about how it should and will move. The graph paper is our universe it&#39;s matter, energy, and the rules they (usually) abide by, the original piece is outside the universe (before/after/outside the possible boundaries of but that&#39;s a whole different game). To say because the line moves a particular way on the graph paper means it would on the original would be logical, until you realize the graph may be a much smaller sample size compared to the original. To say the line didn&#39;t exist before the graph is just as silly just because your current means of measuring the line don&#39;t work on the other piece of paper.<br><br>TL;DR Just because our means for measuring the perception of the passage of time as short lived beings of organic matter and energy don&#39;t work outside a universe of matter and energy on scopes most can&#39;t conceive, doesn&#39;t mean that time magically stops existing when it&#39;s inconvenient for us to figure out.

What if dark matter isn&#39;t a matter, but instead wrinkles in space-time itself! what if space-time isn&#39;t inherently smooth, but the force and cooling of the big bang itself caused the space-time to be wrinkled, creating natural gravitational wells in it. Those gravity-wells are what we see as dark matter, since it&#39;s a gravitational effect on the matter surrounding it, but without any matter to cause that gravity. it&#39;s a gravitational force caused by naturally occurring bending of space-time, originating from the very moment of the big bang.", "comment_date": "2014-09-18T12:46:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andr\u00e9s Ossa", "comment_text": "Waw!", "comment_date": "2014-09-18T12:42:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anne Nhio", "comment_text": "YES!

A more appropriate term would be &quot;inflationary cosmology&quot;. Inflationary cosmology is a theory that sits happily with theistic and secular worldviews (providing you don&#39;t happen to think that everything -- including all your memories -- were created a second ago). In fact, inflationary cosmology was first theorized by a devout catholic, long before evidence for it was gathered.<br>Here are <b>just two possibilities</b><br>Theistic: A timeless, changeless, all powerful god-concept somehow willed, or caused, or in some other fashion orchestrated the inflationary event outside of spacetime.<br>Secular: A timeless quantum field which undergoes eternal flux happens to generate matter and anti matter in -- usually -- equal portions, but in our case (and in perhaps others) happened to &quot;spit out&quot; more matter than anti matter which would then inflate.<br><br>Both explanations beg some pretty huge questions which only speak to the gaps in human knowledge, and -- to be honest -- we may never be able to test for either of these hypotheses. While naturalistic (secular) hypotheses are typically supported by mathematics and our previous findings through the scientific method, there are still problems with them, and naturalistic hypotheses will compete with each other for which most accurately predicts what we have seen and will see in the future. Theistic hypotheses tend to make more vernacular sense, however they generally tend to raise more questions than they answer up to and until persons x, y, and z decide to take their base assumption (a necessary god concept exists) for face value.<br><br>Whichever route you choose, at this point, speaks more to what evidence and/or arguments you find more compelling, and less to what may or may not actually exist. If (and only if) we decide to give into the (very) loaded language of the question &quot;what caused the big bang?&quot; or &quot;what happened before the big bang?&quot; or &quot;why is there stuff rather than nothing?&quot; or what have you, the only intellectually honest answer from both theist and atheist alike would be &quot;nobody knows&quot;.<br><br>Ultimately, it does not matter what underlying worldview one has -- inflationary cosmology has effectively risen above a hypothesis to scientific theory. It might all be BS... but then again, we might all be under the spell of some crazy trickster-god and everything we know might be wrong as well. At the end of the day, all worldviews would do well to incorporate this theory into their understanding of (what might as well be) reality in order to maintain some degree of relevance.

Growing up a bit I&#39;ve come to accept that temporary things can and do have meaning, even if it doesn&#39;t ultimately last. Learning about the scale of time helps to put things into context.<br>For myself, I identify as a secular person and want to see society as a whole move more towards that, because I feel it&#39;s important in our learning to understand how things came to be. When I talk to people who are religious I try to keep myself level-headed and hear out their views, which can be really difficult especially if they are creationists and good with rhetoric. It helps to keep in mind that religion (specifically Christianity) &quot;started&quot; extremely recently. I see it as adaptive, people in the past for hundreds of years lived and died believing in their gods/God, and I don&#39;t want to discount their experiences. I used to be very divided with myself because a part of me was always so extreme like, we have to get religion out of our schools! and government, a notion I still carry but in a much more specific way, like I&#39;m not out to ELIMINATE all traces of religion. Right now I understand that it&#39;s quite complex, there are so many denominations of religions, some of which disagree with each other. How religious people in the US are mostly Christian which is THE religion but what about so many others around the world? How have people gone about bringing meaning and making meaning in their lives.<br>It is both daunting and exciting too see oneself in this massive framework.
