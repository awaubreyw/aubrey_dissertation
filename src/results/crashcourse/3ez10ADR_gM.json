Much of our spending is on benefits for those who serve...China lacks these costs, again because it is a dictatorship.<br>3. The U.S. spends as much as it does on the military because much of the rest of the world sits back and relies on the U.S. for defense, such as why NATO nations are able to field such small forces and heavily fund social services because we provide most of their defense capabilities.<br>4. If you examine the total U.S. budget, the military only gets about 17-18% on average. In contrast, social programs get nearly 50%. To see this you must look at the whole budget. Many people look at just discretionary spending which makes the military appear to get a far larger proportion of the budget because the bulk of its funding comes from that portion of the budget. Most spending on social programs is part of the mandatory spending portion of the budget.

Although this is accurate textbook information that is taught in most schools, it is  misleading and not very intelligent.

Economics is a social science and moral philosophy with different paradigms. Adam Smith, the father of economics, called it &#39;political economy&#39;. Good economics should recognize that the real world is messy and complicated. In real life businesses, people, and governments do not use this kind of &#39;economics&#39; to function and succeed. They succeed because of tactics and behaviors specific to their own areas of expertise and as a result of their interactions with and position within institutions like media, finance, legal systems, politics, culture, etc. If you are looking beyond succeeding in 101 classes (because this video WILL help with that), but what to really understand economics as a social science, start by learning about the history of economic thinkers and schools of thought. &quot;The Worldly Philosophers&quot; by Robert Heilbronner is a good place to start. Then to understand where Economics has shifted to, learn about Ludwig von Mises, F.A. Hayek, Milton Friedman.

Just think of barter exchange  at low  income families.  Fro them knowledge of  micro or macro economics is of no value.  <br><br>The next level may involve  people  responsible for keeping up their family, or their  local family business,  which is still on the  thrershold of  the micro -economics, with still less   care to   least  costs and  efficiency, because they  are also contradicting  and  have negative effects on quality. <br><br>Higher  levels may  help in gaining insight into micro economics, wtih some aspects to macro-economics, bu t again with  keeping  with the proverb, less is often more.

It just seems like it because as Americans we are surrounded by a culture of individualism. There is also the possibility of public transport. If there is a demand, there can be another kind of supply as long as it fills the needs of the people. Community is exactly what we need. People complain that with social media we are getting away from the norms of social interaction. Well, why not approach this problem? We can promote ideals that are important in everything. There is no escaping propaganda in the modern world. We should approach the issue by promoting a culture of intellectualism instead of anti-intellectualism. What is misinformation? How does it work? Well, you see it, so you are likely to remember it and rely on it. People often forget to question where information comes from, and they deem it unnecessary because &quot;I found it&quot; by hearing it professed. There is so much in the world that sounds crazy or hard to believe anyways. That&#39;s not good to do though. We should seek truth. We should seek to promote sharing among the communities. This includes the people that we don&#39;t like to hear from. Everyone can learn from one another. Isaac Newton couldn&#39;t have stood on the shoulders of giants without community. There are other people in the world. We should see to it that the information that gets shared and reproduced is from real experts. Experts can disagree too, but that&#39;s not about whether something like evolution is real. They argue about the finer details of things. What gives that person the right to be called an expert? It is related to the years that they put into understanding the topic at hand. It isn&#39;t exactly that though. It relates to how well their view stands up when they argue with other experienced individuals on the topic. Hopefully these others have differing views. Can they provide valid reasons for their beliefs? Can their reasons, their premises, be shown to most likely be true given the current standards of the community? There we are. It&#39;s all about community. Economics is too. The broad &quot;consumer&quot; is a grouping of all the people who could potentially be a customer. In economics, it is you versus the world. You might as well help it to all work together instead of isolating yourself and pretending other people don&#39;t exist. If you want money, you have to deal with other people. Don&#39;t want money? Well, I suppose you can become a hermit. That&#39;s still possible here in our world for now.

Kudos to Mr. Green and my best wishes to him - I have indeed started using the phrase - &quot;Best Wishes&quot; in all of my email communications to everybody. After watching this video, I started to think about - &quot;Donations to Organisations&quot; and its impact on the economic system - not in terms of good or bad, but the general views on it such as - whose responsibility it is when it is about the welfare of the society; flow of money within the society from economic perspective, not from moral perspective. Ideally, if we think of &#39;Trade&#39; as an economic activity then how does  &quot;Donations to Organisations&quot; fit into the scheme of this notion of &#39;Trade&#39;? I think &#39;Trade&#39; and &#39;Donations to Organisations&#39; are two contradicting entities, but yet essential aspects of economics. I also think that &#39;Donations to Organisations&#39; is an act to keep a check on the inflation in some ways - take some portion of fruits of efforts/service of ones to be given/shared to/with others without any expectations in return. P.S. I will read only those comments which are answered in reply to this comment for answers or inputs or thoughts.

I&#39;m an economist in academia and I appreciate the accessibility that your videos bring. Being a bit of a nerd I listen to quite a bit of economics. The private sector comment about the computer is grossly inaccurate and misleading. Mariana Mazzacuto in the Entrepreneurial State outlines that almost every disruptive technology comes from public funding or public agencies. These technologies include the internet, GPS, touchscreen (if your using an iPad), microchip, Siri, funding for the Google algorithm, and the sat\u00e9lite. Non computer related public funded tech includes ion-lithium battery (electric car), GPS, over 50% of new molecules used in pharmaceuticals (no me2 drugs), and virtually all vaccines. There is virtually no evidence that the profit motive and competition lead to creativity, and there several studies that conclude the profit motive decreases intrinsic motivation, leads to less collaboration, and narrows focus. The Ted Talks by Daniel Pink on motivation discusses a social experiments carried out by the London School of Economics, US government, and Indian academic institutions all the same experiment which gives a monied incentive in some cases and no financial incentive in others. In all cases in all cultures, the more incentived the worse the outcome. The Harvard Business Review has published extensively about the misnomer of &quot;capitalism leading to your laptop&quot; or creativity. The manufacturing and distribution is a better argument, however the way it is framed and the example chosen being a disruptive technology gives the assumption that the profit motive competition brought us the internet and the computer and that is flat unequivocaly incorrect. <a href=\"https://hbr.org/1998/09/how-to-kill-creativity\">https://hbr.org/1998/09/how-to-kill-creativity</a><br><a href=\"https://hbr.org/1993/09/why-incentive-plans-cannot-work\">https://hbr.org/1993/09/why-incentive-plans-cannot-work</a><br><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-case-against-long-term-incentive-plans\">https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-case-against-long-term-incentive-plans</a><br><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/11/people-dont-need-a-profit-motive-to-innovate\">https://hbr.org/2011/11/people-dont-need-a-profit-motive-to-innovate</a><br><a href=\"http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1112.pdf\">http://cep.lse.ac.uk/pubs/download/dp1112.pdf</a><br>And Dr. Mariana Mazzacuto&#39;s The Entrepreneurial State Thank you for what you do, however in your position in education, and reaching such a large audience we need accuracy and nuance.

We spend more than the next several countries on military. That&#39;s true, but that&#39;s not the whole picture. We spend more because we are a larger world power and we are more wealthy than most countries. If you look at it in terms of percentage of spending, we only spend 3-4% of our GDP and military spending only accounts for less than 16% of our total federal spending. Of course, we could still spend less. We can use our military more efficiently and effectively. Higher technological innovation means we are also able to do more with less. However, I would first like to get rid of so many other expenditures that are no legitimate roles of government in the first place. I believe the only legitimate role of government is in protecting the people&#39;s rights to their own person and property. You are not allowed to murder, rape, steal, commit fraud, or otherwise infringe on another individual&#39;s rights to their own person/property. Government protects against such infringements of our rights through law enforcement, a justice system, and a military. Everything else should be left to the people to decide for themselves. Remove all illegitimate government spending, use the extra tax revenue to pay off the national debt, eliminate all federal taxes, replace them with a single flat consumption tax that would be simple and fair to all (with some exemptions on basic staple food items), and then I&#39;ll be happy to also downsize the military. Already, I don&#39;t believe we should be in any nation that we are not currently at war with. We spend over $150 billion/year on foreign bases.

It is defined as counterfeiting because the supreme law of the land states that only congress can coin money (read that to mean in today&#39;s world, manage the creation of money). But more than 90% of our money is ledger/digital and ledger/digital money is not legal tender.<br><br>Through the centuries, banks have captured the media, the schools, the government, the courts, and the economic profession to inhibit the plain truth by diverting the issue and complicating it so as to prevent their counterfeiting activities from becoming household knowledge. President Andrew Jackson considered banking as a many headed hydra-monster with tentacles reaching into many aspects of society. At the time, bankster Nicholas Biddle was bribing politicians such as senator Daniel Webster, who is recorded as demanding his retainer from said bankster. In retaliation to Andrew Jackson&#39;s advocating an end to the central bank&#39;s charter, Nicholas Biddle hit hard and caused a recession using the classic age old credit scheme of superfluous easy counterfeit credit money followed by a money contraction. Today, the courts, scholars and intelligentsia are pacified by counter explanations such as fractional reserve lending and the velocity of money. But let us be very clear about it, this is merely to hide the counterfeiting.<br><br>During the early part of the 20th century we have insider banksters, their agents, and a senator colluding in extreme secrecy to write a bill to create what has been destroyed twice before, a third central bank of the United States. The bank was to manage the nations money supply in secrecy. The idea that money could be manage in secrecy for the public&#39;s interest is an insult to every thinking American. JP morgan et al, studied the idea of controlling the newspapers, and in March of 1915, bought 27 of the top newspapers and place their own editors. The public, now handicapped by misinformation, voted irresponsibly.<br><br>To the uninformed, the ECONOMY appears to be a series of coincidental events. When something catastrophic occurs in the economy, the media addresses it as though it was unforeseen. They make great efforts to avoid letting the cat out of the bag. The media mentions the national debt but it never direct its attention as to who is buying the savings bonds and with what money? They don\u2019t address the fact that our money does not need to be created as a result of credit and therefore those savings bonds are entirely unnecessary. In this way the public is always in the dark when catastrophic economic events take place. But quite simply these recessions and depressions, are in the insider bank&#39;s agenda using counterfeiting schemes to transfer real wealth from the public to their control. In short, they are trading commercial machinery, businesses, houses for computer money created out of nothing, and the courts are at their disposal.<br><br>The end result is fiefdom, where they own the corporations and the homes we live in and we pay mortgage for most of our lives. We are going to be buried in debt, nationally and personally. Now you can look the other way and ignore the problem. You could keep voting in the Clintons and Bushes and Obamas, plenty of those guys around.

Look to the U.K. and how Thatcher came to power. Conservatives hated her for ATTEMPTING a free market as it meant the state (the aristocracy) would loose control over its wealth and assets (British Rail, and various state entities) by privilege, in favour of competition by motive and not guarantee. Conservative meant that the collective wealth of the U.K. and its people should be in the control of the privileged and historically acquainted of the monarchy. Liberal, on the other hand meant that one (like Thatcher - even though she said she was &quot;Conservative&quot;) was in support of a free-market where anyone INDIVIDUAL (anti-collective) could control and access wealth through a level-playing-field free of privileged and historic right. In the early United States, a liberal would have been said to want a free-market and individual ownership well a conservative would support the system of lord and tenant, and constitute control over the ownership and means of production. Also, look at the base definitions of each word. To be liberal means to - put simply - be tolerant of others and thus are willing to partake in economic activity with them (such as corporation or trade). To be CONSERVative, is to generally be protectionist of that in which has value. Thus a Conservative is less likely to partake in an economic activity (or risk - hence a Conservative portfolio v. High-risk portfolio) or cooperative activity such as a business. Once more, look back to the uses of the words &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot;. One will find that before WWII and back before the 1800&#39;s mainly, conservative and liberal were opposite as to the common reversal we most often hear today. Finally, as one looks into economic history, the state was often the Conservative entity, well the Liberal was the businessman (once more, just like in the U.K.).", "comment_date": "2015-07-14T03:38:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rejean Rivard", "comment_text": "In Canada on our CBC there is a SHOW called Market Place :^", "comment_date": "2015-07-14T03:28:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zaltrhiz", "comment_text": "oh the starting of a new course on crash course.", "comment_date": "2015-07-14T01:18:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alumx", "comment_text": "I feel overwhelmed .-.<br>its like this entire episode was a result of caffeine induced overdose", "comment_date": "2015-07-14T01:13:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ceegers", "comment_text": "Seems like it&#39;s gonna be a great course!", "comment_date": "2015-07-14T00:55:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valdas House", "comment_text": "&quot;... and man.&quot; &quot;and woman.&quot; what? feminism is strong with this.", "comment_date": "2015-07-14T00:41:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Abdallah", "comment_text": "YES YES YES YES YES YES YES!", "comment_date": "2015-07-14T00:34:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zerx", "comment_text": "Where are the green bros? :&#39;(", "comment_date": "2015-07-13T23:03:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ComputerCat777", "comment_text": " They cut up my name in the donor list.

In fact, it would be great if they did this instead of adopting an ideological economic theory or perspective: libertarian, neo-liberal, communist, free market\u00a0or otherwise. \u00a0Surely a far better basis for economics the world over is to base economics on the best quality evidence available as to how humans and societies act in reality rather than following some antiquated economic ideology or dogma, before promptly yelling &quot;fascist republican&quot; or &quot;commie liberal&quot; at each other ..?<br><br>For a start, I hope they debunk the myth surrounding the concept of opportunity cost as they seem to construct the term here <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ez10ADR_gM&amp;t=3m39s\">3:39</a>.<br>&quot;Opportunity Cost - if you are still watching this video, it means you believe it is the best us of your time or you wouldn&#39;t be watching it.&quot;<br>Do people really act in a way that they feel is the best use of their time? The data that has emerged since the era of Reganomics would suggest we pay attention to a whole host of irrational factors in making such &quot;decisions&quot;. \u00a0Is that a sound basis to declare that I made a &quot;decision&quot; to watch this video based upon what I felt was the best use of my time? I am not sure the evidence supports that view of economics.<br><br>On a similar note, should this video not be revised with acknowledgement to the third most important assumption of &quot;modern&quot; economics (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ez10ADR_gM&amp;t=4m24s\">4:24</a>): that people are rational actors? I see little to no evidence showing me that they necessarily are, especially in the face of complex or unexpected circumstances. \u00a0<br><br>The problem with such theories, concepts and assumptions is just that - they are theories, concepts and assumptions. \u00a0Without data or evidence to act as a basis, such theories, concepts or assumptions are not simply &quot;flawed&quot; but fundamentally, and often irrevocably flawed. \u00a0We risk making evidence to fit economic policy, rather than fitting economic policy to evidence.<br><br>Of course, at this moment in time it would be unfair and premature to make any assumption over <i>what</i> exactly will be covered over during this CrashCourse, let alone <i>how</i> it will be covered. Personally I am eagerly looking forward to a thrill-packed 40+(?) weeks (then again, I&#39;m a bit of a nerd, but damn it if I am not proud of it). Still, without data or evidence to provide a basis or platform from which to examine such theories, concepts or assumptions, the temptation for me as a viewer will be, if not to mistrust such suppositions, then to assume the view of Hume and say &quot; to the flames&quot; (or at least, head back to the CrashCourse drawing board).", "comment_date": "2015-07-12T14:38:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "whiplashstrike", "comment_text": "Economic ones are great..Good job!!Please do more of these tutorials", "comment_date": "2015-07-12T12:37:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rafi Bdg", "comment_text": "I cannot wait to see more of this :)<br>The two host seems really fun and nice !

I live in the most socialist country of them all (Norway) and I can tell you, it is way more free market than you&#39;d think.

Quit your job and start a cooperative, and only shop at cooperatives, that ought to be our goal, in my humble opinion.

For the people complaining about their inclusion of the word &quot;woman&quot; while quoting the economist, saying that they&#39;re trying to make a point of sexism without there being any, I think it&#39;s important to acknowledge that those arguing that &quot;man&quot; refers to all people seem to be mainly men. It may SEEM like the two in the video are trying to make a point, but as a woman, it&#39;s astonishing when you realize just how pervasive such terms in history have (mostly unknowingly) shaped the world view of those who use the language. Terms like &quot;history,&quot; &quot;mankind,&quot; and &quot;man&quot; were part of my vocabulary to address all people before I ever stopped to notice their wide-reaching and alienating effects. As a woman, even I am surprised by how strange it is to hear &quot;she&quot; being used as a pronoun to represent all people, yet &quot;he&quot; sounds normal. This is not a natural result of biology but a nuanced result of millennia of male-centric texts which reflect the biases of their time. I still think it would have been more useful to change &quot;man&quot; to &quot;people&quot; to avoid this whole debate, but please try to empathize with the need for inclusion of women in discussion of all people. It&#39;s not that difficult. <br><br>2.) Any person who lives in a capitalist society and spends their money on goods generated by such a society is in fact supporting capitalism, however much you would like to admit it or not. The fact of the matter is even though you may not agree with it (and I definitely can&#39;t say capitalism in its current state is ideal) every dollar you give to companies who hold it as their model is exactly the reason they can remain profitable. Most of the time, the aggressive tactics used by such companies do not allow for any other option, and I&#39;m sure this is something they will address in the future, so try not to be too hasty. <br><br>3.)
