During the first battle of Narva Russian army was betrayed by its foreign officers: there were just not enough literate Russian nobles, so a lot of English, Scottish, Polish and even Swedish mercenaries were recruited.<br>2. Russian recruits in many cases couldn&#39;t tell left and right apart, so drill instructors had to strap hay and straw to their boots. Instead of &quot;Left, right, left, right...&quot; They marched like &quot;hay, straw, hay, straw!&quot;<br>3. When Peter found out his closest friend count Menshikov stole state money instead of buying new uniforms, he beat him with his own fists during diplomatic negotiations. And he was considered lucky as other corrupted officials were hanged for such crimes.<br>4. Saint Petersburg people had to pay their taxes in stones for some time in order to pave the roads of the city. So many peasants died during it&#39;s first years it was said to be standing &quot;on bones&quot;.<br>5. After the defeat of Narva Russia lost almost all of its artillery and there was not enough copper to make new guns. Peter ordered to take church bells off and melt them. Church declared him new Antichrist and it was said icons were bleeding cause our tsar isnt a good Christian. Peter literally said &quot;well, if icons won&#39;t stop to bleed soon, clergymen will have their asses bleed too!&quot;... And then icons suddenly stopped. As you can say, he was very different from all the previous tsars.<br>6. Oh, by the way: Peter was a godfather of Abraham Hannibal, quite possibly the first negro man to become an orthodox christian and Russian nobleman. He made an inpressive career as a military engineer and was awarded for bravery. Most importantly though, he was a grandfather of Alexander Pushkin, a founder of Russian literature and poetry. That&#39;s right: he had African ancestry, was a poet and even died by a gunshot wound!
