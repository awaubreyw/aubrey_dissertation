There is a lot of sub-text and innuendo in your videos - to the point it is fairly obvious (to me) what some of your political beliefs may be.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair and makes me profoundly sad.  Unfortunately, you are part of my son&#39;s curriculum.  I have to spend days transcribing your videos, taking out all of the opinions to just get to the facts that I know will be on his quizzes.  Why are teachers doing this?  Teach all sides, good, bad and the ugly without personal reflections.  If you feel the need to personally reflect on something that is important to you, do it - but make sure you also present any opposing views.  Obviously, this is only for political opinions - we all agree slavery is a very bad institution.  \r<br>What got my attention?  You said three things that were bias and influencing the subconscious of students to your personal views:<br>1)You mentioned Republicans at the time of Grant&#39;s election said, &quot;Man, we would sure win more elections if black people could vote&quot;  - then followed up with the comment - &quot;which is something you hear Republicans say all the time these days.&quot; - what did you mean by this?  To me, knowing what I know about the mainstream belief about modern Republicans, I interpret this as sarcastic - because the mainstream belief is that Republicans want to disenfranchise the black vote.  If this is your meaning, shame on you.  It is not the truth - it&#39;s a lie.  Personally, my family and I have sacrificed to protect the ideas of a government by the people, for the people - a family lineage of total commitment to this philosophy.  Why would we want to keep anyone from their right to vote?  It&#39;s absurd.  In the military, soldiers are taught, day one, that everyone bleeds red.  Sure, you will find pockets of racism and people who want to suppress votes - but it is not a collective mindset of the modern and historical Republican Party - quite the opposite.  Nothing would please me more to see a tremendous amount of healing for the black community which seems to be in so much pain.  It all breaks my heart.  I intend to be a part of the solution - your videos, at times are divisive. They do not paint a full picture of the political climate of America and are therefore not part of the solution.  Your bias is showing - please stop.<br>2) &quot;That is why Republicans dominated the south&quot; (because Republicans were part of the process of liberation) &quot;just like today - except totally different&quot; - what is wrong with you?  seriously - this is BS - you are infecting the minds of our youth.<br>3) &quot;Sadly we have an electoral college in the US&quot; ... some of us think it&#39;s a great thing - look at the colors of the districts after an election - for any student that made it this far - look at the US map colors of the districts of the voting map - and ask yourself - is it really fair to have a major part of the country not represented fairly?  population alone would mean the urban highly populated areas would rule the country where the rural areas that by their nature of farming - needs more area - less densely populated - would not have an equal footing on a national level.

Your name.   Your age. Gender. Where you live.  And citizenship status. We can make it free. Hell we give out welfare like candy. It&#39;s not difficult. <br><br>But you have Democrats like &quot;it&#39;s racist to ask for IDs. whites will be able to get in with just a crude crayon drawing of their face and minorities can have 10 forms of IDs and be rejected&quot; or &quot;minorities are too poor to get any form of IDs.&quot; And I am here as a Republican like &quot;it&#39;s not the Democrat Jim crow laws days.  It be a standard photo ID which can be made free. And not all minorities are helpless people, in fact they can take care of themselves and don&#39;t need government to coddle them&quot; which then the Democrats will start over again calling me racist. <br><br>I am going to say this once.  Being against affirmative action. Dividing scholarships based on race. Believe minorities college sat/act score should be lower than whites.  Welfare.  Food stamps. And you should have for when voting having your voters card and some form of photo identification  does not mean that you are a racist or sexist person.  It means you think they are as equal to you and we all should be held to the same standard. And don&#39;t need help getting a job or get into college or whatever. They can do it on their own without help and can succeed.&quot;<br><br>Also who gave the stereotype that blacks are hood rats and gangsters and only true goal in life is rapping?  Hollywood and what political spectrum is Hollywood.  Democrat. A majority of Hollywood movies with minorities place them as some hoodrat or gangster or thug. That&#39;s Hollywood.  Even if they show a rich minority person he is stereotypical of that race which Hollywood makes worse.  <br><br>The moment we realize that being a hood rat. Gangster or want-a-be rapper is really bad thing and stop allowing Hollywood pumping out racist and stereotypical portals of minorities.  Take the best people for the job no matter what the race or background and doesn&#39;t need to be told to hire someone.  I rather have a room full of blacks or whites or asains who know their job and does it well than have a spectrum of races who all are not the best at their jobs. <br><br>Literally political correctness is killing the world.
