Her fame was well spread as far as France and England by the 13th century. Being a rough ensemble of texts without much appreciated identification, Trotula was reworked in new editions including by people centuries later who didn&#39;t know they were initially three different texts and some confusion led to even mislabeling its date from medieval to ancient. The first text only mentions male sources: Hippocrates, Oribasius, Dioscorides, Paulus, and Justinus. The second text is the only one of the three that mostly overlaps another known paper which bores an author name: Trota of Salerno, which immediately led to the name Trotula, &#39;little work of Trota&#39;. The 2nd text itself didn&#39;t have Trota&#39;s name though, and was apparently a modified copy by another autor. The ensemble spread out of Italy and more confusion ensued as now people started assuming the name of the author was literally Trotula, an ancient sounding name, who wrote all texts. In the third text the author refers to himself with a masculine pronoun and he credits specific practices to Muslim women. Due to a progressive and accumulated lack of knowledge and confusion, as new editions tried to fit assumptions for consistency, the author or authors were in practice given as unknown before Modern times. Then in the 1970s, second-wave feminism rediscovered Trotula and started propagating the conspiracy of Trota being &quot;systematically written out of history&quot;. This conspiracy is of course taken to be beneficial to justify the socialist agenda the Green Brothers make sure to push here without you noticing it.

To answer Hank&#39;s question about what a medieval person would think of medicine, it would NOT be what a book told you. The medical practices discussed in this episode concerned the academic world and the wealthy. What about the medicine of the poor or of indigenous people?<br><br>Most of the world&#39;s medical wisdom was systematically destroyed through globalization over the last few centuries. This isn&#39;t a political rant, but just a fact of colonialism and global market systems. As land was taken from the poor and from indigenous cultures and they were left to starve or simply killed off, they took their unwritten knowledge with them. The witch trials were explicitly destroying traditional medical practices, usually passed down orally by women. This created a space for new markets to occupy just as purging the people of the Americas created space for new settlements.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t until the start of the 21st century that medicine started turning back to surviving indigenous cultures for help in finding new treatments. Some of this knowledge has been preserved and is used by established medical facilities today, while some if deemed ineffective, or worse, unprofitable. Most of this knowledge comes bundled with religious and cultural practices as well, which makes then tricky to work with.<br><br>Now I don&#39;t expect Crash Course to cover much of this content because there&#39;s not a lot we know about the medical practices of the majority of the human race (outside of those who had scribes and scholars), but it&#39;s definitely worth noting as an aside that most historical medical practices have been lost due to the violence committed against its practitioners. Medical technologies of the past may have been far more sophisticated than we&#39;ll ever know. This probably represents the single greatest loss of knowledge in human history and it&#39;s a shame that nothing was said about it in this episode.<br><br>Now that I&#39;m done with that, I want to say again, that this episode was still really good.

They also had extremely complex encyclopedias of plants and kept horticultural gardens to stock for this reason as well as just recreational, decorative botanical gardens such as in the imperial palace of Texcoco, one of the 3 ruling cities of the Aztec empire. <br><br>Cortes himself said in a letter to Charles V to not to bother to send doctors over, as the Aztec ones were far better, and Aztec horticultural and botanical texts were later adapted by Europeans and influenced later texts of the same nature and by taxonomists during the scientific revolution. They (most Mesoamerican cultures, really, but especially the Nahuas, who composed most of the core Aztec cities) were also OBSESSED with sanitation and cleanliness: Even commoners bathed using steam baths and the roots of plants as soap multiple times a week; in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, there were a fleet of civil servants that swept streets, washed buildings, and collected waste daily. Dual channel aqueducts were used to bring fresh water into the city, with one pipee being turned off and cleaned while the other was active, and multiple dikes were built across the lake it and other core cities were built on to keep fresh water on one side and the brackish water of the lake on the other, away from Tenochtitlan. <br><br>Gardens with flowers and other sweet smelling plants were located in communal public spaces and in noble homes to stave off smells, and feces collected by the civil servants were used as fertilizer, while urine was handled by the city&#39;s sewage system. Earlier cities in the region, such as Palenque and Teotihuacan (which, like Tenochtitlan, would have been in the top 5 largest cities in the world during their heydays, with Teotihuacan having a population of 100k to 150k and covering 60 square kilometers around 400ad, and Tenochtitlan having a population of 200k to 250k as of 1519, on par with Paris and Constantinople at the time, the largest cities in europe), both of which pre-date the Aztecs by 1000 years, also had flush toilets and sewage and other waterworks systems.<br><br>There&#39;s a great, easy to understand free tto download paper called &quot;Public health in Aztec society&quot; that goes over this, if anybody wants to read about it.", "comment_date": "2018-06-04T22:00:24Z", "likes_count": 251}}}, {"iGiZXQVGpbY": {"Ancient & Medieval Medicine: Crash Course History of Science #9": {"channel_id": "UgxaA71ImhhFQJZl3sZ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "bobcat1", "comment_text": "I appreciate you slowing down the speed at which you talk hank, I&#39;m able to enjoy your narration thoroughly now :)", "comment_date": "2018-06-04T21:55:26Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"iGiZXQVGpbY": {"Ancient & Medieval Medicine: Crash Course History of Science #9": {"channel_id": "UgymNSTjL01DuU1141x4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Camilo Iribarren", "comment_text": "Different pieces of knowledge to explain medicine.
