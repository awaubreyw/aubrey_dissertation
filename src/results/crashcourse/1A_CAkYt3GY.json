A lot of it can be introspective and deals with questions as to the ideal society and the motivations of people and why they do things. Whilst I like philosophy there exists a caveat within it for me as a central issue:<br>Namely, Philosophy can encourage apathy as regards too much thinking and not doing, or not putting ones thoughts into a physical manifestation in the real world, this is of course where philosophy can encounter the realms of politics, economics and sociology. But I find for my own introspective analysis that philosophers as a whole tend to to be sterotypically disconnected with real world issues and more focused on spouting platitudes and stoking their own egos. An idea is nothing if not acted upon, Plato took no action to create his republic of ideal guardians, Machiavelli espoused his theories but did not connive and manipulate to put them into effect, Locke took his notions of a liberal or liberated society of freedom but did he campaign for it, did he issue speeches or create a movement or cause to do so? One may of course retort that he practised it by allowing others to do as they do, to which I say the ideal or idea not put into affect is nothing, and less than nothing it detracts. I may have the idea of making a sandwich to appease my hunger, but without the inclination or will to do so i shall remain hungry.<br>Buddha drew an interesting parallel here when he described a person shot by a poisoned arrow, he states that the man could enquire from whence direction the arrow came, where it was made, what it was made from, who shot the arrow, what is the poison etc etc, but only by dealing with the arrow, i.e. by acting upon it can he affect his life. Thus whilst I admire philosophy and love it myself, I find that most take no action from it, worse they may become armchair philsophers, worse still they may stoke their own egos and platitudes and lastly they may, surrounded only by followers lose touch of the real world they once tried to understand. Wisdom can therefore be a snare, for it is not a conclusion that is important, indeed only dead fish swim with the stream but the evermore exploration and continuance  of the journey, once one reaches a definite conclusion and no longer takes an action, is it not that he/she is indistinguishable from the corpses of those laid to rest in previous generations? he/she that states that they now know truth are thus now nobody, for they have stopped action, thus it is that to know, or truly know is to know that you know nothing and thus one lives by continuing on the journey of trying to understand. Philsophy is therefore a journey, for which the action of walking that path IS the aim, the quaint phrase: It is not the destination but the journey that matters springs to mind.<br>Ugh....you now have me getting philosophical...ah well, here&#39;s to more understanding and more wisdom.

Only an ultraperfectionist can possibly make life beautiful in all the perfectness of life, perfectionists tend to have a cheap arse life, but all this is worth it, if my life is perfect then that means I have a good life, whereas if my life is philosophical I have a good life.

One can be one side supported, and the other can be both side supported, one can be Un-administrative, illegal, atheistic, truth with sin, and, the other can be administrative, legal, theistic, truth without sin. And truth with sin might always have pain in it, and which can not be there in truth without sin, in philosophy.<br><br>But, I also think, science - truth with sin - can be of two types - when the sin will be done with &#39;need&#39; intention, then the sin might be called as &#39;truth&#39;, and when the sin will be done with &#39;pleasure&#39; intention, then the sin might be called as &#39;sin&#39;. Right in one way, and wrong in other way, depending upon the intention. And many might gets confused in this that whether a thing is right or wrong like in case of non-vegetarian foods. And, it may also be that if a thing is Legal, then it might be correct only, truth, positive, good, etc, and might not be sin. So easy to get - of whether a thing is correct or not by checking whether a thing is Legal or not.

Note that many philosophers also like to hide in history in order to avoid addressing ongoing issues themselves, as well as engage in fruitless lexicon games (where a simple agreement on definitions is needed), or immerse themselves in applied (lower) philosophies (such as the video&#39;s &#39;golf&#39;) (or business or economics or politics, to present a few more serious examples), spinning their wheels in a subjective haze... <br><br>Interesting that the video brings up &#39;science&#39;, but it is wrong in saying that science is not the venue for answering such questions - it is - in a deconstructive sense - although it does need guidance (which it gets from philosophy) (which in turn is affected by verified knowledge) (which is obtained through science). You could say that science has the fuel to continue (&quot;I want to save the world!&quot; &quot;I want to discover new things!&quot; &quot;I want to improve life!&quot;), but it does not have a guidance system (hence it is still easily commandeered by evil). There is one question that science will never address (although it does have input): the Greatest of the Great Questions of Life: &quot;Why Bother?&quot; (for, you must admit, you need to answer that even before you turn to any of the other Great Questions of Life, because... why bother?).<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=1m18s\">1:18</a> does describe the difference between science (describe) and philosophy (evaluate), but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=1m21s\">1:21</a> right after that returns to muddleness. &quot;Taking nothing as a given&quot; is the venue of science, and &quot;setting assumptions aside&quot; displays a misunderstanding of what we need to think and progress (assumptions, generalizations, and classifications are necessary tools for perceiving and judging - necessary for decision making, our only task is to refine them).<br><br> The video asks, &quot;What is philosophy?&quot; ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=2m03s\">2:03</a> ) and my guess is it will delve into the history of philosophy (what philosophy &#39;was&#39;) (it &#39;was&#39; science - but the wrong approach - trying to divine reality by sitting around thinking), which is no longer what philosophy &#39;is&#39;. The answer to what philosophy is right now is it is a political, academically self-serving, muddled subjective mess - in fact Stephen Hawking noted that &quot;Philosophy is Dead&quot; (meaning it currently contributes nothing of import to the world). Well, it isn&#39;t &#39;dead&#39; - I found it - in the toilet. (thanks, 20th Century).<br><br>And the video will probably miss the point as to what philosophy actually gives us, and it will not recognize that EVERYONE already has a philosophy - the problem is that they are horrible hodge-podges of trite platitudes that only masquerade as philosophy (all this according to me, by the way). Everyone has one because they would not be able to make any decisions (higher than animal) without one - it is what you weigh such decisions (and you resultant actions) against.<br><br>The video immediately gets off on the wrong foot ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=2m05s\">2:05</a> ) noting that philosophy is an opinion you may have toward a certain topic (the example given being &#39;golf&#39;). That is not &#39;philosophy&#39; proper, that is &#39;applied philosophy&#39;, which is classified as a lower sub-form (by me) - meaning you cannot guide your lives by them - they are not overall life-guiding philosophies (such as my philosophy of broader survival for the space age) - they are, in fact (according to me) ongoing symptoms of universal human cluelessness (trying to get through life without an adequate life-guiding philosophy (and there are none yet) (and religions have failed) (enter me).<br><br>Curiously (noting what I&#39;ve given you above), the video says it will address philosophy even more narrowly than the philosophy of golf (meaning the video&#39;s writer doesn&#39;t have a clue).<br><br>&quot;Philos and Mythos&quot; ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=2m34s\">2:34</a> ) - nice. Give some credit to the ancient Greeks - noble attempts at elevating the defective mindsets of their time (much like I am doing).<br><br>Saying that &quot;science is about answers, and philosophy is about questions&quot; is misleading - science begins with questions (although not the BIG questions, and certainly not the biggest of all: &quot;Why Bother?&quot;) (which the video will surely miss, since it is my discovery, and the word is not out there yet).<br><br>The video then attempts to give a few of the BIG questions, erroneously beginning with &quot;What is the world like?&quot; (which has been passed on to science). Ditto for &quot;What is the nature of reality?&quot; So the video is still stuck in the ancient past - that is, merely speculating about reality, and not really going out and testing it. Today, philosophy is where we get our values (including the Ultimate Value of Life - which I&#39;ve discovered and have given you in my philosophy, thank you very much, now go read it).<br><br>Metaphysics ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=4m27s\">4:27</a> ) needs a new definition, and I will supply it: &quot;Metaphysics is that branch of faulty thinking where people erroneously believe their speculations to be true (for whatever reason - and it could be knavish).&quot; <br><br>Epistimology ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=4m46s\">4:46</a> ) &quot;Is what we know true?&quot; also needs an answer, and I will supply that, too: &quot;The only useful knowledge is Verified Knowledge, and &#39;verified&#39; can be to different degrees, meaning our knowledge becomes a mere model of reality - good for forming assumptions, generalizations, and classifications. So the question becomes, &quot;What is the degree of knowledge, or perspective gained (or mental/mathematical model of reality) good enough for?&quot; If it is good enough for engineering (such as building a reliable bridge), then it is good enough for engineering, but perhaps it is still not good enough for securing higher consciousness in a harsh and deadly universe... As for those philosophers who deny reality, my response to them is, &quot;Reality is that which will annihilate you, whether you acknowledge it or not.&quot;<br><br>The video then addresses Value Theory ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=5m38s\">5:38</a> ), dividing it into Ethics, or &quot;Good vs. Evil&quot;, and &quot;Beauty&quot;. Beauty (aesthetics) does not belong with ethics, however (according to me), it is a lower psychological issue (science) (both of which are currently messed up due to cluelessness). <br><br>Sad that the video&#39;s writer did not realize  that any &#39;value&#39; automatically comes with an associated &#39;goal&#39; (to secure that value), which is what actually determines good and evil (they are goal-driven), and, ultimately, what is &#39;beautiful&#39; (and why), and it answers &quot;How should I live?&quot; ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=6m08s\">6:08</a> ), as well as answering <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=6m16s\">6:16</a> (what obligations should you have toward other people, animals, and the earth). Just to note, on &#39;beauty&#39;, it has been found that the &#39;most beautiful&#39; is merely the &#39;most average&#39; (as a recent study on human faces indicated) (but this may only hold in a clueless world - for I have found that true beauty is held in dynamics (action), and not in statics (posing) (and it is why humans are still posers - they don&#39;t know any better).<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=6m22s\">6:22</a> demonstrates continued universal human cluelessness, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=6m27s\">6:27</a> is on the right track (good and evil are determined by values), but it is still hazy (clueless) - because it is not by values directly, but the associate goal (and the video&#39;s use of &quot;value&#39;s&quot; in the plural also illustrates ongoing universal human cluelessness - otherwise it would have recognized the existence of an Ultimate Value for Life (which would give us an associated Ultimate Goal, which would give us the &#39;ultimate&#39; determination toward good and evil - an ability that humans, being clueless, still do not possess)...<br><br>Logic ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=7m07s\">7:07</a> ) is an interesting aspect of philosophy - both inductive and deductive reasoning (just to mention those - since the video did not - maybe they cover it in their next video on philosophy). The video does make a finer error - &#39;logic&#39; is not the tools in the toolbox, it creates the tools (which are assumptions, generalizations, and classifications, which give us &#39;perspective&#39; - which is the real tool - and the more perspectives we have in our toolbox, the better equipped we will be when peering into the unknown).<br><br>At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=7m46s\">7:46</a> the video is right in saying &quot;you have already done philosophy&quot;, but it is off the mark in explaining it - it is not &quot;your thinking about the world and your place in it&quot;, nor is it figuring out what you value - it is your weighing your decisions (higher than those of an animal) against your Ultimate Value in Life (which, sorry to say, is not what it should be) (your still being clueless).<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1A_CAkYt3GY&amp;t=8m05s\">8:05</a> is a healthy approach (try to understand a philosophical view, and then test its worth) (and your own understanding, just to be fair). Sadly, most people tend to blindly dismiss any new thinking (such as mine), choosing instead to cling to their inherited deficient mental baggage, usually for social reasons.", "comment_date": "2017-10-09T09:17:40Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgzFxiuKvdRSdtN-SaJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Billy", "comment_text": "Fallacies are fun to point out to people who don&#39;t know how to think.<br><br>Especially if they don&#39;t know what a fallacy is.", "comment_date": "2017-10-09T01:35:31Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgxbykAhz1kAD-iaPV94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Ece \u015eeker", "comment_text": "this is the most beautiful and beneficial channel on youtube I have ever watched &lt;3", "comment_date": "2017-10-08T23:05:09Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgweaDd9RhzJhHPlBkd4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Thad tuiol", "comment_text": "I love your vids, but Jeez do you have to talk at 100mph?

Meaning , Philosophy  comes from our consciousness , When the people started become curious about everything in this world . We started to questioning, like What, Who , and How.  That is why religion , science , and beliefs exist because of our thoughts ,  or consciousness. If you think deeply , everything in this world like, innovation ,technology , and inventions starts with a questions , questions that originated from our thoughts , questions that may answer a problem . Without our consciousness no one will exist ,our society will not gonna move and grow . <br><br>Philosophy addresses problems and questions , that arise in all areas of human thought and experience , and in all disciplines.

The technique for that is very simple. When I&#39;m walking in the street I should begin to think in English without translating my thoughts in Russian. How can I achieve that? Well, I must start with a simple sentence like that: &quot;I want to think in English&quot;. Then, if nothing comes to my head, I must repeat the sentence. I must repeat the sentence while some other sentence will come to my head It may be something like that: &quot;I want to think in English but how can I do it? I know some words and I can connect the words to each other. What words do I know..?<br><br>2. <br>Every day I can begin with the sentence: I want to think in English. I have to imagine a way of the thinking process in which I could go in different possible directions for some minutes. Every good step that I will make will be noted as a new level in the game. For example, the first point is: I want to think in English. The second may be: everything, what I need for thinking, is time. How much time can I spend for this kind of thinking per day? It&#39;s a good question. If I want to get a good result it must be one or two hours at least. How can i organize it? How much time do I spend for the internet every day? If I could use half of this time for thinking, I would get enough.<br><br>3.<br>I want to think in English. Where would I come today? Where would I come in a month? In a year? If I think every day trying to write down the process of thinking and focusing on some issue within a month, I will be able to figure out what thinking in English is like. If I concentrate on the issue during a year, I will be able to use English in the process of thinking without efforts. What prospects does it offer? I will be able to listen to everything that I can find on the internet in English. It is the same with reading. Also I will be able to write.

The simple flaw is &quot;If all thoughts and actions are pre-determined and not made by the person, how can you claim to KNOW anything?&quot; The thing is, if there is no free will, there is no free thought, and that means that you can not claim that you KNOW what you are saying is true. Beyond that, if you believe that only the physical universe exists then how do you explain the existence of knowledge itself, or any other non-physical things such as truth, love, reason, and faith? We know through science that knowledge, truth, and other such concepts are non-physical through, so if u claim only the physical universe exists then u can not by nature have truth, knowledge or reason. And once again if these things are physical (simply neurons and chemicals ect) then there is no objective standard meaning no TRUTH. To put this in simple terms, you can not believe to know anything unless you claim the existence of free will, and a non-physical world.

For example, the question &quot;what should I do&quot; seems less poductiv than &quot;how could I be deceived in what&#39;s the right thing to do?&quot; After all, you can easily imagine two characters who follow the same ethical principle and who fiercely oppose each other.", "comment_date": "2016-10-19T02:30:11Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UginfPxJOF9O8XgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Robin HD", "comment_text": "RS gcse anyone?", "comment_date": "2016-10-18T10:56:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "Ugjd0PV9K2EG5ngCoAEC", "comment_by": "nicolas rueda", "comment_text": "Hank should teach crash course literature... at least in this series, he has a much better way of handling humanities than liberal-arts-graduate, hero-of-Tumblr, john (even though his series on world history are really good)", "comment_date": "2016-10-16T04:56:04Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "Ugi81lhyQ1q4RngCoAEC", "comment_by": "scotcheggable", "comment_text": "I used to enjoy these talks at school, I think it&#39;s good for people to form their own opinions on the world and themselves, whether they be similar or different to the majority.", "comment_date": "2016-10-15T16:38:55Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgjFaejiVSlyKXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "William Schubert", "comment_text": "do animals have souls ?", "comment_date": "2016-10-15T08:31:18Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgjN7yQgH4i_KXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Shannon Tobin", "comment_text": "MIND=BLOWN", "comment_date": "2016-10-14T20:57:17Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgjZ9MpbrYQcUXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0641\u0647 \u0635\u0627\u0644\u062d", "comment_text": "\u0644", "comment_date": "2016-10-14T19:12:48Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgiGwbl9YNa5IXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "K", "comment_text": "you guys need a crash course for theatre!", "comment_date": "2016-10-12T19:45:04Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "Uggckw7D8hmt9HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Viktoriya Kovalchuk", "comment_text": "you know that you&#39;ve majored in a field out of genuine passion when the word of the study itself means the &quot;love of&quot; something.", "comment_date": "2016-10-06T22:37:16Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "Ugi0kZ8A51g_N3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Music Lover", "comment_text": "you guys need to collaborate with Wisecrack", "comment_date": "2016-10-05T20:48:18Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "Uggnzgc7zOYTB3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Luveguru", "comment_text": "Nothing is objectively true.", "comment_date": "2016-10-05T19:57:35Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "Uggtt36RlvxQDngCoAEC", "comment_by": "sas chingi", "comment_text": "Can we have a series on political sciences dealing with major theories of politics , which I supposed you have covered in some of your lessons, but I would suggest you to stockpile those excerpts on politics with some addendums to present something substantial", "comment_date": "2016-10-04T21:09:08Z", "likes_count": 3}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgjxAW6DiCdG3XgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Alaa Al Halabi", "comment_text": "hank why are you everywhere ??", "comment_date": "2016-10-03T16:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UggI70A9Ttm3Z3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "Jerlyn Mae Reyes", "comment_text": "The sound bothers me. haha, But definitely looking forward to the course!", "comment_date": "2016-10-03T14:48:54Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgjDp1NoTscMFngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Rico Jakk", "comment_text": "Missing link, Philosophy came from black or burnt faced (Ethiopians) in Egypt and other parts of North Africa including Timbuktu in Mali...but it&#39;s hard for Eurocentric mindsets to admit black people taught their ancestors ANYTHING in history, so they would rather believe it ridiculous things like aliens built Africas pyramids :-/", "comment_date": "2016-10-03T12:47:44Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "Ugh8OaF_fLYNGHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Reed T.

It looks like its gonna be a lot of fun. <br><br>Also as a would-be professional philosopher (if that&#39;s even a thing) I have some suggestions and questions about the course.<br>I want to bring to your attention the (seemingly but not actually) new field of study: African Philosophy. I was hoping that you might include the major thinkers of both ancient and contemporary African countries, as well as those from the African Diaspora.\u00a0<br><br><br>I also want to challenge your phrasing of the origins of philosophy being in ancient Greece. <br>As much as we return to the brilliant thinkers of that era, the phrasing seems to imply that there is one center, one origin, for the vast body of scholarship we term philosophy. In our western traditions we often forget that philosophy is fundamental to all humans from all contexts, and fail to recognize the work from non-western contexts and traditions, which has the double effect of closing ourselves off to brilliant inquiry and valuable thinking, as well as perpetuating modes of thought that enable prejudicial thinking, and thus contribute to anti-African and anti-POC discourse. It may interest you to know that some of our first systems of formal logic originate from Africa, not to mention other subjects.  I will of course provide names of authors for your perusal. <br><br>I also want to challenge what seems like a privileging of analyticity. As much as we love being logical-positivists, I would encourage you to explore the problems with the ideas of reason and rationality, particularly with notions of the a priori. And I do hope you sneak in some continental thinking.<br><br>Lastly, I want to know if you peeps will be touching on any philosophy of language- a slippery field which nonetheless has major consequences for all areas of philosophical inquiry. <br><br>Sorry for long post :)<br><br>Here are some great philosophers you might not have heard of:  <br>Dr Edwin Etieyibo, <br>Kwasi Wiredu, <br>Kwame Appiah Nkruhmah, <br>Campbell S Momoh<br>Joseph I Omoregebe", "comment_date": "2016-02-12T22:19:36Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "Ugg103Y_RyjUIngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Dave W", "comment_text": "So happy  to  see this  Hank.

One of my philosophy professors once told us that, ultimately, all philosophers are directed toward answering the ultimate philosophical question: Why does anything exist at all?  I think the answer is rather obvious.  The cosmos exists because it must; that is, it is impossible for nothing to exist and, since something must exist, that something is the cosmos.  Why can&#39;t nothing exist?  The answer to that is a bit more complicated.  If nothing existed, then there would be not energy or matter.  But, without energy and matter, one can not have time and space.  Without time and space, nothing becomes nonexistent.  Of course, the next question that needs to be answered is why does our cosmos have the form it has.  Again, the answer is because it must have that and no other form.  Why?  That one I can not answer at present, but, eventually, some physicist will pop up somewhere and proclaim that the entire structure of the cosmos from the quark up through the Big Bang universe is due to only three equations, each one of which is derivable from the other two.  Like the three legs of a stool that is stable.  A sort of Scientific Trinity.  Hope he pops up soon because quantum, relativity, and string theory are starting to give everyone a headache.

If Our brains are like an Organic Super Computer, and our brain structure matches that of how the universe seems to form, Could it not then be that the universe is the original Organic super computer with processing power 10^googol compared to anything we have ever seen? Could it be that our universe is a sort of super conscious life form, and as it grows and ages, we slowly evolve?<br><br>Could it not be that humans are just one little Bactria within the body of it? If you look at humans as this you begin to pick up parallels on how we affect the world around us and how we seem to do damage, you begin to realize that we may be hostile to our own host.  But then again not all Bactria in your body is bad so could it not be that unless we change our ways we will either surpass our planet destroying it and moving on to new places and causing illness or we could run ourselves into the ground. <br><br>That is if we do not change our ways and respect not only our planet but the universe as a whole. We do not know the overall impact of what we have done to the universe as a whole or if we have done any damage at all. But it is sure that we have begun to spread. This whole philosophy makes me rethink black holes and how much (at least to me) their ideology mimics that of a virus. Sucking up and absorbing all the that is in its path. A sort of self sustaining assimilator?<br><br>Now people are going to write this off as hocus pocus, which is fare as was how I first interpreted that idea, this is due to its striking similarity to the idea of religious thoughts such as Buddhism. I understand that thought because Religion in general has been known to write off science with such bigotry and fear. But this idea allows for a sort of amalgamation of those two ideologies because this could suggest that the universe did not form on its own but was sparked into action but it would also allow for the idea of evolution, which is something that is indisputable. <br><br>It would affect how we see ourselves, how we see the grand scare of the universe and how that may just be another layer to the cake of life. It could allow us to explore and reexamine the idea of the Multiverse,  Which could relate to the idea of a Super Consciousness and the ideas of Individuality and how it is real but can sometimes be minutiae.<br><br>Does that mean that anything is real or is it just information being processed by our brains? Or is everything real and it happened because someone set caused a massive Rube Goldberg like domino effect? Now take this as nothing more then an idea, nothing is solid and nothing is sacred, Information is fluid like time. But like many ideas before it, it defies all our wildest imaginations.<br><br>\u00a0Its strange nature and obscure ideas based upon theories that are plausible is what compelled me to listen to it fully through. I am one to believed that anything can be true, as long as there is some sort of logical basis behind it. The last thing I have to say is that i know it is strange and that there will be some holes in my theory but then again there are holes in a whole lot of other theories too so I suggest the idea that it isn&#39;t as far fetched as one might believe.", "comment_date": "2016-02-10T09:51:45Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "Ugj9FUBLDJoinHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Enso", "comment_text": "FINALLY!", "comment_date": "2016-02-10T09:39:56Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgjE0bOm9M6XVHgCoAEC", "comment_by": "John Wilson", "comment_text": "Philosophy is math and logic and abstract and manor.

You are right when you hold true to that set of values, and wrong when you break with that set of values<br><br>But there is so much more to ethics than just different values theories! There are also the relativisms. Relativism in Ethics is the idea that right and wrong is always determined relative to something. Cultural relativism states that morality is relative to what your culture thinks is right. Institutional relativism(whether that institution is a religion or another organization such as the military) states that morality is determined relative to some institution. And personal relativism basically just says that everyone makes their own morality.<br><br>From there we get into Utilitarianism, which states that the right thing is whatever does the most good for the most people. And Kant ethics(developed by 18th century philosopher Immanuel Kant), which is a bit complicated to spell out in a youtube comment.<br><br>Finally there is another branch of Ethics just getting it&#39;s start(which may lead to Ethics becoming a branch of Science) which focuses less on &quot;How should we treat other people&quot; and more on &quot;How do we, as humans, determine how we should treat other people&quot;.

A dispassionate love that exists between loyal friends or family. Affectionate regard. Philosophy means something like &#39;lovers of wisdom&#39; or &#39;friends of wisdom&#39; or &#39;dispassionate lovers of wisdom&#39;. Actually just found a mention of philos in Aristotle but only as a non-standard way of writing philia to emphasise a more general concept of philia. <br><br>Actual Ancient Greek philsophy was focused on physis (nature) initially, especially the question of ousia (substance). It went on to explore the seemingly sharp division between physis (nature, the natural world, uncivilised man) and nomos (customs, laws, the ordered world of civilised man) and here we find the first true works of ethics. Plato and Aristotle considered these two questions in tandem exploring what it is to be a good man and live a good life by exploring the substance of reality and human beings. As they held radically different views on substance, they came to radically different views with ethics.

Radical Idea: instead of assuming the role of a teacher.. assume the role of a student of philosophy yourself.. and find experts in their fields who would be happy to discuss deep ideas.. to question your own beliefs.. and then we will see within that series.. how truly difficult it is for anyone to be aware of all the cognitive biases and moral failings that make us who we are.. such books as Ishmael by Daniel Quinn come to mind.. in fact.. suggested readings should accompany each video in this series.. without a fresh flow of new thought from writers with great ideas.. viewers are likely to remain stagnant in their own modes of thinking.. a kind of static friction.. an inertia that prevents any real growth in the intellect.. and further.. suggested questions should accompany the video as well.. questions that make viewers think well beyond having viewed it for the first time: If chickens had a language and were able to communicate with one another, would I be more or less likely to eat one? Or.. to remain relevant to this video: If beauty is objective and things can be said to have such beauty, then what fundamental principles make a sunset have beauty? Does a toilet have beauty only when it performs its function? Necessarily or conditionally? And if necessarily, does that imply that humans have limits as to what we can appreciate as beautiful? Is it for us to appreciate beauty or to simply accept the inevitable beauty that is life?<br><br>Chapter 3: yes.. this comment is beginning to contain its own chapters.. :p", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T23:47:14Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"1A_CAkYt3GY": {"What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1": {"channel_id": "UgiuXkTbs2JG_HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Tntiscool54", "comment_text": "hi crash course!

First we have to agree that &#39;I&#39;, as in everyone&#39;s self, are experiencing the world and are not just a p-zombie. No one can know if anyone but themselves are experiencing this, but we have to agree that everyone else is because it&#39;s only logical. <br><br>My first thought experiment is this: Assume you can cut someone&#39;s brain in half and clone each half. Then put an original halve and a clone halve together twice, making two new brains identical to the first. This is different from a normal cloning thought experiment because it physically clones the existence of the experiencer, not just the information that makes up the brain of the experiencer.  This let&#39;s me conclude a few things since the universe would allow this to happen: <br>1. Your continuation of self can run in parallel. This means you somehow experience both brains at the same time. <br>2. There must be some physical reason you can experienced both brains at once.<br><br>Now, I have no conclusion to what this means, but I do have a speculation that fits perfectly. The universe itself somehow is the experiencer, considering that all matter and energy was of the same at one point in time, and more and more complex energy exchanges in general let it &#39;experience&#39; things. And this is what the sensation of &#39;consciousness&#39; is. It&#39;s out there, and I do not believe it, but it is an idea that ties up all loose strings for what consciousness is. This would in effect means that even worms are technically conscious, but only in the sense that both worms are us would &#39;see&#39; through the senses and thoughts of a worm. This would also mean everyone is in effect the &#39;same&#39; experiencer as well. All world lines lead to the big bang as well, and since continuation of existence is defined in four dimensions, then logically everything was at one point interacting in the same system. <br><br>I haven&#39;t been able to think of another explanation for consciousness that fits everything as well as this one. Better ideas are appreciated.
