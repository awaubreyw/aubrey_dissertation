It has come to our attention that there are a few discrepancies within this episode worth acknowledging: <br><br>First, yes, you are correct. Jaguars don\u2019t hunt gorillas and their natural habitats are on different continents. We decided to generalize our discussion to all rainforest biomes in the Thought Bubble, but that breaks reality. So sorry for the confusion!  <br><br>Also, in this episode we\u2019d like to emphasize that we\u2019re only discussing terrestrial global biomes and their productivity - some of the patterns we draw here are not the same for aquatic biomes. <br><br>And lastly, yes, that fish tank we illustrated is too small.
