The word firmament in the KJV translates back to the Hebrew word for the English word expanse. The earth has two heavens, one the continents secondly the atmosphere. There expanse that divides the waters from the waters (fresh and salt) is solid, so there Greek word reflected a solid expanse &quot;He called the firmament heaven&quot;.<br>The expanse where the birds fly (atmosphere) was erroneously was given the firmament tag. Therefore the idea that the sky was a dome.

What has me confused about using parallax of the Sun to measure the Earth is how the Sun&#39;s light interacts with our atmosphere. From the little I know, if the Earth magically didn&#39;t have an atmosphere we wouldn&#39;t see the Sun as a localized object with our eyes. We&#39;d just be bathed in light.

It has been predicted for black holes and confirmed by the GPS satellites in the gravity well of earth itself. The signals used by GPS are required to be adjusted to account for time dilation caused by the difference in the gravity well between the orbit of the satellites and the GPS units on the ground. This adjustment is very tiny due to the very small gravity well created by the mass of the earth and the very close orbit of the satellites.  This time dilation is a repeatable and verifiable fact one cannot deny. And would apply just as well in all of the known universe, including the vast emptiness found in-between the galaxies.  As the mass increases time slows down.  The gravity well produced by an entire galaxy containing billions of stars, planets and even black holes will be far larger by factors in the billions then that of just the earth. The difference in the flow of time one would experience at the center of a galaxy would be immensely slower then that witch would be found outside of its gravity well in the intergalactic space in-between the galaxies.  If time is slower inside of the galaxies, then it would be faster outside the galaxies. Likewise, in the same manner the GPS satellites experience time faster farther outside earths gravity well  then we do her on the ground deeper inside earth&#39;s gravity well.<br><br>So what does this have to do with the age of the universe?  Think about it.....Time would flow much faster for a spaceship in intergalactic space far outside any gravity well then it would for that same ship traveling inside a galaxy. Likewise...... due to that same time dilation that ship would move far faster in intergalactic space then it would inside a galaxy ( from the point of view of those within a galaxy).  It must by pointed out that the ship would never actually exceeds light speed. If time flow increases then the speed of light increases by the same amount.<br><br>So...If a spaceship that could travel at the speed of light were to leave a galaxy one million light years away heading for earth.  How long would it take to get here? One million years?<br><br>Only if you ignored the time dilation caused by traveling outside of the gravity wells of galaxies and stars. As the ship crossed that intergalactic space nearly completely devoid of any gravity well it would experience a massive increase in the passage of time. With an equal increase in speed as well. (Again from the point of view of those within our galaxy. Not from the point of view of those on the ship) ) This would result in the ship making the entire voyage in a fraction of the time   <br><br>This changes in time dilatation experienced by the ship on its journey would also apply to even the lowly photon...... <br><br>So.... Again what does this have to do with the age of the universe? Only that the time it would have taken for light to reach earth from a galaxy one billion light years away would not be one billion years.<br><br>The argument that the universe must be billions of years old because it took billions of years for light to travel to earth from distant galaxies is fallacious. It is based off of incorrect premises about how light would travel outside the gravity wells of stars and galaxies. Therefore it is not a valid argument and one should refrain from using it. <br><br>Real-World Relativity: The GPS Navigation System<br><a href=\"http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html\">http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html</a><br><br>Scientists slow the speed of light<br>23 January 2015<br><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-30944584\">http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-30944584</a><br><br>Physicists find a new way to slow the speed of light<br>January 23, 2015<br><a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2015-01-physicists-air.html\">http://phys.org/news/2015-01-physicists-air.html</a><br><br>Here&#39;s an oldie but a goodie.<br> <br>HARVARD GAZETTE ARCHIVES<br>Physicists Slow Speed of Light<br>February 18, 1999<br><a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/02.18/light.html\">http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/02.18/light.html</a>", "comment_date": "2016-03-16T04:34:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Poptart", "comment_text": "Did I see moon man at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWMh61yutjU&amp;t=2m25s\">2:25</a>", "comment_date": "2016-03-11T14:23:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MJ", "comment_text": "Question: since stars come in many &quot;colors&quot;(Blue giant, red dwarf, etc...), why do we only see stars in our night sky as white?", "comment_date": "2016-03-07T11:26:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Esther", "comment_text": "If a star is 4 light years away does that mean that if it blew up now we would see it 4 year later?", "comment_date": "2016-03-06T08:20:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "David Marley", "comment_text": "Yeah, but...

So it&#39;s literally a run...<br>It appears that Han was crazy enough to bring the Falcon very close to the black holes in the area, he basically took a shortcut, so to speak. So he made the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs because of that shortcut... or perhaps he was able to shake off those imperial patrols at a point that was closer to Kessel than normal, so there you have two possible explanations.<br><br>1-He got to the delivery point following a shorter route of 12 parsecs instead of the typical one of 18 parsecs. (it doesn&#39;t account for speed, though) <br>2-He was able to shake off those imperial patrols when he was just 12 parsecs away from Kessel (after just 12 parsecs of pursuit, instead of 18, that is)...so you can say that he made the Kessel run, and made it faster than most (this explanation does account for speed indirectly, so it&#39;s more valid, imho). <br><br>The shortcut explanation was probably made up by some SW fan, but it&#39;s not a bad one, I think, XD<br>The &quot;shake off&quot; explanation is mine, I think it&#39;s a better alternative since it also conveys the idea of speed, which is the point Han wanted to make in that cantina conversation with Luke and Obi.", "comment_date": "2015-07-17T02:23:54Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Falchieyan", "comment_text": "I noticed that the distance to the sun was a measurement within .7km. \u00a0What specific reference points are used for that distance? \u00a0Is that from the outer edge of the Earth&#39;s surface to the outer &quot;edge&quot; of the sun? \u00a0Or from the estimated center of Earth to the center of the sun?", "comment_date": "2015-07-17T02:22:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fred Ro", "comment_text": "We Americans do not use metric.
