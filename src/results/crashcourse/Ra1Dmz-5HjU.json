It really helped me round out my education, as business school tends to be exceptionally myopic.<br><br>This was my last one, and it helped more than you know. It helped me to come to terms with the realization that I adore my field of finance, and just because I can&#39;t find a place within it right now doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m worthless.

The friends I used to have at community college I now see were just stoner buddies who went nowhere since I left. Almost nobody graduated besides me, and certainly none went on to actual college. To quote the quite literal only friend I still have, &quot;You ever stop smoking weed with people...and realize that was all you had in common?&quot;. Yeah, I have, and it was.

It can make you happy, but it can also drive you crazy in a never ending spiral of doubt that makes you question your own sanity. I am proudly able to say I don&#39;t need to know, and I know longer care. For thousands of years people have tried to answer these questions, I am not going to be the one to do it nor do I need to. In the end nobody every really leaves this place with any answers, life is not a question to be answered it is a reality to experience. The questions are only questions in our minds. Every single philosophical debate boils down to people arguing over which team they like better. The meaning of life is just to live life. I am putting this boulder down for a bit.

I always ask questions regarding reality, existence, God, constantly searching ideas till I got agnostic then back to theistic.... I tried to understand and build unity among beliefs, misconceptions, and raises questions on society like corruption, death penalty, ideal society, relationships, and different practices...... I begun to study history and appreciated it much, I also love arts, music, theater, and writing.......I also valued the beauty of math and the wonders of physics............ I did all of those even before this series of Crash Course started last year when I was totally depressed and with anxiety disorder which made me stopped schooling.....depression, anxiety, stress, and my experience of not getting in school even added my questions about my life and humanity...... Now, I am more open minded, I learn to listen to different opinions and respect them, I begun to be more reasonable, to build consensus and agreements than disagreements, I am more of a pacifier and peace maker now...... I try to see similarities than dividing ideas....with sometimes getting headaches and insomnias with just thinking about deep questions.... I am interested in the Fine Arts and Education right now, but living like a philosopher is an unending work of questions.....changing perspectives..... challenging ideas...... ridding some old beliefs...and withholding other beliefs...... and most of the time looking out in the blue skies, daydreaming, and being too silent while deeply thinking of a philosophical question....... I am introverted....that&#39;s why maybe arts and philosophy are my hobbies and interests.... side from that according to a lot of Multiple Intelligences tests I answered and got... I always get Visual-Spatial, Musical, Interpersonal, and Existential (the new 9th intelligence) intelligences in my top lists. just sharing. :D Farewell Crash Course Philosophy........................ time to venture Mythology. :&#39;( I&#39;ll miss this.

Are our values really voluntary or (either through nature or nurture) innate? If they are plastic, they must be at least very difficult to change, and probably (i.e. at least <b>apparently</b>) more difficult for some than others - so as a whole, must we not think of values as generally immutable? 2.) Some people will obviously have more or less ability to seek out and strive for what they place value in, but (baring possibly some kind of mental disorder, and I could see debate even in that case) everyone wants to do what they see as valuable, to live their values - because it gives you happiness, or contentment, or satisfaction - or any other word for pleasure. Therefore Existentialism = Hedonism and vice versa.<br>As a matter of fact Hedonism could be seen as the motivating factor behind all known biological life and understanding, and the thus the root of all characterized philosophy. The only usual argument over our root motivation, to increase pleasure and/or reduce pain (as if there&#39;s any difference between them) is the erroneous argument that Hedonism somehow seduces people into irrationally seeking some kind(s) of overdose of immediate pleasure(s) with total disregard for all obvious, painful consequences of doing so. We all obviously and constantly budget our pain vs. pleasure over time. I often use the term &#39;Practical Hedonism&#39; to get this point across succinctly, but in reality that caveat is redundant and unnecessary. Hedonism also does not rule out altruism since most of us see value in helping others in their pleasure vs. pain - thus making us feel good - plus the additional practicality of helping the group to help ourselves (even for the more self centered. Argued exceptions for sadists and the like would be encapsulated within the exception of mental disorders mentioned above.) Obviously some, like young children, require assistance in budgeting their pain vs. pleasure. (Halloween candy binges and tummy aches being a relatively safe primary lesson for many.)<br>The only exceptions to this Hedonistic root motivation in practice (that I can see) would be either concepts of duty/honor and/or religion, which are merely means of control. Concepts of duty or honor are based on social acceptance. When viewed as such, we can not only see it as differing among social groups, but can make our own determinations as to the value of the approval of a certain, limited social group versus the level of our own potential pleasure or suffering. As to the religious exception, it isn&#39;t really &#39;religion&#39; as a concept, but merely certain small groups of religious sects who encourage the idea of some afterlife that will reward wasting your life in misery for the promise of over-matching pleasure after death. Without any verifiable evidence ever in history, this concept must be indoctrinated during one&#39;s childhood development. While, yes, there are some cases of those raised atheist/agnostic later in life being converted into a religious group, these usually follow regular patterns: either a period of emotional pain (whether merely unfulfillment, or in whatever form) and the promise of the religion as a solution to eventually replace the pain with pleasure; or due to the social pressure of a loved one (as in marriage.) This can be easily born out by considering the consequence of waiting until one reached an age capable of considered reason before introducing the concepts of religion or afterlife. Such concepts would almost certainly be seen as ludicrous by most. However, the only advantage to a religious upbringing, outside of social acceptance, is to keep people in a state of acceptance of pain rather than demanding their share of readily available pleasure. Thus religions that promote concepts like heaven, reincarnation, mortification of the flesh, etc. can be seen as not only a means of control, but innately immoral - i.e. in opposition to our evolved Hedonism and Existential self-actualization. The religious indoctrination of vulnerable children would  have to also be considered abuse.<br>While this is merely a progression of logical thought (and an <b>extremely</b> abbreviated version of arguments due to the format here) in our present heavily indoctrinated and controlled society, they would probably be considered radical to most.<br>I&#39;m no great philosopher, claim only mediocre intelligence, and try my best to keep an open mind. My propositions here are more a result of observations throughout my life than anything read or taught. I encourage any constructive counter arguments that could increase my conception, understanding, or personal pleasure overall.

If another driver makes an error and I take action to prevent suffering (a payment), I immediately remind myself of a time I made a mistake driving and another other driver&#39;s skill prevented suffering I may have caused (a withdrawal). I try to have as many of the former events as I can and as few of the latter. Of course I know nothing at all about the full consequences my actions. Allowing a poor driver to continue without incident may condemn them to causing worse suffering at a later date. I can only judge the odds of this eventuality and try to make good bets. And no, saving a life would not entitle me to take one (it occurs to me this would make a good movie plot about a repentant assassin) because I cannot calculate the worth of another&#39;s life.

How can Camus even suggest Sisyphus was happy? The tale is about an extreneous but futile task.

Nozick&#39;s experience machine is a clear equivalent to the demon suggested by DeCartes, and as this solipsistic hypothesis really isn&#39;t disproven, asking oneself whether it is worthwhile to be inside one cannot answer about a life worth living, for AFAWK that could very well be our life. In any case, impact upon our world can still be achieved even inside the experience machine, the fact that this world is a figment of the imagination should not change that.", "comment_date": "2017-02-14T09:37:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cat Waisenkind", "comment_text": "This helped me uncover some cognitive dissonance I&#39;ve been dealing with.

The different schools are all pretty interesting, but the one I find particularly fascinating is Epicureanism, which was the first one to focus on materialism and is what Karl Marx wrote his dissertation on. <br><br>In terms of the good life they believed the absence of pain was the greatest pleasure you could have and that we should live in accordance with nature, which is fairly admirable in many ways. It&#39;s their metaphysics that&#39;s most interesting about them though. They were atomists that believed everything could be explained by physical causes, namely the random interactions of atoms, leading them to adopt a deterministic world view. This also meant that they believed that if there were any divine beings they were absent ones, detached from the world and therefore not really worth worrying about, which links back to the good life. One of Epicurus&#39; main concerns was teaching others how best to achieve that blissful state of painlessness, and not worrying about gods is part of that. He also had reasons for not worrying about death, ones that are still worth thinking about nowadays. If any of that sounds interesting to people I highly recommend they look into Epicurus and Epicureanism, it&#39;s definitely worthwhile.<br><br>Anyway, thank you to everyone at Crash Course Philosophy for reigniting my passion for philosophy, you all did a fantastic job!", "comment_date": "2017-02-13T23:22:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C0deH0wler", "comment_text": "There&#39;s a way to solve this conflict.
