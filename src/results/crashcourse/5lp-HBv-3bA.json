And I do laud you for trying to do the sringara bhaava, or the &#39;erotic&#39; expression... because though you didn&#39;t mention it, probably due to the time constraints,  Kathakali dancers take years to train their facial muscles, not just learn the hand gestures. Literally months or years of learning to move many of their facial muscles independently of each other, with great control and in graceful conjunction with the other ones. So, to actually do an expression of that kind, takes a dancer a long time. But still, a valiant attempt on your part. I know I can&#39;t and will not try with my more or less wooden face. Hehe.
