That is the most frequent number in the data set and therefore most likely to be an individual data point. <br>For instance the foot example said the average person has less than one foot. Let&#39;s assign it&#39;s value as 1.7 for this situation. If I had 5 friends online, and i were to try guessing how many feet they have; 2 would be a better answer than 1.7 . I know this particularly works in the example since you only have 3 options (0,1,2); but that makes mode the best option since it indicates the most frequent answer. Median isn&#39;t necessarily a data point in the set, since when it&#39;s an even number you usually average the two to get median (meaning that value:IS NOT part of the set).

Because I think colors and vision are interesting and I&#39;d love people to have a better understanding of both color and statistics.<br><br>The first obvious suggestion is that the visible spectrum is composed of wavelengths of light. You probably know that visible light spans a wide range of colors from looking at a rainbow that splits up the many different wavelengths (ROYGBIV). Obviously if someone picks &quot;red&quot; or &quot;blue&quot; you can point to a place in the visible spectrum where the light is red or blue and assign their color a wavelength, right? Well ... white isn&#39;t part of the rainbow. There is no single wavelength that corresponds to white. White is a mix of many wavelengths of light which our brain interprets as white. And black is of course the absence of light, so there&#39;s no wavelength to assign it. Worse, it turns out that if you get more specific in terms of your favorite color (not &quot;red&quot; but &quot;crimson&quot;, not &quot;blue&quot; but &quot;cerulean&quot;) then that exact color is probably not single wavelength but rather a combination of many wavelengths. <br><br>For the sake of argument though, let&#39;s add up all the values we can represent (ignoring white, black, grey, brown, pink, gold, silver, etc etc) and we will <b>absolutely</b> get the average color as some shade of green, barring some really intense skew in people&#39;s favorite colors. Green is in the mid range of the visible light spectrum and unless an absolutely massive proportion of the people favor blue/purple or red/orange, the average will be green. The exact shade of green will vary depending on whether or not you do some fiddling to make the visible spectrum more &quot;even&quot; than it actually is.<br><br>The second suggestion is that our computers model color for us through Red, Green, and Blue light. This is a cool trick based on the fact that we don&#39;t individually detect specific wavelengths. Our eyes are composed of three types of color receptors (cones) which are each most active in a certain part of the visible spectrum. These cones report back their activation levels and from that our brain constructs a perceived color based on how much each of the cones in a particular particular part of the eye are active. There&#39;s even a cool trick that because our Red cones are slightly active in the violet-end of the visible spectrum we can combine Blue and Red light to create Purple! That&#39;s really cool and allows us to smoothly transition from violet back to red by reducing the amount of blue light even though those points are on opposite ends of the visible light spectrum and a direct wavelength transition between those values should require us to pass through green. Instead we perceive those two ends as linked - almost like the visible spectrum is a &quot;color wheel&quot;.<br><br>Now, even though RGB does not allow us to encode every visible color, it does give us a more nuanced system for capturing colors that involve multiple wavelengths at once - or even no wavelength! We can capture white, black, grey, brown, and many other colors that aren&#39;t handled by a single wavelength. We can also capture the same wavelength at multiple levels of brightness so we can distinguish someone who likes &quot;light red&quot; from someone who likes &quot;dark red&quot;. If we build RGB representations of each of their favorite colors and average out those RGB values, we can calculate an average value and it will be some shade of grey, possibly with a hint of one of the three channels being higher or lower than the others. Because roughly equal amounts of Red, Green, and Blue light will make some shade of grey.<br><br>A variant on this suggestion though is that when we print we use a different color model. Instead of RGB (which is based on adding light together), most printers use the CMYK model (which is based on mixing inks that subtract light from a piece of white paper). Using Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and blacK, we represent all our colors using 4 values, mix them together, print out the average and get brown. Because when you mix roughly equal amounts of Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow you get a brownish color, then darkened by however much blacK gets used.<br><br>I&#39;d like to pause and take a moment to think about what happens when we calculate averages in other places in statistics. If we calculate everyone&#39;s height in inches and take the average, then switch to centimeters and take the average ... we&#39;ll get the same answer. If we calculate average people&#39;s age in years, then do it in minutes, we&#39;ll end up with (minus some rounding problems) the same answer. If we average everyone&#39;s income in USD, then convert it to Euros and average it ... we&#39;ll end up with the same answer.<br><br>But here we&#39;ve taken three different ways of measuring and representing colors, averaged the inputs in each of them, and gotten wildly different results. No one would mistake green, grey, and brown as being the same colors, so something weird is happening here.<br><br>Let&#39;s try one last thing in hopes that we can resolve this. Rather than resorting to CMYK or RGB systems which are outputting in a limited number of channels, let&#39;s go one step further. We ask everyone to bring in an object they own that is their favorite color. Then we&#39;ll point a light sensor at it and measure ALL the wavelengths coming off the object, average how much of each wavelength is coming off the objects in question, and then we&#39;ll have our absolutely accurate answer.<br><br>Your assistant shows up carrying two purple objects and says &quot;both of these are my favorite color, but I couldn&#39;t decide which one to bring, so let&#39;s measure both of them and take their average.&quot; You agree and measure the light coming off one of them, then the light coming off the other ... and then hang your head in defeat. The two objects have very different sets of wavelengths being measured, yet your eyes consider them indistinguishable. Where one of the two purple objects is mostly reflecting violet light, the other&#39;s color appears to have been made by mixing blue and red paint so it reflects very little violet light and much more red and blue. Showing your assistant the average of the two brings a shake of the head, &quot;that&#39;s still purple, but it doesn&#39;t look like either of them!&quot; In fact, there could be hundreds or thousands of combinations of wavelengths that all map to this same shade of purple, because just as our computer shows millions of shades using only 3 wavelengths, the natural world is reflecting hundreds of thousands of wavelengths that we only perceive as intensities in our 3 types of cones.<br><br>In the end, we&#39;re left wondering why it&#39;s so hard to pick an average color - we have 4 systems that assign numbers to colors, but they give conflicting answers. This is an important distinction then between a numerical representation and a measurement. You can measure the number of pets in each household and determine the mean number of pets each person has - that&#39;s great. But if you assign a number to each of those types of animals (1 = dog, 2 = cat, 3 = goldfish, etc), you&#39;ve created a numerical representation of a qualitative value. If you then average THOSE values, you do not end up with a meaningful result - especially since you could just change the values in your representation and get a different answer. <br><br>Wavelengths of light are interpreted by our brains as colors, and while wavelengths are a physical phenomenon you can measure, &quot;color&quot; is not a one-to-one measurement of the physical world.", "comment_date": "2018-02-08T11:01:57Z", "likes_count": 22}}}, {"kn83BA7cRNM": {"Mean, Median, and Mode: Measures of Central Tendency: Crash Course Statistics #3": {"channel_id": "UgzWZqHlskkiyNw6IuJ4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Douglas Magowan", "comment_text": "The average Canadian has one testicle, just like Adolph Hitler -- or, more precisely, the average Canadian has 0.96 testicles, an even sadder plight than Hitler&#39;s, if the average Anything actually existed.
