MOST people aren&#39;t evil Nazis, just good people who believe differently than you do and truly believe what is best for the government or society is the opposite of what you believe. Voltaire&#39;s strategy and way of discussing and engaging with people who believed things he thought were evil is the BEST and ONLY way to behave in an enlightened society!
