If you think of smaller states as suppliers of allegiance in exchange for support from world powers, world going from bipolar to unipolar decreased the bargaining power of smaller states drastically. In simple economic terms, demand was half as there was only one consumer of allegiance but supply had increased due to more number of states. It was a catastrophe rather than something to celebrate. You can track the decline in human progress since the end of &#39;80s in the number and importance of innovations and how they improved people&#39;s lives. It was that race between two blocks that was taking us forward and now that there&#39;s only one competitor, there&#39;s far less need for racing.", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T19:40:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Pickton-Allen", "comment_text": "Now that you\u2019re getting near the end of this series on european history, what is next for crash course history? <br><br>Asian history perhaps?

Once the international media got hold on the story what was a horrible and tragic accident that cost the lives of 31 people turned in to a national disaster that negatively changed the lives of more than 340 000 people.<br>By mentioning Tchernobyl in that way and not saying anything about how the radiation levels mostly were harmless / good for people outside a small radius I think you are futher disinforming the public on the matter on nuclear energy.  This is another example of a pattern I&#39;ve seen on your youtube channel, where you will make a negative comment on nuclear energy that is not based on evidence or logic, but just states a simple fact or even opinion on nuclear with no context,  that hurts nuclear powers reputation.<br>It&#39;s likely that every month more people die from the production of renewable sources of energy than what has ever died from the production of nuclear energy. Nuclear is by far the safest way to produce energy per unit, while coal is the most dangerous.<br>If we could replace all coal powerplants with nuclear it would be to great benefit for human kind.<br><a href=\"https://tv.nrk.no/serie/folkeopplysningen/2018/KMTE50002418\">https://tv.nrk.no/serie/folkeopplysningen/2018/KMTE50002418</a>  (Norwegian program that explains a lot of how and why this is wrong)<br><a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/lawrence-solomon-hbo-exaggerated-how-dangerous-chernobyl-was-for-most\">https://business.financialpost.com/opinion/lawrence-solomon-hbo-exaggerated-how-dangerous-chernobyl-was-for-most</a> (English)", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T19:20:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eoghan.", "comment_text": "Getting in in the 48 hour window!
