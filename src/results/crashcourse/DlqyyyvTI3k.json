So most doctors will based on symptoms test for white cells and if they are present treat for an infection. HOWEVER if the patient has hematuria (blood in the urine) the test will be positive since obviously blood contains white blood cells.  Only if the patient comes back still complaining of symptoms is the doctor likely to see that the culture was negative and there is also red spells in the urine and then start the process of differential diagnosis for hematuria.  I&#39;ve seen it happen to 2 men in my family.  One was admitted into the hospital for a UTI from the ER based on white cells in urine after having prostate surgery.
