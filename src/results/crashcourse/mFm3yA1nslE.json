Maybe I can contribute some further insight as a layman.<br><br>I haven&#39;t been able to smell for over twenty years, and there are many benefits. The primary benefit is not being disgusted by pretty much anything, so I never get nauseous and I am immune to those odors that would cause ordinary people to gag etc. Vomit, feces, farts, decay, rotting food or animals cannot be smelled and therefore do not bother me. I could wade through a river of raw sewage and not be affected by the smell (not that I would lol). Getting the flu is not like it was when I could smell - it is more like a bad cold with weakness and fever, and none of the nausea and reaction to smells during a flu occur anymore. <br><br>I can also interact with people without the normal distractions of body odor, bad breath, cigarette smoke or too much perfume - thus it is more pleasant and easier to engage with people, as simply people and not be burdened or offended with their smell (offensive or not). Living with, or being around people is much easier when you cannot smell.  Perhaps one&#39;s impression of another is clearer, and unbiased, when the complexity of smell is removed from the equation. One could say that it was impaired too, but I don&#39;t see it that way.<br><br>Another benefit is that I am not obsessed with eating all the time or &quot;living to eat&quot; - so weight gain and over-eating is never a problem. I do enjoy food though, because I can taste just fine.  I should also point out, that the actual sense of taste (not smell), is now somehow enhanced for me. Since the input is purely taste,  I can pickup subtle nuance in the pure tastes of food without the interference of smell. Another benefit is that I pretty much like every food and I don&#39;t have any aversions that are caused by powerful smells. I can&#39;t think of anything that I won&#39;t eat, sans the exotic things like grubs and insects - but I am sure I could get used to them if I lived in those parts of the world where they are the normal cuisine.<br><br>I realized after many years, that when people talk about taste, most of the time they are really referring to smell. For example, saying that beets taste like dirt. Well that&#39;s not really true, it&#39;s just an expression of what people think is taste, but it is primarily smell and texture. In fact, it seems to me, that anytime someone protests certain foods, it is never about the taste, but always about the look, smell and texture. <br><br>Powerful chemicals, smoke and other things like that - I cannot smell, but I can &quot;feel&quot; them in my nose as a sensation of burning or my eyes will react - So I am not blind to hazardous environments.<br><br>I can certainly remember what things smell like, so there is a reference - and I should be clear that there are times when I wish I could smell again. Smells that I miss, like freshly cut grass, gasoline, freshly washed laundry, coffee, wine, bakeries and gourmet kitchens etc. - but in the end it is not all that bad, and one gets used to it and finds the positives to be rewarding.", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T18:49:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Linghua Zhang", "comment_text": "Great video!

Is it just that injuries affecting the skin are slower to heal because the outer layer of skin is dead, or do we really heal faster in our mouths? It makes a lot of sense. My mom raised gerbils for a long time and the worst injury or illness a gerbil could get was a cut or infection in their mouth. It&#39;s not uncommon if they go too long without chewing something hard and wearing down their teeth.\u00a0<br>When your mouth hurts, you don&#39;t want to chew solid food.
