He says the heart is really only concerned with maintaining pressure. The video goes on to say that the heart is a very unique organ, and generates \u201chigh hydrostatic pressure to pump blood out to the heart, while also creating low pressure to bring it back in\u201d meaning it has to keep high and low pressure all in one organ. To think this is just the introduction on the heart!<br>The next part starts off with facts, like the size and shape of the heart, and that the heart grows with you. Next we learn about the pericardium which is made up of apparently two layers, the first is the fibrous pericardium. This layer is made up of really dense connective tissue which helps keep the heart in since heart beats are pretty intense and without this the organ would flail about wildly in the chest. The inner pericardium has fluid, a natural lubricant to keep the heart moving well. He also goes over the layers of the heart as well as the chambers of the heart and valves. Fun fact: the \u201club dub\u201d sound is actually the opening and closing of the valves in the heart. Cool right? I think the thing here that he doesn\u2019t exactly say but solves my question of why is the pulmonary artery called \u201cartery\u201d if the blood is deoxygenated? This video breaks it down like this: veins bring blood to the heart, arteries push it away from the heart. Which in MOST cases means oxygenated blood in arteries, and deoxygenated in veins. But not in the immediate heart area!<br>This video is very through while being very interesting and funny. I even had an \u201cah-ha\u201d moment. It goes over everything from the misconception of the heart being an organ to \u2018love\u2019, to general facts about the heart and circulatory system, and includes blood pressure and interesting information about the lungs. All in all this would be a great little video to show in class, or watch in your own time to maybe clarify any questions.<br>BONUS: It also has a second part to it which talks about McDreamy from Grey\u2019s and everyone knows how much I love that show, and that video is also great. The video also has some awesome information about how cardiac tissues vary from regular tissues, and the intrinsic cardiac system.", "comment_date": "2016-08-04T16:06:15Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"X9ZZ6tcxArI": {"The Heart, Part 1 - Under Pressure: Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology #25": {"channel_id": "UghEzj7K-jeI_ngCoAEC", "comment_by": "Blooper Hacker", "comment_text": "I saw in YouTube that a man lived 555 days without a heart", "comment_date": "2016-08-04T14:37:37Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"X9ZZ6tcxArI": {"The Heart, Part 1 - Under Pressure: Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology #25": {"channel_id": "Ugiml_iLofz0o3gCoAEC", "comment_by": "IELTS Listening Tests.", "comment_text": "Mr.hank ,I&#39;m a student of class 1 and thank you.For crash course first time I pass in Biology and become the first in class.I&#39;m Anestina,from India.", "comment_date": "2016-08-02T10:47:46Z", "likes_count": 109}}}, {"X9ZZ6tcxArI": {"The Heart, Part 1 - Under Pressure: Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology #25": {"channel_id": "UghR7Z6jwiUn_HgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Joe Kilroy", "comment_text": "Queen already made a song about pressure......", "comment_date": "2016-07-18T19:55:31Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"X9ZZ6tcxArI": {"The Heart, Part 1 - Under Pressure: Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology #25": {"channel_id": "UghI7-pPXiMNXXgCoAEC", "comment_by": "Annette", "comment_text": "Why not make the videos a bit longer so Hank can talk a little slower? <br>Anyways, I&#39;m so grateful for this channel!
