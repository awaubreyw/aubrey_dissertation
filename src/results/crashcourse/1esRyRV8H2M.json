I get that it&#39;s a footnote in this video but the long perpetuated myth that the famine was self inflicted by the Irish through poor agricultural methods, and then further exacerbated by the English is blatant Anglophile propaganda. The IPF was a genocide inflicted on the Irish people by their English colonial overlords, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. The Irish were explicitly  refused the right to grow a stable &quot;crop&quot; of crops, because of the overbearing seed and stock control placed upon Irish tenant farmers by their English land owners. In areas where the majority of arable land was owned by native Irishmen, the effects of the famine were, while still notable, greatly mitigated by intelligent crop rotation and a shift to crops which were not effected by the famine. Further, the myth of the &quot;one legged stool&quot; of Irish agricultural practices needs to be addressed. Irish farmers in the 18th and 19th century grew a large mix of crops, however, because of the stipulations of English colonialism, they were only allowed to keep a small fraction of the least economically viable crops ( often potatoes) for their personal use. During the height of the famine, Irish farms were in many cases just as productive as they had been before the famine, however the lion&#39;s share of their non-potato crops were being taken by the English as &quot;payment&quot; for the land on which the Irish farmed.<br><br>Sorry for the massive diatribe, I just cant stand the popular representation of my people as &quot;durr hurr, stupid Irish only knew how to grow potatoes&quot;, when in actuality that myth was an invention of the English to obfuscate their attempted genocide of what they saw as an &quot;inferior people&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-07-12T19:16:29Z", "likes_count": 70}, {"comment_by": "Jens Fogh", "comment_text": "This one really pissed of the right-wing tardhorde +1 for that!", "comment_date": "2017-07-12T19:09:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nickelicious", "comment_text": "So the word globalization alone is enough to make people dislike the video?", "comment_date": "2017-07-12T19:08:57Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "TheAutobotPower", "comment_text": "...And everything changed when the European Nations attacked.", "comment_date": "2017-07-12T19:05:39Z", "likes_count": 48}, {"comment_by": "P.J.
