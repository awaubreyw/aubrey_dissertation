Thermoplastics can be melted and solidified over and over again, and do not have any cross linking, or bonding between the chains of polymers. Thermosets have lots of cross linking, and cannot be melted once solid. Thermoplastics are characterized by being melt-processable, meaning all manufacturing methods involve melting the plastic into a liquid, then forming it into the shape you want and cooling it there. Common methods of melt processing include injection molding, extrusion, and thermoforming. Thermosets, since they cannot be melted, have to be created on a chemical level in their final form. This means that you start with a liquid uncured polymer and an initiator (a chemical that causes the polymer to cure). You then mix the two parts and pour of flow the liquid mix into position, then let it cure and solidify in place. A store bought 2-part epoxy is an example of this. Carbon Fiber and glass fiber panels are examples of things made with thermosets, the fiber weave is encased in a cured thermoset.<br><br>The plastic property mentioned that might aid water flowing higher is a reference to the fact that thermoplastics, when loaded in shear like being forced through a pipe, will reduce in viscosity. Normal liquids increase viscosity and resist flow the more you push, but plastic will flow more. This is a result of the long polymer chains lining up in the direction of flow, but the alignment increases the more you push on them, resulting in lower viscosity the harder you push.<br><br>Another fun property of plastics is the glass transition. Most thermoplastics have 2 different phases of being solid. Below the glass transition temperature, they are stiff like glass, and will be brittle. Plastics like Polycarbonate, used for safety glasses and blast shields, is below its glass transition temperature at room temp. Plastics that are soft and can be belt and folded, like a ziplock bag, are above their glass transition temperature at room temp. When a plastic like polycarbonate is brought above its glass transition temperature, which is less than the melt temperature, it will become soft and wobbly. <br><br>Speaking of temperatures, thermoplastics do not have a definitive melt temperature. Metals have a temp that they always melt at, but plastics generally have a range, and some have no discernible transition from solid to liquid. Melt for a plastic is defined as the point at which there is enough heat energy for the long chains to slide past each other to allow for flow. This mainly takes the form of breaking crystalline regions of the plastic (polymers can be semi-crystalline on a microscopic scale, with small areas of crystal structures and small areas with no structure, called amorphous). The longer the chains are, the higher the melt temperature as its harder to get them to slide past. So 1 plastic can have a range of melt temps depending on the particular molecular weight, or average chain length, of that sample. Polymers that have no crystal regions are called &quot;Amorphous&quot;, and they have no definitive temp at which they melt. From the glass transition temperature to the point where they start to degrade and burn, they just gradually lose viscosity and stiffness. There is no hard line that says &quot;this plastic is now liquid&quot;. You can just turn the temp up or down a little, and it will just get a little less or more viscous.<br><br>Well there is a little deeper into the subject at a very, very brief overview with some fun info. Hopefully someone enjoys reading it!<br>-Source: Plastics and Composites Engineering student senior.<br><br>P.S. don&#39;t pronounce the &quot;ph&quot; in Terephthalate.
