As a gay male who was a teen when Will &amp; Grace was at its height, I was really put off by the show because I couldn&#39;t identify with the characters, and it&#39;s not the only example, just the most vivid one. While I enjoy watching a play or musical from time to time, I&#39;ve never been one for showtunes; I like rock, jazz, classical, and even a little bit of heavy metal. I may have a good eye for color and be able to help friends pick out clothes, but I don&#39;t dress like it--I&#39;m more interested comfort and budget. I&#39;m not skinny, I don&#39;t have short carefully trimmed hair, and at the time I wasn&#39;t clean-shaven. (I&#39;ve also never liked light beer, but we&#39;ll skip over the underage drinking part.) I&#39;ve heard people praise the show, but it left me with more feelings of alienation: in the early 2000s there were still plenty of negative things going around about gay people, but I didn&#39;t see any gay people like me in the media, even the supposedly &quot;positive&quot; examples, who were often reduced to punchlines anyway.<br><br>Even a couple of years later in college near Philadelphia, I found it hard to fit in with the actual gay community, and I can&#39;t help thinking that popular media portrayals of gay stereotypes, no matter how &quot;positive&quot; were reinforced so much that they were internalized by the gay community, whether as ways of identifying each other or as ways of being a &quot;good gay.&quot; There were no examples of an overweight, long-haired rock &amp; roll type of gay guy in the media, and nobody knew what to do with me. (At least it&#39;s a bit better now.)<br><br>Things like this have given me more appreciation for characters who are well-rounded, where such a piece of identity is a trait rather than the defining feature of the character.

The stereotype of the quick-witted, fashion-loving, girl&#39;s best friend, gay man, for instance, was crafted to combat the decidedly dark and more sinister image of gay men in media before then.  The change in the that public image allowed equal rights legislation to go forward.  Often when the histories of such things are written, there is tendency (of academics in particular) to go after easy targets, condemning these simplistic stereotypes rather than contextualising their role in changing public discourse about minority groups.
