I skipped school today, and since in AP bio I was missing notes on the nervous system, I just watched these videos, and understood in 30 minutes what it would have taken 3 days of in class notes to learn (and I&#39;d probably still be confused.) Just wondering, though - I&#39;m confused as to how accumulation of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft (like as a result of drugs like cocaine or SSRIs) amplifies the effect of the neurotransmitter. I received the impression that the neurotransmitters functioned as a communication tool, only having an effect when they bonded to the postsynaptic terminal and then were converted back to electrical signals. Is it that the extra neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft just mean more neurotransmitters binding to their receptors on the postsynaptic cleft? (The animation did not show this, I believe, it just showed them floating around and the receptors were empty; you guys are usually crazy detailed when it comes to ur animations so I&#39;m doubtful this is the reason, but then I must have a fundamental misunderstanding of neurotransmitters or something... sorry for the really long comment!

It seems to me that during these experiences my brain is a bit like a dysfunctional pinball machine, getting stuck bouncing back n forth in corners others stuck in holes and others in chaotic linear directions back n forth, unable to be released, and returned back to base. its my assumption that this inhibits or ceases the ability for messages to be sent from the brain to the body. There are thousands of frustrated synaptic junctions stuck or frozen in limbo battling &amp; trying to outwit each other, but end up in a frozen scrum with a slippery ball no one can grasp. Meanwhile my body is paralysed and often with restricted breathing, and other seemingly deadly symptoms. There is a fear of impending death, that used to have me distraught and awake in tears. That happened in 1988, I thought I had epilepsy but after tests with a neurosurgeon I was diagnosed with sleep paralysis, including associated symptoms of hypnagogic / painful muscle convulsions stuck &amp;  unable to correct, and intense sound hallucinations such as the synapses sounding like maggots munching or cicadas feasting on my grey matter rising to a crescendo and pending self combustion. Before I saw the neurologist I always accepted that unable to speak or call out I would lie helpless and laying there helpless would breath my last. <br><br>After his advise to relax my body and just ride it out, the severity of the experience lessened. I fact the noise and pain would continue to build till the extreme pain morphed into an intense exhilaration. The first time I tried this instead of my paralysis resuming to normal pain, it morphed into a wired pain but more exhilaration, this continued to increase. I responded without fighting it, Ryding to reassure myself I couldn&#39;t die, so let it take its course. Instead of being overwhelmed I sunk into a meditative humility &amp; and amazingly the experience actually went into a deeper pain transitioning to intense euphoria and climaxing with a massive explosion of white light which found my body/ spirit leave my physical body, &amp; travelling like a rocket, exploding again in white light and floating in outer space in euphoria, floating in a nirvana. The pain still reached a state in which I thought my head woulda surely self combust but instead somehow my spirit fused with what what was happening and I had my first Out of Body experience which was the most euphoric experience I had ever had. I&#39;ve evolved to learn how to control them to a certain extent, all experiences are unique, some more memorable than others. Though some can still be nightmarish, I don&#39;t always OBE. His prescription was epilum and advised that during these painful synaptic crashes to just slow my breath and relax my body. within he brain is what happens during an OBE. The neurostranmiters are subsequently in able of sending messages from the brain to the body in these states. Relaxing your body on return is the only way, fighting it is a battle you can&#39;t win it takes forever to return back in your body and it&#39;s very painful. When you are finally back and you do actually feel your physical form re-enter and you need to keep your eyes closed because even though your back in bed in your body it takes 5 minutes to be fully integrated back. I&#39;ve had times when I think I&#39;m back in I open my eyes look around to note I am in my room but a little unsettled then I wave my arms in front of my face and I cannot see my arms because I&#39;m not fully integrated back into my body! I&#39;ve had the most amazing experiences over the last 30 years and one day I hope to write a book about it and make references to scientific explanations as well as some scientific date from Philosophers such as Sheldrake on morphic resonance which I think has some parallels. Thanks for reading would love to hear your thoughts both positive and negative/ sceptic.

Especially if as scientists we don&#39;t believe in spontaneous generations. Where the heck did that first simple cell come from? People argue that because we are so complex, we must have been created by chance,,, but hello?!! To become complex we had to start simple, and therefore implying there is a creator\u00a0who made that simple\u00a0first simple thing and \u00a0understandable. But then people argue that because we are so complex, we definitely must hate been created by God. Which makes sense too because if there really is a being who gave us life, then he is capable of doing much greater things. He was intelligent enough to create being who can also create new things. If we created a robot like in the movie iRobot, The robot would never be able to understand how we were capable of creating him and try to understand us based on their design. He would have his own thoughts and feelings and feel like he owns them. He&#39;ll feel so fully in charge of himself that he wouldn&#39;t give credit to us at\u00a0 all\u00a0anymore. He could even turn against us.Faith is not proved by physical evidence, its felt spiritually. Just like we can&#39;t see love, but we know it when we feel it. That&#39;s God\u00a0\u00a0for true Christians. So stop criticizing and making fun of Christians when you don&#39;t even understand\u00a0 or know what the whole bible says. If you only read certain parts of the bible to hear what you want, is like a reality TV show that cuts bits and pieces out of what someone is saying so that the TV show can look more interesting, even if cutting these scenes out makes the person look dumb. because all those TV shows want is more viewers, more money.Anyway in case you didn&#39;t know who God is. The Bible clearly explains who God is. It says God is love. It literally says God is love. Christians believe that Love is God. So where ever there is love that&#39;s God&#39;s presence. That&#39;s not a difficult matter to grasp. Stop ridiculing Christians , because I&#39;m pretty sure you have believed and felt love before. You have felt and believed in something unseen. You need faith to feel loved, beause someone can hug you and say they love you, but it the end is whether you believe them or not. You have to have faith that the love that person professes for you is real and have faith that you can trust them. Even if u decide to not believe in God, don&#39;t ridicule Christians for having faith in the unseen, when clearly u have had faith in unseen things as well, such as trust, love, hope, and\u00a0joy.
