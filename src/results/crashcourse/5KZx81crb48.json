The script has made the same mistake as the Hyatt Regency walkway design engineer! The tension rod was always supposed to support both walkways.

The top rod was fine, but its connection to the hollow beam section was exposed to roughly twice as much load as originally designed for, and it was torn out of the wall of the hollow beam.

Imagine what would happen if you pulled hard on the ends of the meter stick. Now imagine the meter stick is sawed in half right below the first tube, punched back through it a few centimeters away from the first hole, and again glued in place.
