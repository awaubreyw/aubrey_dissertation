It&#39;s a shame you don&#39;t talk more about how alchemy often was the process of transmuting oneself. If you read those old manuscripts you get to understand that indeed they were working physically on metals - but they would see a direct link between what is going on in the furnace and what would be going on inside of them, turning their own dark, unholy matter into something that is more noble. Take the second line of the emerald tablets &quot;[...]which is below is like that which is above &amp; that which is above is like that which is below[...]&quot;, for me it expresses the spiritual (what is above) quest of becoming a better human through the alchemical work (what is below). I say it&#39;s a shame because it seems to really be in the center of the whole thing, and you can&#39;t really describe the alchemical work through its byproducts as perfumes and gunpowder... If Newton had to hide its alchemical works it&#39;s also because alchemy is accompanied with a gnostic belief system often seen as a heresy. It&#39;s really a hole theory of how nature works and sometimes seeing everything as ONE (&quot;And as all things have been &amp; arose from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.&quot;)  is not well seen by christians for whom there really are 3 things to account for in religion (father, god, holy spirit) etc...
