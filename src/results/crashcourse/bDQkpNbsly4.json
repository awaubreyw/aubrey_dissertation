Indian history was subdued and underplayed by many nations of the world except south east and the East Asian . The primary due to the colonial experience here are some facts :<br>1:- India knew hypotenuse theorem way before pythogoras .cited in Baudhyana sulbasturas it also deals with a lot of geometry intricate calculations, etc.<br>2:- India has the oldest system of architecture in vastu shastra  which is very symmetrical and far superior to Hellinistic Greece or Rome of virtuvan .<br>3:- India has six schools of traditional logic system Buddhist logic system and jain logic system . Unlike the Greek who followed the fallibility and in fallibility , Buddhist had four stages of logical out put and Jain&#39;s had six .This is a fundamental difference in the metaphysics that evolved in a rich mathematical system .<br>4:- India was best in metallurgy zinc, steel and iron wootz steel was the best until the 18th century . wrought iron was the best until the European enlightenment . Wootz steel was exported to Damascus which was used by the Muslims to win crusades. It became known as the Damascus steel .<br>5:- India is the originator of the heliocentric model . Aryabhatta in his book Aryabhatia proposed the model in the 4th century AD. he also defined sidereal motion ,equionxes , etc <br>6:- India is the originator of the decimal place value system and the number zero (0) only this is acknowledged <br>7:- India is the originator of algebra Al-jabbar  translated Indian algebra   in the 7th century and took it to middle east and later Al- Jabbar was called in Europe as Algebra .<br>8:- India is the originator of pi infinite series ,cousin series science series and the basis of calculus all this cited in Bhaskar acharya&#39;s  work  and also the infinite series evolved during Madhavacharyas work in Kerala . All of this before the 14th and the 15th century way before calculus was created .<br>9:- Trigonometry was invented independently in India. All the stupas in Hindu temples follow extremely accurate arc values The Sanchi stupa is a perfect hemispherical dome and present atleast during 3rd century and still exists now .<br>10:- the speed of the light estimation was mentioned first in the Atharva veda which is atleast 1500 BC .Also this was a more spiritual experience ,it was mentioned Never the less , along with this was the concept of infinity , negative numbers and metaphysics or zero .<br>11:- There are still 35 million untranslated texts waiting for scholars . Thats all the Indian civilization combined .<br>12:- pananis grammer grammer composed in classical sanskrit during sixth century BC is still used in computational linguistics and natural language processing infact all of the Indio- Aryan language used panninis grammer .<br>13:- Regarding mind science models, the Upanishads stand out as the ancient piece on mind science .it also evolved into yoga , Tantra all the School of classical thoughts Upanishads are atleast 1000 BC or earlier .<br>14:- The oldest text in metered poetry is Rigveda which is now dated atleast 3500 BC or earlier .<br><br>So , I understand history is not thought well to present Indians or people from elsewhere but in denial  of civilization and citing it primitive people is ridiculous . There are thousands of  evidences and we&#39;ll preserved texts that say to the opposite . All this texts that I have sites is well and alive. This is surviving despite the desecration of 12 , University&#39;s of ancient India including TAXILLA,NALANDA, VIKRAMSHILLA etc India also had other pieces of architecture the Shilpa shastra on art ,the Natya shastra on poetry the Panchatantra which is a precursor of Aesob&#39;s Fables it has the Dharma Dharma shastra on universal ethics ,the Arthashastra on state craft and economics , kamashastra on sexuality and Yogasutras on yoga it also has the mimamsa school of philosophy which is a comprehensive School of rational laws .Nyayashtra on school of logic ,agama shastra on Tempe building and plenty more . At the end it has the world oldest epic Ramayana and world largest in Mahabharata. So I request every one not to consider old Hindu civilization like a primitive civilization .it had a 1500 year&#39;s of classical period which is more than the Greeco-Roman-arabic classical period put together the civilization extended to whole of south east Asia right up to cambodia where we have the largest Hindu temple in Angkor wat and the largest empire of the end of classical period .Namaste \ud83d\ude4f", "comment_date": "2020-05-07T07:39:56Z", "likes_count": 201}, {"comment_by": "Tanay Sarkar", "comment_text": "In 1193 Muslim army led by Turkish leader Bakhtiyar Khilji attacked Nalanda University. they destroyed 95% of all holy educational books and burnt them to ashes also killed the teachers and students.

Just one example that I know of is from an Indian text called hanuman chalisa which predicted the distance to the Sun from the Earth 2 centuries before the 17th century scientists. This example is not even of an old text, the vedas are from 1100 BCE. Also remember that this number is when it was actually written down, considering that Vedas aren&#39;t written texts but spoken, they could be much older. Hinduism is the world&#39;s oldest religion, but in reality, its today&#39;s face has been corrupted by our current society and is not the true face of it. In reality, Hinduism is a way of life, that&#39;s where it gets the &#39;ism&#39;. It is not a religion, it is a guidebook, and a very detailed one. Hinduism teaches a way of life, it shows the best and happiest way to live it. Many think Mahabharata and Ramyana are fiction, read it once and tell me can anyone write such good fiction? The answer is no, it shows complex relationships, physiological behaviour and years of stories that is explained and shown so well that it can&#39;t be fiction, it is a mere recount of the events. No author is that good. Now you don&#39;t have to believe that, but if you are willing to read western books and novels, why not give an Indian scripture a try. These books aren&#39;t important for their holy status but rather they teach us a lot about life and the way to live it. The Vedas are full of sciences of all sorts. Fun fact, the people who disagree that vedas have any good knowledge in them, are studying it at the British Museum. Yes! The vedas aren&#39;t in India. Sanskrit is considered to be one of the most scientific and perfect language, and unlike English with silent letters every second word, it is perfect. To be honest, we have lost the knowledge that once made us some of the intellectual people, and that&#39;s why today, we have corruption, poor education system, basic infrastructure issues and poverty. Don&#39;t forget it is a fact that Chankaya took down an entire Kingdom from his politics and established one of the most prosperous empires in the world. Many of you, who read this comment will probably want to call me idiot and say that I have lost my brains, but the mere urge of yours reveals a lot about you intellect and nature. This is just a perspective, not an argument, because for something that is so erudite (search it on dictionary if you don&#39;t know the meaning) I am too uninformed and young to create an argument that can argue even 1/100000000 of its real value. I just want to say, why not read it just like you would read a novel.\u00a0 Fun fact: The British study the vedas and Sanskrit is though in Cambridge. Yoga has derived from vedas as a form of physical activity to keep you fit. Stephen Hawkins a genius has once told that the vedas have a theory that is superior to Albert Einstein&#39;s theory. Many might ask, how Indians ended up like this, maybe the invasions of barbaric stupid power conquers who looked at wealth as the amount of land they ruled over have lead India to this point, where its own youth argues against the glory of its vedic scriptures. Shame on any Indian who without reading the vedic text publicly calls them a joke. Just remember, our past educates the present to shape our future, and the moment we forget that past we are walking blindfolded into life.\u00a0<br><br><br><br>This comment isn&#39;t supposed to insult or offend anyone, many of you might think my view is ridiculous, then I geuss your smarter than Stephen Hawking.

Also, Alexander barely touched what is now Afghanistan and Pakistan and never made it into the core of India - the Ganges plains. So the Greeks had little to no effect on Chandragupta Maurya.

(al cohol meaning &quot;the cohol&quot; in Arabic, &quot;cohol&quot; being the Sanskrit word\u00a0for an alcoholic beverage made from barley), invented universities, steel beam construction, Damascus steel,\u00a0chainmail armor,\u00a0cotton, marijuana, yoga and\u00a0MEDITATION!\u00a0....among other things. The only country in the world to have an ocean named after it.. heck they have their own tectonic plate!

His name was Panini. He lived before Buddha and other great philosophers of sixth century BCE. Though he mentioned several great grammarians before his time, we don\u2019t know anything about them. We could not get their books. Panini\u2019s grammar book Ashtadyayi was the first in the world.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>Here is a story of a person who gained the greatest knowledge in the world of languages by the grace of Lord Shiva! Tamil Hindus in South India and their counter parts in North India consider Lord Shiva was the one who gave them the language and the grammar.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>The world is not celebrating Panini\u2019s work Ashtadyayi or Paniniyam just because it was the first grammar book known in any language, but because of its amazing structure. He constructed a grammar for Sanskrit which shows the greatest height to which human\u00a0thought\u00a0can raise. This marvellous thing happened 2700 years ago!<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>Homer\u2019s Iliad was just 100 years old by that time. Other languages except Sanskrit did not have any literature at all! Moses could repeat only Ten Commands of the God! Of course we have Gilgamesh in the Middle East and some other writings in Hieroglyphs (Book of Dead) in Egypt. But they are all museum materials and that too primitive thinking without any higher thoughts. They are not literature. But Sanskrit had huge volume of literature by then. The world\u2019s greatest literary wonder Rig Veda was reverberating in the nook and corner of Asia. Turkey had Rig Vedic Gods in Cuneiform letters. And Rig Veda is still preserved in its pristine form without a change of single syllable. All this is done by word of mouth!! That is another world wonder. Nowhere in the world a literature of that size is preserved without writing till today!<br><br>Smiling Shiva in Gangaikonda Chozapura, Tamil Nadu<br><br>Lord Shiva\u2019s Grace!<br><br>Panini was a student of Guru (teacher) Varsha. He was the dullest student in the group. Guru (teacher) was not happy. Guru\u2019s wife also told him to go out into the world and learn the basics. He went to the Himalayas and did penance. Lord Shiva appeared before him and told him that he was fully satisfied with his\u00a0prayer\u00a0and was ready to give him whatever he wanted. Panini was very intelligent. He did not ask for gold coins or beautiful women or a kingdom. He asked Lord Shiva to bestow him knowledge in the language. Shiva was very happy started to dance. His kettle drum boomed and the Himalayan Mountains echoed it.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>Paninni was so focussed he could get only 14 beats from the drum called \u2018Damaruka\u2019 in Sanskrit. Based on the fourteen sounds he wrote the most famous grammar book in the world called Eight Chapters (In Sanskrit Ashta+Adhyayi). It contains 3959 Sutras. Sutra means formulas. He wouldn\u2019t waste a single space. Even if he could avoid a full stop or a comma he would feel as if he had saved one million dollars. But his grammar was complete, no gap, no incoherency.<br><br>1. a i u \u1e47<br>2. \u1e5a\u1e37 k<br>3. e o \u1e45<br>4. ai au c<br>5. ha ya va ra \u1e6d<br>6. la \u1e47<br>7. \u00f1a ma \u1e45a \u1e47a na m<br>8. jha bha \u00f1<br>9. gha \u1e0dha dha \u1e63<br>10. ja ba ga \u1e0da da \u015b<br>11. kha pha cha \u1e6dha tha ca \u1e6da ta v<br>12. ka pa y<br>13. \u015ba \u1e63a sa r<br>14. ha l<br><br>This contain all the letters of Sanskrit language.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>He mentioned 500 towns in his work. This shows his vast geographical knowledge. He talks about 51st generation of Bharadwaja etc. This shows his knowledge in the ancient history of India. People erected a statue for him in his birth place, now in Pakistan. Chinese traveller Huan Taang saw the statue 1400 years ago. Patanjali who wrote a commentary praised him as Bhagavan Panini. Like Divine Homer and Divine Tiruvalluvar he was called Divine Panini. He was considered a seer \u2013 a Maharishi.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>Patanjali says that holding the holy grass Dharba in his hand, facing East, he wrote the marvellous grammar in the world. I will explain the 14 sounds he heard in another article. They are called Maheswarani Sutrani. Brahmins repeat the 14 sutras every year on the day they change their sacred thread and start the Vedic studies again. Great Sanskrit scholars say that his grammar is closer to Vedic language than classical Sanskrit. He never mentioned Buddha or Mahavira. He lived well before their time.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>Panini mentioned the grammarians before his time: Upavarsha, Parasarya, Karmanda, Sakatayana, Apitali and Sakalya. When he was going into a jungle with his students, there came a tiger! All the students ran away. But Panini stared at the tiger and analysed the word Vyagra, Sanskrit word for tiger.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>Western linguists wonder how a person can write a grammar in such a scientific way at that period. Most of the world was uncivilised at that time. But India had produced wealthy literature, quantitatively and qualitatively very high.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>In Kashmir a king passed an order that everyone must learn Ashtadyayi and those who passed in it were awarded 1000 gold coins each!<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>Panini died on a Trayodasi day (13th day either after the full moon or new moon). Even today traditional learners of Sanskrit in North India declare holiday for the studies on 13th day. Unlucky number 13!! Author of Panchatantra Vishnusarman said that Panini was killed by a lion. We know that his town was Salaturya in Pakistan and his\u00a0mother\u00a0was Dakshi. All other details and stories about him are just hearsay!<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>The name Panini is synonymous with the words WONDER, MARVELLOUS and AMAZING.

There was no centralised government, instead there was separate states with governments or monarchs ruling over them. They acted as countries do now and traded with each other. People didn&#39;t move around freely from state to state, however, there were no borders. Google this or read some actual history books on the South Asian subcontinent. I&#39;m Balochi and Kashmiri, my ancestors were never Indian. Indian is not an ethnicity, it&#39;s a nationality. Pakistani is also a nationality, not an ethnicity. <br><br>The British united the states under the banner of British India to make ruling easier as a central power. They also consolidated paganistic folk religions, they called it Hinduism. Hindu comes from Indus which is a Greek word. The langauge, Hindi, didn&#39;t exist before the British came, it was called Urdu. Urdu comes from Ordu, which is Turkish. Ordu is also where the word Horde comes from in English.<br><br>I stopped watching the video 1 minute and 2 seconds in once I heard bullshism a couple of times.

It\u2019s very easy to blame European colonialists for disparaging the word India, but why haven\u2019t we claimed this name? What are we sitting around for twiddling our thumbs for? Pakistan should have done to the Republic of India as Greece did to the Republic of Macedonia.<br><br>The Macedonia naming dispute is a political dispute regarding the use of the name Macedonia between Greece and the Republic of Macedonia, formerly a federal unit of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, the former Socialist Republic of Macedonia gained independence in 1991, naming itself Macedonia. Citing historical and territorial concerns resulting from the ambiguity between the Republic of Macedonia, the adjacent Greek region of Macedonia and the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon which falls mostly within Greek Macedonia, Greece opposed the use of the name &quot;Macedonia&quot; by the Republic of Macedonia without a geographical qualifier such as &quot;Northern Macedonia&quot; for use by all and for all purposes. As millions of ethnic Greeks identify themselves as Macedonians, unrelated to the Slavic people who are associated with the Republic of Macedonia, Greece further objects to the use of the term &quot;Macedonian&quot; for the neighboring country&#39;s largest ethnic group and its language. The Republic of Macedonia is accused of appropriating symbols and figures that are historically considered part of Greek culture such as the Vergina Sun and Alexander the Great, and of promoting the irredentist concept of a United Macedonia, which involves territorial claims on Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia. The dispute has escalated to the highest level of international mediation, involving numerous attempts to achieve a resolution. In 1995, the two countries formalized bilateral relations and committed to start negotiations on the naming issue, under the auspices of the United Nations. Until a solution is found, the provisional reference &quot;the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&quot; (sometimes unofficially abbreviated as FYROM) is used by international organizations and states that do not recognize translations of the constitutional name Republic of Macedonia. UN members, and the UN as a whole, have agreed to accept any final agreement on a new name resulting from negotiations between the two countries.<br><br>Similarly, Pakistan should have done the same to the Republic of India, which has no valid claim on the term India \u2013 neither geographically (Indus Valley vs Ganges plain), neither religiously (Early Vedic beliefs vs Brahminism) and neither culturally.
