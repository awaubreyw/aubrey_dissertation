The mixture of compressed air and fuel on the piston of an engine is not enough to move the piston up and down.

Put an additional two groups of 6balls in a triangular shape to be placed somewhere at the back of 15balls at least 4inches apart from the sidewall and back wall. A total of 15balls + 6balls + 6balls = 21balls. The explosion creates collisions after collisions increasing the energy output.\r<br>\r<br>After explosion the work done increased 21 times.

Energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out\u00a0 photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including heat and light are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations. The most important aspect in thermodynamic is heat. What is heat? Heat is dynamic photons per volume per time. High heat means high temperature due to high availability of dynamic photons within a system as a result of the presence of a heat emitter. In the contrary, low heat means low temperature due to low availability of photons within a system as a result of the\u00a0 presence of a heat absorber.\u00a0Currently temperature has been defined as the average kinetic of atoms within a system. Why and how high temperature leads to high kinetic energy have not been explained? Likewise\u00a0why and how low temperature leads to low kinetic energy of atoms within a system have not been explained too? Without any doubt that photons is the missing link between temperature and average kinetic energy. Higher temperature means higher availability of photons will lead to higher kinetic energy of atoms within a system after they have stockpiled more stationary photons from a heat emitter. In the contrary, lower temperature means lower availability of photons will result\u00a0to lower kinetic energy after atoms within a system dissipate more photons to the surrounding that absorbed by a heat absorber more than the one that they absorbed from the surroundings that subsequently leading them to have lower kinetic energy. Thermodynamic is all about heat (dynamic photons in particular). We should exam on how\u00a0dynamic photons interact with atoms within a system that\u00a0leads to work done rather than relying on some mathematical equation to explain thermodynamic phenomenon. If you are interested in real discoveries, I would recommend you to read my book, The Unification Theory - Volume One and you will be amazed with lots of\u00a0new, interesting discoveries.

Order and disorder are very ambiguous terms and one can be confused for the other.  But if you think of it like bouncy balls in a container, you realize they will spread out, and the likelyhood of them being in any particular configuration is small.  Basically things become distributed.  A balanced coin given enough flips, will be near 50%, a 6 sided die will eventually have 1/6th chance for each number to be rolled.  A coin has less entropy than a 6 sided die, because there&#39;s more states a 6 sided die can take.  A molecule of air moving in a 2d plane has 360 degrees of freedom, all equally likely, so it&#39;s easy to see how in a 3d world with so much interacting the amount of entropy is insanely big.  One person&#39;s ordered chess board might be another person&#39;s mess, people can define order as simply a state they find desirable so ti&#39;s entirely too loose a term to truly understand why when you put a drop of color into a water bowl, the water bowl becomes evenly distributed in color over time.  Yet, one person might say that the system started out disorderly (non uniform) and became orderly (uniform distribution of color)  when in fact, this is exactly what entropy is, in action.  The molecules distributed evenly.  Heat does the same, and it&#39;s all driven by the same statistics as that flipping coin.  When you have a lot of ways to equally do something, and enough time/iterations, the average is represented.  Anyway that is the method I use to think of it as the order/disorder example always confused me.", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T08:41:14Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"4i1MUWJoI0U": {"Thermodynamics: Crash Course Physics #23": {"channel_id": "UgxtpHI2RK6AwbCj5Tp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Jeff Creighton", "comment_text": "Another way of saying this is that Energy is Energy either potential or relative.", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T21:24:52Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"4i1MUWJoI0U": {"Thermodynamics: Crash Course Physics #23": {"channel_id": "Ugxc_48fHy4yMMnKCQx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Angel Whalen", "comment_text": "TALKING TOO DAMN FAST TO TEACH!
