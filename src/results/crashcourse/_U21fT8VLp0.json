I am so tired of everyone misusing the term AI... mostly for clickbait &amp; because they don&#39;t know what it truly means. Not all robots are AI... far from it. You mentioned the word &quot;programming&quot; several times. If a system has to be programmed then by definition it is not AI. Just like human intelligence is not programmed down to every last possibility. Intelligence &amp; learning are providing a framework or base data &amp; having the system whether it be a human or a robot learn &amp; grow above said framework.  For example if give someone / something  1 widget a day &amp; they inferred that they will have 7 widgets in a week... that is not intelligence, that&#39;s is just computation using another predefined framework, arithmetic. I have seen people attached AI to a toaster. A toaster was programmed to make toast. Yes I may be able to remember your preferences but it will never be able to outgrow its original programming.
