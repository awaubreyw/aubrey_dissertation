Chadian Arabic and Juba Arabic have five vowels, which is actually typical for colloquial Arabic varieties, though Classical Arabic has just three vowels.\r<br>\r<br>In fact, a five-vowel system is the most common around the world, so it can be considered a medium-sized inventory. Most Afro-Asiatic languages in Africa excluding North Africa including Hausa, Beja, and Oromo have five vowels. Ethiopian Semitic languages like Amharic and Tigrinya have seven as do Tuareg languages, and Somali has ten. Seven and up can be considered large inventories. So most Afro-Asiatic languages in the region fall in the middle of the spectrum, with a few outliers that can be described as having large vowel inventories.

Strictly, [e] and [o] are close-mid vowels, not simply mid vowels. We often use them for mid vowels in the case of five-vowel systems like Spanish, but for languages like English we need to be careful about distinguishing them from their open-mid counterparts [\u025b] and [\u0254], especially for the latter since several English vowels are conventionally transcribed with it.\r<br>\r<br>This might not be a problem if they decided to stick to the simpler vowel symbols throughout, but they don&#39;t. Writing the diphthong in CHOICE as [oi] while writing the PRICE and MOUTH diphthongs as [a\u026a] and [a\u028a] is simply inconsistent. The CHOICE diphthong should conventionally be [\u0254\u026a], as it appears in the English vowel chart in the video for General American. If we were using the simpler symbols on purpose then we would also write [ai] and [au] for PRICE and MOUTH.\r<br>\r<br>Today&#39;s Parisian French pronunciation of the nasalized vowel in &quot;bon&quot; actually is close to [\u00f5], even though the traditional symbol is [\u0254\u0303] (which is still appropriate for many French dialects). But given the confusion of [o] and [\u0254] elsewhere in the video, I wonder if this is intentional. Ironically, the host&#39;s pronunciation of &quot;bon&quot; is much closer to Parisian French than her pronunciation of &quot;beau&quot;, which is too open and closer to *[b\u0254], not the correct [bo].\r<br>\r<br>Californian &quot;dude&quot; does not have [\u026f]; it is fronter than that, at best a slightly rounded [\u0268].

Case in point farsi is named after the Fars province in Iran which used to be Pars until the Arabs showed up.

Similarly Latin and Greek words that came into Arabic that started with a \u201cK\u201d or a \u201cC\u201d depending on which language they came from are both represented with the letter &quot;\u0642&quot; in Arabic which is much deeper and in the back of the throat than either of the two sounds earlier. This could be due to the fact that in the past those Latin and Greek words were said with a Harder sound that the Arabs adapted to their own script, or it could just be that in those times it was more popular to use that sound than it is these days. Many dialects, including the Gulf dialects and Iraqi have turned that symbol into more of a \u201cG\u201c sound.", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T22:54:07Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "UgwnjhwE78a1qxMTDGF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Aidan Sankowsky", "comment_text": "Portuguese would\u2019ve been a good example of nasal vowels", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T22:47:54Z", "likes_count": 26}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "UgzmDWIJL6PyDceyWW54AaABAg", "comment_by": "Matheus b", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t stress enough how much I love this channel and specifically this series, I&#39;ve recommended it to students, peers and former professors of mine.

IPA is universal.<br><br>i wrote a paper on ToBI labelling of a person who has broca&#39;s aphasia- a condition where someone cannot articulate speech easily (the severity fluctuates case by case). except for long, corrective pauses- which are functionally ignorable in ToBI labelling- the man&#39;s intonation was characteristic of modern american english, despite his aphasia. this was only one research paper done with one audio sample (tho it was long) and by one undergrad student (me) so yknow, take it with a grain of salt. still, i think its interesting.<br><br>another interesting thing about vowels and their gradient vs categorical nature is that, when languages evolve, vowels have an easier time &quot;moving around&quot; than consonants do. in historical lingustics, when we see something that looks like a sound change, we then look for its motivation. why did (phoneme) become (other phoneme)? for example: if by some accident of the morphology a voiced consonant appears at the end of the word, it is common for that consonant to become voiceless. the motivation for this is that sounds at the end of words (and syllables!) tend to drop off in &#39;hearability&#39;, meaning syllable and word final sounds are less important to make linguistic distinctions than syllable and word initial sounds and much less so than the vowels of the nucleus. because of this drop off, the voiced distinction becomes less important and that distinction is lost, making those voiced consonants voiceless.<br><br>vowels, on the other hand, sometimes just dont have motivations, altho they do have them usually. just by the nature of being close to another vowel space can turn one vowel into another. but just because it can, doesnt mean it will: two segments which differ in only voicing are &quot;close&quot; but it takes a more specific circumstance to alter that feature.<br><br>also, the hearability of word and syllable final sounds has another effect cross-linguistically: it is never required of a language&#39;s phonology to have a coda. a coda being the name of the segment occurring at the end of a syllable. and: a language&#39;s phonology will never forbid an onset- onset being the name of the segment occurring at the beginning of a syllable. to tie the whole thing together, the segment between the onset and coda is called the nucleus, and is required for the syllable to exist. you can see this played out with the number of languages which require onsets (arabic) and forbid codas (hawai&#39;ian): a lot, with ones that do the literal opposite: none! whew i got really excited about some stuff. i cant wait for the phonology video where i&#39;ll probably talk about even more stuff!!", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T20:28:43Z", "likes_count": 80}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "UgxNjK2QX2E8oOq5KFp4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Gus Logsdon", "comment_text": "What was that French word..?", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T20:28:07Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "UgxpLDBG8A8dtIbPZLN4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Pallav Goyal", "comment_text": "&quot;No longer disemvoweled.&quot; Love it!", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T20:24:24Z", "likes_count": 102}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "UgzU4YPecGW5bMaexSh4AaABAg", "comment_by": "ve", "comment_text": "This video helped me a lot with my speech and now I can see my R sonds better", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T20:23:31Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "UgxtiCVBm4A5vHoCucl4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Lily Water", "comment_text": "Hopefully, they&#39;ll take about Korean in the next episode.", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T20:15:56Z", "likes_count": 0}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "Ugx80XQd849xUunhFRt4AaABAg", "comment_by": "linguaphile88", "comment_text": "Wait, in French the nasalized &quot;o&quot; is pronounced [\u0254\u0303] not [o\u0303].", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T20:08:39Z", "likes_count": 4}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "Ugy2pRIEZKPgyWrUazF4AaABAg", "comment_by": "Pablo Morralla", "comment_text": "i got SO excited when i saw the notification, THANK U", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T20:08:37Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "UgxKhJVcoeikXN6ptJ14AaABAg", "comment_by": "Levan Alucard", "comment_text": "Hi love the videos, is there anywhere i could find the a list of translations of all the word bubbles in the intro?", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T19:47:40Z", "likes_count": 1}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "Ugy2ICkG4ZbK6o5-THR4AaABAg", "comment_by": "ali sardo", "comment_text": "Using Vowels is a genuine test to distinguish a native english speaker from others\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T19:45:59Z", "likes_count": 12}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "UgykZSCTJVPSjc3OzUx4AaABAg", "comment_by": "dvdr14eb", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPTL5x0QW-Y&amp;t=6m07s\">6:07</a> vowel gang. au!", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T19:45:24Z", "likes_count": 5}}}, {"qPTL5x0QW-Y": {"Phonetics - Vowels: Crash Course Linguistics #9": {"channel_id": "Ugzok53xIbVOLEd07U94AaABAg", "comment_by": "Andruo Beck", "comment_text": "When a teacher enjoys teaching, then the student also enjoys studying.
