These macromolecules are polymers (sequences of smaller molecules put together). Cells can only take in a polymers individual component (monomers). Monomers include Fatty acids, sugars, amino acids and nucleotides. The whole point of the digestive system is to break down polymers into monomers that the body can use to make its own polymers and obtain energy from.\r<br>Alimentary canal (gastrointestinal tract) runs from your mouth to your anus    \r<br>\r<br>As food enters the mouth both mechanical and chemical digestion occurs. The teeth (incisors, canines, premolars and molars) crush and cut food and is an example of mechanical digestion. Chemical digestion takes place as amylase which breaks down carbs is released through saliva. After the bolus (chewed food) is swallowed it travels past the pharynx, down the oesophagus where through muscle movements (peristalsis) the bolus reaches the stomach. The stomach has four layers in its lining from outermost to innermost the mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa and serosa. The muscularis includes an additional layer of smooth muscle for mechanical digestion and the inner mucosa is almost entirely made up of mucous cells which produce a protective mucous to keep the stomach safe from acids. The lining contains millions of gastric pits which lead to tubular gastric glands which contain various secretory cells which create potent chemicals. For example parietal cells in the tubular gastric glands release hydrochloric acid to kill bacteria and denature proteins for easier breakdown from enzymes. When hydrochloric acid is combined with the inactive enzyme pepsinogen made by chief cells the combination results in pepsin.Pepsin is a powerful enzyme that breaks down proteins. Enteroendocrine cells in the tubular gastric glands release regulatory hormones, like serotonin and histamine to trigger the release of more acid by other cells or to contract muscle tissue. When needed somatostatin is released to inhibit secretions. G cells secrete gastrin which stimulates the release of other gastric fluids and controls muscle activity.", "comment_date": "2019-11-10T10:13:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jean-Luc C", "comment_text": "I thought the enteroendocrine cells released gastrin as well as other hormones.", "comment_date": "2019-11-08T09:21:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "echo LOGNAME", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqgcEIaXGME&amp;t=8m35s\">8:35</a> is why IBS can be so problematic for some people.
