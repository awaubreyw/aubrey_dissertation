Likewise were you to universalize breaking promises you would make promises meaningless and people &quot;would laugh at utterances of this kind as empty shams.&quot;  This is very disappointing as videos like this are a valuable tool.  The video on Aristotle&#39;s virtue ethics is also not quite right.  Aristotle does not advocate finding the &quot;middle point&quot; between a virtue and a vice, but advocates finding the proper balancing point that may not be the middle point at all.

Kant actually wrote, in his Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason, that morality inevitably leads to religion, since we must presuppose both God and Immortality if we are to realize the object towards which morality directs us. (Simply put: in order to become a fully good person, Kant thought that we needed an infinite amount of time, since we can only ever get better and better at becoming virtuous, i.e. becoming such that what we want to do is already what we ought to do. This lead Kant to believe that our life must continue after our death, since otherwise we would not have the time we need to become moral persons, and the moral law requires of us that we become such persons. Without immorality, therefore, we could not actually satisfy the law which we are commanded to obey--and this was inconceivable to Kant. God enters the picture because who else could grant us this afterlife? God and Immortality were not conditions of the moral law, but they were regarded by Kant as being conditions of our ability to satisfy the moral law. And so, according to Kant, morality inevitably leads to religion; and this argument is what has come to be known as the moral argument for God.) <br><br>You&#39;re right to note, though, that for Kant, morality could not <b>begin</b> with God. Why? Because if we, like the divine command theorists, begin from a position supporting God&#39;s commandments, then the only reason one would have to act morally would be a fear of God. But many atheists, who did not fear God, themselves felt obligated to be moral. So, for Kant, it&#39;s not that divine command theory can&#39;t tell us <b>what</b> we <b>ought</b> to do--it certainly can--but divine command theory cannot give us the truth of our moral condition, because everyone feels the command of duty, but not all fear God. This revealed to Kant that the source of our moral principle cannot lie in a fear of God, but must lie somewhere else. He eventually realized that the source of this principle, having its effects present to every rational individual, must be located within the will of the rational being itself--and this is why, for Kant, being moral and being free (autonomous) are the same thing. The obligation is self-wrought, and that is why everyone acknowledges it.", "comment_date": "2020-01-27T20:38:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Big Reg", "comment_text": "It seems to me, philosophers took their sayings from the bible and redistributed its truth as their own theories.

To me, this is the same line of reasoning that relieves a soldier from responsibility when he is following orders (the orders in this case being the categorical imperative) no matter what atrocity follows. Actually, I think a stronger argument could be made that Elvira would have the least amount of responsibility when lying (in this instance) since her intentions were actually to spare Tony&#39;s life. She would be guilty of lying, but not the murder. However, if she provided the honest information the stranger wanted, then she would be guilty of being an accomplice to murder. In my opinion, this is an ethical dilemma. The only acceptable choice in this situation would be for Elvira to tell the stranger that she is not going to answer that question because she has no interest in contributing to murder. This maintains the categorical imperative and relieves Elvira from any responsibility in Tony&#39;s possible death. The bad part about this choice is that it would almost certainly result in Elvira&#39;s torture or demise at the hands of the stranger, but this is the price of a consistent application of ethical behavior.", "comment_date": "2018-11-24T06:34:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zenth Wolf", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bIys6JoEDw&amp;t=7m45s\">7:45</a> I don&#39;t see how Kant could justify my actions in watching this video.

Thats because the choice of to live even in annoying conditions is of moral worth.<br>What&#39;s reason? Oh, its the power to judge the reality that passes through the filter&#39;s of the mind, the categories.  Oh, &quot;reality&quot; is a category, too... uh... wait... Reality is a subjective or intersubjective creation. So reason is the power of change reality, and there is no &quot;real reality&quot; as independent of consciousness but consciousness solely.&quot;<br><br>I have problems with the epistemological status of that principle exemplified.<br>Maybe for accept an distinction between perceptual and conceptual knowledge, and opossed to Kant reserve the term &quot;analysis&quot; just for the act of focus your mind on some aspect of the reality and &quot;synthesis&quot; to the act of relating the products of analysing, that is a source of knowledge, too.<br>For that reason, propose a principle at the conceptual level to be a &quot;law of reality&quot; that you can&#39;t help but follow is a mistake, I think. Cos a principle that you can&#39;t help but follow has to be something self-evident in every conscious act. And the law of every conscious act is: something exists - things have identity - you know it. IDENTITY is omnipresent. So, coming to think about the human nature you finds, before several steps of cognitive development as a child, it as a conscious, living being = goal directed. Its is a self-evident truth that every conscious action pursues some viewed good. Try to disagree, wanting to save some reserved intelectual cautiousness, and you will found out it. But the good is not self-evident.  Then, every moral enquiry renders to &quot;whats is good for a conscious living being? &quot;. You comes back to &quot;categorical imperatives&quot;.

However the patient inspects the food and discovers there are psych meds in the food. Now she refuses to eat all food.

Here we have no escape,<br>random fluctuations simply fallback to the same meaningless state (the ergodic<br>attractor). The world is identical in all respects, corresponding to the quantum<br>vacuum, and we can say nothing useful about it. Given a world not yet at such<br>equilibrium, all actions here take place mindlessly, regardless of consequences, as<br>the world runs down (dissipates) towards &#39;heat death&#39; - this is the behaviour of<br>inanimate objects. In human terms these are the automatic responses, the reflexes,<br>those very simple physical cause-effect chains over which we have no control.<br>Despite the &#39;observers&#39; having values, reflected in what is chosen to be observed,<br>scientifically they pretend that they do not, and hence take no responsibility for their<br>behaviours, this world is ethically barren.<br><br>Level 1: Reactive - The World of Distinctions<br>This reactive thought mode is often associated with emotions, here we &#39;take sides&#39;,<br>we polarise into either/or positions. This is the mode of love/hate or fight/flee, a<br>bipolar classification of the stable versus the unstable, the &#39;us&#39; and the &#39;them&#39;, the<br>world of basic discrimination that attempts to reduce diverse order (viewed<br>paradoxically as disorder or &#39;heresy&#39;) in a striving to conformity, a biased walk through state space to a single static far-from-equilibrium &#39;utopia&#39; (a self-maintaining<br>autopoiesis). This is also the bureaucratic world of &#39;no exceptions&#39;, no options, no<br>choice and &#39;taboos&#39;. Actions here promote systemic valuations and social dogmas,<br>disjoint categories of &#39;right&#39; and &#39;wrong&#39; within mind and isolated scientific &#39;facts&#39;,<br>resulting in fixed behaviours based upon an inflexible &#39;box&#39; mentality (the point<br>attractor).<br><br>Level 2: Uniordinal - The World of Measurement<br>At this point we discover variability, but in only one-dimension. We fixate on single<br>paths (the cyclic attractor), single variables, single issues. We have one track minds,<br>trying to maximise and perfect an isolated value (e.g. money). Actions here establish<br>linear hierarchies of the better and worst, extrinsic valuations and deterministic<br>(dynamical) scientific functions fit into this mode, which positions all issues along a<br>continuum. Whilst many different continuums (based upon each systemic distinction) may exist, only one is employed at any time by any group. These axes remain disjoint<br>and unconnected (e.g. academic specialisms).<br><br>Level 3: Multiordinal - The World of Possibility<br>At this level we discover inter-relationships, that we have many values within<br>ourselves or that our viewpoint must mesh with those of essential others. We create<br>for the first time a whole (the strange attractor), whether at a personal level or at a<br>social one (e.g. the individual, the state or the ecology becomes important). We fight<br>for the preservation of our chosen whole, for the chosen level of detail. Here actions<br>focus on single scales, ignoring shorter and longer term consequences, wider and<br>narrower issues, in order to optimise a single intrinsic value, a chosen (but isolated)<br>set of objectives, which often interact nonlinearly and can only be described<br>scientifically in probabilistic terms.<br><br>Level 4: Synergic - The World of Actuality<br>This is the real world, where all the levels interact. We cannot in our actions pretend<br>that their effects are restricted to single levels. In considering the issues we must now take account of all the various wholes and how they affect each other. To optimise this actual world we need an holarchic valuation, we need to consider multiple timescales, multiple spatial scales and multiple emergent levels and the full dynamics of their interactions. Here we also begin to understand that many different short-term solutions (or transient attractors) are possible, depending upon the interactions employed, many different niches or balances of values are equally valid.

In the original, an axe murderer comes to your door asking you where &quot;Tony&quot; is so they can kill him.

Kant said that this is fine, that you can not be held responsible for Tony&#39;s brutal murder because the killer is a rational agent and made their own moral decisions. This goes against common sense morality which says you shouldn&#39;t just let Tony get dismembered and feel like nothing bad happened or that you didn&#39;t do anything wrong.

I thought it was CC&#39;s fault but the fault lies with Kant. Since the previous example is about a chom-chom (which sounds un-1700s Prussia), and the murderer example was introduced with a &quot;Let&#39;s say...&quot; and Kant&#39;s first quote therein was clearly not a quote (because &quot;Tony&quot;), I incorrectly assumed that the murderer example was as much a creation of CC as the chom-chom one (presumably?) is. And since it&#39;s so dumb and only makes Kant look like a crazy person, I was very wrongly disappointed in CC for including it and so muddying the water.<br><br>However, as it turns out the murderer at the door example is famously Kant&#39;s. I do think CC should have made this clearer, and also acknowledged that it&#39;s widely considered a head-scratcher. Google &quot;murderer kant&quot; and the first result is a paper that starts:<br><br>&quot;Kant&#39;s example of lying to the murderer at the door has been a cherished source of scorn for thinkers with little sympathy for Kant&#39;s philosophy and a source of deep puzzlement for those more favorably inclined.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;m just saying, maybe point out that this example is problematic.
