You can think of Carbon arcs as basically working by bringing two charged carbon welding rod together so they arc the resulting plasma producing light. As they arc\u2019d this plasma ate away at rods so while one rod was could be advanced forward on a timed screw they didn\u2019t burn completely consistently so the other had to manually adjusted to keep the light produced steady. <br>\tThis meant at least one \u2018lamp op\u2019, or two, per light and then, maybe to keep departments relatively same size,  the grips became responsible for flagging as well as camera movement. <br>It also helps to concentrate the safety concerns of structural/mechanical rigging of hanging things over people heads separate from those of extremely hot sources of heat and electrical from large power sources. <br><br>In English system the \u2018sparks\u2019 just did both. <br><br>As I said the American hollywood system has become increasingly common but will still find crews trained both ways if you travel.", "comment_date": "2017-11-05T12:55:33Z", "likes_count": 32}, {"comment_by": "Josh Levan", "comment_text": "where is crash course art history?", "comment_date": "2017-11-05T04:13:17Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "loco_syndicate", "comment_text": "Are you gonna do music history next?
