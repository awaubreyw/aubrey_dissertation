Often people who don&#39;t know anything about the atmosphere automatically assume that humans cause climate change. This is not true. The normally cited proof that the world is warming is the correlation between the increase in human caused Carbon Dioxide emissions and warming temperatures. That is an incorrect conclusion. Most of the Carbon Dioxide on earth is dissolved in the oceans&#39; waters. The sun&#39;s output over the last century has been steadily increasing. Even a small increase in ocean temperature caused by the sun can release a great deal of Carbon Dioxide that is dissolved in the oceans. This amount of CO2 released by mother nature greatly exceeds what humans produce by industry and cars. Even though humans don&#39;t cause the majority of CO2 emissions we can still reduce emissions by switching to electric vehicles. Switching to solar or wind isn&#39;t the answer since they increase the cost of energy. A 1% increase in the world wide cost of energy causes an additional 2 million people in the world to starve to death due to the increase cost of food production. The real answer is to increase the use of nuclear generators. Nuclear produces no greenhouse gases at all and the waste products can be put back in the ground because we got the fuel from the ground in the first place. In the energy production industry on average there is one death per every 2000 man-years worked.

There needs to be a monetary incentive to lower emissions. What we need is a revenue-neutral carbon tax. This means you put a tax on fossil fuels, but all the revenue that the government gets from the tax is given back to people and corporations through broad-based tax cuts or direct government cheques. This means if an individual/corporation emits less CO2, they&#39;ll actually SAVE money.", "comment_date": "2017-07-14T02:10:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rafa\u0142 Ma\u0144ka", "comment_text": "carbon dioxide is not pollution", "comment_date": "2017-06-30T09:05:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Billiegirl77", "comment_text": "Im watching this now in 2017 and in Australia our current government which funnily enough is known as the Liberal party but are NOT liberal at all, in fact very conservative &amp; somewhat anti climate change. Prove this the previous government (known as the Labor party) had a carbon tax which the liberal party removed when they got in to government and the mining tax. Now they are pushing for a large coal mine to be open in QLD. The businessman from India who wants to open this mine needs more backing (i.e capital) but the public are pushing against this and in fact banks are too. Most of the banks are saying no to supporting the mine (giving him money) which makes them look great to consumers , as most Australian dont want this mine. (as meant to be one of the largest coal mines in the world and the produce of green gases will be very high -also the risk of damage to under water rivers and great barrier reef to shop the coal) but reality is banks know its a bad investment and in fact are investing in green energy. So with lack of capital the government wants to use tax payers money to fund this mine hoping to create a bundle of jobs (which has been question as well). Watching this video seems nothing change in fact the Liberal party are so in bed with the coal industry they subsidised the industry - (also so does the Labor party) -  and most of these large company of these mines pay lucky 1% tax. And they did a bunch of ads telling us coal is the future and even brought one into the parliament to prove its the only way.  We got a long way to go especially in Australia where coal is plentiful and one of our large exports.", "comment_date": "2017-06-18T11:49:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robyn", "comment_text": "what about the emissions from factory farming?!!? thats the no.1 cause of greenhouse gases!

To which the solution is automatically is &quot;more regulation, more taxation&quot;, how convenient for the leftists to get their cake and eat it, while calling anyone who has even a different way of dealing with CO2 emissions as a &quot;denier&quot;. That&#39;s the language of religion, not the language of science, science has deducible reasoning, not taken for granted assumptions. <br><br>More regulations and taxes, for the sake of feeling good about themselves, will in the end, only hurt the average joe. Businesses aren&#39;t the only ones affected, by affecting business you loose jobs, and that could descend into a recession.Cap and trade sounds nice and fuzzy but in reality, even entire one country reducing its co2 emissions is a drop in the ocean. (tragedy of the commons) And unless you want a world government telling you what to do (as is the open border globalist agenda), then its not to be over regulated. This idea that the earth will perish if we do not treat it like a snowflake is pure nonsense propagated at a mass level. I like renewable sources, since it could reduce money going to terrorism sponsors in the middle east, if the west is energy independent. Eventually we will run out of run out of fossil fuels, and we will need alternatives. But let the market take its course, don&#39;t force progress on society, change needs to be incremental and evolutionary not revolutionary.

Cities are planned and build around the idea that everyone owns a car, and thus everyone must own a car in order to get around because the distribution of essential services and workplaces is made for cars. We build everything important within the downtown area where few homes are available, but lots of stores and offices, and then we spread the homes in a 20-30 km circle around this downtown area. That&#39;s way too huge. Cities need more common transportation services and more cellular layouts. In the ideal city, everything you need in order to live should be available to you within a 15 minute walk away from your home. So instead of having one big downtown for every city, we have 20 micro downtowns surrounded by homes and everyone can just walk to their neighborhood&#39;s centralized service and work area.<br><br>This would alleviate the need for vehicles in our everyday life. You would still need a car every now a then to go see your parents that live in the next city, but that can be easily solved by renting one. Or you could still own a car but just not use it as much. I&#39;ve made the relatively annoying sacrifice of not wanting a car in my life. That means I have to use the bus, the only common transport available in my city, to get around. That means when I go grocery shopping, I can&#39;t hop between 5 different grocery stores to get the best deals. I just have to go to the nearest one (30 minute away by foot) and go back with a light enough haul to carry by hand (30 minutes back uphill with food bags, great exercise actually.) And when I need to go all the way to the end of town to visit a friend or get an item from a store that&#39;s not available anywhere else, I have to plan around the idea of spending 1-4 hours just moving towards and back from those places. Distances matter. <br><br>Not having a car sucks a lot, but I save a lot on the costs of owning one and my conscience is cleaner. It wouldn&#39;t be as annoying if the city I live in had a more thoughtful distribution of services and my employer didn&#39;t build the freaking building where I work 5 mins outside of the actual limits of the city (by car, which would take me 1 and half hour to reach on foot, thankfully there&#39;s one bus line that goes there.) The assumption that everyone has access, by means and choice, to a motorized vehicle makes it REALLY HARD to backpedal to a day an age where such luxuries wouldn&#39;t feel mandatory, but we somehow HAVE to.<br><br>Also we need to eat less meat and look at alternative means of producing it that pollutes less and we need to rely as much as humanly possible on local economies. Global markets require global transportation of shit tons of stuff. Again, distances matter and moving all this around is incredibly wasteful. Yet we are still, to this day, pushing the markets into that direction. Because cheap labor is awesome for profits and consumers!
