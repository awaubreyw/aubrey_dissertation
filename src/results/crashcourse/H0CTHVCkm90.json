If  the &quot;wrongdoer&quot; requires rehabilitation to understand how to fit into society, whose society (culture) are they fitting into.

Do you return them to the same microculture (this is what typically happens) and if so does that even make sense?  While punishment is at the core of most human societal beliefs (not quite a universal but close), and functionalism perceives deviance and its punishment as a function of society to prevent others from committing deviances (through knowledge of punishment as deterrence) it ignores this reality of microcultures existing.  Restorative justice as merely community service relegates this service to a punishment (which is how most people perceive community service sentences anyway) rather than really attempting to provide alternative views of others (victim-perpetrator dichotomy).  There are better restorative justice programs that exist outside of community service and those weren&#39;t even given honorable mention, including how effective philosophy classes are for prisoners in reducing recidivism and, if possible, having the &quot;wrongdoer&quot; and victim meet for a face to face conversation on their views on the deviant act.<br><br><br>I know philosophy always leads to more questions than it answers but these questions demand answers and debate.", "comment_date": "2019-06-13T13:44:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Artemis526", "comment_text": "Very important assumption that is missing in the example: all things being equal.

A failure of justice is not that a fat cat CEO gets away with embezzling funds, or a drug dealer getting off on bail never to be seen again, or an innocent man being sent to prison, for society marches on and girds itself against such further abuses and lapses. Nay I say a breakdown of justice is rioting in the streets, it is acts of vigilantism, and random violence without recourse; the loss of all that makes us secure in our lives. The punishment of criminals is but one of the means to that end. The others are the limiting of powers vested in our sovereign government, and the empowerment of individuals to seek recourse when things go wrong. So the next time you see a miscarriage of justice, do not think of it as a failure of the system, but an opportunity to improve upon it, contact your lawmakers and gather like minded individuals, not just for the change you want to see, but for the betterment of all society.<br><br>That my friend is the true essence of justice.", "comment_date": "2016-12-20T13:07:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Adams", "comment_text": "And yes, restorative justice is the best approach to punishment.

However, I disagree that violating your place in the social order because it&#39;s a place you don&#39;t want to hold is unjust. Forcing someone into a position that they don&#39;t want to be in isn&#39;t justice, and ergo defying it isn&#39;t unjust. However, that then raises the question &quot;are they simply not meant to hold that position- like their ability to contribute is being misunderstood, or is the issue a matter of application- they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re supposed to but in the wrong way?&quot; Either way, they were right to rebel against it. Justice would only be served if they were contributing to society in a way they could be satisfied with. <br><br>The problem with defining equality as &quot;everyone getting the same kind and amount of stuff no matter what&quot; is that it&#39;s way too easy to misconstrue. My mother works as a cafeteria lady, and due to the current school lunches program- they are required to give students all the same food even if they know full well the student doesn&#39;t want it and will just throw it away. That may be technically equal, but it&#39;s such a terrible system because it&#39;s not only wasteful, but it denies students who want something different- their needs aren&#39;t really being met anyway. That&#39;s not justice. So no, that&#39;s a terrible way to define equality. <br>Addressing the criticism that those who need more get more- leaving those who need less at a disadvantage. That is all kinds of wrong. Everyone has about the same amount of need, the problem isn&#39;t that some people need more than others- it&#39;s that some needs are harder to meet up to than others for certain kinds of people. <br><br>The idea of deserving different things is misconstrued as well. A lot of activities have a prerequisite cost, they simply lack the opportunity to earn beforehand. That puts people who already have access to those prerequisite costs at an unfair advantage over those who lack the connections to have such access. That&#39;s not fair. However, some people manage to find ways around the initial cost anyway, and one could call it unfair that they had to work to get around it while others simply have it moved out of the way for them. It&#39;s a lose-lose. Either you&#39;re unfair to the people who arbitrarily lack access to opportunities by saying sucks to be you, or you&#39;re unfair to the people who are somehow able to work around the obstacle by effectively making all their work pointless. Personally, I&#39;d say that many skills simply inevitably become outdated, and it&#39;s a fool&#39;s errand to try to suppress society&#39;s progression just to maintain the applicability of those skills, but our history should definitely reflect how those skills were once needed but no longer are. It is admirable to succeed despite the deck being stacked against you, but that doesn&#39;t excuse the fact the deck shouldn&#39;t have ever been stacked to begin with. <br><br>The Scenario involving the basketball player. Why is Chamberlain such a draw compared to the rest of the team? Is he more skilled than the rest of the team, or some arbitrary factor? If it&#39;s some arbitrary factor, he obviously shouldn&#39;t get paid more or play any fewer games than any of the other relatively equally-skilled players on the team regardless of what he thinks to the contrary. If he wants to leave the team over the request denial- good riddance, a player who arbitrarily thinks he deserves more pay or less work than everyone else isn&#39;t someone you want on your team. However, if he&#39;s genuinely more skilled than them and it&#39;s the team who thinks he shouldn&#39;t get paid more because of it, then they&#39;re the ones in the wrong and don&#39;t understand how merit works. But, if he gets more pay due to his greater skill and the rest of the team is okay with it, understanding why- then I fail to see the unfairness here. <br>But then again, I don&#39;t think athletics or really gaming in any form should be a professional career, it doesn&#39;t really benefit society in any way. Creating games and new ways to play them, sure, that&#39;s actually something society benefits from, but just playing the games doesn&#39;t. <br><br>As for whether or not it&#39;s the government&#39;s job to fulfill basic needs as an essential human right... let&#39;s address the arguments against it. Let&#39;s use healthcare as an example. If someone you&#39;ve never met is in need of medical treatment that negatively affects their ability to do their daily activities, you might think it&#39;s unfair for your taxes to go to their treatment, why should THEY benefit from YOUR money? But it&#39;s not that simple. Society is not composed of individuals, it is a network of jobs that need doing and people doing them. If a bunch of people are in such need of medical treatment that they cannot perform their societal duties, society is less functional- which will tangentially affect you. Unless you&#39;re a survivalist or a rural hippie or something (which I know you&#39;re not, seeing as how you&#39;re reading this from the internet, which needs to be run by a lot people), you need society to be functional to live your day-to-day life, that&#39;s the whole point of a society. Therefore, it is in your best interest to make sure every citizen is in as productive a condition as possible at all times so they can do the duties society (which includes you) needs them to do. Your finances aren&#39;t being ceased to be given to someone else who should be paying for themselves, you&#39;re paying to avoid society being less functional- making sure they can get back to work and fulfill their societal duty you and everyone else benefits from. So yes, I feel things like health care are positive rights, it is definitely the government&#39;s job to provide those basic needs for us; if you benefit from society (which we&#39;ve already established that you do), you and everyone else is in fact obligated to do their part to help the people who make society run. You help it so it can help you back, BECAUSE it helps you back. <br>But to be fair, it&#39;s not quite that simple either. Say you were completely opposed to smoking, you&#39;re fully aware of all the health dangers it carries and feel it is a nasty habit no one should have. Now say someone who does smoke experienced those dangers. They most likely knew about them, but chose to smoke anyway, and now they&#39;re paying the price for it. Except they&#39;re not paying the price for it, everyone else is; that smoker now needs medical treatment and everyone&#39;s taxes- regardless of their feelings about the smoker&#39;s decision to smoke- are paying for it. It doesn&#39;t seem fair to make you pay, even in part, for someone else&#39;s irresponsible decision that you explicitly didn&#39;t want them doing in the first place. Should we just deny everyone who experiences a self-inflicted health hazard treatment and leave them high-and-dry even if it means that many fewer people to help society run, or should we just outright disallow anyone to do anything that has an explicit risk to their health? There&#39;s unfairness no matter which option you pick. Personally, I&#39;d say that it&#39;s an invalid question, how society handles people with self-inflicted ailments isn&#39;t actually the problem, it&#39;s a symptom of a larger underlying problem. What causes people to neglect the potential health hazards and do those activities to begin with? Arguing about whether or not national healthcare should apply to them or disallowing them to do the activity that causes them to need it won&#39;t help anything. <br><br>The whole idea behind punishment is not only flawed in execution, I don&#39;t think the mentalities behind them even can have good execution. When you make a wrongdoer suffer, what is that supposed to really accomplish? If you say it&#39;s to discourage future offenses, as if to send the message &quot;this is what happens when you break the rules&quot;, the problems with that are many-fold. Not only do criminals still commit crimes anyway, but it doesn&#39;t address the reason they committed the crime in the first place. As long as the reason they committed the crime in the first place still applies and similar reasons exist for other people, crimes WILL continue regardless of punishment. So yes, you HAVE TO do some form of Welfare Maximization/Rehabilitation or Restorative Justice if you really want crime to decrease, Retribution and Deterrence simply won&#39;t/can&#39;t work. The goal should be to make the wrongdoer into a productive member of society again, help make society function like they&#39;re supposed to. A good way to do that is by addressing the reason they committed the crime in the first place.", "comment_date": "2016-12-20T12:32:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Myster36", "comment_text": "bloody great episode", "comment_date": "2016-12-20T12:15:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fishbiene", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t understand people who say that paying taxes to provide for the poor is somehow wrong,  mainly because, even after those taxes are paid, you are still much better off than the person your taxes went to.
