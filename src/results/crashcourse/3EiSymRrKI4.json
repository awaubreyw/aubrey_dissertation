The fact was these were Europeans who wanted the freedom to &quot;rise above their betters&quot; who happened to be rich white guys with an attitude.  That they were also largely but not always white is because of where they came from not because whiteness is the essential characteristic of domination.  I do believe the Irish are pretty pasty white and they had been dominated for centuries.

Most historians have no jack clue about the charter and origin of American constitution. American revolution was impossible to win against British and only happened because the settlers refused to hold secondary British status and lack of equal rights to English men. Ben Franklin tried multiple times to provide legal status to settlers under parliament, but he utterly failed. It was inevitable since British parliament refused to provide parliamentary seat to settlers. Worst, they imposed taxes while English settlers had no legal representative in British congress. It is funny how American won the war, but lost all of Canada to British.

If prejudice is defined by a hatred to unfair bias towards a color of people, then surely this sentiment of &quot;white bashing&quot; is racist. Why not actually take an un-biased view of things. The war for land is as old as human history, and all differences between groups of people have been used to spur them on. If native americans happened to be white, do you think they would have been treated any differently? Wasn&#39;t the root of the issue the simple fact that a group of invaders wanted to claim land that was already occupied, and that group of occupants were unwilling to surrender it? Which..is probably every war, right? And if the indigenous people of Africa that were too industrially or/and militarily  under developed to be captured and/or purchased as slaves happened to be white, do you think they would not have been bought and sold as slaves, and slavery would never have existed? It is know that a significant number of slaves were actually sold by their own tribal chiefs. Does that make them racist? <br><br><br>The fact appears to be that the introduction of black people to European civilizations started with slavery. It is natural for humans to make associations and stereo types, and for the black slaves, then assumption must be, &quot;black = slave.&quot; You think this is an association that only white people would have come to? Blacks being slaves is what caused blacks to continue to be treated and thought of as slaves. The colonial elite being the wealthy elite is the reason they were jerks, not because of the color of their skin. Stop feeding into the racist pretend counter-racist propaganda. <br><br><br>In all the pre-american and pre european centuries that passed when countless empires came and went, why were none of these atrocities of war attributed to the color of skin? I am so tired of the growing trend to blame all evils done by nations and empires on the color of ones skin. Every color of skin has, at some point in history, proven to be just as capable of personifying evil and injustice as the next.

In fact, the last shots fired in anger of this war were in recompense for the brutality of militias on both sides, as they engaged in fighting even after the peace treaty had been signed. Pine Bandits hid out in the Barrens, villages were torched by one force or the other - and that&#39;s just the Southern part of the State. The North was characterized by oscillating front lines and what&#39;s called the &quot;Forage War&quot; where both sides sent out small detachments to pillage supplies from the land. So neglected are the small sins of this conflict, all in the name of our National Creation Myth - and it does a disservice to history. Not even New Jersey historians care to remember the conflict that gave birth to such a ravaged landscape, that cemented the ill-reputation of New Jersey very early among the colonies in much the same way people thought of the ex-Yugoslav countries in the 90&#39;s.

British Major John Pitcairn ordered the outnumbered Patriots to disperse, and after a moment\u2019s hesitation the Americans began to drift off the green. Suddenly, the \u201cshot heard around the world\u201d was fired from an undetermined gun, and a cloud of musket smoke soon covered the green. When the brief Battle of Lexington ended, eight Americans lay dead or dying and 10 others were wounded. Only one British soldier was injured, but the American Revolution had begun.<br><br>By 1775, tensions between the American colonies and the British government approached the breaking point, especially in Massachusetts, where Patriot leaders formed a shadow revolutionary government and trained militias to prepare for armed conflict with the British troops occupying Boston. In the spring of 1775, General Thomas Gage, the British governor of Massachusetts, received instructions from England to seize all stores of weapons and gunpowder accessible to the American insurgents. On April 18, he ordered British troops to march against the Patriot arsenal at Concord and capture Patriot leaders Samuel Adams and John Hancock, known to be hiding at Lexington.<br><br>The Boston Patriots had been preparing for such a military action by the British for some time, and upon learning of the British plan, Patriots Paul Revere and William Dawes were ordered to set out to rouse the militiamen and warn Adams and Hancock. When the British troops arrived at Lexington, Adams, Hancock, and Revere had already fled to Philadelphia, and a group of militiamen were waiting. The Patriots were routed within minutes, but warfare had begun, leading to calls to arms across the Massachusetts countryside.<br><br>When the British troops reached Concord at about 7 a.m., they found themselves encircled by hundreds of armed Patriots. They managed to destroy the military supplies the Americans had collected but were soon advanced against by a gang of minutemen, who inflicted numerous casualties. Lieutenant Colonel Frances Smith, the overall commander of the British force, ordered his men to return to Boston without directly engaging the Americans. As the British retraced their 16-mile journey, their lines were constantly beset by Patriot marksmen firing at them Indian-style from behind trees, rocks, and stone walls. At Lexington, Captain Parker\u2019s militia had its revenge, killing several British soldiers as the Red Coats hastily marched through his town. By the time the British finally reached the safety of Boston, nearly 300 British soldiers had been killed, wounded, or were missing in action. The Patriots suffered fewer than 100 casualties.<br><br>The battles of Lexington and Concord were the first battles of the American Revolution, a conflict that would escalate from a colonial uprising into a world war that, seven years later, would give birth to the independent United States of America.", "comment_date": "2016-11-20T20:06:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dante bigguy", "comment_text": "in Short the Natives who fought with the British still Have treaties in Canada All Natives should of fought with the British....", "comment_date": "2016-11-19T10:10:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shadow Gamer 1990", "comment_text": "History is all about the battle for people who want true freedom vs people who believe in some sort of hierarchy.

Entrenching yourself on a peninsula is a problem if you don&#39;t control the sea, but it&#39;s great if you do...and the British had throughout the entire war up to that time, and had little reason to fear they would lose that control. Plus, the primary source of supply for the British was seaborne (as noted, their forays inland into the countryside tended to not go well), so it made perfect sense for them to establish a fortified base at a port. The British had a longstanding tradition of sea supremacy, and tended to base their campaign plans around that. The British maintained sea supremacy throughout almost the entire war...except for that one brief period where they didn&#39;t, which turned out to be the important part. Yorktown only became a debacle for the British because of their naval defeat at The Chesapeake, which happened after Cornwallis&#39; decision to retreat there, and was due to the failure of the naval commanders, not Cornwallis himself.", "comment_date": "2016-01-04T07:16:50Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "Cool Bro", "comment_text": "America is involved", "comment_date": "2015-12-30T20:55:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "abdellaoui reda", "comment_text": "is it true that Thomas Jefferson held slaves?", "comment_date": "2015-12-30T12:14:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim Van Haverbeck", "comment_text": "When I watch these videos I want John to punch the eagle.

And they did not think of &quot;happiness&quot; in modern terms (affectations of pleasure or contentment) but, rather, in Classical terms from philosophers like Aristotle. \u00a0Happiness is the fulfillment of a life lived in virtue. \u00a0And THAT is what made the Revolution different. \u00a0They believe that only a moral people can be free because only virtue preserves true liberty. \u00a0If a man cannot control himself, he will be controlled by others (such as corporations that fuel consumerism or the Government itself). \u00a0A populace lacking control of its passions will have their passions manipulated because if history has taught us anything, it&#39;s that no one has ever stopped wanting control.<br><br>That is why religious institutions could not be - and should not be - promoted by the Government but individuals being religious WAS promoted (see Washington&#39;s farewell address). \u00a0Heck, that&#39;s why Thanksgiving was established at all as a national holiday! \u00a0To give thanks to our Creator for our blessings. \u00a0Without God, who are we &quot;thanking?&quot; \u00a0The Government? \u00a0Ourselves? \u00a0Seems a bit pretentious...<br><br>To the Founding Fathers&#39; credit, while they might not have achieved everything modernity wants in one fell swoop over 200 years ago, they provided the foundation for one of the most diverse nations in the world with a greater presence of diversity in leadership than any other nation in the world. \u00a0Could it be better? \u00a0Of course, everything can be. \u00a0But some great strides have been made over the past 200 years which ultimately owe their inspiration to what they did and gave their lives for.<br><br>Okay, off soap box....keep up the good work!", "comment_date": "2015-03-19T15:56:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "kartik nalamalapu", "comment_text": "Lol everyone arguing over who was evil and who wasn&#39;t.

Furthermore as president he directed congress to pass a bill banning the international slave trade, in which he signed into law. Although Jefferson&#39;s personal actions contradict much of his rhetoric, I do not believe its fair to make a direct comparison between him an George Washington.

No monopoly can persist without government support. Monopolies are the main tool for suppressing freedom to own property.
