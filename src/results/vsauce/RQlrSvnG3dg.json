I make maps for Garry&#39;s Mod, Counter-Strike: Source and Half-Life: Source and I add ambient music to my maps. Instead of adding an entire song, I pic a piece of the song and loop it almost perfectly. Kind of like Canon in D, or The Entertainer, I take a 10 to 20 second section of the music, fade out the last 1 - .5 seconds of that song, Ctrl + X it and Paste over the beginning, creating the illusion of a looping tune. I guess that&#39;s kind of similar to that sound that never stops up-pitching.", "comment_date": "2018-01-29T04:58:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Stalin Chiden Communist Sniff Lord", "comment_text": "this is honestly terrifying", "comment_date": "2018-01-28T21:45:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jos\u00e9", "comment_text": "there was publicity for this video on another video (wich brought me here) and you are starting with publicity again?
