Take the flat earth model and not sure on the scale, but place that somewhere on a much larger globe. This much larger globe is the globe earth but is a dark frozen wasteland. Earth still in a major ice age because the real sun is in a major grand solar minimum or has died or the earths orbit and or spin had shifted out of the goldilocks zone.<br>The sun and moon could be man made satellites sun being a fusion reactor of sorts keeping our little disc warm and habitable and the moon is the counterbalance satellite acting as a positive or negative or the North or south pole of the created electrical generator circling over us that we can harness energy from in more ways than 1, ways that are now hidden from us.<br>Timelines and history are all a mishmash of stories and chinese whispers that have changed and skewed so much so think of history as you wish.<br>The moon could be serving other purposes like it was a giant mirror to reflect a concentrated beam of heated light from the artificial sun to melt some of the snow beyond the ice wall to open up other parts and make more habitable land and the heating/boiling creates vapour clouds that pass over our warm disc area as clouds and provide precipitation. Also moon being a mirror angled at a frozen section of globe, the moon is just a reflection of earth covered in impact creators because the atmosphere and magnetosphere is mostly gone due to little or no protection from the inactive real sun. <br>Its a delicate balancing act as this is weather manipulation in a way.<br>Large ice bergs break off the ice and seen as global warming  is more like the continual glacier surrounding us moving in but melting as it gets to our warm disc.<br>All this ice melt and precipitation is could easily contribute to the ocean levels rising so like I said it&#39;s a delicate balancing act.<br>Another theory is that global warming could also be happening as the globe is coming out of its ice age and icemelt is happening everywhere and land bridges will open up therefore travel by land will be more easy and the whole lie will come undone so the ones who hold the knowledgeand power are desperate to maintain. I have to much in my head to write all down and this theory crosses over Into so many stories and works all the time with biblical and historical accounts and space and space travel. Moon landing was just exploring frozen darkend areas beyond the ice wall. The space suits are just thermal suits etc and it was still all a show and a hoax put on us for further cognitive dissonance.<br>I can&#39;t put all the details in here as it&#39;s a large topic to cover.<br>Space exploration could be probes and satellites etc. sent around the globe to look for or check on other areas to see if any new areas have opened up or whatever, or there are other unfrozen discs with their own man made sun&#39;s and moons, little pockets of survivors run by their own governors and such and the leaders visit each other with &#39;space&#39; travel and or send messages, resources etc to each other. An expanded theory of living in a creator on the moon. <br>Our disc may be the arctic  circle at the north pole and the rest of the globe is the antarctic or anti arctic. <br>Arc came from Noah&#39;s ark, came on a boat before the freeze, the boat people stories of people Como g from the sea, the pheonicians, still in maritime law, we are all from the ark plants and animals and DNA and seed banks ready to replant and repopulate the world if or when it thaws out. <br>Have a think", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T01:41:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rae B.", "comment_text": "we could have a party outside so that the moon could finally be what it was meant to be", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T21:02:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travis Chesser", "comment_text": "What if the big mirror was replaced with a magnifying lens?\ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude25", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T20:28:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lack Poop", "comment_text": "I came here off instagram", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T12:34:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pietro Sal", "comment_text": "I dont need sleep i need answers", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T10:14:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mamgain Shubhanshu", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8I25H3bnNw&amp;t=2m15s\">2:15</a> flatearthers sweating.", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T08:34:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gordon Freeman", "comment_text": "Wouldn\u2019t those mirrors be like death ray projectors?", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T23:34:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u3010Kokoro Kitten\u3011", "comment_text": "moon: ayyy get yo reflection<br><br>me: ay, ay i dont like that AY..

Surely if you covered the moon with mirror tiles the same size as used in a conventional mirrorball (~1cm\u00b2), without scaling them up as you did, you&#39;d probably get a much better discoball effect (from our perspective) from the moon&#39;s current distance than the one you were originally attempting to illustrate. Obviously you&#39;d need billions (trillions?) of 1cm\u00b2 mirror tiles, though, to cover the entire surface of the moon. Also depends on how large the reflection of the sun is on Earth from each mirror tile as to how bright it is. I guess the optimal size of the mirror tile would be one that is big enough to encapsulate and reflect the image of the entire sun (hence its full brightness) onto the Earth, rather than crop the sun&#39;s image to a large degree, although cropping the sun just enough to fill each square tile might offer the best compromise (and increase the number of rays and chance of intersecting Earth). Another optimisation would for the mirror tiles to be as thin as possible so as to increase the surface area of the reflective part of the tiles, although you could take this even further and change the square mirror tiles to polygons (n\u1d57\u02b0 order geodesic sphere) to eliminate all gaps.", "comment_date": "2016-12-06T15:44:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Sannikov", "comment_text": "The huge mirror thing in the visualization is not casting a conical shadow volume, it just turns the sun off when it obstructs it which seems wrong.", "comment_date": "2016-12-06T13:23:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cyyra", "comment_text": "Cool!", "comment_date": "2016-12-06T00:38:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin", "comment_text": "asking the imporant thing", "comment_date": "2016-12-05T01:08:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FludicBacon312 Portal Fan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8I25H3bnNw&amp;t=2m19s\">2:19</a> OMG I WANT TO LOOK UP AT THE SKY AND SEE THAT!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T19:58:43Z", "likes_count": 108}, {"comment_by": "Nim 116", "comment_text": "this is awesome!!!", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T10:00:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PotatoPoisonous", "comment_text": "that would be really beautiful u can even see our home planet in those reflections", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T09:13:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Poetri Poetri", "comment_text": "are you high?", "comment_date": "2016-12-04T05:15:37Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Efe", "comment_text": "this is my go to video when im high.. like right now..", "comment_date": "2016-12-03T19:56:44Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "HackkaBOO Tutorials", "comment_text": "that is terrifying", "comment_date": "2016-12-01T23:26:59Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Knas589 Hks", "comment_text": "That would never happen", "comment_date": "2016-12-01T03:20:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A", "comment_text": "Obi Wan: That&#39;s no moon...

Polaris is a small like sphere that hangs from/or hovers at the center of the firmament/dome, our enclosed flat circular world. The firmament/dome &amp; polaris/sphere are made of a carbon/diamond material. Polaris is the only real sphere/planet like object in our sky/space underneath the firmament/dome. Polaris spins slowly spinning one full revolution every 24 hours. The stars you see at night are light being reflected off Polaris onto the firmament, polaris has imperfections on it&#39;s smooth surface and each imperfection creates the stars projected onto the firmament you see at night. The light reflected off the middle of Polaris to the top, turns clockwise on the firmament, &amp; the light reflected from the middle to the bottom off polaris turn counter clockwise on the firmament, just like a disco ball. That&#39;s why in the northern hemisphere (inner circle, land inside the equator) the stars tuns clockwise. In the southern hemisphere (outer circle, land outside the equator) the stars turn counter clockwise. Also in the southern hemisphere they see the moon upside down, due to perception because the moon stays on the path of the equator. The Sun&#39;s circular path starts on the tropic of cancer, &amp; then moves outward to the equator, on to the tropic of Capricorn, &amp; continues it cycle back inward, repeating this infinitely. That&#39;s why we have different seasons over the flat circular  world.That it why the inner/north pole area has daylight, multiple days in a row because the sun is on it&#39;s smallest circle &amp; cast light upon the entire circle for a few days. Each revolution of it&#39;s cycle takes 24 hours to complete. The moon makes a revolution/circle around the equator every 28 days, on our flat circular world. That is why we have 13 full moons in 364 days. The way we get the different phases of the moon, because the moon &amp; sun travel at different speeds. The way we get lunar and solar eclipses is because the sun goes behind &amp; in front of the moon. There is also water outside of the firmament, &amp; in the water are bubbles that light up with frequencies caused by mother earth vibrating through the firmament. This could be what falling stars are, or it could be small pieces of the firmament which is made of carbon/diamond that reflects sunlights as it falls to the earth, &amp; only the dark side of the plane/earth is able to see it as it falls.", "comment_date": "2016-08-28T20:11:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Slime universe", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t even imagine how fucking cool that
