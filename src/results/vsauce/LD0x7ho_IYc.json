This generations hypothesis is all well and good, but how do you explain the difference between my two older sisters and myself? One is 5 years older then me the other is 9 years older then me. They both want to claim I&quot;m the same generation as them, but their culture feels more foreign to me then my baby boomer parents&#39;s. I listen to Rock from Chuck Berry, The Beetles, Jimmy Hendrix, The doors, Rolling stones, Led Zeppelin - Nirvana. They listen to Justin Bieber, Taylor Swith, and Kate Perry. Their age group is where Hipster/SJW culture first appeared on college campus (a culture I find cringe, though to be clear I&#39;m not found of the alt right either). When I was growing up my peers all talked about Jaws, Star Wars the original trilogy, Indiana Jones ,ect on the elementary school playground despite those films being over 20 years old at the time we still rented them from block buster and watched them. My sister and their peers in their age group refuse to talk about a film much older then 5 years old and that they consider stretching back. Their peers when they attend High School were more left leaning, then the peers I had at the same school when I was graduating in 2016 (most of my peers openly admitted to voting for trump in 2016, where as for my sisters most of their peers voted for Obama in 2012) and this wasn&#39;t me gravitating to people I related to/agreed with, I didn&#39;t agree with my peers on most political issues as I leaned more left then them (just not to sjw levels), though I&#39;m aware of both from the internet and people who graduated in the following years that people even younger then me even at that same high school it started to swing back to the left and possibly even further left then when my sister&#39;s attended after I had graduated.<br><br>TLDR; Why do I see much more generational flux in a smaller time frame then the generation hypothesis allows for?

Obviously, I&#39;d miss my family and friends but cats don&#39;t think like us in that regard nor do I think they have the ability to remember as much. The old generation seeing the change in the new way of living is new and different to what they are familiar with. The brain gets smaller with age and I feel like new information cant be prossesed as well and it could be even scary to them. Rapid change is something no one likes and I bet getting old sucks in general.

My parents are always angry when they heard other parents say that kids today are the worst ever. I remember my father said that more than 30 years ago, in my country, various forms of social discrimination were everywhere, many major corruptions took place, many people were illiterate and didn&#39;t do well in academic tests or anything dealing with science. The last two generations at that time were incredibly conservative and opposing to changes. Many still regard that foreign languages and cultures were the reincarnation of colonization, therefore speaking them used to mean you didn&#39;t support all the struggles the country had gone through. My mother, on the other hand, told to her friends that they haven&#39;t yet seen their future kids. She always emphasizes that my generation is always more scientific and open minded to many things, revolutionary to the point where negative traditions are easily breakable, very close to the society of the holy trinity: full of art, kindness, and science. They both have said that the adolescence they lived were too restrictive, despite all the fun they had, not much gotten nowadays. They know they lived in the era when getting friends meant true friends. Outdoor games are there. People socialize much in person. People had more complex and developed system of manners. The gap between the rich and the poor isn&#39;t as prevalent as today in some parts of the world. It was easier to be very religious and &quot;do less sin&quot; because all the dirtiness present today weren&#39;t that much. Pornography, for example, was extremely difficult to get without getting caught by parents or not known by any other people. However, was that conservativity my parents were so sick of.<br><br>They do acknowledge that today&#39;s kids are more prone to depression and other psychological problems, becoming not very religious and &quot;easy to sin&quot;, but they believe they mature earlier and are much more intelligent than my parents&#39; generation were. Not easily fooled by hoaxes. Can use technology to their maximum potential. To learn things. To explore the beautiful universe. To expand their skills and hobbies. Have their own ways to express wonderful ideas, brighter than ever. Reject conservatism and believe that humanity and freedom are always in the first place, that religions are all about understanding of their scriptures and teachings, and their correct and modern implementations, that is, to accept that we&#39;re humans. And I totally agree. At first I was disgusted to see my friends&#39; taste, behavior, and &quot;immaturity&quot; when I was little, but I realized as we got older, we became smarter, more mature, and are loaded with a truly powerful potential to extinguish all the worst we&#39;ve got today. Each generation has its ups and downs, and seeing one <i>always</i> better than the other is a big no-no.

It&#39;s easier than ever to release music, pushing the low bar for quality way down.

The resulting poor ratio of good music vs bad doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s less good music now, there&#39;s probably more, it&#39;s just harder to find due to the ratio.<br>4. Music is far more likely to grow on you and gain a sense of nostalgia over time than to develop a bad association or have you otherwise spontaneously stop liking it.<br>5. It&#39;s easy to only consider genres you&#39;re well acquainted with - perhaps due to developing a critical eye for that genre - which favors the genres that were particularly common in your preferred era.<br><br>For an example - I would argue that there is more 80s sounding music of better quality made in the last year than the entirety of the 80s.

First, it allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students civil liberties. Second, this doctrine can provide a non-biological parent to be given the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.<br><br>This authority was given to teachers in schools, and although there were abusive teachers, it did keep the students in line. Nowadays teachers get less authority and the students are undisciplined. <br>When I was in school there were a few bullies picking on another student in my class. That student tried to reach out to his homeroom teacher for help. After the bullies got a stern talking to by the homeroom teacher, they bullied him even worse then before! What else could have the teacher do? They certainly can&#39;t discipline the bullies and make sure they will behave. Their job is on the line after all. <br><br>The parents are always to blame in failing to raise their kids right.

The loudness wars played a huge part in homogenizing popular music as well. Nearly all songs produced have some amount of compression put into them, this means that lowest volumes are brought closer to the higher volumes. This plays a very important role in making vocals sound clear and making drums sound so impactful and pronounced. But as ways people listened to music evolved from record players to radio, CDs, and digital files, so did the ways that compression is used. The largest change happened after the popularization and advent of radio. Now most people are listening to music in a loud vehicle with components that are likely lower quality than what they would have in their home. Extra compression had to be added to tracks in order to both add gain and clarity to the music. If all instruments are playing at the same volume, you can still hear them in a noisier environment like a car. It didn&#39;t help that radio stations would demo songs to people over the phone, which created even more need for compression and loudness. The loudness wars became so omnipresent that radio stations started to add their own compression to already compressed music. Then with the advent of CDs and other formats of storing music besides records, the issue grew worse. There was a certain point where you couldn&#39;t make a record any louder, otherwise the needle would skip out of the groove, but with CDs the volume can be at the ceiling the entire time without any issues. During the time that high powered stereos were uncommon and wattage came with a hefty price tag, producers were saturating the market with these very loud and very compressed CDs that only furthered the loudness wars. Now it is difficult to find CDs that do not include some sort of clipping (when the volume of the track is too high to be correctly amplified), unless they are specifically marketed as audiophile CDs. And the MP3 format by default has compression due to the bit depth limitations of the format, though only to a relatively small extent.", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T19:34:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Michael Moran", "comment_text": "This is why I refuse to complain about fortnite, complaining about battle royale games feels like millenials getting their feet wet in attacking the younger generation", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T19:29:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "meh", "comment_text": "this cris is ww3 and COVID-19", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T18:13:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "t 77", "comment_text": "Back around 1900 when Johann Strauss Father and son perfected their Waltzes, the Genre became more homogenous as well, like pop songs right now.

Doctors do not, in fact, use only penicillin for everything, and if they did, millions of people would have died for this, due to the fact that many infections and illnesses would be incorrectly treated, and due to the fact that penicillin allergies are very common. So, actually, one SHOULD criticize a doctor for using penicillin for everything.<br><br>2. I do understand the argument that pop songs sound the same because satisfying the goal they are presumably meant to satisfy require them to do so. The problem is that this ignores the fact that music is an art, and within the domain of discourse of art, one expects to see creativity. Much of the perceived beauty originates from the fact that a particular piece is creative, something of a twist, something maybe even &quot;novel.&quot; But pop songs do the exact opposite of this. Is this inherently a bad thing? Do we have to fundamentally change our conceptual understanding of how art works and how art should work?

But I don&#39;t think your analysis sticks. Art, and music specifically, have a creative nature. Creativity is related with coming up with new things. People are creative when they&#39;re able to come up with something new, something interesting. This is not the case with medicine. The experimentation in medicine is not focused on coming up with simply new and different treatments, but it aims to find THE ones that work. The ultimate stage of medicine, medicine on the limit, the utopic form of medicine, would be one where we&#39;d have the best possible treatments for every possible problem and we&#39;d stick to those forever and we could stop all research. But art isn&#39;t aiming at an ultimate piece so that all creative endeavors could cease. So no, I don&#39;t think the answer is that music producers have found the ultimate formula for music.<br>A second thing to consider is that people who spend more time listening to other music genres or older pop music, typically musicians and people who&#39;ve studied music, tend not to be satisfied with this new and homogeneous pop music.

They all listened to it. So the musicians were inspired to write it. With every song that was written, there were small mutations, which over time leads to a new style. This new style is what children would listen to. As they grew up, that&#39;s what they were inspired by, so that&#39;s what they wrote. In other words, the accepted style has changed from complex jazz music, to simplistic Beatles songs, to a little more complex rock, to simplistic pop, etc. Musicians write what people like.", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T19:10:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J Rudy", "comment_text": "Ok boomer", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T15:19:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jcknight7996", "comment_text": "<b>is looking for ok Boomer memes in comments</b>", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T14:01:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chona Castillo", "comment_text": "Its scary to think that the future us isnt even like us in the present day.

Second in order for this word to have meaning, an opposite word must also exist. Up has down, left has right, and juvenoia has .... well nothing, because it&#39;s not a real thing, it&#39;s made up by kids who need to shift focus from themselves to the past generation. The very existence of the word juvenoia suggest a fear of adults. When an adult complains that the kid who works at McDonald&#39;s who won&#39;t get off his or her cellphone to do his or her job, that&#39;s not a reason to invent a word to describe the adult. But by inventing such a word you&#39;ve in fact have created a paranoia towards adults. So where&#39;s that word?  Please Vsauce, I expect a certain standard when watching your videos, please inform the viewers next time when you use slang terms as the focal point of your video that the word is in fact slang. You do such a great job when it comes to the origins of other words in other videos, you should do an addendum to this one.", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T19:59:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sims", "comment_text": "W H A T S  U P  W I T H  T H A T   M U S I C", "comment_date": "2018-07-02T11:33:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Muticere", "comment_text": "I feel fortunate that I somehow as a child learned to identify juvenoia and was immediately suspicious of it.

Since a generation includes people of many demographics, distinguished solely by age and region (a millennial in USA is very different from a 30 year old in Vietnam), a generation must be defined by a common memory that shaped culture. For Baby Boomers, this memory was the Korean War and Cold War; for Millennials, this memory was 9/11; for iGen or Gen-Z, this memory was the election of Donald Trump and the Parkland Shooting (the latter triggered a movement directly involving students). Thus the birth year parameters for a Millennial are about 1980-1995, since anyone born after 1995 will not have a profound memory of 9/11, while iGen/Gen-Z was born ~1996-2010. This puts each generation at about 15 year gaps, not 20 years, although the definition of a generation is so vague that specific years and time periods do not matter. It is possible that generations may be getting smaller, as technological developments define age groups differently, or that they are getting wider, as people of all ages have access to the same resources and technology.", "comment_date": "2018-06-13T22:01:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pond", "comment_text": "Well, now we know that the feminists and SJWs will cause a crisis in 2025, time to start preparing to fight back.", "comment_date": "2018-06-13T15:03:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "elsa", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=11m20s\">11:20</a> he wrote that to his fcking cousin", "comment_date": "2018-06-13T13:34:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Wood", "comment_text": "2025<br>8 years for the right wing pendulum to swing back.<br>What adventure&#39;s we&#39;ll have until then", "comment_date": "2018-06-13T08:44:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the demon spawn828", "comment_text": "I&#39;m a melleniul born in the last year yay", "comment_date": "2018-06-11T23:39:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moracha !", "comment_text": "I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not a kid anymore.", "comment_date": "2018-06-08T07:33:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u306b\u3083\u3042\u30a8\u30a4\u30ea\u30a2\u30f3MeowAlien", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=0m15s\">0:15</a> I&#39;m ded XD you got me good there", "comment_date": "2018-06-08T00:05:20Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "CDKobra", "comment_text": "The way they dress", "comment_date": "2018-06-07T18:41:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arab Trooper", "comment_text": "I can\u2019t wait for the next 20 years, I\u2019m take the living piss out of Gen Z the same way I had to endure it for years.", "comment_date": "2018-06-07T07:54:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leonard Preiss", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=0m40s\">0:40</a> xDxDxD Beethoven was deaf and the picture says &quot;imagine these people listening to todays music&quot; xDxD", "comment_date": "2018-06-06T20:27:46Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "It's Zain", "comment_text": "&quot;Juvenoia these days&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-06-06T19:29:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KodyDarko", "comment_text": "But first shit in your bed and make it burst - Mozart lol", "comment_date": "2018-06-06T07:47:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Former UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon", "comment_text": "I clicked this because i thought juvenoia is a new type of drugs.

It is also why I think the whole &quot;act your age&quot; thing is self-destructive. When I was growing up adults around me always seemed uptight and angry. Now as an adult I understand why it is the societal expectation that you should act a certain way because you get older. An older person &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; enjoy video games, cartoons, pop music, and etc. They need to be serious and mature! Bullcrap! That &quot;expectation&quot; is making people MISERABLE! You can be responsible and still do what you love to do at the same time. Being mature means balancing responsibilities and things you love doing, not giving up what you love doing to focus entirely on responsibilities. That line of thinking, that &quot;societal norm&quot; is killing us with stress. Well, go tell society what it can do with itself and live your self how you want to live it and not how you are &quot;expected&quot; to live it.

The video claims that the unskilled jobs created a new situation where the young could get money is... well, it&#39;s not right.  Prior to factories, the young were perfectly able to get money.  And far more of it, actually.  Prior to the rise of factories, adolescents would be apprentices or similar, and those positions paid enough that if the adolescent ended up with a child of their own, they could start their own family and care for it.  With factories, however, the jobs paid very, very little.  Because society stepped back and said &quot;they don&#39;t deserve any more money, the work is easy, the machines do all the hard work&quot;, factory owners paid adolescents so little that when they ended up with children of their own, it plunged their whole family into starvation.  This is what invented the whole &quot;we have to kill sex&quot; movement of the Industrial Revolution.  And also invented the &#39;terrible teens&#39; as a rebellious phase of life.  Cultures which support and encourage adolescents to develop independence don&#39;t ever see a &#39;terrible teens&#39; phase at all.  Only western cultures that try to cage them and actively prevent them from developing independence do.<br><br>I do wonder how the &#39;Everything Bad Is Good For You&#39; thesis plays with the tide of anti-intellectualism that began around World War I and continued to rise throughout the 20th century.  Once people saw science and reason used for war, creating the most suffering ever seen on the world stage, it disturbed people in society greatly.  Prior to that they thought science and reason were purely good and could not be used for evil or harm.  Then throughout the 20th century we saw failure after failure laid at the door of science and reason, causing some of the worst tragedies ever (eugenics, fascism, leaded gasoline, thalidomide, etc).  People have a very difficult time holding on to nuanced ideas like &quot;this thing can be used for good and bad&quot; and much prefer the simpler good/bad dichotomy.  And since science and reason keeps everyone safe, even those who spurn it, it ends up being no personal loss to reject reason and science.  <br><br>I actually don&#39;t think the anti-intellectualist bent leads to things like the simpler pop music, that comes from something else.  Specifically, the way music distribution works.  This also affects network television and mainstream movies.  In the book &#39;A Drunkards Walk&#39; it is shown that extensive research has determined that the public response to media is random.  There are no patterns to be found.  Humans don&#39;t deal well with randomness.  We invent patterns where none exist.  And especially if we are investing large sums of money into the success of media, we do things to improve our chances.  This is why a movies opening weekend is a huge deal - big movie publishers need to take another roll of the dice as fast as possible if there&#39;s a flop, and keep their successes around longer.  Control of distribution is their only key to success.  TV stations, book publishers, etc are all also companies.  They have humans in them trying to make a career for themselves.  So they convince others that they &quot;know what the public wants&quot;.  The ones that get lucky with this con job become legends, while most fail because the game is random.  But when there is a success, everyone apes it because they believe that a pattern has been found.  They haven&#39;t figured out there aren&#39;t any yet... or don&#39;t want to face the reality of it because it would make them superfluous.", "comment_date": "2018-01-21T22:43:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ciara.Chaya", "comment_text": "Regarding &quot;media these days are dumbed down&quot;, I&#39;ve noticed more the opposite.

I could even update Strauss-Howe generational theory for lacking. It all comes down to mechanics of fluctuation and relativity. I wouldn&#39;t talk about &quot;cycle&quot; any more rather than well, fluctuation. Our social structure and entertainment has grown very complex. Our diversity is at peak, but our social behavior has settled to a higher-entropy mess. We&#39;re having these cycles to an accelerating degree just like our universe is expanding and, because of that, our diversity could be evolving to a hive minded state. Right now we have this personality crisis which will evolve to a point we realize we&#39;re no different from each other. We don&#39;t agree, awaken, identify or have crises the same way in small communities anymore. We&#39;re having these during couple of year or even month cycles per one person depending on situations.<br><br>Ofc I&#39;m not entirely sure if we evolve to a hive mind, but we&#39;re going to have some sort of major revelation associated with our similar personalities and the fact that it&#39;s all the same. We&#39;re all the same, just like the whole universe is all the same. One thing I&#39;m sure of and it&#39;s that we&#39;re no different from the mechanics of the universe. Which indicates that our social structure will seek high entropy state. It will stop conflicting with itself. There&#39;s couple of ways this could happen. <br><br>First and the most likely one; We&#39;ll evolve our technology to a degree we can either transfer our awareness to cloud or computer, or to some highly diffused gas like state filling our universe. Evolving &quot;inside&quot; or &quot;smaller&quot; if you will. Intergalactic space travel and population in our current physical form won&#39;t happen. There&#39;s just not enough low entropy matter in our immediacy. Even if we could form anything out of quantum scale particles, our carbon based physical form would be useless.<br><br>Second most likely one; We stop being. Either the climate will take care of us, or we might accidentally develop something that will eradicate human. Human extinction scale war won&#39;t happen, tho.<br><br>Third one that comes to my mind would be that, we separate from each other. Do not reproduce much, if at all. Possibly reproduction happens through laboratories. Maybe we&#39;ve found the way to live &quot;forever&quot;.

Despite your debunking of juvenoia as sensible state of being for the most part, I now feel justified, in my juvenoia regarding music, which is my main source of personal juvenoia anyway.

There are many bands, artists and composers who create brilliant music all the time... The question is not: Why has musical creativity diminished? The question is: Why do mainstream radio and the recording industry just shove the rubbish out there down our throats, now? Because, that&#39;s what&#39;s happening! Mainstream radio and the recording industry used to cherry pick the best music around or at least a good random selection thereof to show us... now they cherry pick the rubbish with 2 chords and beat us to death with it. You can write more interesting and complex music accidentally by dropping your instrument. Good innovative and creative artists are now relegated to being fringe alternative artists hidden at the back of the music store if you are lucky or random unsigned artists on youtube or your local shopping mall or club.

The 2020 election will largely be a response to the failures of the current administration. When that 2020 administration also fails (being much of the same pendulum swing we always see), something new will finally gain traction in 2024, perhaps some type of neo-libertarianism (libertarianism without the more extremist nonsense). Given the utter disaster of the 2 party system is finally meeting a crisis point, as demonstrated by the last election, and given that even in this past election the third party options finally got some attention and traction (though not enough), it seems probable that the momentum will meet a tipping point in a few more elections, whereby the vote is adequately split three ways to make for a new paradigm. Instead of a binary pendulum, it becomes trinary, and with that a new cycle ensues OR the other two original parties are rendered impotent and archaic (if they don&#39;t merely evolve to something more palatable). 2040 will certainly be an interesting time for the USA. <br><br>I think there might be something to this cycle, although I do agree with Vsauce that it is largely unscientific. It is falsifiable, however. All it takes is for a UNRAVELLING to happen instead of a HIGH following a crisis. But that does sound a bit subjective -  how do you know if you are in an UNRAVELLING versus just nearing the end of a CRISIS stage in that cycle? Doesn&#39;t any crisis potentially contain some level of alienation, thus resembling, if only superficially, an unravelling? At that, the problem of falsification might be mere symantic in origin, that the terms are vague enough that any event or cultural shift can be interpreted to be in any one of the four stages of that cycle if you include or exclude key indicators and attributes.<br><br>For example, what makes this now the CRISIS period and not just a continuation of the UNRAVELLING? Society is as bifurcated as ever, with divides being further deepened by the media on both sides playing on irrational fears and promoting general distrust. I don&#39;t see that shifting to a unified feel any time soon, certainly not under this administration and political climate. Then again, that unification might be some onset of increased reason, where people finally wake up and realize they have been played for decades by the media, made unaware participants in the most divisive game in human history. Perhaps this unification will happen as people increasingly distrust the media, finally embrace reason and skepticism, and learn to seek truth by reliable means rather than absorbing it from the mere surface of biased sources.", "comment_date": "2017-10-29T07:34:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mason", "comment_text": "I do hate talking to people who are set in their ways. &quot;they don&#39;t make music like this anymore&quot;...

It&#39;s not the same, and music is a broad enough subject to have variety in.

I feel that the reason Pop has gotten so &#39;bland and same old same old&#39; is because it&#39;s target audience doesn&#39;t take enough notice of the music to notice. Now, this is a generalization - but most people who listen to the highest mainstream music only listen to it because it&#39;s what&#39;s been exposed to them. It&#39;s popular because it&#39;s catchy, not necessarily because of it&#39;s innovation or creativity. People are exposed to it and don&#39;t bother searching much further through music than the artists they&#39;ve seen. As opposed to earlier times when the spectrum of entertainment was a lot narrower and less readily available, there was more incentive to search music to find the best of the best.

In every generation there are songs that are considered &#39;Timeless&#39; and will be sung for generations and others that will be thrown out and forgotten. Sure there are songs like Creedence Cearwaters &#39;Bad Moon rising&#39; or Elvis Presleys &#39;Can&#39;t Help Falling In Love With You&#39; but lets not forget about the lyrical masterpiece <b>&lt;Heavy Sarcasm</b> that is Lennon and McCartneys &#39;I Am The Walrus&#39;. All three of which are from the 1960s. Lets try then to go up in time to the 1970s and 1980s. Yes you have songs like U2s &#39;With Or Without You&#39; or Journeys &#39;Don&#39;t Stop Believin&#39; but how could we forget about the cultural masterpiece that is the 1976 release of Rick Dees &#39;Disco Duck&#39;.... I know you touched upon the notion that most pop songs sound the same in your video entitled &#39;Will We Ever Run Out of New Music?&#39; where you say that there are an almost uncountable amount of finite possibilities for arranging music but I think that number is wrong. You see pop music usually uses 3-5 chords because that allows the listener to predict the tones following. Now it doesnt mater what key these chords are in because they are transferable (reference to the four chord song by axis of awesome where they take songs and transpose them so they all work in the same key) so all we really have are 8 different notes that needless to say have to be harmonious with the chords (cant really play notes right next to each other on a keyboard without them sounding dissonant), that can be arranged in three popular standard lengths to form &#39;Catchy&#39; melodies. That narrows down the possibility of originality significantly. Since all the songs mentioned in my comment so far can be played with four chords we can throw away the argument that past pop music was more complex. Lets not forget that &#39;Pop&#39; isnt a genre its a term used to describe music that is popular. I have a question for you though: Who decides what music is popular? Because there are songs on the radio that a large audience dislikes, even rap fans consider Drakes &#39;Hotline Bling&#39; to be ridiculous. So the question is, if that song was not brought out by Drake but rather by an obscure new artist, would it be just as overplayed? What makes a song popular? Id love to watch you explain the mathematic and scientific reasons for why all types of art is enjoyable. A video in attempt to prove that artists, actors and musicians have a more subconscious mathematical talent (if you will) than people who study in the field of maths and science. ~ I eat all my brain candy with Vsauce, Cheers!", "comment_date": "2017-07-18T16:08:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicholas Garziano", "comment_text": "I would like to nominate this video as one of the greatest contributions to humanity.", "comment_date": "2017-07-18T15:07:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hanan Aljaber", "comment_text": "I am born in generation Z 2008 well it used to be good but in 2017 kids became stupid", "comment_date": "2017-07-18T08:58:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neongreenlemon V . 0", "comment_text": "MCR FANS UNITE", "comment_date": "2017-07-17T16:23:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arthur", "comment_text": "I still love rewatching Vsauce videos", "comment_date": "2017-07-16T17:46:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sonny N.", "comment_text": "Vsauce, will you be my daddy?", "comment_date": "2017-07-16T16:36:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Washington", "comment_text": "Climax of the 2016 election will occur in 2025?

He never has thought much of electronics cause he is part of the remainder of an era where labor was HARD. He built houses and worked in factories.

Funny enough it&#39;s only worked because the longitude was aligned with well, my bathtub. I first came across this in California when I was studying earthquakes as a hobby in which the  bathtub was the  detector source for the earthquake&#39;s time that it took to get from Japan to well Venice Beach, CA where in fact I happened to have the bathtub filled with water to soak the window blinds and I was a third shift worker who had 2 days off I had received the alert on an app which I had the time of the occurrence while in the bathroom about 2 hrs 10 min 38 sec and my tub water was actually swaying for the distance was greater it was only a 7/8ths of a inch sway unlike tonight where i set up for it got a 1 1/4th of an inch sway earthquakes bigger than 7.0 if distances are greater than  3,000 miles for something smaller like a 5.9 mag to 6.9 mag would have to be  &lt;3,000 mi and &gt;2,500 mi and for and for like a 3.5 mag to 5.8 mag would have to be &lt;2,500  mi in order to see about a 1 inch sway  that is made in a tub from Earth moving in one pushing motion in one direction this is why the tub would have to be long ways pointing to and away from the earthquake here&#39;s a diagram: <br><br>earthquake pushing......&gt;.........&gt;............&gt;...........[;;;;;;;;;;;;;;]the bathtub of water...&gt;...........&gt;..................&gt;.................... <br><br> This can be used using any point of the compass but hit or miss you gotta be lucky  when it comes to earthquakes which we kinda all are as long as the tub you use for the water is facing east and west from where it is and for it to work well you can be on the ground level in fact 2nd story is perfect  or using a controlled test for this theory works as well.                                                                            <br><br><br><br><br>In my theory proposal I look at converting time in to the past and future at the same time . meaning where it happen where it went and how fast it took to get there. To create a computable number  or the [ out come number] that has information embedded within the time itself that when converted you can find the mass displacement, and  speed of its out going power.   and take the time from which it happened. to do this take this earthquake that took place in Russia today 1/29/16. so to do this take <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=10h25m10s\">10:25:10</a> PM EST then find the difference from when the water started moving at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=11h48m29s\">11:48:29</a> PM EST you then find how long it took for it to get here to make the movement of bath water in the tub swaying which in fact you can see this is really cool how this works i have been studying this on my own for about 8 months so it&#39;s my new idea!!!!! it took <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=1h23m19s\">1:23:19</a> hours  for that push to reach us now to get what i call the out come number of this wave so you can then take the time from when the earthquake happens. Mind you it has to be a big one like 7.0+ and your bathtub has to  be running the same line lengthwise in the direction of the event. So you take the time from which it happened at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=10h25m10s\">10:25:10</a> PM EST and turn it into this [102,510= the out come number] a countable number other than time.  Then take the time from which you have received the wave of the quake that you won&#39;t feel but the water will pick up by moving left to right in the tub like someone bumped the house that time is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=11h48m29s\">11:48:29</a> PM EST turn that into the out come number =114,829 you subtract the two numbers from the time state of the number  giving you this number <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=1h23m19s\">1:23:19</a>hrs=12,319  you then find the distance from you to the quake which in my case it&#39;s 5,327 miles you then take the outcome number  now to fully tell you about this idea of changing the number into something other then time that we think of saying its all connected with different properties of use we need to simplify the number for use of it&#39;s other properties that are embedded within time itself we then take the [outcome number] i&#39;ll call it Baptiste,  a.k.a. my last name,  Law this is when your figuring out mass displacement unless they have something there already with a law of changing time  into  a computable  number other than time  you take the [ outcome number ] =12,319 and the multiply that buy the distance 5,327 giving you not speed but the amount of displacement within that time frame of  65,623,313 metric tons of Earth displacement or the nudge to find the speed of which it traveled.  well simple math haha you take the time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=1h23m19s\">1:23:19</a>hrs using my law the Baptiste law you then change it to the [out come number]= 13,219 you divide  this new outcome number to the distance of travel from using the surface of Earth from where you are to the event zone which = 5,327 miles you get 2.481250929 or 2.48 you then take the 5,327 multiply that by 2.48 = 13,210.96 mi/hr.", "comment_date": "2016-01-30T08:10:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Pray", "comment_text": "Ravioli ravioli give me the formuoli", "comment_date": "2016-01-29T23:40:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "King Kross", "comment_text": "isn&#39;t a basic Generation is 10 years so from 1990-1999 and 2000-2009 and so on. just guessing.", "comment_date": "2016-01-29T22:55:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tentavision", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=11m10s\">11:10</a> why is your shadow red", "comment_date": "2016-01-29T16:02:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xx1ML3G1T xX", "comment_text": "Why did Michael film this episode in a Taco Bell bathroom?", "comment_date": "2016-01-29T04:25:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "reissecupfilms", "comment_text": "I&#39;m gonna keep this in mind for the next 20 years just to see if it&#39;s true.", "comment_date": "2016-01-29T03:22:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marco Polo", "comment_text": "I remember in the 90s  I used to wear really baggy wide leg oversized pants, so baggy that people couldn&#39;t see my shoes.

Music doesn&#39;t have to scratch anybody&#39;s itch but the music maker&#39;s, and if you want to look for more diverse and interesting music writing in the popular realm you will find plenty if you dig deep enough. I&#39;m not even talking about being good or bad music, just more diverse.And by popular I mean: not academic.This is more of a problem between authentic music X functional music then a problem between generations, and exists since aways. One can put side by side for example, the music written by bards versus the music ordereded by the church for the Mass in medieval in times. The first was maybe created to express the feelings and environment of an individual, it does not matter, what matters is that it had freedon, it could embrace any kind of melodic and harmonic obscenity, while the second had to follow a format designed for the ritual of the Mass. The result is that every gregorian chant sounds alike, while the bard songs created personality for themselves and some pretty interesting inovations in melodic accidends and in use of instruments.\u00a0This diference between funtional X authentic goes on today in popular music and even inside erudite, or so called classical music, which has its own bunch of &quot;soundthesame&quot; kind of music. With the time other entities came to replace the direction/function giver, the Church.

So many songs during dictatorships that go the long way &#39;round to talking about the pain of the people, yet the people fucking know, they get the point, they can decipher. It&#39;s magical. Yet now the money grabbing whores of the industry put out crap people to do a crap job that doesn&#39;t fit them. Katty perry, thought to be some kind of prodigy by some, can&#39;t sing.

There is a huge, gaping variable you aren&#39;t considering. How reading has gone down, drastically. And this truth is manifesting itself in the creation of things like audible books. No an audio book isn&#39;t inherently bad, but I know people who never read and only listen. Now as far as the quality of books, there has been a cultural shift for better or worse. Most classical literature we&#39;re character based, the plot a platform use to support and define the characters. But since films are plot driven, most books have adopted this form and conveying.

I&#39;d recently read several books on polio that shed light on a side of North American history I&#39;d never known about, and changed my whole perspective on what things were like back then. Though I didn&#39;t say it out loud, I remember thinking for the first time, &quot;Well of course those days were better for <i>you</i>. You were white and middle class, and no one in your family got crippled by polio or ruined by the Depression.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s when I suddenly realized \u2014 most of the people you hear complaining about the &quot;good old days&quot; are white, middle-class, heterosexual, cisgender, healthy, able-bodied, and so on. Life may very well have been better for <i>them</i>, but it wasn&#39;t better for people who got sick, for people who were crippled (it&#39;s appalling how they were treated even as recently as the 50s), for people with mental illnesses, for people who were black, or gay, or trans, or poor. Improving the lives of people on the bottom often involves those on the top making some concessions (and becoming more aware of what the world is like outside their bubble). So with every generation, as things get a bit less unequal, things get a bit less luxurious and carefree for them, and they understandably perceive the world as becoming a worse place, because they&#39;re thinking about how great it used to be for <i>them</i>, and forgetting how awful it was for everyone else.<br><br>And oftentimes, they even forget how bad it was for <i>them</i>. My grandmother&#39;s first fianc\u00e9 died of kidney disease at 29, and her oldest sister died of pre-eclampsia at 18. Though the latter case was mostly the result of medical malpractice, I suspect that today&#39;s medicine could have saved at least one of them, even if nothing else had changed.

All these are in Sapolsky&#39;s new collection, along with something one might not expect: wry, witty prose that reads like the unexpected love child of a merger between Popular Science and GQ, written by an author who could be as much at home holding court at the local pub as he is in a university lab. In this collection (the majority of pieces ran in Discover, others in Men&#39;s Health, the New Yorker and Scientific American), Sapolsky ranges wherever his formidable curiosity leads, from genetic determinism as seen through the eyes of People magazine&#39;s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot; to the reasons why crotchety old people are neurologically disinclined to like whatever passes for music among young people nowadays. Each essay brings its own unexpected delight, brief enough that you can dip a toe in, yet insightful enough to encourage you to pursue the topic further (and Sapolsky helpfully appends to each essay a list of suggested further readings).&quot;<br><a href=\"http://www.amazon.ca/Monkeyluv-Other-Essays-Lives-Animals/dp/0743260163\">http://www.amazon.ca/Monkeyluv-Other-Essays-Lives-Animals/dp/0743260163</a>", "comment_date": "2015-11-29T04:50:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackson Mock", "comment_text": "My brain craves that mineral", "comment_date": "2015-11-29T04:02:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quang Milky", "comment_text": "Now: bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop<br>( Whip/Nae Nae - Silento).", "comment_date": "2015-11-29T03:58:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ben moshe", "comment_text": "greeeeeaaaaatttttt video !!!! pls do allot more<br> you are the best", "comment_date": "2015-11-29T02:18:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LoneElephant 752", "comment_text": "Hey Michael, I always think what would or will happen if the earth flipped Like the cars went up past the atmosphere and people went up into the air like falling like what would happen?

All the &quot;essentials&quot; for life in America - school, jobs, general knowledge, and a household - Is all degrading. More and more people are homeless, because they can&#39;t get jobs, as someone is working 3 jobs or something because they don&#39;t earn enough since inflation is a bad thing.<br><br>Schools are the largest victim here; teachers are slaves to the curriculum, and can&#39;t say a word more than what they have. Students themselves are victims of this behavior; forced to conform to what the curriculum says, true or not. They can&#39;t speak up against anything without harsh consequence. More and more students are dropping out not necessarily because they just want to, or think it&#39;s cool or something. It&#39;s because the sheer amount of work you get in school as an unnecessary guarantee for everyone&#39;s understand is super stressful, and takes it&#39;s toll on the mind.<br><br>General knowledge to find jobs is even degrading, yet they are still accepted into the society based on personal bias and the expert fallacy. Utility is almost completely overlooked, believe it or not, and you can get into just about any job if you speak correctly; a huge flaw in the deciding factor.<br><br>People with jobs all over the country are suffering from the effects of inflation: They have to work more jobs to make a living, as the value of products increases while wages stay the same. As a result from that, which can really take it&#39;s toll on someone, they become physically and mentally unhealthy. It leaves you with no time to do anything you actually want to do, which totally goes into another discussion on &quot;What is the purpose of our existence? Working isn&#39;t one of them.&quot; But if I talk about that here, it will start fights, which I do not have the patience or sanity left for.<br><br>Relationships I can&#39;t even get into. Far too big a topic.<br><br><br>We think robbers as terrible people who wish to insight fear on everyone around them and use it to make them give something they have to him/her, but sometimes there&#39;s a genuine reason.

Though about pop music, it isn&#39;t the only genre of music that has been lacking complexity and has gotten simpler. Im studying music and its really hard sometimes to enjoy certain pop songs when they follow the same formula, then again I feel the same for certain classical sonatas that follow a strict form and might stick to 1 or 2 key signatures (can get boring), but with that said, I admit that when there&#39;s a pop song that follows the typical &quot;pop song&quot; formula but includes sounds or timbres that I haven&#39;t heard before its awesome! Its like, what else can you do with that four chord progression? How far can you take that and will you be able to make an original statement? Then again a lot of us are just aching for new sounds right? Also some simple music that might sound like any other pop song can be good for our brains because science has recently shown that listening to more complex music is more tiring than listening to less complex music, especially if you&#39;re musically trained then your brain is just gonna have even more to process hehe idk just some of my thoughts", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T05:47:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NWViewer1", "comment_text": "My late uncle once said:<br>&quot;If it wasn&#39;t for kids who knew more than their parents, we&#39;d still be living in caves.&quot;", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T05:46:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Canal1337", "comment_text": "And as always, another excellent video!", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T05:21:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheGaurdianSeesYou", "comment_text": "qouldnt 9/11 be a crisis?", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T05:20:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Holy Cannoli", "comment_text": "<b>watches video</b><br><b>gains a new perspective</b><br><b>feels the need to pet Michael&#39;s fuzzy head</b>", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T05:00:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Retard Ranger", "comment_text": "teenagers are scary<br>(half viewer base gone by the next day)", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T04:55:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Retard Ranger", "comment_text": "teenagers are scary<br>(half viewer base gone by the next day)", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T04:55:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stoney Baloney", "comment_text": "Mikel: do you know what else is scary<br><br>Me: DEEZ NUTZ!

That&#39;s definitely true but we probably shouldn&#39;t forget about a similar, unconscious reason for increased similarity: Making &quot;Pop&quot; music reinforces the defining characteristics of what &quot;Pop&quot; is. The more &quot;Pop&quot; is made, the more these characteristics are reinforced and the more narrow they eventually become. Thus, over time, they become more similar simply because every new song is doing its part to emphasize the genre&#39;s boundaries. <br>I think a better measure of musical complexity and diversity is just to look at the variety of genres that exist today compared to, say, 20 years ago.

To be more precise: Why is a biological body superior/inferior to technological. The advantages and disadvantages of cyborgs. Are our biological bodies simply just very advanced technological bodies?

And this topic, I think, if ever taken into consideration, should be analyzed by taking into account brains(brain technology?) and our body. If for example our bodies are highly advanced technological pieces then are our brains even more advanced than that? Can these two be even compared this way?

Likewise, artists of the first half of the XX century have shook the world at the very time they were doing their creative work. This has always been the case. Which artists are shaking the world in the last 20-30 years? Not many, I think. Sure, there are many of those that gain great fame, wealth etc but their overall influence is, for the most part, forgotten.

Im saying that and Im a teenager. It  is just copied bull crap that milks the cow of people who have not the brain to analyze the meaning behind the lyrics. Look at some older metal. Surprisingly, there are MANY different meanings in most metal and rock songs. Take &quot;Mein Herz Brennt&quot; by Rammstein. Its not terribly old but the meanings in the lyrics are amazing. Or what about Dream Theater&#39;s magnum opus, &quot;A Change of Seasons?&quot; This masterpiece is a single song that last more than twenty minutes and is SO powerful and complex. It changes time signatures more than once a minute for goodness sakes! People my age are listening to Fetty Wap who sounds like a person with a speaking disorder (no offense, its just true) and the song &quot;Or Nah&quot; which is just about SEX! No double meanings, just sex! That is so dull! Haven&#39;t we had enough friggin&#39; love songs! How about a storyline where a guy proposes to his girlfriend, she denies him, he kills her, she comes back to life and kills him, then they go on a murdering spree together? Oh wait, that&#39;s already been done (A Little Piece of Heaven by A7X)! Today&#39;s music isn&#39;t bad. Today&#39;s mainstream music on the other hand is just so boring. No genre is bad. Everyone has their own taste but when an &quot;artist&quot; walks into a room, says a couple words, someone else makes a mind numbing beat to go with it, loops it five times then calls it a song, that is utter bull crap. That isn&#39;t art! Okay, even if I make a stretch and say that it is art, it would be a poem, where as there are great novels out there, in every genre! And I swear! If I hear one more freaking Fetty Wap song I am going to gouge someones eye out (Ok, I just realized how ironic that is. Im not making fun of him, it was not intended, but at the same time that was too funny of a coincidence to erase)!", "comment_date": "2015-11-03T02:04:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "klutzedufus", "comment_text": "&quot;Hey guys, go look at my dong&quot;", "comment_date": "2015-11-03T02:04:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aidan red", "comment_text": "On music: it is unfair to say our generations music is dumbed down and simple.

My feeling is that these things they are doing have never been done before and a sign that we are really heading over an abyss very rapidly, especially considering how there really doesn&#39;t seem to be an outrage over it.  We have all heard that during WW2, that between the things the Nazis were doing and Pearl Harbor, there were tons of really angry guys who were so offended by what was going on that they would even lie about their age in order to sign up and go fight against these enemies.  Yet today? No one from our cultures seem anywhere near as offended and certainly not truly supporting our own military and they even look at our military machine with contempt!  How can we say that things today are the same as they&#39;ve ever been when clearly the attitudes of people within the military age group are not at all (as a majority) willing to do anything about it as previous generations were.  Certainly from Viet Nam and now, theres been a strong anti military shift among the youthful public and very few seem willing to want to get their hands bloody over a belief that we are right and the enemy is wrong (or at least that our government might be wrong to involve us in anything thats not directly affecting us).

They&#39;re also still being made today. And it wasn&#39;t because we used to have better and greater taste in music either, oh, no, seeing the average reaction of younger folk to the older generation of music, which is usually, &quot;I wish we had that today.&quot; It&#39;s because we&#39;re lazy.

Back when there were CDs, and prices were quite frankly ridiculously high while their costs were low, virtually everything was a guaranteed sale, a guaranteed success, and if occasionally something failed; it mattered not to the billions of profit they were swimming in. As a result, they had no trouble signing new artists, new genres, and promoting them. That&#39;s no longer the case.<br><br>Since music companies dictate what radios put on the air through package deals; you only get this very successful song and artist if you also put all these on; the result is no variety on the radio; just nothing but the most over produced, nothing to attack the senses, lazy, non-risk, processed in a factory crappy music.

The next generation remembers this (the generational criticism, or\u00a0being viewed as immature)\u00a0as a negative experience,\u00a0which\u00a0instills a brashness, a hardness of character,\u00a0and a\u00a0lack of perhaps humility\u00a0and mildness. Also: The mere fact that in the late 1800&#39;s there is evidence of some\u00a0behaviors being\u00a0comparable to some\u00a0from modern life in the 2010&#39;s is not enough to draw the conclusion that the world isn&#39;t changing. The world has been changing on too slow an arc\u00a0to base theory off of behavior 100-130 years ago.\u00a0The arc has however curved sharply in the last 100-120 years.

Exaggeration\u00a0IS effective, but that does not mean the sentiment is untrue, that it is somehow a &quot;white\u00a0lie&quot; used to control the next generation. Exaggeration is not ideal, certainly not in this current zeitgeist of questioning everything; the exaggeration will only serve to alienate the next generation because they will feel the previous generation is being paranoid, or out-of-touch with the world. While this imperfect tendency also exists, it is in interest of guarding the next generation and rallying them to serve with the previous generation to fight, to protect the settlement, to encourage solidarity. We must not disregard the warnings of previous generations as it concerns a code of conduct.

I support my hypothesis with the following evidence:<br><br>Using the labels at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=0m55s\">0:55</a>, every generation, from the Silent Generation back, were brought up in a culture that, at large, hailed the values, interests, opinions, and pursuits of <b>adults</b>. The children, therefore, had to weather the obnoxious complaining about their peers by adults, and were expected to eventually grow up into a world that valued the older, wiser generations, and were better for it. They left their childish things behind them and mixed a few new approaches to the old and continued carrying the torch.<br><br>But starting with the Baby Boomers and on to now, we have lived in a culture where the values, interests, opinions, and pursuits of <b>adolescents</b> (first teenagers, and now sometimes including pre-teens) are held aloft. Hard discipline is frowned upon, sometimes even illegal. Millions of young people demand their &quot;piece&quot; and to be cared for but have no interest in contributing and earning things on their own. Our economy supports impulsiveness and pretty much demands and expects debt. I could go on. <br><br>&quot;There is nothing new under the sun,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean everything is constant or lends itself to longevity. The older generations, now, are expected more and more to bow to the whims of the younger generations with no regard to the harm that it can cause them. To offend or make someone uncomfortable is now a sin, and such is the logic of children. <br><br>At least the Baby Boomers had the advantage of having the value of hard work instilled in them by their Greatest- and Silent-Generation parents. But they notoriously didn&#39;t leave the house in better order than they found it, and the generations since aren&#39;t doing a good job of cleaning the mess themselves.<br><br>So let&#39;s not discuss how every generation has griped about the upcoming generation and then those generations grow up to be fine, without acknowledging that the last few generations have not had to actually grow up in the same ways.", "comment_date": "2015-11-02T16:05:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Micah", "comment_text": "This was so interesting!

That media today is mindless and doesn&#39;t teach values. I find that in the comment section of freaking Pokemon or whatever.<br>Not only was Pokemon not the smart, high value thing they are trying to make it out to be, it also still exists and is largely the same thing; in some aspects actually better, smarter, deeper and more challenging. So what the hell?<br>I also saw people in videos about 90&#39;s consoles and handhelds complain about computers and smartphones and how we used to take our Game Boy outside and play together and spend time in the sun while nowadays kids only sit around at home or on their smartphones. How the hell does that make sense and how are people not realizing that they are saying these things on videos about the things our parents said kept us from going outside and socializing? And how is the heavy use of the internet, the constant connection to friends online any less social than playing on your Game Boy all day? <br>Ugh... It&#39;s just sad.

Popular music has evolved into more easy listening because less people (most young people and I should know) are actively paying attention to what they are listening to.

Here&#39;s what I think will happen, (and I will be super specific so feel free to correct me in ten years :^)] the climate change will cause mass concern, and as a result we&#39;re finally going to start fixing many of our problems. For instance, cows, fuckers release insane amounts of methane into the atmosphere, they&#39;re actually worse than cars. Which since we&#39;re talking about, will be another point of contention in our newest crises.<br> So, what&#39;ll happen? The meat industry and the auto industry will be revamped and likely many, many others. A carbon tax will be instated and we&#39;ll be happy. On top of that, there should be a boom in new technology that&#39;s more ecologically sound, paving the way for more jobs! Effectively replacing modern day auto/engine production. Yay! <br>One of the main reasons I believe there will be a corporate renaissance is because of the growing awareness of the way monopolies affect our government. Bernie Sanders, love him or hate him, is a figure for this. If Bernie is elected then this whole process will be sped up, if Trump is the corporate turnover will be slowed, and if Hillary is then... Well, Hilary is conservative... I guess she might try to ignore global warming? Or at least downplay its severity.

I have a theory about music tastes. If you look at any genre, there are always certain patterns. It doesn&#39;t matter what style of music, there is always a specific format to that style, and sometimes even a sub-variant. For example, a lot of 70s-80s hard rock bands sound similar, and then AC/DC has songs that both fit that mold and are immediately identifiable as being AC/DC, even if you never heard that particular song before. I think that the reason people dislike certain genres or artists, or new music, because they are trying to apply the rules of a different style to it. Of course Person X dislikes modern pop, they&#39;re still thinking in terms of grunge, or maybe Tupac or Wu Tang Clan. Of course X&#39;s grandparents hate X&#39;s music, they&#39;re thinking in terms of The Beatles and Rolling Stones. And of course everyone pays lip service to classical, but trained musicians make up the majority of those who actually listen to it, as they&#39;re the only ones with the background to understand what the rules back then even were.", "comment_date": "2015-11-02T06:09:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L0LWTF1337", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0x7ho_IYc&amp;t=12m37s\">12:37</a> So...

The only real reason as to why every new generation is arrogant, self centered, and spoiled is because the previous generation lets them do just that.

I believe that technology shouldn&#39;t be blamed for the selfishness and carelessness of teenagers, but teenagers themselves should be. Teenagers &#39;these days&#39; in my opinion count on technology and took it too far.  If they look up to an actor, a social personality or pretty much anyone, they all are in the social media dome. Teenagers try to be better and more successful than the last generation and want to keep up with whats going on. Social media was a great idea, it can connect people from across the globe, share news worldwide and can help people to connect with a celebrity or someone they look up to. Teenagers took it too far but it can&#39;t really be changed, no generation is the same. If people in past generations wished for this technology to happen and people would stay the same they were not thinking because as technology grows people change. This may not be what they were expecting but it might even get worse for people like us to be mentors for the next generations and when technology gets better just you wait.
