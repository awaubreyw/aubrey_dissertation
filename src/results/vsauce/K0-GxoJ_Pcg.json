The earth is neither rotating nor revolving. The sun appears to move from east to west because the earth is tilting. To explain this concretely, you can think of an umbrella in the sky. As the umbrella in the sky rotates while tilting its axis, the sun will appear to be in a circular motion. In reality, the umbrella is not rotating, but the earth is tilting while tilting its axis. The tilt angle of the axis changes when the four seasons change. When this goes out of orbit, it becomes a pole shift, which is the ice age.<br><br>* In the predecessor Kujiki Taiseikyo, written by Prince Shotoku, the freshness is light, the sun rises, and when it becomes heaven, it becomes the heaven and keeps covering the earth, and the turbidity sinks heavily. , The shade is stiff and becomes the ground. A modern translation of this is that the quanta that make up the universe are light, constantly circulating, and the elementary particles that make up the Earth are heavy, stagnant, and solidified into matter. Therefore, the earth is immovable, and the universe (heaven) is moving around. Due to the law of inertia, heavy objects cannot move. It is a child&#39;s deception such as the heliocentric theory, and it is just a superstition that the earth rotates forever. If the earth revolves around the heavy sun, the galaxy should revolve around the center of gravity of the universe, but there is no such movement, only the constellations are circularly moving around the heavy earth around the North Star. ..<br><br>* Let&#39;s prove that Galileo&#39;s heliocentric theory is a lie<br>It should be possible to observe the rotation of the earth from a flying airplane, but it does not seem to be moving very much. The earth, the atmosphere, and the airplane are not rotating as one. The atmosphere is not bound to the earth because the wind is blowing from all directions, north, south, east and west. Airplanes are not bound by the atmosphere because they can navigate freely in the atmosphere. Certainly, when observing the appearance of flying a botfly in an airplane in flight, the botfly was flying lightly without being affected by the inertial force generated by the weight of the botfly itself due to the speed of the airplane. This is evidence that no inertial force is generated in the confined airplane. In other words, it is considered that the air in the space before and after the botfly (even if it is a vacuum) cancels the inertial force. The inertial force is created by the air pocket after the object is moving. Therefore, after the airplane, the inertial force works, and if it suddenly decelerates, the inertial force works positively. However, the atmosphere on the earth is freely flowing without being glued to the earth. Therefore, if the airplane sails westward against the eastern inertial force (due to centrifugal force) due to the rotation of the earth, the propulsive force of the airplane will be attenuated accordingly. The inertial force generated by the rotation of the earth at 1700 km / h is quite large, and it is quite possible that the airplane cannot travel.<br><br>The speed of rotation of the earth near the equator is 1700 km / h. If the ground is moving at this speed when the plane lands, the plane will be wrecked by the impact. The reason why it is not wrecked is that the earth does not rotate.<br>If you look closely at the movement of the constellations, you will see two circles. If the earth rotates, one circle should be formed. This is a contradiction of the rotation theory.<br> <br>If you ride a rotating wooden horse that rotates counterclockwise and pass the ball to your opponent, the ball will bend in a right curve. If you shoot the target with a rifle, it will not hit the target in the same way. This is also the basis for saying that the rotation theory is wrong. The rocket launch video shows the rocket flying straight into the sky. If the earth is rotating, it should draw a curve that warps in the direction of rotation due to the inertial force of centrifugal force.<br><br>Evidence that Antarctica is infinite<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXXnXq_FCNo&amp;list=UU8nlwBiuAcuLKOFz7V-NGyg&amp;index=7\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXXnXq_FCNo&amp;list=UU8nlwBiuAcuLKOFz7V-NGyg&amp;index=7</a><br><br>* The most stupid is the Nobel Prize-winning scholar, and the most genius is Prince Shotoku, a psychic of wisdom who excels in intuition.<br><br>Let&#39;s break free from the brainwashing of science (mathematics, physics, etc.) built with lies and regain the true scholarship in our hands. Twice<br><br>Science is a fiction created by the devil to deny God, and it is true that it is described in ancient Japanese legends and the Christian Bible. All the stupid scholars overturned this truth and built it into Mason&#39;s convenient system. Thanks to that, the people believe in the devil&#39;s scam rather than the word of God. What is called brainwashing without calling this brainwashing? Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution, Galileo&#39;s heliocentric theory, Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, medicine, genetic engineering (genes are words and genes are tools) are all wrong. On the contrary, ghosts, UFOs (aliens are lies), psychic powers, divine miracles, telepathy, teleportation, etc., which are called occult, are true. There are things and spirits (gods) in this world, and the universe is active by the spiritual power (thoughts) of God. God created everything by means of word soul. It is clear when you read the Bible. Today&#39;s scholars use human wisdom to knead logic and cannot reach the truth. What is important is intuition. Why does a child do that? What cannot be answered is a mistake. Our common sense is more correct than a stupid scholar. Everything is made up of matter by the thought of God (person).<br><br>1 + 1 = 2 cannot be proved by a mathematical formula. Only the physical phenomenon that one apple is combined with another apple to form two apples can be proved. If the apple disappears suddenly, or if the number increases like the art of alter ego, 1 + 1 = 2 does not hold. 0 + 1 \u2260 1. Since 0 (none) is not a thing, it should not be treated as a number. Even if you combine apples and oranges, the things are different, so there is no point in adding them. If God is defined as having (integer), there is no existence (0) because there is no other than God. Mathematics is wrong and fictional because it defines 0, negative numbers, imaginary numbers, \u221e, etc. that do not exist in this world.<br><br>The roots of scientific theory are all unsuccessful, and the bottom is cracked. For example, in particle physics, electrons connect atoms to form a molecule. A meson is a link between a proton and a neutron, and a proton is made up of three quarks. Electrons and positrons (antimatter) are generated from photons. Every time a new elementary particle is discovered, an elementary particle that connects the elementary particles is required, and the relationship between the elementary particles and the elementary particles becomes increasingly unclear. Why is there a difference in the presence or absence of electric charge even though protons and neutrons have the same mass? Science has no answer to these questions. I think that electrons are matter, and positrons are matter-deficient holes surrounded by ghosts and not matter. In other words, antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is trying to think logically and is losing sight of the truth. God&#39;s constructed natural mechanism is simpler, but difficult to understand with human wisdom.<br><br>Einstein&#39;s ghost<br>People who often experienced asphyxia are said to have seen the scene of heaven through the tunnel of light during the rebirth. The speed of movement of the soul is no longer bound by gravity, and in the world of consciousness there is no law of invariance of the speed of light that I discovered in my lifetime. In other words, what you think is to move as it is. Furthermore, what you think is transmitted to the other party as it is. All of us life share one inner nature. And the substance is actually consciousness. All things are in your heart, and you are the one who lives in the heart of all life. It means that everything in this universe looks like the outside world to the eye, but in reality the outside world is your inner world. Here, the relativity disappears, and this universe is based on the &quot;universal truth called God.&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-01-12T03:38:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u9ad8\u6a4b\u62d3\u54c9", "comment_text": "\u203bThe most stupid one is a scholar of winning the Nobel Prize, and the first genius is Prince Shotoku of the medium of the wisdom that excelled in intuitive power.<br><br> We are delivered from it from brainwashing of the science (mathematics, physics) got by a lie, and let&#39;s regain true study in our hand. <br> <br>The science is the fiction which I made because the devil denies God, and what is listed in a Japanese old legend and the Christian Bible is true. A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.<br><br>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.<br><br>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.<br><br>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.<br><br>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.<br><br>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.<br><br>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.<br><br>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.<br><br>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.<br><br>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.<br><br>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.<br><br>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.<br><br>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.<br><br>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:<br><br>For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:<br><br>For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:<br><br>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:<br><br>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:<br><br>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:<br><br>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences<br><br>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:<br><br>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:<br><br>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.<br><br>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.<br><br>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.<br><br>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.<br><br>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.<br><br>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.<br><br>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.<br><br>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.<br><br>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T19:45:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NotSmile Plays", "comment_text": "And that\u2019s how Spin got invented Johnny!", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T19:18:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ImGoldenGuy", "comment_text": "In the end we go yeet and fir", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T18:54:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Husaam Asam", "comment_text": "It\u2019s a shame this guy is not Muslim", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T16:55:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chris Strebeck", "comment_text": "Its all theory \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 nobody really knows what would happen honestly..

And if our definition of a year becomes shorter, is the amount of time that a year changes by negligible enough to ignore when estimating the timing of cosmic events? Like now it\u2019s estimated that the earth will be absorbed by the sun in 7.5 billion years, but is that assuming every year from now until then will be composed of 365 24-hour long days, or is the change of the speed of earth\u2019s rotation factored into these estimates?

Well, first of all you would gain weight. But that is the least of your worries. The spin of our planet is important and is actually giving you the time of your life. (literally) At the equator, the surface of Earth, and everything on it, is spinning around at 465 metres a second. As you move closer to the poles you don&#39;t have to move as quickly to complete Earth&#39;s daily rotation. Here in San Francisco the Earth would be driving me east at 368 metres per second. If I could float above the surface independent of the Earth&#39;s rotation, the Earth would spin underneath me pretty quick, pretty cool. But, of course, when I jump straight up into the air, the Earth doesn&#39;t move underneath me because I continued to spin with it. We are all spinning with the Earth and that is why slamming on a set of magical planetary breaks that caused everything classically called Earth (dirt, hills, rocks, soil, sand, tectonic plates, the crust, everything below the crust and etc.) to stop spinning would be catastrophic. Immediately everything that wasn&#39;t Earth, and wasn&#39;t safely at the poles, would continue moving, as it had been, and be flung east at more than a thousand miles an hour. You wouldn&#39;t be flung into space because escape velocity is 24,800 mph (ca 39911.731 km/h) but your body would instantly become a 9.5 inch calibre bullet. Well, really more of a supersonic tumbleweed. Because the atmosphere would more gradually slow down, people in airplanes assuming they could navigate the resulting storms might have a better chance of surviving. Astronauts around the ISS would fare even better. But it is unlikely that anyone would be waiting for them down on the ground.

The definition of the second is related to the <b>frequency of the radiation</b> emitted/absorbed between these levels. i.e. the difference in energy between them, divided by planck&#39;s constant. When the electron drops down from the higher energy level to the lower one, it gives off a photon of light at a frequency determined by the size of the energy gap. Given a known frequency (of any kind) we can define the second in relation to that. And since frequency of light is directly proportional to the energy difference in atomic orbitals, we can define the second in relation to any two arbitrarily chosen atomic energy levels. We choose two specific levels for the outermost electron of a cesium atom for a couple of reasons but anyway the point is it&#39;s not about how rapidly the electron moves up and down, it&#39;s about the frequency of the radiation that corresponds to that energy gap, which is in turn deeply related to the Planck constant.", "comment_date": "2017-12-01T14:03:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vic Steurs", "comment_text": "They heard scientist say that a very long time ago mars used to be just like earth.

Physics says if moving object or particle smashed with another particle or object then only motion occurred. But if we are talking about dark matter then what things are happening in the dark matter who create another universe. According to the theory of relativity black holes are stop moving as they start to grab everything inside them and if you say black holes are moving too then relative to what? If whole dark matter moving like a flow in one direction then what gives that motion to the dark matter? We are still missing main force apart from gravity and that is What makes everything move/spin. I hope, I will help some physicist to think about in that direction.

You already answered in this video that that if Earths core stopped spinning we would lose protection from the sun.   But what about birds losing their ability to navigate, would that really happen? What about the scene on the golden gate bridge, would the loss of the OZone be visible like they portray in the movie? Also if the earth core did stop spinning, would using nuclear bombs to start it up again be realistic? How much nuclear energy would it take realistically? I would enjoy watching a video on this.

If earth was spinning from west to east, the clouds should have always moved from west to east !!! Sometimes the clouds just stay where they are and sometimes they move... that means, earths atmosphere is not locked to earth&#39;s surface. Am i missing anything here?<br><br>03) Why do we see the birds flying in smooth paths and they dont get lost out of sight due to earth&#39;s high rotational speed?<br><br>04) why does the rain not fall miles away from the clouds due to earth&#39;s rotation?<br><br>05) If we try taking a long jump in west to east we should technically cover less distance as earth is also rotating in the same direction... if we took a long jump from east to west, we should be able to cover longer distances as earth would have moved 0.5 km per sec below the feet?? The initial velocity of any object will be same as the speed of earth. In one case we jump in the direction of earth&#39;s rotation and in other case we jump against the earth&#39;s rotation. Technically the initial velocity should add up or cancel out with the speed of jump !!!<br><br>06) Is there a container anywhere on earth that can display water being curved as it is shown on globe earth.. again curvature runs in miles..<br><br>07) why dont the aircrafts land sidewards as thr earth is supposed to be spinning from west to east? Or, should I assume that all the runways on earth are in east west direction?<br><br>08) How does solar eclipse take place when sun and moon are sometimes seen in a different positions in the sky at the same time? I have personally not witnessed this but have seen many videos though.<br><br>09) If earth is rotating from west to east at 1600 km per hour, why do we see the ripples on water surface moving in all directions with equal speed. They should actually be distorted !!!<br><br>10) If earth is a round rotating ball, why do the rockets need to fly upwards? even few miles horizontally should be enough to take rockets into space as earth is supposed to be round and it also revolves around the sun at a staggering speed. As earth revolves around the sun, it should also get away from the horizontally moving rocket.<br><br>Not sure if my sences are screwed up !!!", "comment_date": "2016-06-19T08:22:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ayush112000", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0-GxoJ_Pcg&amp;t=7m34s\">7:34</a> he used the orbital vsat from black ops 2 as a gps satalite", "comment_date": "2016-06-19T07:40:27Z", "likes_count": 74}, {"comment_by": "Kaleb Wilson", "comment_text": "This dude explains stuff sooooo good", "comment_date": "2016-06-19T07:22:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Natalia", "comment_text": "what if you were at a pole, in a bunker?", "comment_date": "2016-06-19T04:18:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackson Laskos", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t care if I got strait A&#39;s this year I still get confused when I watch this guy \ud83d\ude06 this is y I&#39;m subscribed to him", "comment_date": "2016-06-19T04:09:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cat", "comment_text": "Orbital vsat <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0-GxoJ_Pcg&amp;t=7m33s\">7:33</a>", "comment_date": "2016-06-19T00:36:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Poats", "comment_text": "Does this mean that a day for the dinosaurs was 23 hours long?", "comment_date": "2016-06-18T20:22:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom moT", "comment_text": "I&#39;m pretty sure that if the earth stopped rotating, days would be 6 months long not 1 year long.", "comment_date": "2016-06-18T20:18:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gwen Funtelar", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0-GxoJ_Pcg&amp;t=1m22s\">1:22</a> when somebody farts so loud.", "comment_date": "2016-06-18T13:32:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S PRIDE SCHAMROCK", "comment_text": "The Eart is not spinning!", "comment_date": "2016-06-18T13:28:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colin Soder", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t understand why any of this would happen!

The fact that they always continue spinning is against the commonly understood laws of physics. Therefore, to ask a logical question - where do they get their energy supply? The answer is that their very act of spinning actually &quot;claws&quot; in the scraps of various types of energy  from around them. The earth does the same thing. The earth, our mother Gaia is a conscious living entity and by spinning she is clawing in energy into her geomantic grid from the outside solar system/universe. It is a conscious process. Similarly, she choose to live in the area of the solar system which is exactly neither too cold or too hot - i.e. perfect for the emergence of life. <br><br>The north pole is too cold, in fact frozen, and the equator is perilously hot. The actual distance between the two expressed as a function of distance from the sun is very small. However, despite the fact that our earth spins around the sun in a gigantic circular orbit it never actually deviates out of this comfort zone. A random process? - i don&#39;t think so. There&#39;s a lot more at work here. <br><br>The reason why pure scientists ask questions such as how can everything in the universe be in such perfect balance and equilibrium - the statistical probability of this being by chance alone are astronomical etc etc is because they don&#39;t factor the concept of consciousness into the equation! The universe is alive - it is a thinking entity. All of the suns are connected by conduits of energy in the same way the neural networks in our brains are connected by neurotransmitters. <br><br>The world isn&#39;t going to stop spinning - have faith!", "comment_date": "2016-01-24T15:15:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rin Yokohama", "comment_text": "Vsauce you say that if you were to hover above the ground, and the spin of the earth wasnt affecting you, you could see the earth moving under you.

But, you will be to afraid to look into what all I say here, because you WANT TO BELIEVE what you were told. It sounds fantastic to you, right? Traveling a vast, endless &quot;space&quot; some day in a &quot;space ship&quot;? Explore other worlds, and live like you are in the Jetsons? Here&#39;s the problem: everything you believe is FALSE. It is not the reality that you have SEEN and OBSERVED your whole life. Consider the sun and moon. I already told you to go measure, and OBSERVE, through TESTING and REPEATING, which is SCIENCE, that the moonlight is 100% opposite of sunlight. It is cold, not hot light. The sun and moon appear to your vision to be the same size. They travel roughly the same path past you everyday. But you were taught from birth to believe the lie. In your crib, directly in your face, a solar system, going &#39;round the sun. You hit the age to be able to understand pictures and books? SOLAR SYSTEM TIIIME! Here is the GREAT BIG SUN little kids! And Earth is just a little insignificant dot whirling &#39;round it. You are blasted with the lie from birth to death. That is the manifesto of making a lie work on millions of people. The lie has to so enormous, so outlandish, that the average, reasonable minded person would never BELIEVE that such a lie be possible to attempt. The second rule of making a massive lie stick is CONSTANT REPETITION. Knowing what I just said, fire up you &#39;tel-lie-vision&#39; and start watching the news. Or just watch commercials. You will see a GLOBE EVERYWHERE. GLOBE and the word GLOBAL. If you are an older soul, then, you remember when you were growing up that everyone always said &quot;world-wide&quot; and &quot;all over the world&quot; and &quot;across the face of the Earth&quot;. Now? &quot;Globe global global globe globe global globe global globe globe global global global globe, were going global!&quot; That is the REPETITION to FORCE you to CONTINUE to always believe the lie. The Earth is FLAT. I mean that quite literally. Research quotes from the engineers and land surveyors whom laid the thousands of miles of bridges and railroad tracks all over the world that are still in use today. They all declare the ball Earth a lie, that astronomers claiming the earth to be a ball were stupid nutbags who never experimented or measured Earth like they do, and that there is NO MEASURABLE CURVATURE OVER ANY DISTANCE. Research and discover that ALL ships MUST use the FLAT, DISC-SHAPED EARTH map to navigate in the southern oceans or they will be LOST, or wrecked at sea. Notice there will NEVER be a GLOBE on ANY ship, be it, a boat, or a PLANE, to navigate with. Why? They are useless. They are only to get you to disbelieve the Bible. Period, dot. The whole fake belief that you spend 100% of your lifetime believing is true, is to make you believe that SURELY the Bible got it all wrong. You should know that those powerful men in control of our world are ALL part of the SAME club, though it has many names and lodges. There are literally millions of people who KNOW FOR A FACT that Earth is 100% flat. They are the men controlling our world politics, the &quot;news&quot; you are told (which are mostly hoaxes), they control 100% of what you are EVER allowed to be &quot;taught&quot; in any school in the U.S. by way of REGULATIONS AND &quot;STANDARDS&quot;. You have been duped through the entire process of your lives, from the minute you are in a crib. Nasa and space travel is just one small section of the massive amount of lies you all were &quot;taught&quot; is true. Like, &quot;The Christian Crusades&quot;, for example: is 100% a FAKE lie. The very story is actually well known by others &#39;round the world who laugh at Americans because they KNOW you are taught 100% lies. Everyone else is aware that the roman catholic church is who went around murdering anyone caught with SCRIPTURES, meaning, CHRISTIANS. It was NEVER Christians going around forcing people to believe their way. It was the catholic church killing millions of Christians. Again see: the OPPOSITE of what we were &quot;taught&quot; to &quot;believe&quot;. JFK? Yeah. The U.S. govt DID do it. He was cock-blocking thousand of shareholders of &quot;defense&quot; contracts from getting to get paid from having a war with Vietnam. DUH! THEY&#39;RE GONNA KILL ONE GUY TO GET THEIR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. 9-11? You&#39;re brain functions less than a single-cell amoeba if you don&#39;t realize that the U.S. govt is the only one capable of such a thing. They spent 2 million dollars investigating 9-11. That&#39;s about 3 million less than they spend on a random statue or sculpture to decorate the front of one of their buildings with. Btw, they spent SIXTY MILLION &quot;investigating&quot; Clinton&#39;s blow job. Sounds they like they must not have cared TOO much about who caused 9-11, huh? Have you not noticed that our military contacts are PRIVATE contracts? We give tax money that we do NOT owe to ANY govt or king, says the Constitution, and these rich men who control our govt pay their own companies to build our military equipment. I mean, how freaking brain-dead do you have to be to see that. Guess what else? We are everywhere in the world, on the OFFENSE, but all your life you have been taught to call it DEFENSE. You see? There&#39;s that OPPOSITE of REALITY (inversion) that you are taught again.\u00a0These rich men use the BIBLE in their club to perform their sex and death rituals (which they lovingly call ceremonies). Realize that, if these powerful men who ACTUALLY know what the REAL truth is, use the Bible to blaspheme, then that PROVES that it is the true book. These men do not use Jurassic Park, or Harry Potter, or any other &quot;fairy tale&quot; book. They use the Bible to disgrace. Why? Because they KNOW that we are on a FLAT, DISC-SHAPED Earth, and that it does not rotate, that it is covered by a DOME, called the &quot;firmament&quot; or &quot;raqia&quot; in ancient Hebrew, that the stars are in the DOME, exactly as the Bible stated. They are aware that the sun and moon are roughly the same size, and that they are CLOSE to Earth, and follow each other in a &quot;circuit&quot; above it. Google image: &quot;masonic artwork&quot; and observe. Also, they call their club the keepers of the secrets. Well guess what that secret is? Observe the UN logo. Observe immediately under the flat, disc-shaped Earth map that it says their motto which is: &quot;WE BELIEVE&quot;. Read up on Admiral Byrd&#39;s expeditions to Antarctica. Then follow that by reading up on Operation Starfish Prime, Operation FISH BOWL. Then follow that by reading up on the WORLDWIDE treaty immediately declaring that ALL major nations, even ones AT WAR with each other, all agreed to not fiddle with Antarctica. Such a thing is like watching soldiers standing in each others face ready for war against each other, and suddenly, someone declares: &quot;Ok everyone, not hitting, punching or shooting each other in the balls! Ok?!&quot; And then everyone agreeing. The Antarctica treaty proves that ALL wars are CONTRIVED by the leaders of those nations, but that they are all in the SAME CLUB together. They are ALL FRIENDS. Saddam? Bin Laden? All FREINDS. Russia? They are how NASA tells you they get to the space station you fools! No nations leaders are at war with each other. War is used as a GAME to those men who control militaries. Don&#39;t want to believe that? TOO BAD. The Antarctica treaty PROVES it. Your world is SCIENTIFICALLY and EXACTLY as the Bible declares it is. It does not move, or, rotate. It does not revolve around the sun. It is not a ball. If we lived on a ball, we would always be downhill from each other. Everyone, everywhere. If you are on a sphere, no matter how massive compared to you, you are on the very top of the sphere at all times. Sailing would be easy, just point and go downhill for free. You don&#39;t live on a ball. The Earth is the biggest thing mankind will ever interact with in this mortal body. See again, how they had you thinking the BIGGEST thing you will ever know is a little &quot;marble&quot;? It is all inversion. A classic position of satan. Remember, satan doesn&#39;t necessarily care WHAT you believe, as long as you don&#39;t believe the Bible. The Bible declared that water was first, even before the sun! Nasa just admitted several years back, publicly, that they have &quot;discovered&quot; that water on Earth is, indeed older than the sun. HE HE HE HE HE....... See. They will admit the Bible, but only one little truth every couple of years or so that you don&#39;t catch on to the fact that their entire organization was created by powerful men who HATE the fact that the Bible is true. That, actually IS the point of freemasonry. They control the world on behalf of the monarchy who operates on behalf of the Jesuits, who operate on behalf of the POPE. Now, go read: &quot;The Extreme Oath Of TheJesuits&quot;. It is on google. Go on. ....Now you have just read what is ACTUALLY going on in this world around you, while you could care less because you are kept ENTERTAINED by sports, tv shows, fake news, soothsayer churches with terrific music abilities. You are DUPED by your own SUN-god DAY worship. The GOD of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob declares HIS holy day that HE MADE AND SANCTIFIED, to be the SEVENTH DAY. But, again SEE? The inversion of satanism. &quot;No! Not the last day of the week when your own GOD said! The FIRST day! We will ignore HIS COMMANDMENT and honor him on the FIRST day, like the Bible-hating pagans do.", "comment_date": "2015-10-20T15:36:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ediancley, o \u00danico", "comment_text": "And what would happen if the Earth stopped spin not around itself, but just around the Sun?", "comment_date": "2015-10-20T12:20:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sunnie Albright", "comment_text": "this doesn&#39;t make any sense", "comment_date": "2015-10-20T03:45:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Verxx", "comment_text": "i have a question, there&#39;s been a game that has been released called soma, a horror Sci-fi game where  they put the conciseness of people, into robots, can we copy ourselves and paste it into robots?", "comment_date": "2015-10-20T00:02:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tevin Adams", "comment_text": "So we weigh more towards the equator", "comment_date": "2015-10-19T06:30:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tevin Adams", "comment_text": "So we would weigh more towards the equator?", "comment_date": "2015-10-19T06:29:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tevin Adams", "comment_text": "So we would way more towards the equator?", "comment_date": "2015-10-19T06:29:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Albert", "comment_text": "ROFL!

Since time is also a perception, by changing the time of a given year by a second or two will actually do nothing to the percepted time. For example, every year I have a birthday. Well if they decide that the earth is spinning too slowly or too quickly that they add/subtract a second or two, then my physical age does not change. The cells in my body will still have aged another year, or in seconds is 31,536,000. However my Percepted time will have been altered by these changes in time by the TAI time changes. This means that if they feel the need to subtract one second this year, they will have increased the VALUE of the other 31,535,999 seconds. So technically speaking, If the earth stopped spinning our perception of time would simply stop as well, since we would need to infinitely add seconds to TAI time to come up with 31,536,000 seconds worth of Value.<br><br>This also leads to another question regarding value of time and the effect changing percepted time has on it. <br><br>What if the earth constantly continued speeding up its spin? Would we need to infinitely subtract seconds in order to keep the the VALUE of 31,536,000 seconds? For example, (these numbers are simplified to more easily understand the example) If we are spinning at a rate of 1 meter/second, that means we will spin 31,536,000 meters in one year. Well if we increase that by 10, that means you would have to take 31,536,000 and divide that by 10. This would mean that a percepted year would only last a mere 3,153,600 seconds. Given earths current speed, that many seconds only equates to 36.5 days.<br><br>So, if the earth increased its rate of spin 10x, one year would actually only equate to 36.5 days.<br><br><br>My last point: <br><br>The circumference of the earth plays a role in the perception of time.

The reason we have not picked up on this is due to our interpretation of how fast the Sun rotates. \u00a0We are mistaken here since the barometer for rotation are the sun spots. \u00a0Sun spots are the remains of a nickel iron (core of a planet) that orbited closer than Mercury to the sun and \u00a0now finds itself fragmented and slowing breaking back down to plasma on the surface of the sun. \u00a0This is why there is so much chaos in terms of magnetic fields in the area of sun spots, its due to the solid iron/nickel composition interacting with the suns plasma<br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0My point here is that the suns rotation period is much faster due to plasma in gas form moving in streams faster than any other form of matter can travel. Currently we believe that Jupiter holds 60% of the angular momentum of the solar system but when we incorporate the speeds of plasma as opposed to the sun spots, we will find that the Sun holds closer to 99% of the solar systems angular momentum, matching the amount of mass that science gives it.

We observe over 13 billion years. But is it right to say the universe is this age?  And I say no. What we see is the remnants of what was, the universe existed far more earlier. We are reasoning from our point of view without taking time dilation into account. For example in extreme gravity situations like on our own Sun time progresses much differently. Let me explain, take a spaceship and keep accelerating it with 1g, untill it approaches lightspeed it will generate gravity of 1g and for the observer time on the spaceship keeps slowing down as Lorentz contraction and Time contraction become more relevant the spaceship can exist way longer in time-space-contiuum compared to the observer. Again I ask you to calculate the real age of the Sun if you compare it with artificially gravity like the spaceship going faster and faster and this way creating artificial gravity. Your conclusion could be the Sun is much younger from the point of the Sun&#39;s view. In reality but not for the observer, the Sun is burning out real fast until it fuses into an Iron star and it will die. For us humanity we see the Sun as an observer burning out slowly as a highspeed movie slowed down. This is a Paradox. I gave it lot of thought though and my conclusion is that eventually we can no longer in any possible way say how old the universe is. End of part1/142<br><br>*Cosmic After Glow, A Look Over The Horizon<br><br>Imagine you were at sea and were looking for other ships. You would soon realize that you see over the horizon since the top of other ships are seen before the whole ship shows up. Early ships had a nest to look as far over the horizon as possible. It were men at sea to be the first to see and conclude that Earth is curved. Now imagine a beautiful day. No matter where you look, the sky looks homogeneous. Many scientist believe we live in a curved Universe, and I agree. Just as in the example of ships at sea, if you just look far enough, you will look over the Universe it&#39;s horizon. Scientist call it the Cosmic Afterglow. Does it belong to our Universe since our Universe its inception? And I do not concur. I assume the cosmic afterglow is similar to Earth its horizon. It is bound to our Universe yes, but it manifests its self because of external reasons. There would not be a sky without the Sun. There would not be a Universe without something unknown. The only prove is that we live in a curved space. And we are looking over our Universe its Horizon.

If you are not clear let me explain. All life consumes, reproduces, and uses other tactics to survive, but why. What drive or influence causes life to repeat these actions over and over, generation after generation. Why doesn&#39;t a human or any animal for that fact just sit down and die. Is it an influence from the joys of life like having a family, being social with others, or from countless other positive influences from their daily lives. If you can answer this question for a huge fan of yours, I will be eternally grateful, that is if our conscious can maintain themselves in some shape or form for the rest of time.

I&#39;ve heard other solar systems referred to by their names or titles, and ususally it&#39;s named after their star, but ours is always just called &quot;Our Solar System&quot;... does it NOT have a name? Or is it&#39;s &quot;official&quot; name, &quot;Our Solar System&quot; or &quot;Sun Solar System?

Not the philosophical meaning, but the scientific one</b><br>But because the chances of you seeing this comment is so pathetically low and because I still want to share my opinion/thoughts on the matter I&#39;ll just do a discount take on it here.\u00a0<br><br><b>What is the meaning of life?</b>\u00a0<br>What is the meaning of life, what is the meaning of our existence? This is a question we have all asked at least once or twice in our lives. We all also choose to answer it differently.\u00a0<br><br>Those whom want to live a comfortable life without pondering this fascinating question often goes to Religion for the answers. Not only does religion answer these questions but they mostly do so in warm ways that are typically not hard to understand and easily accepted by the ignorant fellow. However as time went on and education was offered to the average bloke these options became very unpopular and instead seen as primitive and dumb.\u00a0<br><br>So where do we go to get the answers now? Some people refuse to give up their religious beliefs but those who did went straight to Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution and natural selection which states that the purpose of life is to - for lack of better term - to fuck to keep life going. However this is unsatisfactory. There&#39;s just something about it that screams &#39;&#39;INCOMPLETE!!!&#39;&#39; when you read about it. But up until now there has been nothing to add.\u00a0<br><br><b>:WARNING: The following will be facts mixed with my thoughts and opinions built mostly during my time on the toilet</b>\u00a0<br>As Schr\u00f6dinger demonstrated with his infamous &#39;&#39;undead&#39;&#39; cat experiment, observing nature forces it to arrange into something that fits within the physical rules of our universe. It all involves quantum mechanics which is rarely discussed because our brain is not outfitted with the tools necessary to logically understand it which is why I&#39;ll grossly simplify it for you guys sitting in your computer chairs presumably eating cheetos.\u00a0<br>Basically what&#39;s happening is that two fatass kids are trying to make it through a door to a room in which there is only enough space for one. But because they&#39;re so fat and because they&#39;re trying to make it through at the same time they instead get stuck in the door frame. That is until a third kid - representing the act of observing - helps them out by ramming them from behind. Forcing one through into the tiny room making the other fat kid search for a different door.\u00a0<br><br>Without the third kid the two kids would be stuck forever, trying every tiny variation possible within the space they&#39;re in. So in reality without the third kid, everything is possible. Which means every tiny variation is happening all at once which means that life is inevitable. Once life is created within one of these variations that means the act of observing is so also, which forces nature to straighten itself out and choose one specific variation, prompting the creation of a universe.<br><br>There are probably some faults in my logic that I&#39;m sure some of you will point out but the ground work is stable.\u00a0<br>So according to me and the leading scientists within quantum mechanics the meaning of life is to keep the universe in check.", "comment_date": "2014-06-25T01:20:18Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Keith Kaczynski", "comment_text": "no more ifs", "comment_date": "2014-06-25T01:15:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin Larsen", "comment_text": "Hi Vsauce.<br>I have been following you for quite some time and I recently started running and wondered: How great could a human being&#39;s condition be?

In many fantasy movies there are lego figures, fairies or shrunken people. Whenever these people encounter a normal sized human, this human speaks very deeply and moves very slowly compared to the shrunken human, lego figure, fairy or whatever. If a person could really shrink, would time seem to speed up? Would a normal size person , who is a now a giant, really seem to move very slowly and speak very slowly and deeply? Also, it seems in movies that little people also can not see all of their surroundings. If they looked up to try to see a normal sized person, they could not even see the face. Everything beyond a certain point is just blurry. I wonder if this is really what a person would perceive if they could shrink.<br><br>So Vsauce, pretend to shrink down and take a look around.

I&#39;m new to the channel but will be sure to check out the rest of your output. I&#39;ve got a question: In what age range are we humans meant to expire? I ask for two reasons. Firstly, human females have a menopause. This is incredibly rare in nature, and is usually only seen - albeit not often - in animals in captivity, which is to say removed from their natural habit. If our biological purpose is the procreate, should we not die around the time this function wanes? Secondly, we are only blessed with one set of adult teeth. They&#39;re hardly the strongest teeth in the mammal kingdom, either. This leads me to question whether we as a species are defying the limitations imposed on us by evolution.
