By helping to clean you are in fact giving away free labor to the municipality or city or whoever really has the obligation to keep the park clean. The fact that there is this much trash in the park means that either the ones tasked with keeping the park clean are neglecting their duties or are in fact not given adequate resources to do so.

But it didn&#39;t demonstrate or relate to moral licensing at all. The first example with the cleanup and the homeless man was totally off the mark, since the subsequent &quot;good deed&quot; being measured was by no means clearly a &quot;good deed&quot;. There are many arguments for why giving money to a homeless person, especially if they appear capable, could in fact be enabling behavior and reasoned to be a bad thing, irrespective of prior good deeds. Also, it is conflating NOT doing a good act (if we accept the premise that giving money to a homeless person is good) with doing a BAD act. Moral licensing is specifically describing a person allowing themselves to do a bad thing because of accumulated &quot;good credit&quot;, not &quot;using up&quot; their budget of good deeds.<br><br>The second experiment also failed to demonstrate moral licensing, but the design was better since allowing an innocent to take the blame would be more universally regarded as being a bad thing. However, and this is the key part, there is no way to establish causality between the donation and the subsequent &quot;bad act&quot;. So much so, it is unclear if moral licensing is in fact a real phenomenon at all. Even the best possible study design here, which would include controls and large sample sizes, would at best be able to establish a statistically significant correlation between donating money and not allowing the child to take the blame. But there are a variety of explanations that could explain the correlation, so you could never establish that the prior act was the cause of the subsequent one. As Dr. Stanford concedes, social science is weary of taking post-hoc explanation at face value.<br><br>The &quot;established&quot; literature on moral licensing goes even further in this fundamental mistake. Examples like people consuming diet coke together with their hamburger and fries and being more likely to engage in self-indulgent behavior after doing something &quot;good&quot; are also overfitting the good deed as &quot;causing&quot; the bad one. There are alternative explanations that explain the correlation that are not in any way invalidated by the experiment. For example, a person has a certain minimum threshold of &quot;good&quot; deeds that they want to exhibit in order to be consistent with their self-identity. Hitting that bar earlier in the day means the threshold is satisfied. But then the inverse would also be true, which is that doing a bad deed makes one more likely to do a good deed later. In effect then, moral-licensing is a not a real phenomenon in the sense of bad deeds justifying good ones, so much as there is some average level of &quot;good deeds performed over time&quot; that are consistent with people&#39;s self-concepts, and depending on your measurement window you will see different sequences of good and bad behaviors.<br><br>I haven&#39;t found any convincing literature that establishes moral licensing as an actual experimentally verified cognitive bias and phenomenon. As is unfortunately common, lots of bad extrapolations and correlation/causation errors in social science rife with speculative explanations.", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T20:31:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M G", "comment_text": "Not giving money to a stranger whether or not they say they or home is not a fair or rather accurate judge of whether someone is doing good or a good person.

There is just a shitty stigma around homeless people, folks really treat them as less than people, and a lot of people have no compassion or empathy.They also all only gave a dollar when they just got 50 for doing nothing. I understand its not like they owe them, I&#39;m not saying you always gotta give them a couple bucks, shit I&#39;m not even saying that you always gotta donate something everytime. But I feel that folks should do it now and then, and help get rid of that stigma, not all of them are on drugs. If a homeless person looks particularly strung out, or you can tell they are high or having withdrawals, then you don&#39;t gotta give them anything if you don&#39;t want to.

I wanted to take the blame really badly.<br><br>I ended up telling the teacher while we were lined up outside to go to lunch. It was in the middle of the hallway, so anyone could&#39;ve seen it, and I had a reputation as a kid who never got in trouble (so much so it was more likely for a teacher to wrongly accuse me than for me to have actually done something wrong), but despite all that, I shakily went up to the teacher and told her it was my fault, and that the punishment for my friend should be moved to me instead.<br><br>Without giving it much thought, she just said, &quot;Okay,&quot; walked up to my friend and told him he was free, and that was the end of it. I received no punishment. It was really confusing and I was honestly a bit frightened during the confrontation, but I did a good thing, and that made me feel good. Still a bit confused why I wasn&#39;t punished though.<br><br>The point of me saying all this is that if, by chance, I was in that scenario where Noah was trying to take the blame for something I did, I&#39;d probably refuse to let him take the blame (more strongly and confidently than before), since the scenarios are somewhat similar (I mean, 7th grade is literally when you&#39;re 12 going-on 13).<br><br>Then again, who knows?

For some subjects (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZlOw3rsPBM&amp;t=17m46s\">17:46</a>), the mom was not there in the room when the kid took the blame, whereas for some others (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZlOw3rsPBM&amp;t=22m38s\">22:38</a>), like the guy who owned up, the mom was there. That variable had a very big role to play, which mind field just either ignored or perhaps even did it purposely as no one actually owned up because of the confusing scenario, and they wanted to put someone who actually would own up in the episode. (I personally don&#39;t think so, coz it&#39;s Michael and he has a scientific mind, and I assume he understands the importance of unbiased experiments, but you never know considering that these are just episodes and it would be in their interest to make it more interesting.) <br><br>3. The kid and the mom were already there before the subjects showed up. So when the kid takes the blame, they might be wondering if the kid is even talking about the same guy as he might have let someone else in before they came. If anything, this just makes it slightly more confusing.<br><br>4. Maybe the subjects thought that the kid was somehow closely related to the people who worked there. So that&#39;s why he took the blame because he would know who all actually worked there. As time passed, calling the project head and the security and then taking the mom and the kid away would have given it away that the kid is not related to them, but it would be too late then because the situation had escalated a lot and the subjects would just be less likely to own up simply because they didn&#39;t own up earlier, irrespective of whether or not they made any donation.<br><br><br>Overall, a very bad episode because of the second experiment.

If they do not give money, it&#39;s because they think it&#39;s not good to give someone the money directly, instead they might donate to food banks or shelters with the justification that giving them cash directly, that money could be going to drugs/booze. The people that give money also see what they&#39;re doing as a positive because, well, there&#39;s someone who needs money and they give it. I&#39;m not making a judgement call on either of these ways of thinking but having lived in a city where we all knew the local homeless population they seem to be the two major categories people fell into. And coming from a background as a heroin addict in recovery and having a few brushes with homelessness myself, I personally think it&#39;s probably better to give to charities that fund solutions to homelessness than giving someone the money directly. There are addicts that consider &quot;flying a sign&quot;(hanging out off an interstate off ramp with a &#39;homeless please help&#39; sign) their job and as messed up as it sounds, I&#39;ve known people to make money doing that than I was making at a legitimate job.

It feels like a mind field episode needs that for some reason. <br><br>He even said himself the first experiment is flawed. Each time during the first part of cleaning up the trash, they didn\u2019t stay consistent. First time they asked directly, second time they didn\u2019t. <br><br>Noah isn\u2019t really that good of an actor. Second experiment was also super flawed. He basically wanted to take the blame so the subject just allowed it, or as it seems, even though he confessed twice. Didn\u2019t really know when to stop confessing and didn\u2019t really look at the situation. Even after Michael confessed TWICE, Noah still insisted on taking the blame. Some of them had the mom present, which added an eye witness and it wasn\u2019t consistent with the rest of the experiments. <br><br>Maybe this is just me, but it feels like it\u2019s Noah\u2019s decision to take the blame and I would\u2019ve just let him get in trouble, cause it\u2019s his fault. There\u2019s no huge consequences that he could have and it\u2019s he put himself in that situation. <br><br>Also no one has said this, but the experiment itself feels flawed from the beginning. Where did this guy come from? Wouldn\u2019t a robbery be more planned out? He just seemed like someone who worked there and they also have cameras to track him down. He also couldn\u2019t have gone far.<br><br>By the way he exits on the other side makes it seem like he knows the building very well and is a worker. Doesn\u2019t really make sense to me. He being so professional makes it seem like Noah was confessing to something in the past, and also Noah saying it so quickly is bad acting.<br><br>Also no control. Like what if there isn\u2019t a chance to help in the beginning? How will we compare this without anything to compare it to.

And as for the charity thing, when are you ever going to get a 100 to 1 matching donation?! Unless you really need some of that money, you donate every single cent. I would probably ask if it&#39;s definitely going to be matched, and whether the company matching it took that into account, so it&#39;s fine to pass it all on, but clearing that, you have to give it all.

I do think the first experiment is a little flawed in that even though alot of ppl who have good moral standing would want to give him money, there are so many other variables that would make giving him said money a bad thing. It could be going towards a drug habit, he might be a panhandler, you never know. The moral thing to do in that situation I&#39;d say is see to it that he gets food, not just give him money to do with how he pleases. In that sense, i don&#39;t necessarily think that the first experiment holds as much ground as it could. Then again, we all grow up learning different things. The main reason I think this way is that growing up my family and I would take vacations to Chicago, which was much different than my small suburban life in rural Indiana. The homeless people made me sad to see their state of living, and I wanted so much for my parents to give them money, but they had to pound it into my naive head that it wasn&#39;t a good thing to always do that.

For STARTERS, you need a control group in order for it to be a controlled experiment. Which these are now definitionally not, and do not fit not one standard for an experiment that does not require one. And even though the botched procedure renders your findings useless anyway, the execution was arguably even worse. There were a couple insultingly poor design flaws that skews the results so profoundly that it renders your control group-less experiment even more useless than it would\u2019ve been anyway. Because not only is it lacking in credibility, but there\u2019s about a 0% chance you\u2019re experiment accurately reflects what precisely you\u2019re trying to prove. FOR INSTANCE, the kid IMMEDIATELY going OUT OF HIS WAY to take the blame for seemingly no reason, and BEFORE the severity of it is even revealed, destroys your whole set up. Because it creates a \u201cokay, sure, I\u2019ll let him ACTIVELY take the blame if he\u2019s hell bent on doing so\u201d rationale to the subject. Ideally, you\u2019d want the kid to RELUCTANTLY take the blame, not ACTIVELY do so on his own free will. Because the subject is inevitably going to think that, although it seems to them the kid is taking the blame for no reason, there must be SOME reason. Which means they may know something the subject does not, perhaps severity in punishment (although it could be any number of things), and that something is enough of an incentive for the more informed kid to take the blame. So to go against that, is to go against the kids own free will who actively WANTS to take the blame, for an unknown reason that\u2019s apparently strong enough to compel the kid to take the blame. Doing precisely that does not indicate you have a surplus of moral credit, no, it indicates that you have a brain average to above average in the decision making department. A better experiment would have the subject opening the door, the thief stealing the shit, then, the subject being called OUT OF THE ROOM for something or another (paperwork, doesn\u2019t really matter). Then, once finished, having the subject return to a sight of the kid being blamed for having opened the door, and the kid, at first, denying without throwing the subject under the bus, with a eventual, RELUCTANT admission of guilt, after having the severity of it spelled out for him.

We talk ourselves into whatever it is we want to be the Truth of whatever we&#39;re contemplating.

The art of rationalizing your beliefs into fact becomes possible when you realize how Truth is a liquid not a solid,  (see &quot;thing in itself&quot; ) Equivocations simply being relative to whatever and however you choose. With just the right formulation, you can erect meaning that can satisfy  your dreams for them. There is a Caveat to this though.

In the first one mainly because of the homeless person and the fact that people usually have a very strong predetermined behaviour in that particular situation, that means that the first good deed doesn&#39;t necessarily affects the second. The second experiment on the other hand was set in a very weird situation. People who donate are more likely to open the door for the guy, because they are prone to help others, including the guy on the other side of the door whos asking for help. Also, it is not clear in the video, but even though they were told not to open the door, it doesn&#39;t seems like it could have too bad consequences. What i mean by that is, if you were in a Bank Vault, you have very clear that there is valuable stuff inside, that people want it, and that they don&#39;t usually let people from the outside get in, but if you are in a normal room, in a normal building,  it feels like even though opening the door breaks the rules, it is not so bad, or doesn&#39;t have any consequence. Add to all that, that the kid offers to take the blame out of nowhere and doesn&#39;t even seems nervous about it, and it all becomes an incredibly confusing situation. I guess it kind of works, but there are so many other things involved. Still i really like this series, i think you and your team are doing an incredible job, and i&#39;ve been truly enjoying it.

The second one was way out of the norm. The scene starts with then in a room where they don&#39;t know each other well, which is normal of course. The man shows up and asks to be let in and they let him in, can see why that might happen. He leaves with the box and the subjects sit down, again, I can see why that would happen. But then when they ask where the box was, the kid answers immediately. There was no pause, no initial time for it to sink in. The kid answers immediately that he did it. This scrambles the subjects mind because they don&#39;t know what to do or why this kid is so ready to take the blame. The subject Michael did indeed say that he let them in but it fell on deaf ears, this possibly made him feel discouraged from mentioning it again because of how tense he felt saying it the first time. You can tell he does not feel comfortable, not knowing exactly what the repercussions would be. A better way of going about the second experiment would be that they question the kid first, accusing him. Letting the thought sink in and then seeing if they act.

Success!", "comment_text": "In my opinion (Note: I am still a high-school student, and barely able to legally get a driver&#39;s license meaning or drink alcohol.) I think a lot of the participant&#39;s reactions in the last test were more-plausible than I would&#39;ve thought, and a lot goes of it is from the fact that it was a child that was there.<br>A child has generally less consequences than what those participants, legal adults, would have had if they themselves confessed. To them in that moment it was a real and active situation, and they were rationalizing whether or not they should confess instead of letting the child be reprimanded instead of them. (Though that is assuming they even would get remorse from letting a child be wrongly-reprimanded.)<br>To them, they rationalized it by the fact that if they confessed they would&#39;ve gotten a larger consequence, and to those who had donated money, they felt that their decision had been more-justified, because they had done a &quot;good deed&quot; and have already done something out of their &quot;kindness&quot;, being $1-$10(Seen as $100-$1000) and therefore the possible consequences of the situation, and the outcome of them not being blamed, were quite justified. The first one was already a rational-enough justification, and even more so for having donated money. <br><br><br>Personally, I felt the situation would drastically have changed if it wasn&#39;t a child, if it was indeed an adult, still an actor of course, and still had to admit they they did it even if they didn&#39;t, the situation would vary a lot, but it wouldn&#39;t have been the same as if it were a kid and also a parent. Let&#39;s say you let the guy in, and like any other participant, you currently might not have much remorse as to what you just did, (To be honest, being that it was basically right after or a few minutes after the woman who was like organizing or something left, the abrupt chances of a perfectly-placed man going into the room, saying He is carrying a load of stuff so He couldn&#39;t open the door is quite suspicious even as a viewer who already knows that He is stealing stuff instead of being an authorized person.)<br>Then the woman comes in and makes sure no one unauthorized went in because there clearly are many things missing, notably the VR experience thingies.The other person, let&#39;s say it&#39;s your average run-of-the-mill Steven David, white dude, normal build, He&#39;s a decent person, He doesn&#39;t look like He stands out, and He&#39;s just here for the VR experience and donated, probably works around the near vicinity, basically the same as you. When the woman starts asking, Steven looks at you but then looks like He will hesitate, but then speaks up and takes the blame, you feeling a bit guilty contribute a bit by trying to explain what happened. Of course because you felt that Steven did what He did to himself and you didn&#39;t have much remorse for it at this point, you let him explain that He opened the door, not you. <br><br><br>Now this would feel quite weird, and vastly-different, even if the situation may have been the same, you as the participant would have felt less remorse and less regret and less guilt.<br>But then the security guard is called in and some other guys come in to inspect the stuff, like in the video, they tell Steven to come outside,of course this isn&#39;t a kid and He doesn&#39;t have a mom with him, Steven looks at you, then at first hesitates (though still appearing like a normal being hesitating, whether or not it was their crime.) but then gives himself in. How would you feel? <br>Most-likely you would take more time trying to rationalize and justify your decision to keep shut and not admit that it was you and not Steven. Why? Because the consequences that Steven would get would be much much greater than if it were a child with a parent, but at the same time, you can rationalize it with, &quot;He let himself in, it was his decision.&quot;<br>...Sorry if I tried at first to make it out as if this new version of the situation was going to be vastly-different, but at the end, it ended up being the same thing, except that there was more guilt, but there was also more rationalization. It balances out, and you leave, scot-free. I feel that this displays more into how, the average human being might always try to do this, instead of actually being the most-genuine, they will try their best to get away with what they did, of course, they have moral limits, but they will try to fit in that moral limit as best as they can, and perhaps in extreme cases, try to fit that moral limit into their situation, rather than the opposite way. The more things you do that aren&#39;t right and that you aren&#39;t aware of the more you do this, the more you try to rationalize what was wrong and make sure that it was right, perhaps you never had the consequences, but the fact you try to rationalize things may be because you are afraid that these consequences will come to bite you back, which in a lot of cases, may happen.", "comment_date": "2019-10-12T15:47:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "juergen dengel", "comment_text": "well done- hehe - a good video- gnihihi", "comment_date": "2019-10-12T15:14:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dory Saraf", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t think this is a good test too many confounding factors.

Why? This is almost infuriating how people take those baseless morals as the standard when doing SCIENTIFIC experiments. First you need to understand ethics. Then you do social experiments around it.

For the first one, how do we know people who picked up the trash are not just people who have a philosophy of earning what you get, and people who didn&#39;t pick up the trash are more lazily oriented and giving $1 is a low risk high reward. For the second experiment, with the first girl the mother left the room and the girl could have easily thought it was the mom coming back/locked out. Two, just because someone donated $1 doesn&#39;t mean they think they filled a moral quota for the day... $1 is a low risk payoff for a reward of feeling positive. If anything it shows people who are willing to accept low risk opportunities to feel good, while not taking high risk opportunities like the situation with the kid. Three, for the guy who fessed up, the mother was in the room, which could have made him feel pressure to admit. None of the sessions shown were repeated under the same circumstances.

I observe that the participants looked conflicted about the fact that Noah was not only willing to take the hit for their violation, he volunteered, and perhaps that made them less likely to want to overrule him.

E.g. I&#39;m pretty environmentally conscious and hate litter, so I would help pick up the rubbish. But I have a friend who hates touching litter (even with gloves on) because she has a fear of needles/syringes, so she wouldn&#39;t help pick up rubbish. So in that moment, none of us would see picking up rubbish as a &quot;good deed&quot; since our actions benefit us on a personal level.<br><br>As for the second experiment, I think it would have been wayyy better if security assumed the kid let the guy in, rather than having the kid confess immediately. I think the kid&#39;s confession just confuses the participants and they just think &quot;wait, why is this kid lying? Did I miss something? Maybe I should stay quiet&quot;. I mean, the black guy said like 2 times in his recount of the events that he opened the door, but everyone believes the kid when the kid says that he did it. So I imagine the black guy was just really confused about what was going on and chose to stay quiet, not to consciously let the kid take the blame but because he didn&#39;t understand what was happening. I think a scenario where blame is assigned to the kid, rather than him standing up and confessing, would have better. E.g. Security comes in and says &quot;Son, did you open the door.&quot; &quot;No&quot;. &quot;Son, this is serious. Some expensive stuff was stolen and, if you opened the door, you need to tell us&quot;. This gives the participant an opportunity to confess. And if they don&#39;t, then you can have the kid (reluctantly) say he did it and then go from there.", "comment_date": "2019-04-21T23:32:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jay G", "comment_text": "It\u2019s not that I\u2019m judging them for their decisions.

People could&#39;ve had certain preconceptions, stereotypes, and beliefs going into the experiment that would severely impact the results. However, that&#39;s to be expected. What&#39;s NOT to be expected is for the people making this show to decide that homeless people just casually walk up to people and ask for money. As far as I&#39;m aware, that doesn&#39;t happen very often, and when it does happen it usually seems threatening and aggressive. If they had gone for a more passive approach by having the &quot;homeless person&quot; laying down with a sign and a box across from the tent, the results might&#39;ve been drastically different. Also of note is that one of the participants had his newly-earned money IN HIS HANDS when the man walked up to him, which might&#39;ve skewed his reaction to the request since he doesn&#39;t have to commit much to giving. I would posit that there&#39;s a lot of thought that goes into taking your wallet out in front of random stranger asking for money, and that many can&#39;t get past that initial hurdle and deflect the request with an excuse. But if you already have all of your money out in the open, most of that thought process doesn&#39;t happen, so you might feel more generous due to how simple the act becomes.<br><br>Then there&#39;s the second experiment. This was hands down the WORST built experiment I&#39;ve ever seen in a serious context (i.e. not &quot;social experimenters&quot;). The very idea that the average human being would react casually to a CHILD taking the blame for letting a thief into a VR studio is utterly ridiculous. Everything around the child&#39;s actions is completely wrong and unnatural(though not necessarily because of the child actor), and leaves the participants more confused than anything. I&#39;m pretty sure the first participant shown was having an existential crisis the whole time, which led to her &quot;freezing up&quot;, as she put it. Without any context or reasoning to attribute to the child&#39;s actions, the participants are left in a very uncomfortable situation that bypasses morality entirely because of how ludicrous it all is. Instead of trying to make a difficult moral choice, they&#39;re instead busy grappling with reality of what&#39;s happening around them. What&#39;s baffling to me is how Michael can keep a straight face throughout the whole charade, which I can only chalk up to numbness after having seen enough rehearsals. More than anything, this experiment showcases how unreliable these post-experiment &quot;debriefings&quot; are, since there&#39;s always the possibility (especially here) that the participants could be lying to try and get out of there faster, or because they haven&#39;t had enough time to process what just happened and don&#39;t want to just sit there awkwardly for 5-10 minutes while they think of a good, honest answer. <br><br>Both experiments are invalid, but the second one is so terrible in execution that it could only be used as an example of what NOT to do in future experiments.

For example, in this scenario, I would have simply given the guy a drink from the table. If that is all he wanted, sure here you go. In most cases, I rather buy them what they supposedly want than simply hand out cash. I understand people can end up homeless for many reasons including mental illness, and to my experience, a lot end up like that due to their own actions or lack thereof. I would most likely lie about my cash because I hardly ever carry cash so I use that as my excuse most of the time. In this case, I don&#39;t think picking up trash would have changed how I reacted to the test. Just my 2\u00a2.\r<br>\r<br>Kimberly was a little bitch, I would have immediately asked the kid why did you take the blame? Of course, I wouldn&#39;t have opened the door.

Michael is not solely responsible for his actions now that his choice was based on a group decision. Therefor sharing the guilt with the kid. At this point when the kid takes the blame, Michaels rationalization to this situation is that even thought the kid didn&#39;t open the door he was just as guilty as Micheal.

You can only control a limited number of factors.<br><br>Some possible flaws or factors leading to deficits in the first study might have been:<br><br>1. Having two tests that aren&#39;t equivalent to each other and don&#39;t take into account outside factors. For example there is a stigma around homeless people spending money on drugs and around them as people in general that isn&#39;t present with picking up trash, to have them be in the same group of equivalency to test moral relativism is more like testing two TYPES of moral relativism that are character-dependent<br>2. Not really having any control groups. Also lack of diversification in displaying what participants chose, I don&#39;t know if there were any participants who for example didn&#39;t donate and didn&#39;t help the homeless man but did clean up, and it&#39;s likely there were some. <br>3. Behavior traits inherent in participants that would have contributed to their choices other than their morality. People like the vlogger might have been more inclined to donate or help the homeless man or donate than clean up trash because it&#39;s simply less work. <br><br>Possible flaws in the second study might have been: <br><br>1. Not making all aspects of the situation entirely clear to the participant. When many people picture a thief they have a specific image in mind, they physically might have not registered that the man who took the VR set wasn&#39;t just some worker that forgot his key card, his attitude was pretty casual and his demeanor seemed calm which is contrary to what most people assume of thieves.<br>2. Making the actor be a child. This goes along with point number one. Adults seemingly have more credibility, and if a child claims responsibility for an action that they didn&#39;t commit it is more likely that the adult involved will just think they&#39;re being silly, imagining things, and not think it important enough to correct the child because of the assumption of misunderstanding. <br>3. Fight or flight response/ anxieties/ social deficits. When just told no one should knock on a door, someone does, and then after letting them in you are told they are a thief and security and staff start interrogating you, that is sufficient ground for anyone to freeze up, even if they want to do the right thing. Regardless of how much you donated beforehand, your individual response to stress is going to be a huge factor here. People who are shy or timid but who are &quot;morally righteous&quot; will have different responses than those with the opposite behavioral pattern. <br><br>TL:DR It&#39;s true moral relativism doesn&#39;t define whether you&#39;re a good person or not, but it also can&#39;t be defined by the most recent actions you took. Otherwise there would be no one in the first study that donated, helped, and cleaned, for example. Socialization and character traits of an individual are huge factors, along with the type of situation they&#39;re in. Moral relativism might be an aspect in the behavior we&#39;ve seen today, but it certainly doesn&#39;t tell the whole story.", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T14:53:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebok 21", "comment_text": "Mrbeast would allways give money", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T14:51:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cosh", "comment_text": "FREE MONTH", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T14:05:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cosh", "comment_text": "That reminds me of S2 Ep1", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T14:05:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ImmortalAlvah", "comment_text": "Lol all the poor fucks who can\u2019t get youtube red lul", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T13:31:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Morgan", "comment_text": "What I have noticed is me and my girlfriend have struggled in our life and have suffered quite a bit so when we see others who need help we usually help even if we have done a good deed that day.

I come from india and I can tell you that there are atleast 5 times more people asking for money. usually, the only beggars I give money or food to are women and children, someone who otherwise would find it hard to find a job for legal or cultural reasons. But when i see a fit adult man asking for money, it is always morally wrong because the asking never stops. You could give a beggar a thousand dollars and he would be begging the next month you see him. Because thats sort of what he is best at. So according to this, it can be seen that a few people dont count the donation of money as a necessarily good deed.  <br>Sure you can make the argument that the homeless person was infact a war veteran, but i would contend that its better to either give them food, or donate to a homeless shelter or political party aiming at helping homeless people. If you give money to a homeless person, you are mostly doing it because you want to feel good about yourself. And that&#39;s totally fine, but not everyone feels this way.
