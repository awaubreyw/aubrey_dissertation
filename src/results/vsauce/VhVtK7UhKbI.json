Us humans and other heterotrophs must survive by eating other life forms. Those life forms we eat are made of individual cells, which in turn is made of lipids, carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids as well as other organic or inorganic chemicals and trace elements suspended in a bubble of water kept together by a phospholipid bilayer. All the same carbon-based stuff we are made of and that makes sense, we eat those things because they have the same stuff that our body is made of so we can use what we eat to build our bodies or break it down for releasing the energy that keeps our bodies running. However, what would happen when you eat something alien, that may not be made of lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and it&#39;s genetics may or may not be based on nucleic acid? Would it even be carbon based? Would it use water as a solvent for it&#39;s chemicals or something else?
