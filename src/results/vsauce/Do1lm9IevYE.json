If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

So shadowed surfaces still receive additional weight from light unless it is a total darkness scenario, like deep underground.<br>On the other hand, if we ask what is the weight of a shadow, we must first ask ourselves what is a shadow. And if we consider a shadow to be the obstruction of light coming directly or indirectly from a light source, pheraps we could say a shadow has negative weight in comparison to the better illuminated neighbouring surfaces.

Speed of light... interesting!<br>Another fun video topic: Speed of sound. That is about 300 m/s, right? But it needs a medium. In space it doesn&#39;t have one. So, sound does not have any speed at all, or does it?<br>On earth, at sea level sound must travel faster than on top of Mount Everest. Does that change the pitch at all?<br>And what about in a world with a denser atmosphere? Is that comparable with sound traveling through water?

Using the example of a light year long board and pushing it to press a button, what happens to the board? With the slinky, you can drop the top half of it and watch as the bottom doesn&#39;t move until the top catches up, but the slinky has space to move. The top half has enough gaps in it so that when you drop it, it coils back up and continues to move down. But a board cannot. If it&#39;s made out of wood, it would condense when you push on it because it all can&#39;t move at once ( otherwise it would in be breaking the speed of light ), so the speed at which it moves would require the wood to flex or get denser in the areas the momentum is currently at as it moves towards the other end. Wouldn&#39;t that break the board? Or would you be able to see the difference in the condensed wood and the wood the force of your push has not gotten to yet? This is probably really confusing, I&#39;m not quite sure how to word my question, but if anyone understands me could you provide an answer?

However, I&#39;m not so sure if a shadow weighs a thing. Maybe I missed it but he wasn&#39;t clear on it either. Light is very tricky. Why is it that you can see what&#39;s in the shadow? Maybe because light is absorbed and reflected off an item and sent to the shadow thus having some weight. However, what it it was a large shadow. A large object where light couldn&#39;t get around. That would be an absence of light correct? That&#39;s what a shadow is right? The thing is though, we are not in a controlled place. Did you know in slow motion, light will wrap around an apple and the apple will glow before casting a shadow. I think because you can see what is underneath the shadow it has weight. But if the shadow is completely dark, then it&#39;ll weigh nothing. As there is no &quot;push&quot; or energy hitting the object where the shadow is casted. Which makes me think...on a hot day will you weigh more. Since heat is a product of energy and energy is a part of light. On a hot day, would we weigh more? Or excise more? According to some scientist. Absolute zero is when there is no heat what so ever. Heat requires energy though. And in order for there to be matter, there needs to be energy. An atom bonds with another atom because of energy. But if there is none.... What would happen. A black hole? No matter equals no weight right? Idk. I&#39;m just ranting now.

The frontal lobe (used for problem solving) takes up about 1/3 third of the cerebral cortex. Each neuron has about 7000 connections. This makes about 37 trillion connections. When neurons activate, they send signals via calcium ions. Calcium has an atomic weight of about 40 amu (atomic mass units). Each connection uses about 1000 calcium ions. With this math, an idea weighs about 37 quadrillion amu, or 6.14 x 10^-8 grams.", "comment_date": "2012-10-08T04:03:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kyle meyers", "comment_text": "The speed of light is limited by observation.
