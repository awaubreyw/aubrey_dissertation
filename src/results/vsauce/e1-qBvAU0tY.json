So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people&#39;s throats. It&#39;s your choice whether you want to accept it. So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) You, I and most( most because babies don&#39;t sin, and maybe specifically mentally I&#39;ll people) purely human beings have violated God&#39;s moral law. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God\u2019s eyes. Don\u2019t try asking for forgiveness, what if you tried that in court: &quot;Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again&quot;?You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned. The reason why blood must be spilled for remission of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals was enough for remission of some sins, not all. It wasn&#39;t infinite, unlike Jesus&#39;s. Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. The Old Testament sacrifice of animals, the spilled blood of those animals could cleanse people from some sins but not ALL, unlike Jesus&#39;s.  He was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus&#39;s spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved!
