And I have been culprit as well in the construction of my own cage......  But I am going to disagree with you about dancing as a mechanism to fit in. Too late for that. Besides, old grandma over here will never fit in. Who the hell wants to do that anyway???? Music is like my personal writing journal-- logs that reflect, celebrate, release, express, reinterpret, find closure, new ideas, and strengthen my spiritual Faith base. Its not that I wish things were like they used to be. It just sucks they way they disappeared. IE....Skating rinks. Dance floors. Jams. POOF GONE!!!!!

Thousands of years ago humans were scavengers and had to focus on finding food and water 24/7 all the while trying to keep them safe from danger and the brain cant handle being on alert 24/7 at the same time of gathering food and sleeping. So the brain will allow you to live focusing on food and reproduction and be able to make a split second choice can be made when danger has snuck up on you when your eating berries or seeds and not get killed by a predator.

And eeeever since then, for some odd reason, I found it funny when I would later remember that daydream, and would not only realize how suprisingly long it had been since I&#39;d last remembered it, but I&#39;d also always be able to recall roughly when/where I&#39;d last thought of it..

It&#39;s kinda like having a song stuck in your head. But soon now I think it&#39;s time to get rid of this repetitive tune. I honestly don&#39;t see any other way out of it, and frankly, I don&#39;t know if I want any other way out. What&#39;s the point of living when there is nothing more positive to look forward to? All you live for is to pay the bills, dissapoint friends and family, and work your ass off to earn money to pay more bills... And at the end of it all, you just sit there alone in the dark with nothing, just some dead material things you have lost interest in. I have long ago stopped answering the phone when strange numbers calls me, I probably have unpaid bills, or the landlord wants to kick me out, or someone I haven&#39;t seen in years wants to talk to me. I don&#39;t bother anyway, I have nothing I want to say or talk about, I know life ain&#39;t fair, but it should at least be somewhat enjoyable, but instead it&#39;s all depression, paranoia, money and expectations. If I could go live as a hermit out in the woods, alone, just living of the nature, in peace, I would very much be a happy man. But even that is a far out goal regarding my current situation. And the only reason I haven&#39;t cleaned out my skull already, is because I am an only child and my parents are separated, but still close friends, yet I don&#39;t want them to grow old alone with no one close to take care of them, I am the only one they have. Yet, I feel horrible just going through the motion every day, trying to stay invisible, keep for myself as these darks thoughts are decaying me from inside, making me barley motivated to get up in the morning and keeping me from having a single night of normal sleep. On Sunday I turn 30, I really hope I&#39;ll be dead by then. This song has been stuck in my head now for over a decade, maybe even closer to half my life... You might call me weak for not going through with it already, maybe I am, or maybe I am strong to keep on trucking through this crap and subconscious wishing things will pick up?

One of my friends said, &quot;Hannah, are you okay? You seem upset about something.&quot; And then I told him, &quot;I&#39;m fine.

My 8 days are up and by the way, this is much much worse than that.&quot; And then she asked, &quot;are you pregnant?&quot; And then I said, &quot;no. I&#39;m not married. I don&#39;t even have a boyfriend.&quot; And then one of my best friends asked me, &quot;did you get into a fight with your family?&quot; Then I said, &quot;no.&quot; I put my head down on the table. Then I said, &quot;that movie. Oh my goodness, that movie!&quot; And then my friend, who was the guy who asked me if I was okay, said, &quot;what movie is it? Is it Titanic? Twilight? ET?&quot; And then I said, &quot;neither. It&#39;s a movie that I loved to watch with Grandma when I was a very little girl.&quot; And then my friend said, &quot;what&#39;s the movie called?&quot; And then I said, &quot;I don&#39;t remember what the movie is called, but I remember the ending.&quot; And then he said, &quot;Hannah, why don&#39;t you call your grandmother and tell her to come to your house so you two can watch this movie together just likw old times?&quot; And then I said, &quot;I can&#39;t do that.&quot; And then he said, &quot;why?&quot; And then, I said, &quot;Grandma died when I was 11 years old.&quot; And then, my teacher told all of us that I was experiencing nostalgia.

You were alive in that moment in lets say 1995, or 2001 or 2011, listening to your favourite song. But in that moment there was a life path, that you were just so sure you were on. In a moment of clarity, when you now listen to that old song again, you remember that path you thought you were on back then, when you used to listen to that particular song all the time... and you realise you went in a completely different direction. <br><br><br>It is almost certain you went on another path than the approximate one you imagined you were on back then, as your young inexperienced brain at that time was making a poor estimation of what&#39;s likely in the future, mix that with the unpredictable change of culture over the time span between then and now (you probably hadn&#39;t accounted for it back then either) and then finally mix all that with the change in your own tastes... these changes likely lead you on a completely different path and since that time you have lived a very different life from the one you thought you would lead. Your values are different, your emotions are different, the job you do, the relationships you have. All different. That is fine. <br><br><br>But all those hopes and dreams that you never did realize, there wasn&#39;t a day when you said goodbye to them all. Some were altered, some were replaced, most you forgot until your whole world view was radically different, it happened just a little bit, day by day. When you hear that bit of music though and suddenly it&#39;s 2011  again, and suddenly you&#39;re in your first apartment, with that partner, the one you&#39;d always meet at that bar that doesn&#39;t exist anymore, and who you keep in touch with back then on a form of media that is no longer used, you remember that old path you thought you were on, it was simplistic and comforting seeming, you realise it has completely vanished and was a mere fiction that existed in a fleeting moment. You miss your belief in it. You mourn the future you thought you&#39;d be living in that never came to fruition. You mourn lost futures.<br><br><br> And the future you now imagine you will have over the next 10 years... it will turn out totally differently too.

I found so many new friends and discovered some parts of my city. I walked around with a girl from Berlin who was new to my city and I showed her some stuff and we got really close friends. She had shown me some songs she listened to and I really liked them. Well since then we didnt really do things together and now I miss this time really much. Everytime a listen to certain songs it throws me back to this summer and I think of doing more stuff next summer, more stuff with all of my friends. Nostalgia really helps me to make decisions.

It&#39;s a simple evolutionary tactic. It makes sense because a lot of instances of people experiencing nostalgia is when they go from child to adult. adult hood is where you are more aware and knowledgable about dangers and where you feel most uncomfortable. Childhood, for the majority, was when you had no worry, and were very ignorant and in general more happy. because of this you long for when you were happy and that just happens to be mostly your childhood. Maybe children take in events as being more important, thus making the memory more prominent in later years which could also be why childhood is where most nostalgic memories come from.", "comment_date": "2016-03-14T22:13:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Black", "comment_text": "&quot;Crawling back to you, ever thought of calling when you had a few...&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-03-14T14:47:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrEnKaye", "comment_text": "FUCK I LOST THE GAME", "comment_date": "2016-03-14T08:02:50Z", "likes_count": 27}, {"comment_by": "Guess Who?", "comment_text": "Am I the only one surprised that James from top gear is here?

Nostalgia brought me to a complete mental breakdown. I focused too much on the past, I forgot to look forward. I did manage to achieved this and then something I had no knowledge of prior to taking down my facebook account, which lead to my past hurting me in a terrible way.  I will never let anyone hurt my Children. Does this make me stupid, I think so.. if I had used my common sense, instead of rushing out to protect my loved ones things may well have turned out quite differently. No, feeling freedom from gossip, I was now completely unaware of the plot against my family. In fact, I had a mob of 7, 5 men and two adult women attack me. I&#39;m a strong woman and I did use a walking stick to hit the women on the head, but only after they kicked and punched me. I was punched in the head, face, body, back and had quite a few cuts and bruises. It did hurt and it was very scary. However, they were the ones who ran with the phones, they were the people who phoned the people first and they produced a photo when they had been filming the entire thing. Unfortunately, my kids are so stupid at times, however my eldest two sons and youngest are growing up fast. My other son is a very angry teenager and wants to tell the truth. He should be living with his father, to keep him away from danger. However, this is not happening despite the warnings of a social worker called Vanessa. No offence to her, but she is so young and naive, you need life experience if you are to speak to the man of the house, in my case an ex police officer. She told him to keep Nathan there and told me I had to make him stay. He&#39;s missed two days of college and has been in town every night. What do you do as a parent when this happens? I&#39;ve phoned the police, emailed my solicitor and now I don&#39;t even have access to a phone. British justice... it doesn&#39;t exist. I am sick of being let down time and time again. Not by the police close to me, but the police in Hereford have been very cruel and mean. Shouting at me when in fact they failed in their duties not me. Do you send two male officers at 3am, large male officers to a 45 year old woman and tell her to drop it as I was just as bad.

As if they are creating a history in their own accord, though, its not widely enough to be known, but at least it connects your self from other people. My nostalgia is feels like I&#39;m at my home, see my bed at glimpse as the room showering the light from the window. It draws me out as if I will never ever leave my significant memories of having me in there at particular time.

I have always been interested in nostalgia, largely around music, but also in general. I think that nostalgia can be a nice feeling, but also that some people can become trapped in it, and that even good memories can trap us.

In any case, nostalgia can seem like a quagmire, preventing us from moving forward. I think that it can keep some people from taking risks.<br><br>I&#39;m a composer writing a couple of trios whose focus is nostalgia. The first trio\u2014&quot;Suffusion&quot;\u2014is about that bogged down sense of nostalgia, while the second, &quot;Ascent&quot; will be a sort of liberation from that. \u00a0<a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/composenberg/ascent-banff-residency-fund\">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/composenberg/ascent-banff-residency-fund</a> is my Kickstarter that describes it, and yes, this is a bit of a shameless plug.
