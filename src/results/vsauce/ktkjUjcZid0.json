By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman&#39;s Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with primary consciousness will probably have to come first.\r<br>\r<br>What I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990&#39;s and 2000&#39;s.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.  They are based on realistic models of the parts of the biological brain that the theory claims subserve these functions.  The extended TNGS allows for the emergence of consciousness based only on further evolutionary development of the brain areas responsible for these functions, in a parsimonious way.  No other research I&#39;ve encountered is anywhere near as convincing.\r<br>\r<br> I post because on almost every video and article about the brain and consciousness that I encounter,  the attitude seems to be that we still know next to nothing about how the brain and consciousness work; that there&#39;s lots of data but no unifying theory.  I believe the extended TNGS  is that theory.  My motivation is to keep that theory in front of the public.  And obviously, I consider it the route to a truly conscious machine, primary and higher-order.\r<br>\r<br>My advice to people who want to create a conscious machine is to seriously ground themselves in the extended TNGS and the Darwin automata first, and proceed from there, by applying to Jeff Krichmar&#39;s lab at UC Irvine, possibly.

Hindu and Buddhist philosophies elucidated the 3 Elements of Monkey Mind thousands of years ago as monkeys are abundant throughout Asia and make for easy field observations.  (It should be noted that the Big 3 Abrahamic religions were conceived in arid regions where monkeys were exotic curiosities and therefore were not investigated or scrutinized to guide understanding of ourselves).  In fact, all the world&#39;s problems today could be attributed to Monkey Mind, the default mind-program of our species, and which operates in the background of every person on this Planet of the Apes.  The 3 Elements of Monkey Mind are:<br>1) Limitless Greed - nothing is ever enough for us, especially if it is pleasurable to the senses or rewarding to the ego.  EX: Got a pay raise?  It&#39;s not enough, want more!  Had a delicious meal?  Not enough, want more!  Got some sexy-time last night?  Not enough, want more!  Etcetera ad nauseam.<br>2) Tireless Fear - nothing in life is certain except uncertainty.  Uncertainty is a Law of Physics.  Yet uncertainty causes great unrest, angst, anxiety, and conflict in people.  What we don&#39;t understand we fear and reject.  Chronic Fear is crippling and causes many people to develop agoraphobia among other psychopathologies, on one side.  On the other end of the stick, chronic fear creates control freaks who attempt to create certainty but often times fail.<br>3) IMPassive Dominance - monkeys seek highest position on the tree, especially when under threat.  Likewise, people grasp and reach for higher status, greater achievements, higher commendations, more fame, etcetera ad nauseam.  But as the saying goes, &quot;the higher the monkey climbs, the more it reveals itself.&quot;  This primitive program  is seen throughout human history and in all relationships where dominance vs submission are constantly at play, at school, at work, and in interpersonal relationships. <br><br>However, transformation of Monkey Mind is possible and necessary if we are to continue to thrive and grow.  In fact, one becomes a true Human Being by reforming Monkey Mind thus becoming a sharing and compassionate being.  Understanding the 3 Elements of Monkey Mind is only the beginning and requires practice to have a breakthrough.  The 3 Virtues that transform Monkey Mind, in respective order are:<br>1) Limitless Generosity - you will always have more than another in need and kindness does not cost anything.  This practice alone can yield great merit and bring balance to our world.<br>2) Tireless Trust - trust is fundamental to human civilization and imperative to a happy secure life.  Practicing trust opens up possibilities and reassures others security.  Trust is essential to being a good human being.<br>3) Passive Abiding - The dominant are overturned by the submissive by bending down lower.  The rigid crack and soft absorbs.  On a deeper level, our essence is more like water than anything else.  Water is the most powerful element in the universe (extinguishes fire, erodes rock, moves wind, and permeates all life) yet it is soft, smooth, and gentle. Water seeks its own level and transmutes states of matter (from solid, to liquid, to vapor, in endless repeating cycles).  &quot;Be like water&quot;<br><br>\ud83d\udca6\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udca6", "comment_date": "2022-08-11T04:40:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leopoldo888", "comment_text": "You look as my Grandfather looked in the sixties... including the shirt and pants... ha ha ha!", "comment_date": "2022-08-10T17:58:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Delac", "comment_text": "Interesting theory, but I personally think its bullshit.

Or if there were few predators where they ventured but a lot of new plants and animals so knowledge and passing of the knowledge was more beneficial than short term memory....which would imply maybe a huge and sudden climate change, maybe also explain why humans have such short digestive tracts ( almost all animals are eatable  but almost all plants aren&#39;t thus we developed digestive tract more suited for bigger brains to figure out the changes in environment and how to hunt something safe to eat and parallel to that  favored more kcal dense food instead of risking eating poisonous plants)...", "comment_date": "2022-08-10T15:09:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Inquisitor Generally", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0&amp;t=16m50s\">16:50</a> over thinking, over analyzing, separates the body from the mind", "comment_date": "2022-08-10T03:26:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Sheats", "comment_text": "They forgot to add the part where Enki and Enlil genetically modified us at the second chromosome... its fused together.", "comment_date": "2022-08-10T01:21:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maybe1Someday", "comment_text": "Can I regress to only memory?

Basically the reason some primates ended up in the desert and some didn\u2019t was not a migration as much as it was a change in climate in the western region. There\u2019s a fault line of two tectonic plates that separate western and Eastern Africa. At one point there was either an earthquake or movement of the western plate that caused it to increase elevation catching far more sun which dried it out and killed a lot of vegetation.

Maybe moving to the savanna required our ancestors to also develop a longer range focus in their vision, since they had to look for threats all the way to the horizon not just in their immediate surrounding like in forest canopies.

Without judgment progress cannot be made. For no one can express or receive love or any other desired emotion in its entirety if the don&#39;t know themselves. We are all not created equal however we all have a equal obligation in living up to the pleasure, potential, and responsibility of femininity and masculinity. So don&#39;t miss the deadline on doing your best to become physically fit, mentally sound, and spiritually balanced being able to express physical freedom. Which can be accomplished through clean air, water, fitness, that specializes in overall functionality combined with  high sources of nutrition organic  non-genetically modified would be best.  Plus formal education and real hands-on experience.     When one learns the body&#39;s capabilities and limitations by fully engaging with all their bodies senses to their extreme limits in the most efficient way that is humanly possible. The subconscious then begins to naturally subconsciously systematically coincide with the mind-body souls  spirit mother Earth nature and all the various different forms of life that live within this world and the most efficient way that is humanly possible.  Thus yielding<br>the best spiritual kickback for one&#39;s efforts accomplishments experiences.    You might want to take these points to heart <br><br><br><br>            Considering the simple logic basic concept that if life is not free, why the hell would death be any cheaper? It&#39;s not the question the common, basic, average, normal man or woman may be able to wonder is what is the spiritual cost to one&#39;s own soul and spirit for freely living dying off having only used the smallest percentage of a fraction of the true potential they are first born with.   Not to add insult to injury for the last hundred and 50 years or so the mass majority of the population from coast-to-coast globally more so here in America.       has been living and dying yielding the worst spiritual kickback that has ever been manifested since the beginning of life only getting worse. And that has nothing to do with everybodys so-called charming personality and everything to do with the standards of quality pertaining to our air, water, foods, landscapes, working/living environment, every day home products, habitats, and ecosystems. This lack of comprehension conscious physical participation in solutions is ignorant beyond retarded (no offense to any disabled people was intended.) When you consider for the last 490 years Give or take we have had the manpower woman influence or vice versa   to have created clean high paying jobs from coast-to-coast globally that would constantly consistently be improving upon and maintaining the quality of our life in such a manner.   <br><br><br><br>            That the mass majority of the population from coast-to-coast globally  would constantly consistently naturally, gradually, and systematically almost effortlessly start becoming stronger, smarter, healthier, happier, better off physically, mentally, and financially possibly spiritually then the previous generation.   Now I would like to resurrect the wish and prayer I made prior to my 8th birthday which was to be held spiritually accountable to the statements I proclaim to the way I&#39;m living personally and professionally. I guarantee you never see or hear another body, man or woman in power, persons of legal, religious authority, or leaders ever freely validate the statements they proclaim with that level of certainty one reason they don&#39;t have the best interest of the majority of the population&#39;s needs at heart a another reason could be they cum   from a bloodline of cowards or simply have a lifestyle that suggests, confirms, and validates them as being feebleminded physically inadequate submissive subservient which it doesn&#39;t get any worse than that. One is genetically inherited and the other is a simple generic learned behavior. Quite possible to be a combination of these worst-case scenarios combined is one to say the least. Nonetheless either way it is physically, mentally, and spiritually useless to freely live and die in such a low quality manner.<br><br><br><br>           Especially if that ignorant stupidity, weak, lonely desperation  stems from being soft, lazy, out of shape, over fed, undernourished, overworked, and underpaid with a dirty low-paying job that comes from outdated power sources, inferior materials, poisonous, toxic substances, pesticides, and chemicals that never change their killing composition. Which means simpletons whether it is a solid, liquid, or burnt off into our airways atmosphere as a vapor it is always going to be poisonous, debilitating, and deadly to the body at the same time polluting, corrupting, and devastating to mother Earth and all the various different forms of life that live within this world. There is no cash profit to be made in the demise of the planet. Thanks to those dirty low-paying jobs we are in the mist of environmental financial global collapse.  The good news souls and spirits have paid out are picking up the tab on the end results of those dirty low-paying jobs And so much more.   The even better news that the common, basic, average, normal man woman may be able to comprehend is souls and spirits have been are being managed, directed, maintained, and implemented with all the disease, sickness, illness, pain, suffering, injury, abuse, neglect, hunger, addiction, sadness, anger, and hyper- aggressive violent criminal conduct. That has been allowed to occur manifesting throughout the history of mankind into what it is today thanks to people like Donald Trump who have the false belief if the mass majority of the population is at their worst they will feel   less afraid scared inferior to the true potentials of love, honor, and the creation of life.   Here&#39;s the deal you&#39;re either part of the world solutions or exacerbating the planets problems there is no safe in between.

We see other evolutionary trade-offs in nature, so this makes sense.

We have lost some of the ability to utilize short-term memory to the extent that chimps can (witness Michael vs. the chimpanzee), but we have evolved the ability to live in large complex groups, something chimps don&#39;t need to do since their local societies are much smaller and less complex.

MIrrors what is likely to have happened 300 million years ago when, due to some reason, two groups of animals diverged away from reptiles.  Some learned to use burrows to live in and would eventually become mammals, while others moved upwards into the trees to nest and would eventually evolve into avians (birds).  One group, the mammals would develop a full emotional empathic response in order to allow for the parenting behavior and as a consequence of this develop social behavior.  The other group would develop only a limited kind of emotional empathy (avians) that would allow for flocking(social) behavior but only a short parenting period ending with baby bird being pushed out of the nest to either fly or die.  <br><br>     Since empathy promoted social behavior is can easily be imagined that vocalizations evolved as an extension of this system.  Allowing individuals to better express their current emotional state.  And so we come to your tradeoff with humans developing full blown speech presumably to further enhance this behavior.  With speech, as you say, we became able to tell stories.  To have a sense of time.  In other words to think in abstract terms.  Thus we have the evolutionary pressure needed to develop our next innovation, cognitive empathy.  With cognitive empathy we are able to &#39;put ourselves into another shoes&#39; so to speak.  This too is a highly abstract way of thinking.  If it seems hard to conceptualize then think on this challenge.  Try to get your dog to understand that you want to take them to the park.  But not today, not until tomorrow.  Try as they might, this concept will be beyond your pets ability to conceptualize.  And so with cognitive empathy we then see how and why we have developed hyper intellect.  <br><br>     And so it went from reptiles to mammals with emotional empathy.  To vocalizations to better express that empathy.  To language that still further enhanced said empathic ability.  To cognitive empathy that introduced us to abstract thought.  And abstract thought leading us to our hyper intellect.   The ways in which your presentation meshes with this theory I think genuinely gives both of these a high likelihood of being factual at the end of the day.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23endhatrednow\">#endhatrednow</a>", "comment_date": "2021-02-24T03:03:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ronn", "comment_text": "I&#39;m wondering how much this ability is a spacial recognition ability.

Nedrow", "comment_text": "Actually cognitive tradeoff is common in evolution.  The key lies in how the brain is organized, not how big it is.  Brains evolve just as bodies do.  If our environment changed dramatically, no doubt our brains would change, too, and the survivors would be those whose brains functioned best in that new environment.  We see similar brain differentiation in other members of the animal kingdom.  In this case, the chimps retained or acquired a higher facility for rapid spatial memory, but sacrificed development of that part of the brain that enables speech.<br><br>A similar tradeoff probably accounts for human evolution, too.  Neanderthals and Homo sapiens had brains largely the same size, but it is probable they were organized very differently.  Neanderthals survived in Ice Age Europe for hundred of thousands of years before we arrived and adapted to a specialized hunting lifestyle (attacking large mammals from ambush) that put a premium on sight, hearing, touch, and smell and a brain that could process those stimuli rapidly.  But they were not notably innovative (they largely used the same stone tools they brought with them from Africa eons before) and they lived in small, isolated clans and were not social.  They had the brain of a predator.  Homo sapiens also began with simple stone tools, but soon developed a far more sophisticated tool kit, built large social networks and traded for goods,  hunted in organized groups, and shared food in hard times -- indicating their brains were wired a bit differently from Neanderthals from the start.  This began a feed back loop between intelligence, tool innovation, language, and improved diet (from more successful hunting) which led to an intellectual and cultural explosion about 50,000 years ago that elevated homo sapiens from mere hominid to humanity.  Forty percent of our total caloric intake today is used by the brain, for thinking and communicating.  We are predominantly social creatures.<br><br>We cannot analyze the brains of Neanderthals and early man directly; brains do not fossilize.  But we can trace the difference by examining what each did.   From the neck down, Neanderthals were not that different from us, but when the climate in Europe changed 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals lacked the ability to adapt mentally and went extinct.  Given the rapid techological advances of humans today, it seems likely our brains in the future will be wired very differently and that some people alive today would be unable to function in that future environment and will have no representatives alive one million years from now.  Or it may be that higher intelligence is itself an evolutionary dead-end and that our ability to create weapons and machines we lack the judgment to use wisely will ultimately lead to our own extinction.

I think Chimpanzees have better photographic memories in order to travel in dense jungle, as everything would look the same without it.  However their memories in general aren&#39;t any better than humans.  You could tell Matsuzawa was getting incredibly annoyed when Michael was beating Ai.  Even when Michael was doing well on Ayumu&#39;s 9-digit test, Matsuzawa had to exaggerate on the difference in time completion - even though he was the one who told Michael to keep going slower.<br><br>Ayumu is clearly doing something incredible regardless, but keep in mind - this is a chimp who has been trained for YEARS from birth.  If any person took this type of test for an hour, they would immediately be better the next day.  You can train your memory to excell in certain testing conditions, and this is no doubt what is contributing to Ayumu&#39;s speed.  They seem to use the same clip of a few rounds of this memory-game to display how good this chimp is at it, but my assumption is that this was a selected run of several games the filmed with the best display.  I bet you if you had the monkey video taped at random, his error rate would be MUCH higher.<br><br>I believe they do have innate abilities that make their memories better with spatial sense, shapes, etc., yet likely exaggerated.  You may ask, why would they do that?  It&#39;s a very common problem in science.  Just like Matsuzawa, most scientific studies, and all larger scale ones like this, are gov&#39;t or industry funded.  If the studies aren&#39;t producing data and information that is worth it, funding will be dropped.  Then everyone will be out of a job.  This is literally the backbone of scientific study, it all hangs on whether you can or cannot get funding.  This has led many shady people with fantastical theories supported by shallow evidence to get grants/funding over scientists who truly want to find answers.<br><br>The prostituting of science is a widespread problem, much larger than most think.  Many scientists won&#39;t speak out against it either for it could hurt their chances of funding in the future.  I&#39;ve seen the manipulation of data for monetary gain before, and I immediately got the same vibe from Matsuzawa.  That doesn&#39;t make him a bad person by any means.  Many of these scientists just get tunnel-focus on a theory, and cannot bring themselves to accepting other possibilities because of how long they&#39;ve been chasing one theory.

Once the body is relaxed in such a way, it is much more likely to drop down. Therefore, we have decided that a bed on the ground is a better idea.<br><br>Actually I&#39;m not so sure what might have come first: REM sleep that made us sleep on the ground, or us sleeping on the ground that has in turn allowed REM sleep to develop. Probably the two aspects have reinforced each other. In any case, the interesting thing is for me that REM sleep is said to be closely related to our creative abilities and abstract thinking capacities.

True learning, as with humans, provokes the desire to perfect or improve on most tasks, either for necessity, or the natural instinct to be better or more efficient.  This requires things like reason, logic or aptitude.  Very basic and natural skills that even a small child has.

Mr. Matsuzawa mentioned our ancestors being weaker and through a series of events they had to develop language to share. I understand it is a hypothesis, and we may not have the answer, but did he happen to mention the way in which they were weaker? Were they physically weaker, less competent, or were they already starting to show signs of the tradeoff?<br><br>2. Mr. Matsuzawa related the chimp&#39;s short-term memory ability to their need to identify potential threats quickly in order to survive. While this does make sense, how does that ability translate to the skill of being able to do it numerically? Since our number system is most likely not inherent to any other species it seems improbable they would pick up on that. Unless they were training them to understand the order, possible through an operant conditioning process, how would they know what order to press?<br>(As I wrote #2 it seems to be obvious but I will leave it here anyways)<br><br>3. Dr. Deacon talks about potentially trading the ability to remember specific details in order to gain the ability to generalize/abstract information in a different meaningful way. Did he go into any detail as to what parts of the brain this may be associated with. I know he mentioned everything being relevant, but anything more specific? I.e. hippocampal activity or size as it relates to the temporal lobe or anything else.

I&#39;m not sure we can really claim any sort of superiority in that regard, when we don&#39;t fully understand the other &quot;more simple&quot; languages. A better question might be, why do we consider our communication so advanced, when the Universe is constantly humming with communication all around us we cannot perceive without assistance, and which we don&#39;t understand in any meaningful way when we do. In some ways, our communication and intellect are precisely what prohibit us from understanding more.<br><br>Anyway, there is evidence that behaviors of chimps and other higher order mammals are evolving behaviors which we can observe in the very short span of time we have been measuring and observing them in a scientific way. There is a pack of chimpanzees which rule an unprecedented amount of forest. They were documented because they also exhibit behavior which is extraordinarily violent and calculating in its cruelty, with the specific intent of increasing their numbers and territory. It&#39;s fascinating, but also difficult to watch because it sort of mirrors the more violent and ambitious behaviors of various periods in our early history, where barbarism and cruelty very closely mirrored the violence and ferocity of our primate cousins. In some ways, we prove that becoming more intelligent doesn&#39;t necessarily go hand in hand with moving away from some of our more animalistic and feral instincts.<br><br>Great episode, as per usual.

They definitely have nouns verbs adverbs adjectives and names for both individuals and classes. They also do basic math involving counting addition and subtraction.

All animals (including ourselves) have thoughts and feelings and in fact have the same emotions. <br><br>Anyone who has had a pet can do a simple demonstration. When your cat or dog come up to to be pet they are doing two things: 1. They are coming to you, not your sofa, not the table, not anything else, they go to you. They have remembered that you pet them and when they want to be pet again they know to come to you. They are to distinguish between you and everything else. This demonstrates thought. 2. When your pet gets the pet they wanted they perform a response or pleasure, and when they get pet the wrong way they perform a response of discomfort. This demonstrates that they can feel.<br><br>Why can&#39;t we &quot;listen&quot; to what animals have to say when they communicate? Well, you can and you can&#39;t. All things communicate uses their senses, it what senses they use to communicate that can differ. When it comes to mammals the majority communicate using primarily visually and secondarily tactilely and tertiarily verbally. It is not to say that don&#39;t use their other senses to gather information, they just don&#39;t use those senses to express information. Perhaps you are thinking you have seen your dog sniff to gather information before. What they are doing if sniffing for pheromones, which humans do the same thing after shaking hands but this isn&#39;t the same thing as expressing information. It is not common to see a communication model not like the one mentioned previously in mammals but some mammals, such as humans do. Humans flip what most mammals do and communicate primarily verbally and secondarily visually and tactilely. <br><br>Your communication model is something\u00a0 are born with and language is something you learn. Language is based on communication models, so all human languages you learn with primarily involve verbal components. Usually we don&#39;t involve visual communication in our language but rather use the same visual communication across our species and call this body language (which is a poor term as it isn&#39;t a language). There are some visual languages (such a sign language) but all of those languages are based upon the use of verbal language and translating that into hand singles or otherwise to express thoughts in the same way you do verbal language, i.e. words. Because some visual languages exist, we can and have taught other animals how to &quot;speak&quot; our visual languages, such as Koko the gorilla. We have a hard time learning other species visual languages because unlike ours they don&#39;t base their visual languages in a verbal or word like way. <br><br>Can other species that share the same communication models communicate with one another. Yes, but not completely. While latin isn&#39;t a communication model but rather a language we can latin demonstrate a point. There are languages called romance languages with are based upon latin: spanish, french, portuguese, italian, romanian, etc. While all of the romance languages are different languages, because they are based on the same language they can use those different languages to express thought amongst themselves without having to know the other language but have difficulty expressing increasing complex ideas. Different species that share the same communication model have developed their own languages based on the same model and can express ideas amongst each other but the more complex the idea the harder it is to express it. Just like we can express ideas in english to someone who only understands japanese by using on simple level, but when we share the same language we express even more complex ideas. <br><br>Why this is important when it come to autistic people is understanding our communication differences. Through my own understanding and experiences with communication as well as speaking to other autistic people it is my understanding that perhaps our communication model is much like other mammals being primarily visual and secondary tactilely and tertiarily verbally. Having a different communication model could explain our communication differences and sharing the same communication model as most mammals could explain we understand other mammals a lot more easily. <br><br>When thinking about how I express emotions, my emotes are not naturally my face (a demonstration of primarily using verbal communication up close as having facial emotes aids in verbal communication in a close range to demonstrate subtlety of language) but rather my stims using the rest body. Emoting with your body is something allistic people do to a degree but not much as their face, much like my primary emotes being with my body but there a few natural emotes with my face such as smiling when in uncomfortable situations (which other primates also use to demonstrate aggression and ward off others) but there a few stims I also do using my face but not as many.<br><br>I had to learn to use my face to emote and it always feels forced and unnatural, but my resting face makes people think I&#39;m upset or angry. People can&#39;t ever tell what I&#39;m feeling because they look at my face, which gives no information, and when they look at my body they see some information but miss alot, alot of the information they see is variables they recognize but those variables don&#39;t usually mean the same thing. I feel like only ever being taught to recognize emotions in ways unnatural to how I emote, such as any emphasis on the face and what little emphasis on the body not being the same, has contributed to my alexithymia and I have been trying to work out when I&#39;m not making how I naturally emote and what feelings that is tied to like: more vigorous movement means the feeling is more intense, joy is pressing my feet into the ground, excitement is bouncing, happy is swaying my hips like a cat does before they pounce, comfort is bringing and pressing my arms to my chest, sad curling up, anxiety is shrinking my body, feeling shame is when I try to hide any expression but end up curling some and trying to cover my hands near my chest (which I think is a mix of sadness and seeking comfort), rocking I think is seeking comfort when anxious and sad rather then when I seek comfort by pressing my arms to chest and shrinking when anxious but not sad, on edge is when my body is more open and I am making eye contact kinda like how people are taught when relaxed people look like but for me it my body getting and being prepared for attack or getting attacked and the eye contact is what can set off that reflex and so can sudden movements or anything shady and I tend to think of it like a cat&#39;s stalking reflex for hunting or any combat they are prepping for, but these are just all the things I&#39;ve pinpointed but not necessarily every emote or feeling I do just what I recognize and can attach something to.<br><br>The way we as autistics understand and express communication naturally is fundamentally different from allistics. Allistics have a model of communication that is primarily verbal and secondarily visual, all languages come from this model and even languages such as sign language is based on that model. There is some universal body language, such as smiling and crying, but the more complex emotions are the more body language becomes cultural. Autistics have a flipped model, or rather we share a model that most of the animal kingdom uses. Our model is primarily visual and secondary verbal. I remember growing up not understanding verbal communication at all, I just mimicked sound patterns that produced different results for me and just made the noises I thought everyone else wanted to hear. When I was 12 I learned that using those kind of scripts doesn&#39;t always work and was trying to figure out how people communicated and how to learn to both allistic communication model but also english on my own for the next 6 years before I began to understand it. Nearly all autistics are partially verbal, some completely nonverbal even. Verbal communication is not natural for us and some of us pick it up better than others.<br><br>When we talk about fight or flight, we tend to focus on 2-3 of the 5 options people make that there is: fight, flight/run, freeze, but there is also posturing and submitting. Posturing is given the signal either verbally or nonverbally you are a threat, it is primarily a means of being dominant and aggressive, and from my experience allistics find social (as opposed to physical as in a fighting context) posturing to be arms crossed, not looking towards them, and not verbally communicating as much but what is strange is that is exactly what I do when I feel comfortable and relaxed when engaging verbally with someone. For me, posturing in a fighting context is body facing the person and and giving eye contact, in essence what allistic people seem to want for relaxed and comfortable communication. When someone is making eye contact or facing their body towards me like that my instincts feel they are posturing for a fight and the emotional pain associated with that is what I feel, and that pain can turn physically and more aggressive when someone wants to come closer and comfort in an allistic style when I am acting on instinct alone. When talking to my fiance about our instinctual responses and feeling something we are learning is that there are shared physical actions, of which physical actions variables, and variables that aren&#39;t shared at all (like her facial emotes and my body emotes). Those variables have a function (what they serve to display or feel) but a lot the time shared variables have a different function and shared functions have a different variable. It can cause a lot of miscommunication.", "comment_date": "2019-10-06T06:41:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Leachy", "comment_text": "This is so interesting, so glad this series was made free.

Developed at the end of World War II out of desperation by the Nazis, many of the manpanzees were almost ready to fight the allied forces.  There were pilots, mechanics, infantry, engineers, scientists, and much more manpanzees trained by the Nazis.  At the fall of Hitler, the manpanzees were not needed.  But many were very educated in the most advanced technology of the time.  Not risking to uncover these hideous half breeds, the manpanzees were kept contained in their current area.  There secret Russian and American scientists studied the manpanzees. Generations have passed and the manpanzees population is quite large now.  They have been oppressed, tortured, over studied, and even ridiculed by the Russian and American scientists.  But they have been planning and arming themselves quietly and almost invisibly.  They will soon rise up against their captors and then against all of humanity.  They are more intelligent and stronger than humans. Humans will become little more  than a zoological curiosity after the manpanzees are done with us.

Evolution explains that animals started as another type of animal and changed into what they are today over the course of those millions of years. This is impossible. Adaptation Is what causes changes in a species. A bird in the jungle is very bright and colorful by comparison to a desert bird. Why, because of adaptation not evolution. Take a liger or tigon. Two cats that have no way to make babies naturally. It has to be done in a lad. Why because a tiger and a lion, while both big cats are fundamentally not the same species, yet polar bears and Grizzlies can breed naturally because they are the same species with separate adaptations. A grizzly is colored and built for the woods where a polar bear is colored and built for icy climates.

What about autistic and other children who suffer from communication difficulty without their impairing IQ? For example, this year I taught in kindergarten 2 children English who were likely to be autistic*: these children were incapable to have conversations beyond set of learned phrases repeated daily and while they rarely seemed to pay attention to lessons and did not respond to rewards, when it came to testing vord recognition (point to the picture, join picture and word) and spelling, they always had the highest scores. (*If they were diagnosed, I wasn&#39;t told so I cannot state as a fact &quot;my children were autistic, only that they seem to match highly on description of autistic spectrum.) Another child that I was told IS autistic was always in the world of his own but whenever I asked him a question he could give a perfect answer.

Personally i think that a tree dwelling species will have (among the millions) a thousand or so individual monkeys fall to the ground after, say they tried swinging from a weak branch. Imagine that among those thousands, per se, how were confronted by a predator? I assume thousands upon thousands of times a year a monkey would have been confronted by a predator with broken branch in hand, how many do you think would wise up fast enough to use the branch as a weapon? Those that do will live to have children and those that dont die off.

So if scientists didn&#39;t no or prove that air which is invisible is keeping us alive and exist then we wouldn&#39;t believe it if we weren&#39;t alive because we need air to breathe but we don&#39;t see it but we know it exists so you apply this to a lot of other things and you use common sense and read between the lines and then you realise that you don&#39;t always need hard physical proof to be convinced that there is more or more beyond this world. A lot of it is common sense and looking at things differently which requires experiences and to understand things truly deep down 100 percent we need to experience them but other people who don&#39;t believe us won&#39;t believe us because they haven&#39;t gone through what we have but they will  leave believe us if they experience what we do but unfortunately it doesn&#39;t always work like that . So everybody should have an open mind and not be cynical and also ignorance is a lack of experience and knowledgeand once you know the truth about things then nobody can convince you that you&#39;re wrong or that you&#39;re imagining things because you experienced it yourself and the best proof is personal experiences.I hope what I&#39;ve written has clarified a lot of things up for close minded people out there.", "comment_date": "2019-05-12T01:40:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Asmus", "comment_text": "These findings would be equally as interesting, without trying to perpetuate the lie of evolution.", "comment_date": "2019-05-12T00:28:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Vardanega", "comment_text": "We r not monkeys or human or anything like that.we r eternal spiritual beings made of intelligent energy and love and but also on a scientific level we r made up of living eternal energy of light which is also made up.of electromagnetic energy .we r a soul a eternal soul ..a spiritual being in a physical body but the body is a cocoon more like a tool and we use the body to serve our purpose here and survive but in physical death the cocoon or the outer skin or the physical body dies and breaks down.

Maybe put them through the same learning protocol of numbers as they did with the chimps and go from there.<br><br>Or train an adult to not look for a pattern, not see numbers and just see the board as is, with shapes, and then remember what they&#39;ve seen.<br><br>I think it could help with understanding how adaptable we are as a species , and how our brains can relearn to make quick decisions to take up a task.

There are videos that show this, but in a nutshell, the females and the children will hide, while the males surround the snake and force it into one of their holes. Once the snake is in the hole, they will bury it alive. But they each know how to harass the snake from all sides, they communicate where to force the snake, they know how to sound the alarm, and the alarm is different for each type of threat (indicating the language contains actual words and names for things).

While it is entertaining to watch, we gain very little insight into relative cognitive limits from a middle-aged human on basically their first try performing less well in a task than a young chimp with likely many thousand hours of training. (I do not doubt that chimps are way better, but this is not good evidence.) 2. That we have an ability chimps do not have (language) but perform less well on something else (short-term memory) is only weak evidence for us having traded one for the other. Humans and chimps differ in many ways, and we may well have traded for something completely different, or more likely a one-for-one exchange picture is simplistic. The mechanism proposed by the researcher also does not check out. While it is true that neighbouring brain tissue can be recruited by increased usage, there are language areas but there are no known &quot;memory areas&quot; in the brain. 3. To claim that the chimp ability of photographic memory of a static pattern helps for evaluating a situation with &quot;nine enemies&quot; is a stretch. It might rather help to remember the location of &quot;nine ripe fruits&quot;. Indeed, I&#39;m prepared to bet that humans are better at the former. Evidence? Well, watch some FPS gaming on youtube. There you have multiple enemies rapidly moving on complicated trajectories in a visually rich environment with a ton of distractors (including almost identically looking &quot;friendlies&quot;). Humans are great at dealing with such situations. Indeed, rather than having traded for language, humans might simply have adapted their cognitive abilities so as to be better hunters / warriors, as compared to the chimps likely optimising for gathering. 4. I note that we are now worrying about keeping the few remaining chimps alive, rather than vice versa.

Your eyes might have registered it via the light  they\u2019ve collected, but the brain wasn\u2019t given enough time to physically process what was there. Memory deals with information already collected and processed. It&#39;s about information retention, not collection. Had we been able to have a few seconds to actually do this, then made to wait a short time before being tasked with disclosing this retained information, THEN it would be an accurate test of short-term memory. But it isn\u2019t \u2014 instead it\u2019s a test of the brain\u2019s visual processing capabilities and reaction time. <br><br>It DOES make sense that humans would have reduced REACTION TIME in order to compensate for language, as the brain would need to wait a certain period of time to receive the necessary information from language, which is more complicated than the methods of communication employed by apes. Because it is more complicated, it is slower to input and output it from one person to another. It takes more time to speak than it does to use body language, and signs, simple screams and grunts, and pheromones, and it takes more time to process.<br><br> It will take you several seconds at least to read my passage before you comprehend it at all. For a chimp, it would be near instant for his eyes and brain to physically capture it all, but he wouldn\u2019t of course have the faculties for processing comlex language other than simple words. Even if he did, he would start to read it and stop right at the very start because he&#39;d react to the first few things you said and not listen to anything else. If you\u2019ve ever come across someone who listened to some of what you tried to tell them and immediately jumped the gun and interupted you without listening to anything else, imagine that, but every single time. Right as you speak, the ape (assuming it has faculties for processing language and speech, and can talk on the level of a human. I know they already have limited faculties, but can only understand so many single words) immediately is done with the conversation because what little you say is enough for his brain to decide it has all the information it needs to respond.<br><br>Chimps seem to have a much faster processing ability because their methods of cummunication are much less complicated than language. They HAVE to be able to react in a split second to THEIR language. Not just their language, but the ability to move they way they do \u2014 swinging and climbing \u2014 so precisely, swiftly, and accurately. If we had their processing ability existing alonside our language and speech faculties, we\u2019d have a lot of difficulty understanding our own speech, because the brain would be too busy processing sounds the moment they come out of the mouth rather than waiting to collect enough sounds to form coherent meaning like sentences and the meaning behind them.

I am thoroughly impressed he developed a method of training chips to be able to develop cognitively and to demonstrate that development in a consistent, repeatable way.  However what was shown here  <i>at best</i> demonstrates consistency with the hypothesis, and nothing more.  Michael&#39;s failure to reproduce Ayumi&#39;s speed at the game demonstrates nothing.<br><br><br>Chips are recognized as having impressive cognitive ability (at least within the animal kingdom).  Dr. Matsuzawa&#39;s research demonstrates that chimp&#39;s can be effectively trained to perform tasks (to my knowledge this was already known and demonstrated, and not just for chimps!).  Ayumi has been playing this game presumably since it was able to climb into the box along with its mother.  This could be many months, to many years (exact age was not specified) of exposure to this training paradigm.  During this time Ayumi started off slowly and with a low number of digits and then progressed to the blistering fast pace with a high number of digits.  Given a chimp&#39;s aforementioned ability to respond to training, this should have been expected.<br><br><br>What should also have been expected, is Michael&#39;s <i>inability</i> to reproduce this precise end state ability (the speed and accuracy) his first time playing this game.  It is not surprising that he was unable to match the speed or accuracy of the highest performing chimp, as he has undergone <b>no</b> training whatsoever.  Additionally, there are signs he was progressing himself fairly quickly.  His times generally were trending down, and his accuracy was trending up (he completed the last puzzle of the set, also in the fastest time).  Again, not shocking as his repeated exposure to the tests were serving as training for the subsequent test.<br><br><br>I don&#39;t dismiss this research or its corresponding hypothesis in its entirety because I understand that it is possible in the associated publications they did comparative trials of one form or another (rates of learning, top end performance, etc.) showing chimps with equivalent training times as their human counterparts were consistently outperforming these humans.  However I am being generous here because the claim/hypothesis, though intriguing and with evidence demonstrating consistency, is in my opinion not actually being tested with what was shown here; and hence I am speculating as to what <i>else</i> has been done that was not shown.  Again, at best, this research presentation demonstrated that chimps can be trained (already known) and with that training they can out perform humans with no training (impressive but not all that unexpected).  However without evidence showing humans can not perform at or above this level, with a corresponding amount of training time, I assert the hypothesis remains thoroughly untested.", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T11:20:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pentti Hilkuri", "comment_text": "What type of watch is that on Michael&#39;s wrist?", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T09:33:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The_Bread_Pirate_G0nz0", "comment_text": "I wonder if this is why people on the autistic spectrum can sometimes excel at this sort of task, because of the lack of development of, or impaired, language ability.", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T05:45:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hambone", "comment_text": "my man look like hes off to gaykumes circumcision", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T05:42:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ashyshonkov", "comment_text": "I got here from ApeSex Legends", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T04:40:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "this guy", "comment_text": "humans can easily do that with a small practice..we can have multiple languages and photographic memories..", "comment_date": "2019-02-17T03:04:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Weihe", "comment_text": "Was this test run for people who learned their letters at age 9-10 (about as late as possible)?

Space is the medium in which matter expresses itself under certain conditions. Matter in space gives the volume of space occupied by it the property of density. Volumes of space of equal density repel each other. Volumes of space of unequal density attract each other. Thus all motion is of &quot;a volume of a given space-density&quot;.   Does any one know that 15 sq. meters on a sphere&#39;s surface is not equivalent to 15 sq. meters on a flat surface? But our maths says it is. Space-density gradient - actually part of a continuum from infinity to minus infinity - runs from a very high number (for a black hole) to say .0000000000000001 in some units - probably spacons, for material entities. Recall an atom is mostly empty space. Physical space has the property of density. Science&#39;s constants become inoperative at some point on the space-density gradient. Science doesn&#39;t want to know that. Look at the mess in the quantum mechanics . Strange probability maths had to be formulated to explain the unexplainable. Quantum physics cannot be completely understood that way. The lower we go on the density gradient , the less the applicabilty of &quot;mathematics&quot; and &quot;time&quot;. But that&#39;s all that science uses for measurements. Science doesn&#39;t know that at very low densities of matter, the space density of certain voids in the human body become part of the experiment.

In a highly publicized study, a juvenile \r<br>chimpanzee, Ayumu, performed substantially better than \r<br>university students on memory for digits displayed for \r<br>210 msec in a spatial array (Inoue &amp; Matsuzawa, 2007). \r<br>The authors further observed that Ayumu could pause \r<br>several seconds before responding\u2014for example, in re   action to environmental sounds\u2014and still maintain high \r<br>performance. The authors described these abilities as \u201cex   traordinary\u201d and likened them to eidetic (so-called \u201cpho   tographic\u201d) memory. The findings were reported by The\r<br>New York Times, the BBC, NPR, and all four U.S. televi   sion networks, as well as in the pages of Science.\r<br>However, Ayumu was the only 1 of 6 chimpanzees to \r<br>achieve this level of performance. Furthermore, Inoue and \r<br>Matusawa gave their 6 chimpanzees extensive training \r<br>on a non-time-pressured version of the task, wherein the \r<br>digits did not disappear until the subject touched the first \r<br>digit. Training involved approximately 200 trials per day, \r<br>5 or 6 days a week, and began in 2005. At the time the ar   ticle was published in 2007, 5 of the 6 chimpanzees (those \r<br>other than Ayumu) were still being trained. From this, we \r<br>can infer that training was quite extensive. In contrast, the \r<br>human subjects received almost no practice of any sort.\r<br>In a subsequent study, Silberberg and Kearns (2009) \r<br>showed that humans can match Ayumu\u2019s performance \r<br>when they get extensive time-pressured practice\u2014that is, \r<br>practice at the extremely short 210-msec stimulus duration \r<br>that was used for the final test. This finding, while casting \r<br>some doubt on the conclusions of Inoue and Ma tsuzawa, \r<br>does not decisively overturn them. It is perhaps unsurpris   ing that human performance improved for the 210-msec \r<br>task after practice on the exact same task. In contrast, Ayu   mu\u2019s success occurred with no prior practice at 210 msec. \r<br>Instead, Ayumu\u2019s practice sessions allowed the animal to \r<br>observe the display at leisure until initiating the response. \r<br>Inoue and Matsuzawa reported that the average latency be   fore responding was 650 msec\u2014far greater than the expo   sure time used by Silberberg and Kearns for practice. Thus, \r<br>parallel performance in humans and chimpanzees under \r<br>comparable conditions has not yet been demonstrated.\r<br>In the present article, we report that, with practice simi   lar to that undertaken by Ayumu, our human subjects not \r<br>only matched but outperformed Ayumu. Furthermore, \r<br>human subjects can maintain high performance with short \r<br>delays, demonstrating an ability similar to that reported \r<br>for Ayumu. Finally, a pattern mask disrupted performance, \r<br>suggesting that facility in this task is supported by ordinary \r<br>processes of iconic memory storage or retinal afterimage. \r<br>In sum, there is no evidence for a superior or qualitatively \r<br>different spatial memory system in chimpanzees.", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T09:39:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Max", "comment_text": "What about someone who&#39;s mute?

Not impressed. We often have people who try to compare human thought, memory, stimulus response time, etc to primates, birds, dolphins, all in a attempt to magnify animal behavior and belittle human behavior. Yes, its an impressive trick...but think of Annie Oakly...if all you ever had to do was walk around and shoot things then shooting coins tossed in the air is no big deal. But give the same gun to another human being with different experienced and they will fail. A young human mind is the best for learning as there are no cognitive distractions in their conscience and they have untrained neural pathways. Once you put them into an educational system be it mental or physical these pathways are established well used and behavioral performance of either physical or mental tasks becomes specialized. A chimps hard wire is hunger, how to get food? Of course they will become specialized at how to get food in their environment. Look at primates that learn to use tools...it is always and only how to get food that drives them...or an itch you just can\u2019t reach to scratch.

As you said chimpanzees are taught from young age how to do the number task to get their reward and they start from easiest level successively progressing to harder ones. @Vsauce, you did compete against Ayumu but you had no, or little previous experience in this particular task. Ayumu on the other hand was doing it since he was very young. He wasn&#39;t that good from the start. Basically it was like putting a rookie against a champion.<br><br>So basically what I wanted to say is that in order to make this hypothesis more convincing you need to have a human that is practicing same task over and over again and then compare him to Ayumu. Otherwise you won&#39;t have eliminated a possibility that a human could reach same level of mastery and perform equally well (as we know human brain is subject to neuroplasticity and can achieve many great things once trained).<br><br>Other thing that came to my mind would be to have a savant with very good memory make this task and see his result and then maybe compare some parts of his brain with Ayumu to try to track down if similar parts of the brain were more developed to do this task.

It is easily explained by a stage in evolution between the tree-dwelling ape and the savannah hunter, when the forest dried up and apes who lived along the seashore survived by venturing into the water, learning to eat shellfish and eggs of seabirds, both of which were easy to catch, and developing an upright body to keep our heads above water as we waded out in search of seafood.  We have a subcutaneous fat layer possessed by no other primates, but present in all aquatic mammals like seals, whales and dolphins.  This serves for  insulation and buoyancy.   The Aquatic Ape theory of human evolution also explains the enigma of the fat baby.  Compared to other primate infants, human babies are born round faced and chubby, in spite of the difficulty for the pregnant mother of getting enough extra calories to put fat on the baby, as well as the burden of carrying that heavy baby around once it\u2019s born.  The only animals that benefit from a lot of body fat are those that spend a lot of time in water.  Fat babies float!  Sea mammals like dolphins and seals, as well as humans  have a subcutaneous fat layer that provides buoyancy, insulation and streamlining, needed for an aquatic lifestyle.  The fish, shellfish and eggs of seabirds provided an abundant source of omega-3 fatty acids needed for the substrate-driven expansion of our brains. Aquatic ape theory, also called \u201cSeashore Man\u201d also explains why we became the naked ape.  For swimmers, fur is a drag!  In order to dive after shellfish we needed to learn to hold our breath. This was a prerequisite for the development of speech.  No other land mammals are capable of controlling their breath.

So everyone understands lets look at this like playing a video game, someone who plays the same game for years will obviously be better than someone playing it their first time. I use to visit my grandmother every now and then, she had an old mario game she liked. It took her 3 hours to beat the game (More than 60 levels) It took me 3 hours to get past lvl 3. It&#39;s obvious that the apes playing the same games over and over would get good at them. They can memorize 9 symbols in order in half a second. What about a human comparison? We have professional video game players now. These video game players can press on average more than 240 keys a second in an exact order with over 90% accuracy (I&#39;m actually being pretty lenient here). That equates to over 120 keys every half second. Now this isn&#39;t exactly the same as short term memory, but what I&#39;m saying is that if you preform any task enough then you will get very good at it. This is how our brain is built. Which takes me to the neurological side of things, with a few years experience and studying neurology I feel very comfortable with this explanation. Now when a specific part of the brain is used it tends to grow larger, when it&#39;s not used it grows shorter, and one part of the brain can take over functions to a lesser degree that use to be held by a functioning region that is damaged. Short term memory is localized in the prefrontal cortex, which in humans makes up 1/3rd of our total brain mass, and is four times larger than in apes. So the loss of one region of the brain for another is completely ridiculous considering that the very region we&#39;re talking about is much larger in humans than in apes. Now if we consider photographic memory, that might be a different story, that would be located in the visual cortex, which is larger in apes than in humans. However this still does not support the theory because as he mentioned it would only make sense if the regions gained and lost are very close to one another. The prefrontal cortex is the front most part of the brain the visual cortex is in the back most part of the brain, literally the furthest that they could be apart in terms of distance. Now, there are other minor reasons that poke holes in this theory but I&#39;m not going to go into those because my comment is already large enough. <br>Lets get onto the paradox then, any creationist readers will probably like this one. <br>A study preformed to measure the brain mass, activity, and etc of many animals that can use tools found that it should be impossible for any creature to have evolved to the point at which they could use fire as a tool without first having fire as a tool. <br>A simple explanation, the intelligence of any creature is determined not by the size of the brain but the number of specialized neurons, specialized being a key word here. We can measure the number of specialized neurons in the brain, we can also look at fMRI images to determine where tool use is localized in the brain and measure the number of neurons in that region of the brain. We can then measure the energy needed to maintain and use that part of the brain on a regular basis, and we can compare that energy to the maximum amount of energy that can be obtained from the environment. What was discovered is that tool use seems to be broken down into the number of steps required to preform the tool use. Simple tool use takes one step. Complex tool use is three or more steps. I&#39;ll break this down more, take cracking nuts for example first you have to find a nut, then find a large rock, then place the nut on the rock, then find another suitable rock, then slam the two rocks together over the nut. That&#39;s five steps. This is simplified obviously. few creatures can use tools with this complexity, namely great apes and humans. These two creatures obviously have the most number of neurons in the animal kingdom and require similar energy consumption. In humans our brain consumes approximately 1/3rd of the the total energy our body consumes every day. In apes I believe the number is about 1/4rth. Our brain contains about twice as many neurons on average than the average ape brain. But I&#39;m getting off topic here, basically after doing various measurements and years of study across more than 50 tool using species the scientists theorized that humans would have had to have fire (Which multiplies the amount of energy we can obtain from food) for at-least 400,000 years before we could have evolved to the point at which we could create and use fire as a tool. Now obviously there are many many theories trying to explain this, but all of them fall short. The best one is a mathematical theory that simplifies the equation, but even that only half&#39;s the amount of time needed to evolve fire as a tool. Now when I say use it as a tool, I don&#39;t just mean create it and carry it around I mean actually cooking food, which is many many many steps Just think about cooking a marshmellow, you have to find the food, find the stick do a strength test and length test put it on the stick hover it over the fire, do a distance check so its not too close not too far (this check is two steps) then watch it and do a cook test to determine when its cooked (several more steps) then take it off the flame, let it cool, etc... This simple explanation is at least 11 steps, and that&#39;s not even including making the fire and determining what food can and cant be cooked and etc. <br>Anyway this is the human evolution fire paradox, I thought some people might be interested in this. I&#39;m not trying to disprove evolution here just stating a simple paradox, if I tried to disprove evolution I would have written a much, much, larger and more detailed comment, but I don&#39;t like typing that much, so yeah. <br>This comment is waaayyyy too long as is.", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T06:07:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Bruh", "comment_text": "Micheal&#39;s gaming skills beat AI...", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T04:48:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dyslexci", "comment_text": "Raise ayuma to 10, then 11, and keep raising to see how far he could go...", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T04:45:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Bruh", "comment_text": "FINALLY DADDY UPLOADS A FREE &quot;PREMIUM&quot; EPISODE! :D", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T04:44:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zelda Phobia", "comment_text": "My favorite part <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0&amp;t=4m55s\">4:55</a>", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T04:38:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Micah Koziol", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0&amp;t=4m47s\">4:47</a><br>The chimp on the left is taking a wiz", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T04:19:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Armstrong", "comment_text": "Not enough time no link", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T03:10:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian._002", "comment_text": "Awesome", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T03:01:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melroy van den Berg", "comment_text": "Nothing is impossible.", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T02:57:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maxrowave", "comment_text": "<b>BEEP BEEP</b> Human wants to learn Language but Human needs to forget a skill?<br><br><br><b>Select Quick Decisions/Fast Memory</b><br><br><br><br><br>and..

It&#39;s interesting to think that we may have given up part of our short-term memory in order to develop language and imagination. Animals have limited imagination whereas humans probably have the most imagination. It&#39;s kind of ironic though, you know? Because another hypothesis says that part of the reason we don&#39;t remember anything from when we&#39;re really little is because we haven&#39;t developed language yet. Once we begin understanding language and speaking, our memories (at least, our explicit memories) improve. So I wonder how that works, exactly. If language is necessary to develop memory, but we gave up part of our memory in order to speak, how does that work? Perhaps because language is necessary to develop long-term memory, while short-term and implicit memory doesn&#39;t require language. So while chimps have incredible short-term memory, they probably can&#39;t recall things like from when they were young and vice versa for humans, we have great long-term memories and can recall things from childhood but our short-term memories don&#39;t even compare to a chimp&#39;s.", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T02:57:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bretton M", "comment_text": "I wonder if a human would be able to reach Ayumi&#39;s level with sufficient training/practice?", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T02:54:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Philip J.

There&#39;s the implication (and apparently this is what happened) that the chimps start off easy and <i>eventually</i> work their way up to the harder tests.

This seems to be nothing more than standard trial and error training, where a person (or chimp) gets better at a task over time, and eventually gets to a point that when viewed out of context seems &quot;super human&quot;. <br><br>The 9 digit test may be on the upper end for performance, but I see no reason that a human wouldn&#39;t be able to do that if they did this task daily like the chimps do. Maybe even do better, if you had several humans doing the tests and they could communicate discoveries and oddities of the test with one another (&quot;the numbers always ascend in a spiral,&quot; perhaps).

Its not impossible for humans to read as fast as Ayumu or Ai. In this long comment let&#39;s see how it&#39;s possible. The chimpanzees aren&#39;t reading the numbers, but they are looking at a giant picture instead. Imagine a painting of a horse in the foreground, mountains in the background and a hay field in between. Now if you focus your eyes only on the horse you might not be able to see what else is in the picture because you are so focused on just the horse. In order for you to see the mountains your eyeballs have to shift to that portion of the painting. However, if you focus on the whole picture you would be able to see all elements of the painting. This is essentially what the chimpanzee is doing. He is looking and the entire screen at once, instead of looking at the individual numbers and shifting his eyes between the digits that are presented to him. We humans can also do this, albeit with practice. The reason why we have to practice this in order to achieve it is because of the way we learned language or more specifically how to read. Typically when someone reads something they have a voice in their head &quot;saying&quot; the word they see. If they don&#39;t have that mental voice in their head then they use their actual voice while they read. Ask yourself this: are you vocalizing right now? There is a third way of how people read and that is; to read without a voice. It&#39;s really hard if you&#39;ve learned to read the traditional way, but doable.The theory behind how chimpanzee reading or speed reading is simple. It takes time to say a word in your head or by voice. When you read a word out loud and you hear it, that&#39;s when you know or understand what you&#39;ve read. For example lets look at the process of how vocal readers read; upon the first word reaching your eyeballs the brain recognizes it and looks it up in it&#39;s database., once it finds a match, your brain then signals your mouth to move your lips to sound out the word, then your ears have to hear what you&#39;ve said send it back to the brain for a final confirmation, and that&#39;s when it registers. Now that sounds like a lot of steps. Compare that long string of processes to the one speed readers (readers who don&#39;t utilize a voice either mental or physical) your brain sees the word, then recognize it. That&#39;s right. Just those two steps. See how much faster that is? Now combine this with the idea of expanding your field of vision with your peripherals. You should be able to see many things across a large screen and recognize the whole picture and one. For instance lets say you were reading a book. A normal person could read a single page in about 1 minute or less. A speed reader however can read the same page in 15 seconds or less because instead of vocalizing each word has they read, focusing sentence by sentence, a speed reader is reading paragraph by paragraph. Fun fact Teddy Roosevelt was known to read a few books a day because he could speed read (more or less.) If you want to get into speed reading there are many resources to learn how, one of the easiest way to do so is by using the app &quot;Speed Reading&quot; by Speed Reading Team. You can find the app online at <a href=\"http://speedreadingteam.com/\">speedreadingteam.com</a> Happy reading and happy holidays!

(originally written by Finch)<br><br>Michael doesn&#39;t owe you anything.  I totally get missing his old style videos, but Mind Field is incredibly interesting and fascinating.  He gets to experience, learn, and show us things he could never do without a company backing him.  Yes, this does mean that there&#39;s only one bunch of uploads each year and a majority of the videos will be for Premium members only, and unfortunately, that&#39;s not for everybody.  Vsauce2 and Vsauce3 both upload high quality free content with Vsauce3 matching YouTube Premium quality FOR FREE on a consistent basis, and Michael still makes videos for DONG on the side.  He also convinced YouTube to put Episode 4 out for free when it releases and he is finishing up a regular Vsauce video right now.  Michael never stopped working or doing what he loved.  The way we consume it is now different.  And it&#39;s not like YouTube Premium is some kind of evil entity that must be stopped because it&#39;s &quot;destroying YouTube.&quot;  If anything, it&#39;s helping to legitimize YouTube as a platform where a creative person with a passion for something can be as respected as a mainstream celebrity.  Jake, Logan, Viners, etc. are more at risk of destroying YouTube - heck include PewDiePie in that list, if you feel like it, as his carelessness on a few occasions has brought a lot of heat to the platform.  What I&#39;m trying to stay is: Don&#39;t complain that &quot;you&#39;re not getting the real Michael&quot; or &quot;the old Vsauce&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s sad he locks his videos behind a paywall.&quot;  He is getting the opportunity to teach us and show us ideas and topics that he never would have otherwise, he stands as a shining example of why YouTubers deserve all credit they earn and the respect to be taken seriously as creators, and he still delivers regular content on the side.  I would say that anyone who refuses to at least acknowledge this lacks respect for Michael and what he does as a creator and should rightfully be ignored.<br><br>This is coming from someone who is not subscribed to YouTube Premium, btw.  I understand being upset or missing Vsauce content, but there comes a point when there&#39;s a real lack of understanding and respect for the amount of work that goes into producing something like this.  People other than Michael worked on this show, you know, and the minute Mind Field stops being profitable, they&#39;ll drop it.  Maybe you think that&#39;s what you want, but who&#39;s to say that Michael would start uploading regularly again after that?  You might still just be stuck with one upload a year, as he could easily just switch to touring with Brain Candy or stick to DONG or just oversee the Vsauce brand and help on Vsauce2 and 3.  Don&#39;t assume you know what will happen if this series was gone and be careful for what you wish for, but, more than anything, don&#39;t disrespect Michael or the team that worked on Mind Field.

While this is our primary way to remember things for us, it does take longer as we must internally go one, two three, four etc in order to have it in our working memory. Of course we would then keep it in our memory using rehearsal which i believe the monkey would not have as a function. As we have an inherent meaning behind the numbers it may be limiting for us to view the them as just the visual  form thereby taking us longer.

In fact, he points out it was Japanese researchers who first introduced  an empathetic viewpoint to studying Chimpanzees (omoiyari?).  <br><br>I am still in the process of reading the book, and I&#39;m not sure if Frans is going to pursue the direction of the Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis, but as an applied linguist myself (and in Japanese colleges for the last 35 years), this theory sounds entirely plausible.<br><br>One possible weak point of the theory though, is how, or if, it accounts for &#39;dark triad&#39; personality traits among humans \u2014 machiavellian opportunists, narcissists, and psychopaths.  But then again, chimpanzees also appear to have individually distinct temperaments, so we can presume not all of those temperaments are as &#39;loving&#39; as that of bonobos.<br><br>Combined with Dunbar&#39;s Number regarding cognitive constraints on social connections (and by implication, rule-driven hierarchies rather than empathy-driven communities), there are all kinds of implications regarding the moral (or immoral) nature of what it means to be a member of homo sapiens.<br><br>p.s. Just finished Fran&#39;s book (the 3rd I&#39;ve read from him), and confirmed that he is the researcher I would choose as &#39;Would Most Love to Chat over Beer With&#39; award.  He did not go into the Cognitive Tradeoff Hypothesis (for which I am grateful for this video), and I think he oversimplified Dunbar&#39;s hypothesis by implying Dunbar was referring to overall brain size (rather than just the pre-frontal cortex) and cognitive limits to sociality.  <br><br>But Frans did a fantastic job of pointing out something I see in many of the comments to this video.  A large proportion of humanity can seem to justify self-worth and identify only through an &#39;othering&#39; process, rather than a connecting process.  <br><br>My guess is that there is a genetically influenced temperamental trait among homo sapiens, stronger in some more than others, which predispose such people to egocentric exceptionalism, and no amount of reason or education will change their fundamental assumptions.  <br><br>But along with Frans&#39; book, the limits of language and logic (Wittgenstein and G\u00f6del as modern examples, Lao Tzu and animistic/shamanistic traditions as historic antecedents) also seem to indicate that the entitled, egoistic temperament is just as likely to be found among those who fetishize science as among religious zealots \u2014 a lot of secular Japan and China being prime examples of some of the uglier, economic forms of fundamentalist self-interest.<br><br>As implied above, it is not just the moral implications of this video that are intriguing.  Far Eastern cultures such as Japan, Korea, and China stress the importance of rote-memorization, especially for high-stakes, standardized tests for college entrance exams (the Centa-Shiken in Japan, the Gao Kao in China).  It is interesting from an anthropological viewpoint how an emphasis on rote memorization may affect cultural norms and political dynamics as well.<br><br>But in the long run, I can&#39;t help but to feel a bit pessimistic.  <br><br>Both good science and self-interest dictates that we SHOULD compare humans with chimpanzees (and bonobos) as a fellow &#39;social&#39; primates.  <br><br>But where among the chimps and bonobos can we find populations exceeding small communities \u2014 our own tribes becoming large scale &#39;herding&#39; primates, and then self-destructive &#39;swarming&#39; primates?  <br><br>When the populations become too large for mutual recognition, communities are replaced by institutions run by the double-edged sword of hierarchies ... both &#39;binding&#39; and &#39;marginalizing&#39;.  But hierarchies are based on rules that can, and will be gamed, rather than immediate empathy.  <br><br>No matter the institution ... political, economic, religious, education, etc ... &#39;meritocracy&#39; is little more than a carrot (or whip) to keep the majority in line, while the entitled minority tend to be self-entitled, despite rules \u2014 not because of them. <br><br>This is where I am pessimistic about our long term sustainability.

I noticed that, as I was playing along with Michael, I was darting my eyes across the screen (placing my central, focal vision on each number), and there just wasn&#39;t enough time to do that when they were on screen for only .5 seconds (but I could still remember what I HAD looked at). Maybe the reason chimps are better is partially because they can process the ENTIRE screen (and thus register the contents of the screen) because they&#39;re not &quot;limited&quot; by an enhanced central field of vision? It&#39;s the same thing on brain games, where they had the animals go on stage during the performance, and no one saw them because they were outside their field of PERCEPTION. Perhaps that contributes to the discrepancy of human and chimp scores? It&#39;d be interesting to put this to the test by monitoring the gaze of chimps and humans performing this game (to see if chimps take the entire screen in at once and if humans bounce their gaze between each number.?", "comment_date": "2018-12-15T04:52:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christiam Huere", "comment_text": "Ponganlo en espa\u00f1ol carajo", "comment_date": "2018-12-15T04:43:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Piervincenti", "comment_text": "&quot;Because we can talk.&quot; The same with everything else.

EXPLANATION: If you are a reader...you MUST focus on each word one line at a time. it is nearly impossible to read all words on a normal page simultaneously. but the chimp is not trained to focus on one character at a time, then compute it&#39;s meaning in combination with other characters in some arrangement of proximity close by....humans are taught that ....therefore we do NOT excel at the task of looking at a tree with fruit in it and counting how many there were, colors, sizes, shapes.

Our teacher Jesus knows each one of us by name. The natzi wreick take orders from the fallen to infiltrate every society and country&#39;s Government especially child welfare Areas to covertly take over and enslave us and use us for hard labour.

Do use Jesus name and Jesus words for Heaven&#39;s Army is in toe, or tow if you will, with Jesus words. For this is the measure that has been given use wisely and break the kneck of the snake witch is the wrieck German cabal. They took over the Royals, especially England marrying Queen Victoria and pioneered slavery and promote wars to kill our selves in their depopulation agenda 21 delivered by their Jesuit groomed two way plants in top investigative positions and media to think tank us in to weakness and defenceless positions while they negate their covert take over technics and lead us in to a false sense of security while they manouvour war it to place seemingly as a natural progression. They have dumbed us down to believe their lies of fevorous hatred against each other when we should direct hate to them the international central bankers and their luciferian blood lines of the business mogals that get a free pass on business aided by all their satanist free mason business, civil, investigative roles and police plants in top positions that all meet in secret to think tank against the country they operate in. This is call treason against the people that they are paid by to look after. We the elect will not be fooled even if it were possible. For our sake time shall be cut short and thier plan not find fruition. Our Prince Micheal, Jesus Angel, has now risen and gives this message. &#39;Jesus is coming soon. Jesus is the root and off spring of David. Jesus is bright and morning Star that tells of a brand new day to come.&#39;  So for those who desire may drink freely of the water of life from Jesus lips delivered to you by his 12 aposels of which Jesus recruited Soul of Tarsus : Paul apostle : to replace Judus given over that the scriptures be full filled. Jesus 12 are the foundation of Righteousness in the new temple of Jeursalem. One of Jesus 12 to the foundation gudgment of each gate of the 12 tribes that come in and go out of the New Temple of Jeursalem. Use these words of Jesus wisely for they are your pass to eternal life that you may go in and out of these gates covered in the blood of the lamb of God where there is no condemnation. The measure has been given and we must give to those who keep truth chennels open for God&#39;s children to hear through his only son Jesus has sent in the flesh to be slaughtered in our place so we don&#39;t have to be slaughtered. Those who believe Jesus will be saved for only those of us who have our names in the book of life are blessed from above to have eyes to see and perceive and have ears to hear and understand. Because of Jesus blood we may recieve the living water from Jesus mouth freely and so we may give this life giving water freely for those who desire. Jesus is coming and he is coming soon. And so I say to the third horse man with scale in hand! &#39;a pound of wheat and two pounds of barley for a days pay and do not hurt the oil or the wine&#39; . Jesus is coming and he is coming soon his reward of eternal life is with him and he knows each one by name. Give to those who are for us to get the channels of truth open so truth can be heard. For who ever is not for us is against us I tell you the truth. Prepare for the weding ceremony for Jesus words are oil for your lamp. Fill up that you may see your self through the midnight hour to come until the bride groom comes for you and takes you into the wedding chamber where Jesus shall shut the door that no one can open. Jesus is here in the spirit now and soon will be in the flesh as he was before. For greater is Jesus in us than the he that is in the world only for a short time longer take hart your Father in Heaven loves you very much he has sent his only son and they have not listened. But we who have ears have listened. Tell the Good news Jesus sets the captives free, the lame walk, the deaf hear, the blind see and is coming in the flesh soon for all had been given to him from Father that all shall worship Jesus as the Father! Father and Jesus are one. By Jesus words we sanctify our selves whole and complete to bond into the new and everlasting covenant that Father, Jesus and we the children of God Almighty be as one. Rejoice for your price has been paid by Holy Blood that has sealed the new and ever lasting covenant that Father, Jesus and we who have ears to hear the spirit of truth, our helper, that was sent at penticost that Jesus is in now to bring in all of us into his number to join our brothers and sisters benieth the sea of glass. Let those who have ears to hear now hear!  Jesus is coming and coming soon. Holy be thy name Jesus Amen! Tell the good news the captives are being set free, the dead come to life, deaf now hear and the blind now see. Your pice has been paid. The best good news of all is Jesus is coming soon.

Humans eventually found ways to survive as individuals. When we come into a space where there are multiple individuals, it takes quite a while for us to map out the pecking order. I think this may be why we have to construct such explicit social environments with labels and &quot;positions&quot; for individuals to occupy to make it easier for us to remember who we do or don&#39;t&quot; have to&quot; obey.

There was a significant time period between leaving the trees and the expansion of brain capacity.

And we stuck together in tribes because sex felt good and we didn&#39;t have a &#39;mating season&#39; like practically every single other animal on the planet does.  We stayed in tribes to retain access to a group of sex partners for pleasure.  If females had not evolved to have hidden estrus, and we had not evolved to have the drive toward physical and sexual intimacy (something other animals have little need for), we almost certainly would have died off.  But because sex felt good and it motivated us to stick together, there were selection pressures that gave advantage to greater cognitive ability in order to navigate social interactions, which motivated development of language, etc and we were off to the races.  Don&#39;t sell sex for pleasure short.  If sex were mainly for reproduction in humans, nothing would make any sense.  It requires too much investment of time and energy, it is extremely inefficient (about 1 out of every 1000 sexual encounters results in a live birth, worst rate in the entire animal kingdom), and we have no way of knowing when it is even likely to work.

The synthesis of meaningful speech requires a lot of short memory - to convert current thoughts to sentence and relate it to the previous statement. The same is true for speech listening.<br>So, it is not coincidental that speech area created next to/in short memory area. As human language ability was growing, so the advantage of humans was growing too. And this new advantage made short memory less needed. So speech area indeed canibalized part of short memory but it happened because it was less needed anyway and canibalizing other areas was less beneficial. If short memory would be still in high demand, speech area would grow in some other direction, canibalizing other areas or increasing in size by itself.

I feel like we cant memorize 9 randomly placed numbers in half a second because we need to reason. When Michael was given enough time to stare at the screen, which you would do the same, he was reasoning. Something like, making sure he is choosing the lowest number and then eliminating it while its still visually showing on the screen, kind of like ignoring it. Also we need to reason each step of the way that 1 is smaller than 2 which is smaller than 3 and so on and so forth. This matters also entirely because a fast chimp still doesnt know that he is choosing the numbers in increasing order. If for the first time ever a chimp was able to answer correctly then you can say they have superior memory. But imagine they have to have starter at a very easy level and gradually get to 9 numbers. Which means, they are learning the order at which things must be such that it would produce a treat. Again to prove the point that we are slow because we are evolved to reason, is to manipulate the test and start from number 13, and randomly increase the numbers until you have 9 total numbers and see if a chimp can remember that. for example the string of 13, 17, 18, 22, 29, 33, 44, 51, 53, etc and see if chimps can get that right. in other words it would take the chimps roughly the same time to learn these numbers or ascending order of 9 letters of alphabet to produce a treat. they are just learning the shape and order at which a treat is issued. once thats learned, they are master of one and only one pattern. however a human, because it can reason, will be able to answer correctly given enough time even if you changed the numbers with bigger and more random numbers and letters and sizes, the very first time you present them with it. why? because we reason. And i said all the above to prove the process of reasoning among human and lack there of in chimps, to arrive at this conclusion. reasoning and correct reasoning takes time.", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T09:03:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andy Macrae", "comment_text": "You forgot  about the alien d.n.a. manipulation part. and the dumbing down of the designer slaves.", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T09:02:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Morgan Muldoon", "comment_text": "I love this asian man so much.", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T08:56:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "feras salah", "comment_text": "I think with enough practice, a human can improve his short-term memory", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T08:52:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ghostly Cactus", "comment_text": "Stoopid Monky is peeing caught on camera <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktkjUjcZid0&amp;t=4m47s\">4:47</a>", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T08:38:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lemon Lemon of Lemon Lemon", "comment_text": "My god, you&#39;re still alive!", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T08:37:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "m !", "comment_text": "Can somebody work on Arabic captions please", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T08:37:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Your Neighbour", "comment_text": "Just here to find the triggered creationist comments.", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T08:32:37Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Adam Alto", "comment_text": "This guy needs some grizzly wintergreen and dumbbells.", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T08:31:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cervo Gian Luigi", "comment_text": "Lo vogliamo in italianoooooo.", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T08:12:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dezy", "comment_text": "XDDDDDDDDDDDDD How stupid are these 2 ridiculous morons???

And I&#39;ve just binged watched two youtube sci series since joining, and I have to say youtube tv shows are my new best thing. I&#39;ve been missing out. But here&#39;s my snag. All the Clcas that decided to go down from the trees onto the savannah would have been killed by predators, having &#39;no sprint speed, natural offences or defences&#39; or complex language system (yet). They would they have survived on the savannah surface long enough to breed and protect their offspring to adulthood? I don&#39;t see any survival chance. And there was not the necessary amount of time for favourable mutations to take place for them to have survived on the savannah because they would all have been killed by predators. How would they have developed a language system so quickly and to teach it to their offspring before being killed off? \u00a0 If the chimp human ancestor who left the trees developed a complex language system within one generation (i.e. before they were all killed by predators) then we should be able to get chimps\u00a0 to develop complex language. The best we have got is to teach apes sign language in California in the 60s and 70s .e,g. Koko. and there seems to be a limit with how much sign language they can learn. And we don&#39;t really know for 100percent certain how much the apes understand the sing language they are using. It requires heavy use of prompting, which was a big critique in the face of the Koko program, which still runs even though Koko died through the Koko foundation. If this is really true then it is possible for\u00a0 chimps to develop complez language within their lifetime i.e. 40 years.

An interpreter must identify the words spoken in the source language in its order, understand any colloquialisms, translate that to the different order of a target language to make sense, then ultimately interpret the conversation as fast as the other can speak!

I.e. could we do something to improve our short term memory based on the theories underlying this phenomenon?<br><br>3) statistically speaking how do chimps stack up against humans in this sort of test?  They admittedly pitted their best chimp against Michael.  I&#39;m certain that if we looked there would be a human that, with the same amount of practice, could beat this chimp.

If a human performed this task daily from a young age, I would argue they could do much better than Michael and may be able to reach close to the ability of the apes. When Michael tried the hardest test, he did very poorly, however there is a key to winning this game that he didn&#39;t have the time to consider- if you look at the grouping of the numbers and the shapes they form, it is easier to memorize their positions than if you think of them as individual numbers in a sequence. Figuring out the sequence comes second to memorizing the shapes. Our mind thinks ahead to solving the puzzle while the ape merely sees the shapes formed by the clusters of numbers. You don&#39;t necessarily have to remember the individual numbers, you just use the process of elimination to work out the sequence based on the memorized shapes. I don&#39;t think a human adult could do this puzzle anywhere near the speed of the chimps, but if a human were specialized to the activity from a young age like the apes are, and could work out advanced techniques to solve the puzzle, they would be able to do it nearly as fast as the apes.", "comment_date": "2018-12-08T00:10:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "s l o w d o w n", "comment_text": "vsauce is easily one of my favourite channels, I could rewatch any one of these episodes like 4 times and absorb some new information I missed beforehand.

Rather than being a trade-off in the brain (as if we&#39;re talking about a processor forced to switch tasks) doesn&#39;t it make more sense for this to be a byproduct of the structural aspects of language? I think we can address this by referencing other closely related phenomena related to written language. First though, let&#39;s talk about language and the brain. In the brain, we have Exner&#39;s writing area, Broca&#39;s expressive speech area, and Wernicke&#39;s receptive speech area but what we don&#39;t have... is an area known to directly correlate to the use of written language conceptually (Exner&#39;s writing area seems to be responsible for the motor control aspect but not ideation).<br><br>One good source for thinking about this are studies done on dyslexia (the general term for disorders that involve difficulty in learning to read or interpret words, letters, and other symbol) and agraphia (an acquired neurological disorder causing a loss in the ability to communicate through writing). When looking at reading specifically, brain scans do not show any one area designated for working with written language (other than Exner&#39;s in the physical act of writing). Studies on dyslexia are especially relevant here. Instead of being one spot, in brain scans the brain seems to spread the load around several areas working in coordination to produce cognition with written language (dyslexia appearing to be a dysfunction in neural adaption in these areas). Language and memory are just not that cut and dry.<br><br>As an example, if you have a person read a word... horse for example... most people will picture the object that word represents, for them the mental image of the object being inexorably tied with it&#39;s meaning. However, there are people with Aphantasia who do not have that attachment between a word and a mental image of the object... but they retain a concept of what it is anyway. Many dyslexic/dysgraphic people have a similar experience. They (we in this case) retain the concept separate from a mental picture (even of words themselves). More than that, we now have evidence that recalling a memory actually re-writes the memory IF we retell it to ourselves or others (this is part of why police don&#39;t want you telling the story of an incident before they get their report). Without that aspect of telling the story though, if we are merely struck by a memory but do not dwell on it, we are far less likely to force it into the confines of language and re-write it.<br><br>The whole idea that our brain physically borrowed processing power from memory to make language seems pretty silly given how complex a task language is for the brain (not to mention how language shapes our interpretation of reality structurally). Additionally, I&#39;d say we didn&#39;t re-task some other area because nothing in our evolutionary background would have been transferable to the level of abstraction we use when writing. Given what we know about the the formation of memory and it&#39;s intersection with language as well as those reading disorders, I just don&#39;t see other science backing this theory.

The chimp was allegedly the best one they have and he had who knows how much training in this test.<br>2. Michael on the other hand had to learn the rules (not so hard as he already knew how to count) and certainly did not train for this task.<br>3. Most importantly, Michael is used to write stuff down. It has been shown that illiterate people have much better memories than people that know how to write. And the ability to write is quite young, at most 10\u2019000 years which in evolutionary timelines is absolutely nothing.<br><br>I have to agree with others, that this video was a bit disappointing.

Train several children from a very early age to play this game and then compare results.  Second,  while the chimp they keep showing is the young male, is he representative of the average?

I\u2019d bet science has kept more ground breaking possibilities from reaching the common people. Than it\u2019s given us value in our lives. After all science gave us the atom-bomb, hydrogen bomb, and now neutron bomb. Thanks, for that science. Many of the greatest scientists, have claimed their greatest inventions. Were, inspired or given to them. While in altered mental states meditation, or dreaming. Tesla, Einstein, Newton, and I\u2019m willing to bet if they were honest. The greatest of world changing ideas came while in altered states. People might not have the reactionary times of animals. That need those heightened reactions, and quickly to survive the wild. I want to see monkeys build a car, statue, meaningful speech, motivational actions, essentially fore-thought. For a purpose of making spiritual happiness within. Like, a beautiful well written card. That inspires a person to fight their illness, rather than giving up and in. These abilities aren\u2019t in any other animals besides mammals. The only characteristic I\u2019ve seen of a higher level in lesser species. Is that of compassion and love. Perhaps there are things we could learn from the animal kingdom. Not by dissecting and caging them for study. Instead having compassion and love. Stop, destroying our habitat and theirs. Work in groups and stop thinking ourselves superior to each other. If mankind ever gets their heads out of there touches. Long enough, to stop repeating the mistakes -of our forefathers. I, believe the definition is crazy.

These results would be more telling, I think. <br>But it might be very difficult to have the chimp understand the purpose or rules of the exercize.<br>Two (and that&#39;s the most important one): I think there is something about the number that doesn&#39;t help chimpanzees here, and does give the human an edge, but still, it could go the other way totally: Chimps don&#39;t know what numbers mean. If you held up three fingers to their face, they could not choose between 1, 5 and 3 on a screen without preparation. <br>I&#39;m not exactly sure how that can affect the experiment, but I&#39;d like to see it done on both human and Chimp without numerals, but that would mean changing the exercise completely, either showing meaningless symbols one after the other on the screen and then asking you to point them out in order, or telling you the order of a set of meaningless symbols (like numbers, say \u2640 is first, then \u263c is second and \u25c4 is third) and then having them appear simultenaously on the screen and asking you for the right order, finally. <br>Nevertheless.

Perhaps the chimps (who don&#39;t understand the numbers but know the sequence to press them in) simply remember what number is in each place, and then sort the order out later.  I.e. they take a mental snapshot and then go through that snapshot to find the order in which to click.<br>This could probably be tested by not having the numbers all be shown at the same time, but to go on and off in an non-numerical order.", "comment_date": "2018-12-06T11:17:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "O", "comment_text": "This is interesting but there are a few arguments I feel are not answered in this episode at least, though I haven&#39;t read the detailed study reports admittedly. <br><br>First, it looks like the chimps are being trained in recognising the numbers slowly first. If a human participant put in an equal amount of hours as the chimpanzees are doing to train to say Ayumu&#39;s level, would the results be that different? You could use made up numerals that humans are not familiar with in order to make it a fair comparison perhaps. Seems like pitting an amateur guitarist against Hendrix. What seems impossible may well just be practice and then tacit intuition.<br><br>Second, when I tried to remember the positions of the numbers on the 0.5 second trial, I felt that my vision was not broad enough to even look at the whole thing quick enough, perhaps the vision of chimps and humans is a little different. V-Sauce in one of his previous videos (a long time ago) showed that the focused vision of humans is about the size of your finger nail at an arm&#39;s length. Would humans be able to do it better if they sat further from the screen?<br><br>Third, I don&#39;t understand why there would be a trade off with brain function. That wasn&#39;t really explained other than to say if one gets bigger the other has to get smaller. But again, our brains have gotten bigger than smaller primates so why all of a sudden is there a limit? <br><br>Lastly, I don&#39;t think that what distinguishes homo sapiens from other primates is our ability to share. All primates appear to share. I think it&#39;s our ability to be so damn greedy. We have places to store all our stuff and we somehow came up with the crazy notion of &#39;owning&#39; land. No animal even owns clothes let alone a bank account full of money and a house and a car. Sharing is something we are capable of, but certainly not our defining feature.<br><br>EDIT: lots of folks seem to think I said we don&#39;t share, and that only humans are greedy.

The  Stanford Prison Experiment, I think truly is this like only minor showcase of humans at our worst and what travesties and horrors we are willing to do in the name of power at all costs even over community.<br>Secondly in reference to this video I remember way back about 5 years ago when I was a junior in high school taking AP Psych that  the human&#39;s short term memory does best with closer to 5 pieces of info and also kinda maxing out around 7, but that you can maximize that by memorizing things in chunks together. For example, remembering someone&#39;s phone number by each singular digit is hard, but break it up to area code, first three digits, last 4 digits and now you&#39;re just remembering 3 pieces of information. Idk if maximizing on this part of the human short term memory to think forward and compartmentalize and chunk information together would increase reaction time on our part for test like these.  So in the case of the second 9 number test Micheal took, memorizing it in chunks of 3 so 1 to 2 to 3, then 4 to 5 to 6, and lastly 7 to 8 to 9 are each their 3 point line and now 3 pieces of info instead of 9.", "comment_date": "2018-12-06T04:50:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akashdeep Singh", "comment_text": "I have a theory.

Maybe a lot of brain power is consumed into processing and filtering out all that information or correlations. Given enough time we will still be able to do it. Chimps on the other hand don\u2019t not remember that my relations hence less things to filter and get  faster easily with practice.

Crabs rarely if ever use their claws for defense. Those are strictly used for either eating or settling territorial disputes.<br><br>Their main mode of defense is their speed, as having side-to-side movement allows them to significantly simplify their leg movements and thus diminishing their energy consumption, hence why shrimps and lobsters use the caridoid escape reaction (flick of the tail) to escape, because their gait doesn&#39;t allow for fast speeds. Meanwhile crabs are comparatively incredibly fast, allowing them to quickly hide under rocks (marine crabs) or burrows (land crabs). This is also why sea crabs have a generally flattened appearance, it&#39;s to allow them to fit under rocks more easily.<br><br>Claws are only ever used as a last resort, like a lizard&#39;s detachable tail, a crab can sometimes dig it&#39;s claw into a predator to distract it, which will most often cause the claw to be potentially detached from the animal.<br>Otherwise, most crab species (mostly land-based ones) will attempt a &quot;lunge&quot; to intimidate, which doesn&#39;t actually do anything other than frighten whatever it&#39;s trying to get away from (I had my pet land crab &quot;pinch&quot; me a couple times after a successful lunge, it really doesn&#39;t actually do anything).<br><br>Ironic how you used the atlantic ghost crab here as an example, animals that almost never use their claws for defense. Their main modes of defense are actually speed (notice how most ghost crabs have a significantly more muscular ischium-merus one their walking legs compared to most other crab species) and their camouflage (atlantic ghost crabs can actually change the color of the top of their carapace based on the color of the sand they reside on without molting).", "comment_date": "2018-12-05T19:59:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stasi Memelady", "comment_text": "\u201cThe ability to speak does not make you intelligent.\u201d", "comment_date": "2018-12-05T19:59:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Siim Land", "comment_text": "The same trade-off can be seen in long-term thinking and giving in to immediate gratification.

But is what the chips are doing reading? A human doing the test is presumably processing each numeral as a number, as a symbol that represents a concept; reading them. Do the chimps not do that? They obviously understand that these symbols go in a certain order. Do they understand that the symbols can stand for counts of things? Might a human perform better on a variant of the test using non-linguistic images, like say cartoon faces of different animals? We&#39;d have to learn what the right order of animals is, but presumably the chips had to learn what the right order of numerals is. Maybe the problem slowing humans down is that we&#39;re trying to read the numbers, instead of just seeing a picture and remembering what that picture looks like.<br><br>It makes me think of the difference between &quot;system 1&quot; and &quot;system 2&quot; processes, where system 1 is &quot;muscle memory&quot; and system 2 is deliberate thoughtful action. The latter seems like it would be highly connected to the same parts of our brain that handle language and abstract reasoning, and that is known already to be much slower than system 1; that&#39;s why you can screw up your ability to effortlessly do something you&#39;re good at by thinking about it too much.

To learn many languages fills the memory with words instead of with facts and ideas, even though in every man, memory is a vessel that can take in only a certain limited amount of content. Also, learning many languages is harmful in that it makes a man believe he is accomplished, and actually does lend a certain seductive prestige in social intercourse; it also does harm indirectly by undermining his acquisition of well-founded knowledge and his intention to earn men&#39;s respect in an honest way. Finally, it is the axe laid to the root of any finer feeling for language within the native tongue; that is irreparably damaged and destroyed. The two peoples who produced the greatest stylists, the Greeks and the French, did not learn any foreign languages.\r<br>But because the commerce of men must become increasingly cosmopolitan and, for example, a proper merchant in London must be able to make himself a necessary evil. When it finally reaches an extreme, it will force mankind to find a remedy for it, and in some far-off future time everyone will know a new language, a language of commerce at first, then a language of intellectual intercourse generally, and this as surely as there will one day be aerial navigation.

Auels books-series The Earth Children (first book called Clan of The Cave Bear). The book-series shows a difference between Neanderthals and early Homo-sapiens similar to what is being discussed here. It describes Neanderthals as being able to call upon a inherent memory of the clan, in other words; the children seem to pick up on survival tactics and clan-norms, -values and -tradition way quicker than the main protagonist Ayla; She is a Homo-sapiens, and feels like she has difficulties learning the same things like her Neanderthal clan-mates because she can&#39;t acces this inherent clan-memory. The Neanderthals, in the books, communicate with sign-language, while Ayla (who, with great difficulty, grows up learning sign language as well) and her, later on, Homo-sapien family already have the ability to speak and have a spoken language to communicate.<br><br>I believe the neanderthals in the books are able to pick up on things in their clan s\u00f3 quickly that Ayla thinks they have a inherent memory, is because of their lack of capability for spoken language. They still use a language - sign language - but it&#39;s very different from spoken language as it uses visual symbols to communicate; something that the neanderthals in the book are good at learning (I.e.

These are all things I recognize from TV documentaries and I always found it annoying. Now I don&#39;t necessarily think the whole mind field series is bad, because there are some interesting topics and findings in some of them still. But I would like it if mind field were presented in the old vsuace way, where it was a lot of information from different angles and switching topics frequently like you mentioned in your ted talk to keep the audience interested. You also never really dumbed things down for the general audience in your old videos, or didn&#39;t explain trivial things much. So not only do the topics seem to be less complicated but also the narration spends too much time on simple things. Together they make for a worse experience than your old videos. Though I do appreciate that you now can travel and give us some more first hand experience, I just would like that you also delve more deeply into topics again, and drop the documentation type narration<br><br>either way i really like the channel and will always come back to watch new or old videos, so thank you : )", "comment_date": "2018-12-05T17:45:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XXSEAN \u4e61,", "comment_text": "keep it up", "comment_date": "2018-12-05T17:45:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tobias Schrodt", "comment_text": "Jesus people let Michael do whatever he wants to do, he has fun doing this series and this shows again and again.
