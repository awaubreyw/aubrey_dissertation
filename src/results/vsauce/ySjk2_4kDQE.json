This creates a series of lines that are angled vaguely towards the dots. Additionally, since the sides of the box are lighter than the circles the &quot;negative&quot; we see when its covered by the circle will be a darker line, reinforcing the bent segments as well as extending them into the circle (ie as it moves you see a small bit of white line bent towards the dots just outside the circle as well as a small bit of dark line that was just covered up by the circle).<br><br>This is why the contour line is much more apparent when the circles are moving inward, but are almost absent when the circles move back out (we still get a little bit of the uncovered box appearing to be bent, but no darker negative enhancing the effect).<br><br>Then because these small bent lines appear to move in a similar manner as the dots, and the lines are bent vaguely towards the dots, our brain assumes that their motion is connected and finishes the line in our mind.", "comment_date": "2016-05-04T04:50:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "harrison sim", "comment_text": "the dot thing looks like DNA", "comment_date": "2016-04-23T18:41:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marshall Nalley", "comment_text": "Is on the bottom left", "comment_date": "2016-03-30T13:22:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orange Puffle", "comment_text": "[:/", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T21:55:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dying Upon The Truth", "comment_text": "why u have to show pornogrpaphic [ics with ur img", "comment_date": "2016-03-14T22:18:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oto", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySjk2_4kDQE&amp;t=4m18s\">4:18</a> its the edges of the circles moving in and out, hitting the edge of the square. our eyes connect that to the dots since they are pretty much moving in the same pattern, giving us a weird illusion.
