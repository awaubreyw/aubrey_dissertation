I see how embalming was beneficial for humans in the past but is not really anymore, it&#39;s just backwards, savage, and sadistic. The population is high enough on Earth for us to be playing with the dead. Matter can not be created or destroyed so the best way to honor a loved ones memory is to let the earth take them back and use their nutrients to make more life. If its your own body, I don&#39;t think it matters what happens, but i think I&#39;d rather have statues built after me where no one can change the position. Seems a lot less degrading than becoming a piece of property that your loved ones cant even have or you control what happens to you or used for.

The basic technology has been around since the late 1960s, and has, despite minimal funding, become quite advanced in the last decade or so. It&#39;s quite insane, really; ignoring cryonics is like ignoring the lifeboats on a sinking ship. When you ask people why they don&#39;t \u00a0sign up for (or at least support) cryonics, they come up with the strangest and most infantile excuses. Yes, excuses, that&#39;s all they are. There is no rational argument against trying to preserve the dead to the best of our abilities. Overpopulation, boredom, can&#39;t turn a hamburger into a cow... I&#39;ve heard them all before and they make no sense at all. Not then, not now, not ever. It&#39;s funny / sad to see otherwise seemingly intelligent people fail so badly at logic and reason when it comes to aging, death, and cryopreservation. More people (almost twice as many, in fact) have been to space than have been frozen. It&#39;s a psychosis, and it has a name: deathism. It&#39;s basically a mix of Sour Grapes and Stockholm Syndrome, a once-useful defense mechanism that has not just become obsolete, but lethal. But whatever.

With dwindling resources and facing aspects of mass starvation and the ensuing wars on the remaining resouces, could it happen that things like human ethics or moral code may be replaced with very cold and efficient pragmatism? Like recycling or reusing our dead bodies into something useful instead of leaving it to rot or shoot it into outer space. Like compulsory organ donation / redistribution or blood donation after that person dies. Or recycling human dead meat into jerky meat, diamonds, clothes or into a new iphone. Yea I know its disgusting and moraly wrong and unethical. And vegans may agree with me that life is sacred and stuff. But hey. Junkies sniff up the cremated remains of their dead relatives when they are short on drugs. Desperation and the sheer will of surviving does turn some people into monsters.
