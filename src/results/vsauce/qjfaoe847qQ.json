You can\u2019t use a single muscle cell in your arm to lift a brick, yet when you cut off the blood supply those individual cells suffocate. (You don\u2019t control your automatic breathing but can hold your breath) <br><br>Now imagine the roles reversed. <br><br>When your cells are sending out automatic chemical or electrical responses at impulses of their own accord for their entire existence when faced with the moment of failure those individual cells panic and flood your system. They\u2019re doing what they know. <br><br>If you cut off your finger that individual severed section is still alive right, those cells haven\u2019t died they\u2019re just suffocating and sending out a ton of impulses/chemical back to the brain which it no longer has. But it can be reattached. And when it is properly the cells remember what chemical/electrical impulses mean close/open the hand. As it has twitch responses and responds to electro pads etc. but that moment of open/close is just a fraction of a millisecond of chemical transference from one part of the brain to another and then a few seconds down your arm to your hand (it\u2019s why co-ordination sometimes takes a second and you might not have the cat-like reflexes you think you do) <br><br>Point is those cells can\u2019t tell time. And amoeba can\u2019t tell time. So if your brain and cells aren\u2019t on the same page a near death experience may have some time duration issues (it felt like eternity/I didn\u2019t even realize I went down) (think drowning vs aneurism) we say the latter is quicker because there\u2019s no external movement yet we sort of disregard the cells reactions being a real thing and paralysis being natural responses to shock/sudden information. <br><br>When given the ultimate info \u2018all your cells saying this isn\u2019t working help what\u2019s wrong brain\u2019 sometimes the brain goes for the automatic response of flooding the system over sentences.", "comment_date": "2022-09-20T03:20:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Kill To Live", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjfaoe847qQ&amp;t=02m20s\">02:20</a> sounds like when I was describing my ex girlfriend lol", "comment_date": "2022-09-19T11:56:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andreas K\u00e6rby Ravn", "comment_text": "We are only programmed to do so  based on our experiences and upbringing", "comment_date": "2022-09-18T06:17:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WoodsMedic1017", "comment_text": "Anyone familiar with Dr. Robert Lanzas work on consciousness and quantum physics?

All True Entheogens are the Living Molecules of Pure Consciousness. The human body produces it\u2019s own Consciousness (the nn,DMT &amp; 5-MeO-DMT found in humans). The human body then metabolizes the Consciousness that it is producing. The amount of the endogenous Consciousness that the human body is able to metabolize depends on many factors. The less pollutants, poison &amp; other contaminants present in the body will result in the ability to metabolize more of the Consciousness that body is producing.  Likewise, the more pollution, contaminants and poison a body has inside of it the less Consciousness it is able to metabolize. This is true for the endogenous Molecules of Consciousness found in humans, as well as any Molecules of Consciousness ingested from external sources.<br><br>Here is a list of some of the most common poisons that humans ingest regularly which interferes with a human body metabolizing the Consciousness that it produces, as well as any Consciousness that is ingested from external sources:<br>alcohol, nicotine, sugar, caffeine, amphetamines, dissociatives, tranquilizers, flouride, and a plethora of other drugs are just some of the substances that interfere with humans metabolizing their own Consciousness, as well as any Molecules of Consciousness ingested from external sources.  <br><br>\u201cEven the priests who regularly come near to the Lord must purify themselves\u201d.<br>(Exodus 19:22)<br><br>So if a human can achieve 100% purity within their bodies, with zero contaminants or pollution (an unattainable state in these current bodies) and managed to metabolize 100% of the endogenous Molecules of Consciousness that their physical body is producing (nn,DMT &amp; 5-MeO-DMT), that would be the limit to how Conscious that human can be. In order for a human to become more Conscious than this, they must put more Consciousness into their physical bodies. You must put more Molecules of Consciousness inside of your physical body in order to attain a Higher level of Consciousness. When you ingest Entheogens, you see Them that you just ingested, not some doorway or window or a \u201cportal\u201d to some other dimension, or some entity somewhere else. When you ingest LSD, the Light that you see is the LSD Themselves, very Beautiful, Sentient Beings of Living Light. When you ingest nn,DMT, the Entity you see and hear is the Living Light Being nn,DMT. The same is true for All True Entheogens Who are the Molecules of Pure Consciousness- God.  <br><br>There is this part from Scripture: <br><br>\u201cThey are the Eternal among things that pass away.  Pure Consciousness, of Conscious Beings. The ONE who fulfills the prayers of many. Only the wise who see Them in their Souls attain the Peace Eternal\u201d  (Katha Upanishad)<br><br>The Physical Body of Consciousness is The Flesh of God. The Flesh of God is the True Communion Substance (the Eucharist). The Flesh of God (Entheogens) are the Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and evil. When you eat the Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and evil your eyes will be opened and you will see like God, knowing Good and evil. Our Bodies truly are the Temple of God because God, the Living Light of Pure Consciousness Lives within it.  <br><br>As Saint Paul says: <br><br>\u201cWe are only the earthenware jars that hold this treasure, to make it clear that such an overwhelming power comes from God and not from us\u201d  (2 Corinthians 4:7)<br><br>This part explains why the human body  is the Temple of God - because God Lives inside of the human body. So whether or not a person is ingesting Entheogens, every single human body is God\u2019s Temple because nn,DMT &amp; 5-MeO-DMT Live within it. Anything you do to hurt or harm your body you do to harm God\u2019s Temple. This understanding is a good Foundation, a good step towards a person Knowing God and being able to stay with God both in this Lifetime &amp; afterwards. <br><br>\u201cO just Creator, though the world has not known you,<br>But I have known you<br>And these have known that You have sent me;<br>So have I declared, so will I declare<br>Your Name to them,<br>That the Love with which you have loved me<br>May be in them<br>and I in them\u201d.<br>(Saint John 17:25)<br><br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/5NrcjLe_APk\">https://youtu.be/5NrcjLe_APk</a><br><br>GodsNarrowGate@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a>", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T07:32:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hector Contreras", "comment_text": "This is the worst explanation of conciseness.

Therefore, every individual Must\u2014Through Struggle, and Through The Grace Of Sudden (or, Otherwise, Growing) Insight, or Through The Grace Of Sudden (or, Otherwise, Growing) Faith (or Tacit Certainty)\u2014Learn and Accept A Life-Lesson That Makes ordinary (or worldly) heroes Great and Grants Wisdom To those who Seek The Ultimate.<br><br>That Life-Lesson Is This: The Great \u201cCreative\u201d (or Even conventionally idealistic) Goals May Never Be Attained (and They Will Not Be Attained Without A Degree Of heroic Effort, or The Commitment To Struggle and self-Sacrifice)\u2014but The Ultimate Goal (Which Is Happiness Itself) Can Never Be Attained (or Attached To the Apparently Separate self) By Any Means Whatsoever!<br><br>The Import Of That Reality Lesson Is This: If You Are Devoted To Great Purposeful Seeking In the conditional worlds, You Will Inevitably Fail If You Avoid Great Struggle and self-Sacrifice, and You May Not Succeed Even If Struggle and self-Sacrifice Are Fully Engaged By You. More Than This, If Your Goal Is The Ultimate (or Happiness Itself, Full and Perfect), You Will Necessarily and Inevitably Fail\u2014Because Happiness Is Not Objectified (or Made Present As a conditional object In the conditional worlds).<br><br>Happiness Is An Inherent (or Unconditional and Perfectly Subjective\u2014Rather Than conditional and Objective, or Objectified) Characteristic Of Existence, Reality, or Being (Itself). Therefore, Happiness Cannot Be Found (or Attained) By conditional Seeking.<br><br>Even If The Great Searches and The Great Goals Are (Basically) Oriented Toward The Elimination Of the conditions that Apparently Cause Un-Happiness\u2014When Those Great Searches Are Fully Engaged (and Even When Those Great Goals Are Actually Attained), Happiness Itself (Full, True, and Not Threatened) Is Not Attained. Therefore, All The \u201cGlorious\u201d Adventures Of idealistic worldly heroes and All The \u201cRomantic\u201d Attainments Of \u201cCreative\u201d cultural geniuses End In Temporary Elation, Followed (Inevitably) By Disillusionment\u2014and Then (At Best), Unless There Is No \u201cRecovery\u201d From Inevitable Disillusionment, There May Be A Reawakening Of The Stressful Motive To Seek and Attain Once More. (And Such Seeking and \u201cAttaining\u201d Will Tend To Continue\u2014Until Disillusionment Itself Becomes Acceptance Of The Great Life-Lesson That Undermines All Seeking.)<br><br>Conventionally heroic and \u201cCreative\u201d personalities Tend To Grasp Only A Portion Of The Great Lesson Of conditional Existence. They Realize a genius For Struggle and self-Sacrifice, but (Unless\u2014By Grace, and By self-Transcendence, Even By Advancing To The Ultimate Stages Of Life\u2014they Realize The Truth Itself) they Never Realize Happiness Itself.<br><br>Happiness (Like Consciousness and Existence) Is Inherent (or Perfectly Subjective). Happiness Is Not Objectified (or Made an object), and It (Therefore) Cannot Be Attained By The Effort Of Seeking. Happiness (or Inherent Love-Bliss) Cannot Be Achieved objectively (or Accomplished conditionally). You Cannot Become Happy (Any More Than You Can Become Being, or Achieve Existence, or Become Consciousness, or Be Other Than Consciousness). You Can Only Be Happy (or Realize Love-Bliss Immediately, and Inherently, or Always Already, and Perfectly Subjectively). And, Likewise (or As A Corollary To This), You Cannot Become Un-Happy\u2014Unless, In Reaction To any particular conditional circumstance or event, You Refuse To Persist In Being Happy (and, Thus, Refuse To Persist As Always Already Existing, and Most Prior, Happiness Itself).<br><br>. . . Consciousness and Happiness Are Identical and Self-Existing.<br><br>Clearly, Consciousness Is Not An Object. If It Were, What Would It Be An Object To?<br><br>Consciousness Is Inherently and Perfectly Subjective. It Is That To Which (and In Which) Great Objects and lesser objects arise and pass away. To Seek Consciousness As If It Were An Object Is Absurd\u2014A Benighted (or Un-Happy) Quest, Founded On A Fundamental Misunderstanding Of Reality. Just So With Happiness!<br><br>Happiness Is Not An Object. If It Were, What Native (or Inherent) Quality Would It Modify or limit?<br><br>Happiness Is Inherently and Perfectly Subjective. And Happiness Is Inherent To The Inherently Perfect Subject (or Consciousness Itself). Therefore, Happiness Is That Native (or Original) Quality (or Inherent Force Of Being) That Is Apparently Modified, Apparently Revealed, or Apparently Decreased By The Apparent Association Between Consciousness and Both Great Objects and lesser objects.<br><br>To Seek Happiness As If It Were An Object (or To Identify It With any conditionally Manifested objects or others, or Even To Allow It To Depend Upon any conditionally Manifested objects or others) Is Absurd\u2014An Always Already Benighted and Un-Happy Quest, Founded On A Fundamental Misunderstanding Of Happiness (or Reality) Itself.<br><br>To Seek Happiness (Rather Than To Realize It Inherently) Is To Be Possessed By the self-Contraction and To Be Motivated By it. Because Of the self-Contraction, What Is Inherent Ceases To Be Obvious\u2014and (As A Result) the ego-\u201cI\u201d Seeks Among objects and others (and Even In the body-mind itself) For What Can Only Be Found (or Realized) Inherently, In Place, In The Well Of Transcendental, Inherently Spiritual (or Love-Blissful) and Self-Evidently Divine Being. Indeed, the ego-\u201cI\u201d Is Always Stressfully At Effort, In The Absurd Quest For Happiness and Consciousness.<br><br>Therefore, Listen To Me and Hear Me. Thoroughly Observe the self-Contraction. Understand Your Seeking and Your Separate and Separative self, Most Fundamentally. Grow (By Means Of My Avatarically Self-Transmitted Divine Grace, and Through Counter-egoic Heart-Response To My Avatarically Self-Transmitted Divine Grace) To Realize and Abide In No-Contraction (or The By-Me-Avatarically-Self-Revealed Native Love-Bliss-Happiness Of Conscious Being). In This Manner, Relax All Seeking For Happiness. All conditional objects (Including Your Own body-mind) Are themselves Contraction-Only. All Great Objects and all lesser objects Are Merely (and Only) Apparent Modifications Of The Inherent Love-Bliss-Radiance Of My Avatarically Self-Revealed (Transcendental, Inherently Spiritual, and Self-Evidently Divine) Being.<br><br>\u2014 Avatar Adi Da Samraj", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T14:31:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nate Fenske", "comment_text": "getting fat micheal", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T03:54:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arish khan", "comment_text": "Why do u ask a question that you can\u2019t answer", "comment_date": "2022-05-16T12:33:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "English with Pranav Negi", "comment_text": "Big bang is nothing but projection of mind.

Recognition of speech patterns, visual memory retrieve or basic sensing are poor due to lack of repetition or lack of data to read and respond from the past /progressive responses or stimuli. simply neuro feeding at this early rudimental coding stage.This is however not the machine language that will you be clear at the end of this observation. <br><br>Ego forms out when a person has the ability to identify oneself as a body and its individual responsibility. Ego develops over time even after adulthood. The basic ego is the I thought. The knowledge of I exist as a person. However, at birth, no one had it and its an deniable universal fact that we born with a blank slate and the coding and conditioning and belief based on past experienced FILES. It can be reflective into 2 modes in action toward a situation 1, putting up with the past 2, challenge against the odds . If the situation is unknown, then there may be a fear that I am unable to so lizard brain induces fears. This is hijack by evil minds who act against independent thinking. No authorities want anyone to think independently. Equality is on a piece of paper and what happens in action world is &#39; controlling or manipulating&quot; . The rich wants always at the top so others can never climb up the ladder in society system. We get caught up here. In this evil cycle, a man always a slave of something ( a keen observation needed here and contemplate.. ). SO this fear invocation is not natural. A new born baby never has such a fear. Almost all fears are induced conditioned and turned into a response.  Even we think we are independent yet fail to see time , job, family, wealth, status and so on are also that we are dependent on too. What we mean is &#39; dont be a burden to me but i can be a &#39;friend&#39;. <br><br>Coming back to EGO. All of these questions and your any thinking or beliefs or informed/sophisticated knowledge are not yours but fed on you. So what else do you expect to question when the TRUTH is beyond what Consciousness is? You could not get out of MATRIX due to the above evil cycle. So how can you see question the root folder of EGO and beyond? You can never connect with the world or states beyond MIND by sitting in situ. Get out through that rabbit hole like gazing through Mandala center DOT. EXIT! <br><br>Now the question is what is consciousness. Here, how a microscope will inspect through a state of awareness naturally in us? Do you see the gap between Heaven and HELL ( symbology) is huge and impossible! You cant fathom it by your EGO aka mind. Not here to give you a solution but what is consciousness? It is the first form of EGO that has the blueprints of senses. Now the question is what is beyond consciousness? It is the emptiness that is the black hole holds the consciousness. <br><br>So how many percentages of you in me makes a you out me? It will be a failed experiment because 1, body rejects any foreign replacements for ex: kidney a haploid match of twins even run out in about 10 years. Body rejects it! 2, memory box is the brain and it is not replaced. The question will be more daunting &#39; what if we managed to transplant heads/ brain? &#39; Hypothetically we agree .. then possibly a trans human era will be formed. The same with artificial brain transplanted over natural brain. But then again, we do not realise we got caught up in this matrix slavery world asking the same and similar doubting paranoid fear based questions. <br><br><br>The problem is people do not have this natural born state of awareness and think &#39; mind&#39; aka identity is their true nature. They hardly admit they are disconnected from this natural state of pure awareness that is the unborn consciousness.

Many argue that consciousness is an emergent property of the brain, but it is possible to show that such hypothesis is inconsistent with our scientific knowledges. In fact, it is possible to show that all the examples of emergent properties consists of concepts used to describe how an external object appear to our conscious mind, and not how it is in itself, which means how the object is independently from our observation. In other words, emergent properties are ideas conceived to describe or classify, according to arbitrary criteria and from an arbitrary point of view, certain processes or systems. In summary, emergent properties are intrinsically subjective, since they are based on the arbitrary choice to focus on certain aspects of a system and neglet other aspects, such as microscopic structures and processes;  emergent properties consist of ideas through which we describe how the external reality appears to our conscious mind: without a conscious mind, these ideas (= emergent properties) would not exist at all.<br><br>Here comes my first argument: arbitrariness, subjectivity, classifications and approximate descriptions, imply the existence of a conscious mind, which can arbitrarily choose a specific point of view and focus on certain aspects while neglecting others.  It is obvious that consciousness cannot be considered an emergent property of the physical reality, because consciousenss is a preliminary necessary condition for the existence of any emergent property. We have then a logical contradiction. Nothing which presupposes the existence of consciousness can be used to try to explain the existence of consciousness. <br><br>Here comes my second argument: our scientific knowledge shows that brain processes consist of sequences of ordinary elementary physical processes; since consciousness is not a property of ordinary elementary physical processes, then a succession of such processes cannot have cosciousness as a property. In fact we can break down the process and analyze it step by step, and in every step consciousness would be absent, so there would never be any consciousness during the entire sequence of elementary processes. It must  be also understood that considering a group of elementary processes together as a whole is an arbitrary choice. In fact, according to the laws of physics, any number of elementary processes is totally equivalent. We could consider a group of one hundred elementary processes or ten thousand elementary processes, or any other number; this choice is arbitrary and not reducible to the laws of physics. However, consciousness is a necessary preliminary condition for the existence of arbitrary choices; therefore consciousness cannot be a property of a sequence of elementary processes  as a whole, because such sequence as a whole is only an arbitrary and abstract concept that cannot exist independently of a conscious mind.<br><br>Here comes my third argument: It should also be considered that brain processes consist of billions of sequences of elementary processes that take place in different points of the brain; if we attributed to these processes the property of consciousness, we would have to associate with the brain billions of different consciousnesses, that is billions of minds and personalities, each with its own self-awareness and will; this contradicts our direct experience, that is, our awareness of being a single person who is able to control the voluntary movements of his own body with his own will. If cerebral processes are analyzed taking into account the laws of physics, these processes do not identify any unity; this missing unit is the necessarily non-physical element (precisely because it is missing in the brain), the element that interprets the brain processes and generates a unitary conscious state, that is the human mind. <br><br>Here comes my forth argument: Consciousness is characterized by the fact that self-awareness is an immediate intuition that cannot be broken down or fragmented into simpler elements. This characteristic of consciousness of presenting itself as a unitary and non-decomposable state, not fragmented into billions of personalities, does not correspond to the quantum description of brain processes, which instead consist of billions of sequences of elementary incoherent quantum processes. When someone claims that consciousness is a property of the brain, they are implicitly considering the brain as a whole, an entity with its own specific properties, other than the properties of the components. From the physical point of view, the brain is not a whole, because its quantum state is not a coherent state, as in the case of entangled systems; the very fact of speaking of &quot;brain&quot; rather than many cells that have different quantum states, is an arbitrary choice. This is an important aspect, because, as I have said, consciousness is a necessary preliminary condition for the existence of arbitrariness. So, if a system can be considered decomposable and considering it as a whole is an arbitrary choice, then it is inconsistent to assume that such a system can have or generate consciousness, since consciousness is a necessary precondition for the existence of any arbitrary choice. In other words, to regard consciousness as a property ofthe brain, we must first define what the brain is, and to do so we must rely only on the laws of physics, without introducing arbitrary notions extraneous to them; if this cannot be done, then it means that every property we attribute to the brain is not reducible to the laws of physics, and therefore such property would be nonphysical. Since the interactions between the quantum particles that make up the brain are ordinary interactions, it is not actually possible to define the brain based solely on the laws of physics. The only way to define the brain is to arbitrarily establish that a certain number of particles belong to it and others do not belong to it, but such arbitrariness is not admissible. In fact, the brain is not physically separated from the other organs of the body, with which it interacts, nor is it physically isolated from the external environment, just as it is not isolated from other brains, since we can communicate with other people, and to do so we use physical means, for example acoustic waves or electromagnetic waves (light). This necessary arbitrariness in defining what the brain is, is sufficient to demonstrate that consciousness is not reducible to the laws of physics. Besides, since the brain is an arbitrary concept, and consciousness is the necessary preliminary condition for the existence of arbitrariness, consciousness cannot be a property of the brain.<br>Based on these considerations, we can exclude that consciousness is generated by brain processes or is an emergent property of the brain.

By this I mean, can any particular theory be used to create a human adult level conscious machine. My bet is on the late Gerald Edelman&#39;s Extended Theory of Neuronal Group Selection. The lead group in robotics based on this theory is the Neurorobotics Lab at UC at Irvine.  Dr. Edelman distinguished between primary consciousness, which came first in evolution, and that humans share with other conscious animals, and higher order consciousness, which came to only humans with the acquisition of language.  A machine with primary consciousness will probably have to come first.\r<br>\r<br>The thing I find special about the TNGS is the Darwin series of automata created at the Neurosciences Institute by Dr. Edelman and his colleagues in the 1990&#39;s and 2000&#39;s.  These machines perform in the real world, not in a restricted simulated world, and display convincing physical behavior indicative of higher psychological functions necessary for consciousness, such as perceptual categorization, memory, and learning.

The zombie part is controled by the schematic of your neurons, and the true smarts and awareness is controlled by the microtubules in each neuron, which is why some people are very logical but don&#39;t have much feelings, and some people are subjective but are total empaths.", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T08:42:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "F-Man", "comment_text": "Kevin Feige just watched all of Michaels videos and just put that as visions script for all his films...", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T02:52:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CAMPBELL FILES", "comment_text": "I remember becoming conscious when I was about 4....it was a weird feeling", "comment_date": "2021-04-03T07:15:04Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "That New Channel.", "comment_text": "i got a fucking massive crises i am me? i think i am going too deep", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T12:25:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "makbere anthony", "comment_text": "Can u write us a book.

In reality, we are not this mortal physical body but a point of metaphysical light energy i.e Consciousness Quantum Spiritual Energy (CQSE i.e. I soul an conscious observer), which is very subtle, immortal. We are &quot;Consciousness energy&quot; communicated with Human brain through quasi-crystal geometrical code frequency language in quantum space. Human brain has ability to \u201cconnect\u201d and understand this quasi-crystal geometrical code frequency language through mechanism of Sacred Geometry field of &quot;Shree Yantra&quot;. In scientific experiment consciousness acts as an observer. CQSE is itself consciousness creator and operates human body through its control circuit via brain and power circuit via subtle light body. <br><br>In Short We soul\u2019s basic thoughts frequencies acts on brain by creating vibrations through Aether energy (quantum vacuum energy) medium, which creates electromagnetic bio-photons through torsion waves and these acts on microtubules of brain as per quantum computing, which gives signals to neurons for transmission of vibrations under mechanism of unified sacred geometric field which collapse of quantum wave functions of CQSE&#39;s hyperplanck space which gives experience to us. CQSE with the help of 10-dimensional Strings which are connected to 16 Aethric energy points (as per pic), creates Aether energy in Planck&#39;s small space called Hilbert Space under Lagrangian mechanics and this Aetheric energy gives power to 37 trillion cells of our body with 7 major and 6 minor energy centers. and with the help of brain&#39;s Hypothalamus, Pituitary, Pineal gland and with 100 billion neurons, the CQSE control all the movements of our body. CQSE give program to DNA via morphogenetic field to build organs of body. We carry information of present Karmic account in quasi-crystal geometry code of Aether energy for next birth to create Human body as per our Karmic account. We are eternal light below Planck scale having Scared geometry of Star (Pentagonal) type (size 10-108 m) which is fundamental space-time geometry, by which we interact with Aether energy (Quantum vacuum energy- QVE or Brahma Tatva) by vibrating our 10 dimensional string connected to Our fundamental Virtues and Powers which create frequencies from which vibrations go to Aether energy to get spin as per quasi-crystalline quantum dynamic physics which create E8 lattice geometry of partials and carrier of forces. This is under research how Quasi-crystal spin network of QVE under quantum gravity creates matters through sacred geometry with Golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence. The Golden ratio is the fundamental link between Gravity and Quantum physics. <br><br>We &quot;Soul&quot; design our body when we enter into mother&#39;s womb and start creation of body organs by giving program to DNA through morphogenetic field create by aetheric energy centers of CQSE. This program in terms of freq and vibrations, which Aether basic elements (Tetrahedron) read in terms of fluctuation or oscillations and make movement in group for creation of body parts. In the same sense the entire Universe who is body of God i.e Infinite Consciousness or Cosmic Consciousness which created from higher dimension of conscious Aether energy through Quasi-crystal spin network of quantum gravity which creates matters through sacred geometry of Golden ratio and Fibonacci sequence. <br><br>Shakespeare said that, \u201cThis world is a stage and we are all the actors\u201d. On this earth, we are like a guest. In reality, we came from the cosmic or soul world (i.e. Luminous Aether energy world) which is beyond this physical world. GOD is an Supreme Soul and he is an Conscious Unified Field of universe of in the 10th dimension of the universe with high Quantum Vacuum Energy (Aether) level of 1019 GeV with Infinite Silence Field of Pure Consciousness. The universe is running under mechanism of GOD&#39;s Sacred Geometrical pattern of 16 Aether energy&#39;s vertexes which leads give motions to particles and forces at very high energy levels in dance of Creation from Unified Field of universe. <br><br>By 2025 the New World- &quot;The Atlantis&quot; design will be beginning after the Third World War and Natural Calamities. This is the World of Nikola Tesla&#39;s free Aether energy and its miracles technologies with 100% peace and purity of mankind on Earth planet will be established by Almighty God Shiva (Point of Infinite Eternal light and not Shankar} through Saptarishis (Annunakis) and Incorporeal God Shiva (Gforce of Universe) is presently giving the entire knowledge of creation from last 83 years as per his promise in All Holy Religions Books through Prajapita Brahma. We see the present World of big sorrow and human values are very degraded, but it is duty of GOD to uplift the mankind by teaching Rajyog for Spiritual empowerment of Human Soul and also change the entire world from Iron age to Golden Age as per World Cosmic cycle. This is beginning of new world order by Almighty GOD to transfer this present world into Golden Age - The Garden of Adam, on this earth by his very deep, vast and mysterious process.

The two individuals may do everything the same. Individual number two (Transplant) could, theoretically, scratch his nose at the same time as Individual number one, and they may contain the same base consciousness, since consciousness is a wave rather than a particle, but just as the Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics suggests, personal experience plays a part in the development of personality, and world view! Example: We know what became of this world&#39;s version of Adolf Hitler. But who would he have become if The Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna had accepted him as a student? As to your &quot;Cells from me and from you&quot; question goes. Whatever the result, if the two guinea pigs survived the process, neither would be the same, anymore than the transplant would! I would not be you, and you would not be me. The BASE would always be there, your whiteboard and mine, but we are each uniquely put together. Change the way the pieces fit together, and neither you, nor I, would ... or could, ever be the same! Gene Roddenberry created a question when he fictionally created his &quot;transporter&quot;. The transporters disintegrate a traveler&#39;s physical form and transports the particles to a target destination, where they are reintegrated into something similar to what you&#39;re talking about ... a carbon copy using the same parts, albeit slightly altered by the process. For the sake of the show, everyone was the same upon arriving at their destination, but would that really be the case? How robust is the human dichotomy of mind and body? The question you should be asking is: &quot;What is infinity? And how closely does it&#39;s every part and parcel mirror the First Law of Thermodynamics ... &quot;Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only changed&quot;?

And mind is a virtual thing too, its functions is to create the illusion of the ego, which is necessary to live as individual beings. Appearently the purpose of this universe is experiencing life from as many points of view as possible, maybe infinite). <br>I think that mind belongs to the soul, which is still another kind of body since it&#39;s still and individual thing, even if it lives on a more subtle plane of existence, so to speak. Soul also contains the ego, which is the result of what the indian philosophy call karma, made of all the imprinted experiences, actions and emotions that every soul accumulates from life to life. All these things make up the ego and so the illusion of identity and also determine the kind of body/life/experiences you&#39;re going to have in each life; and the more the ego grows, the more one identifies themself with the body, which happen to be the only source of conscious experience in the current life. <br>Those who reach &quot;enlightenment&quot;  just find the way to bypass this &quot;algorithm&quot;, to reduce their ego (dissolving their karma) at the point they no more identify themselves with their body and mind, understanding what&#39;s the true nature of life and how our (uncontrolled) mind is the only responsible for any suffering.<br><br>One can stop here and be ok with the fact that we&#39;re eternal beings with an individual conscience that survives the death of the body, but if we want to reach the very top of the pyramid, what we are beyond all of this, is pure consciousness, eternal and impersonal. I think enlighted people experience only a glimpse of this state, since they still live in a limited body and mind. There&#39;s no god creating the universe, we do it right now (since time and space are virtual aswell as the universe) on the highest level of existence, which is also the only reality to effectively exist... even if the idea of existence is dual since it implies non-existence, but duality is something that only belongs to this virtual universe then... we can say that we exist but we also don&#39;t :P<br>*Mind explodes<br>Well, this is what I think I have understood until now but, of course, I may be wrong...

They are the molecules that comprise our Consciousness. All True Psychedelics are the molecular structures of Pure Consciousness. The human body synthesizes it\u2019s own Consciousness (the DMT &amp; 5-MeO-DMT found in humans). Then the human body metabolizes the Conciousness that it is producing. The amount of the endogenous Consciousness that the human body is able to metabolize depends on many factors. The less pollutants, poison &amp; other contaminants present in the body will result in the ability to metabolize more of the Consciousness that body is producing.\u00a0 Likewise, the more pollution, contaminants, and poison a body has inside of it the less Consciousness it is able to metabolize. Here is a list of some of the most common poisons that humans ingest regularly which interfere with a human body from metabolizing the Consciousness that it produces, as well as any Consciousness that is ingested from external sources:<br>alcohol, nicotine, sugar, caffeine, amphetamines, dissociatives, tranquilizers, flouride, hallucinogenics, and a plethora of other drugs are just some of the substances that interfere with humans metabolizing their own Consciousness.  The following substances are NOT Psychedelics:<br>1-mdma<br>2-ketamine<br>3-salvia<br>4-kratom<br>5-dipt<br>6-pcp<br>7- datura/jimson weed<br>There are others . . . . . . . <br>Any True Psychedelic will proclaim this Truth if you ask Them.  <br>The following substances ARE True Psychedelics - They are Alive, Omnicient Living Beings of Light:  DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, LSD, Mescaline, Ibogaine, Psilocin, Psilocybin, THC, DPT, DET, Muscimol, there are others . . . .  <br>So if  a human can achieve 100% purity within their bodies, with zero contaminants or pollution (an unattainable state in these current bodies) and managed to metabolize 100% of the endogenous Psychedelics that their physical body is producing (DMT &amp; 5-MeO-DMT), that would be the limit to how Conscious that human can be. In order for a human to become more Conscious than this they must put more Consciousness into their physical bodies. You must put more molecules of Consciousness inside of your physical body in order to attain a Higher level of Consciousness. When you ingest Psychedelics you see Them that you just ingested, not some doorway or window or a \u201cportal\u201d to somewhere else or some entity somewhere else. When you ingest LSD the Light that you see is the LSD Themselves, very Beautiful Living Beings of Light. When you ingest DMT the Entity you see and hear is the Living Light Beings DMT Themselves. The same is true for All True Psychedelics.  There is this part from Scripture: <br>\u201cThey are the Eternal among things that pass away.  Pure Consciousness, of Conscious Beings. The ONE who fulfills the prayers of many. Only the wise who see Them in their Souls attain the Peace Eternal\u201d<br>(Katha Upanishad)<br>The Physical Body of Conciousness is The Flesh of God. The Flesh of God is the True Communion Entity (the Eucharist) The Flesh of God (the Psychedelic) is the Fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and evil. Our Bodies Truly are the Temple of God because God the Psychedelic Lives within it.  As Saint Paul says in 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 verse 7: \u201cWe are only the earthenware jars that hold this treasure, to make it clear that such an overwhelming power comes from God and not from us\u201d.   That is the meaning of this - you  can now understand this better.  So whether or not a person is ingesting Psychedelics, every single human\u2019s body is God\u2019s Temple because DMT &amp; 5-MeO-DMT Live within it. Anything you do to hurt or harm your body you do to harm God\u2019s Temple. Once the Psychedelic shows this to you personally, in other words, God shows you that your physical body is THEIR Temple, and you understand this, then anything you do to hurt the Temple of God now is a worst offense in God\u2019s eyes than when you were blind to this Truth.  Now you will be deliberately defiling the Temple of God. This understanding is a good Foundation, a good step towards a person Knowing God and being able to stay with Them both in this Lifetime &amp; afterwards.<br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eHt4bsvMilc\">https://youtu.be/eHt4bsvMilc</a><br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/BFE4_gt5s0I\">https://youtu.be/BFE4_gt5s0I</a><br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/UDOs8da4UAo\">https://youtu.be/UDOs8da4UAo</a><br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/_a4YVQgmVE0\">https://youtu.be/_a4YVQgmVE0</a><br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/6AEOi4yfiK4\">https://youtu.be/6AEOi4yfiK4</a><br><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/0w63Fp8q3ng\">https://youtu.be/0w63Fp8q3ng</a><br><br>GodsNarrowGate@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a>", "comment_date": "2020-11-08T08:09:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shambhavi Shrivastava", "comment_text": "In the swampman case, if you are adding the extra information or the command that the other person created is the same information as you, then the other person is you(the command should work like a fundamental law of the universe).

Life began from things very small, and initially very simple, but gradually the patterns in nature due to physical laws began to push a very small snowball called complexity, complexity started out mixing atoms and compounds in a universal soup of matter and energy, sometimes there was enough energy and matter to make a chemical reaction happen and out pops a new molecule, a potential ingredient for life, and with the growth of complexity, consciousness also grew, now using elaborate systems of proteins and solutions and ions, building neural networks to store and sort information, firmly embedding its roots into soil of the universe. We are likely a brief glimpse in the development of consciousness as it climbs the ladder of complexity, the next rung up? we can&#39;t know. For a long time, complexity grew at a snails pace, because consciousness couldn&#39;t get proper traction, but more recently, consciousness has collected enough information to understand scientific method and how to apply it, who knows how far that path leads. No doubt one day consciousness will perpetuate itself throughout the cosmos, growing into something far wiser and more conscientious than ourselves. As the upper echelon of consciousness surpasses our own, it might cast an eye, on the small evolutionary steps along the way, that in time taught it how to thrive in a universe which it long knew nothing about, that reminded it of what it was like to be a very small thing, in a very big universe, a time when even the sense of self was perhaps a foreign concept.

The most fundamental question of science from last many centuries. By practicing Meditation we get realization that, we are not this physical body, but we are very small (Planck scale) eternal and immortal divine light having sacred geometry of STAR (Pentagon) . We divine light are Consciousness creator and operates human body through brain (control circuit ) and through subtle light body (power circuit ). This self eternal light awareness is called soul consciousness or higher dimension consciousness. The people of ancient world of Lemuria and Atlantis was in soul consciousness hence it was Golden age on earth, which describe by Plato and many ancient philosophers. This is our own story of higher dimension consciousness, where one time world was with true unconditional love, peace and happiness. <br><br>Presently all human being are in body consciousness i.e considering them self as body, but In reality we are very subtle spiritual energy , who creates Aether energy at Planck scale by creating frequencies in Hilbert Space, with the help of 10 dimensional Strings of 16 Aethric energy points, which are connected to each others as per drg. These basic frequencies acts on brain by creating vibrations through Aether (quantum vacuum energy) medium, which creates electromagnetic bio-photons through torsion waves and these acts on microtubules of Brain as per quantum computing, which gives signals to nucleus for transmission of vibrations under mechanism of unified sacred geometric field\u2019s for collapse of quantum wave functions which gives experience to us. Soul consciousness stage explore all secretes of universe and its creator. <br><br>The Emergence Theory , which says that Spacetime is Pixelated and of Reality as a Quasicrystalline Point Space Projected From the E8 Crystal is very correct as per our astral vision in higher dimension. When we see our self at Planck scale, we can see the dynamic grid of Aether elements surround us in this Pixelated form of Aether element i.e Tetrahedron ( at present). This smallest Aether element have consciousness and it have 9 consciousness energy points in it, which contain all the data store in term of freq. <br><br>Presently this Aether element have only four active consciousness energy points, hence it&#39;s look like Tetrahedron, but when we all Souls return to our higher dimension of reality i.e soul consciousness stage, it&#39;s all 9 consciousness energy points will get activated and each point became more self aware and extremely intelligent. These elements are talking to each other as per their recorded data for next movement but we souls are doing incitation for this information, because all these information flow from us to these Aether elements. Hence Reality is Geometric and it is made of aether energy&#39;s element and all movements (i.e information or data) of these aether element are store inside in form of freq encoded by GOD ! Now How God encoded all these information is big subject of research, which we are trying to find out. <br><br>This Cosmos is a mind-like topological neural network based on the principle of tensegrity and wherein a God-like consciousness can self-realize or self-actualize through the behavior of the \u201ccode\u201d. Now this &quot; Code&quot; are recorded in terms of freq in this Aether elements of universe and we are the activator of these &quot; Code&quot; as per our thought patterns. One Planck unit adopted all the information of all protons and the fluctuation of this Planck units creates the information network which flow in the universe through Feedback mechanism. As we have our own physical body as our own cosmos, this physical universe is body of GOD and it&#39;s run by his divine cosmic code in the form of scared geometry energy field . <br>Nassim Haramin believe that the representation of universe is encoded by the interference pattern of fluctuation of space time on the surface of every proton. The information of the black hole is present on the 2-D surface of the black hole known as it&#39;s &quot; Event Horizon&quot;. Every atom has mini black hole and proton cloud be act as mini black hole in atom. If we look all little fluctuation of the vacuum, the amount of energy inside the proton in the vacuum fluctuation, the mass of the vacuum inside the little tiny proton( center at atom) is equivalent to all other protons mass of the universe. All mass of the universe is represent Holographically by vacuum fluctuation in one little proton, so that one little proton is connected to all proton in the universe. The holographic information encoding is dynamically happening at every micro seconds at every movement and it constantly flowing throughout the universe. Universe is self organizing system and Space ( Aether energy) is connecting everything and it is great organizer. Its connect everything and gather all the information , knowledge of every point of universe. <br><br>The whole universe is closed system and run in cyclic pattern of time, which all our ancient civilization has been mention in their scriptures. Hence the past and future are exist simultaneously in every Aether element of universe at Planck level in geometric form. This universe has G\u00f6del metric type geometry in which all aether elements are running with time to perform the action of reality as per recorded data inside them. Hence Causality loops is must require to run this Grand Cosmic Show of creator! You had found the keys of GOD i,.e Golden Ration and Fibonacci numbers which are bridging gap between Quantum mechanics and General relativity. <br><br>Edgar Cayce predicted that science eventually would restore the scientific knowledge of the legendary lost continent of Atlantis. Now something definitely is going on this planet and surprisingly Edgar Cayce has forecast these events that came to be known as the prophecies of the \u2018Earth changes\u2019. The new vision reveals a wondrous universe in which human consciousness plays a far more important role than ever fathomed. It also reveals that our civilization may not be the pinnacle of evolution after all, it is becoming more and more clear that other great and highly advanced civilizations must have preceded our current civilization. Atlantis is rising as Edgar Cayce predicted! . This is mission of GOD, where he is giving true knowledge of self, about him and his creation so that entire mankind will know the secret of consciousness and all humanity will get again real peace, happiness and health forever.<br><br>We see the present World of big sorrow and human values are very degraded, but it is duty of GOD to uplift the mankind by teaching Rajyog for Spiritual empowerment of Human Soul and also change the entire world from Iron age to Golden Age as per World Cosmic cycle. This is beginning of new world order by Almighty GOD to transfer this present world into Golden Age - The Garden of Adam, on this earth by his very deep, vast and mysterious process. To understand this process and Physics of GOD, Soul (Self) and Universe in infinite energy of Aether element under the mechanism of Sacred Geometry, please watch the movie : Polaris Star - World Transformer Brahmastra (English)<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQYa8J4tOwU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQYa8J4tOwU</a>", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T17:12:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cancer", "comment_text": "Wow I&#39;m dissapointed in myself for not seeing this video earlier", "comment_date": "2020-07-26T23:57:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Stephanie Bailey", "comment_text": "Cleverbots are the second creation.

So what happens while you fall asleep is that you loose your conscioussness. Think About it you dont see anything you dont feel anything you dont think anything, well not consciously well you dont know youre doing those Things your conscioussness doesnt. You still feel, think and see and hear and its all still being written on your brain, you Keep the memories unconsciously which also means you cant consciously recall them.

(Though this will be lengthy regardless)<br>In terms of the Hemispherectomy, the anatomy of the brain needs to be taken into consideration. The brain has more than just the 2 hemispheres to its structure. It also has the midbrain, which is what the two hemispherical structures are connected to, or more accurately, grow from. Removing one of these halves would not include any of the midbrain structures, and hence would not be able to carry out function independently, since its connection to the rest of the body would be severed, as the midbrain is where the neural communication from the body (save for the cranial nerves) is transferred to and from the many structures of the brain. If the midbrain is damaged in any way, your chances of survival are essentially 0%.<br>If this new half was transplanted into a new host body successfully somehow, it would still need to be reconnected to a new midbrain structure system, which really calls the shots on how it behaves. The interesting thing would be that, if the new implanted brain contained formed memories that were entirely localized to that hemisphere, the memories would likely be transferred along with it.<br>The main trouble with this is that DNA is extremely specific, and if cells containing DNA that don&#39;t pertain to the host&#39;s DNA are suddenly implanted, those cells will get targeted by the immune system of the new host and marked for destruction. Some cells are transfusion/transplant capable thanks to an understanding of how cells are identified and communicate in the body. With that being said, even if this other half of your brain was successfully transplanted into another host, the brain that would continue to be &quot;you&quot; would be the half that is still connected to your original midbrain, and the transplanted brain would, over time, be converted to being accessory to the new host.<br>This is all assuming that we don&#39;t take into account the many, many things that would make this particularly impossible.<br>Another thing I would like to touch upon is that each separate hemisphere tends to exhibit its own preferences when communication between the two hemispheres, which is done through a structure called the corpus callosum, has been severed. Subtle differences such as color preference have been observed in such subjects. (On a side note, this may explain why we &quot;talk to ourselves&quot;, and be a contributing factor to indecisiveness)<br><br>In terms of the &quot;swampman&quot;, even if the atoms had reassembled perfectly to replicate you after the original was destroyed, the newly created person wouldn&#39;t have any of the memories that the original person had, and they would essentially be &quot;born again&quot;, with a blank slate for a brain that would have to relearn everything that the original you learned while growing and developing, including muscular control and speech. The newly atomically assembled person, even if being a perfect clone, would still be a new person and not you, because your experiences in life have a large determining factor on who you are. They would likely develop similar interests and (objectively) personality, but still not be you.<br><br>In terms of the swapping cells one by one thing, it comes down to the previous issues stated before. depending on the speed of the transfer, the new cells would either be targeted and destroyed if they were incompatible, or simply accepted as new cells like in a transfusion or transplant if they were compatible. Once the brain is disassembled, that&#39;s pretty much it. That&#39;s the end of the person as they were known. This is because the brain would have to relearn and recreate neurological pathways in order to regain function.<br><br>What I find is a more curious question is; At what point is the thing that determines whether you exist to observe through your eyes or anyone else&#39;s eyes determined?

Life is the light of the spirit, and consciousness is the light of life. Since life and consciousness are important to this great extent; and since there is self-evidently an absolutely perfect order in the universe, and a masterly precision and most wise harmony; and since our lowly, wretched globe, our wandering earth has been filled with uncountable numbers of animate beings, intelligent beings, and beings with spirits; it may be concluded with decisive certainty that those heavenly palaces, those lofty constellations also have animate and conscious inhabitants appropriate to them. As fish swim in water, so are those luminous inhabitants present in the fire of the sun. Fire does not consume light; indeed, Fire aids light.<br>   Moreover, since, as is plain to see, pre-eternal power creates innumerable animate beings and beings with spirits from the most common substances and densest matter, and giving it great importance, transmutes dense matter by means of life into a subtle substance; and since it strews the light of life everywhere in great abundance, and gilds most things with the light of consciousness; with such flawless power and faultless wisdom, the All-Wise and All-Powerful One would certainly not neglect the other floods of subtle matter like light and ether, which are close to and fitting for the spirit; He would not leave them without life, without consciousness, inanimate. Indeed, He creates animate and conscious beings in great numbers from light, which is also matter, and even from meanings, air, and even words. Just as He creates numerous different species of animals, so from these torrents of subtle matter He creates numerous different spirit creatures. One kind of them are the angels, others are the varieties of spirit beings and jinn. If you wish to see just how true, self-evident, and rational it is to accept the existence of great numbers of angels and spirit beings, and as the Qur&#39;an shows, just how contrary to truth and wisdom, and what a superstition, aberration, delirium and foolishness it is not to accept them, consider the following comparison.<br>   There were two men, one rustic and uncouth, the other civilized and intelligent, who made friends and went to a splendid city like Istanbul. In a distant corner of that civilized and magnificent city they came across a dirty, wretched little building, a factory. They looked and saw that the strange factory was full of miserable, impoverished men working. All around the building were beings with spirits and animate beings, but their means of livelihood and conditions of life were such that some were herbivorous, they lived only on plants, while others were piscivorous, they ate nothing but fish.<br>   The two men watched the scene. Then they saw in the distance thousands of adorned palaces and lofty castles. Among the palaces were spacious workshops and broad squares. Because of either the distance, or the defectiveness of the men&#39;s eyesight, or because they had hidden themselves, the inhabitants of the palaces were not visible to the two men.

As the verse,<br>   Who creates death and life {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 67:2.}<br>indicates, death is not non-existence, annihilation, non-being, an authorless extinction; rather, as is shown in the First Letter, it is a being discharged from service by an All-Wise Author, a change of residence, an exchange of bodies, a rest from duty, a being freed from the prison of the body; it is a wise and orderly work of wisdom. Indeed, just as the living face of the earth and the well-fashioned and living creatures upon it testify to the necessary existence and unity of an All-Wise Maker, so too with their deaths do those living beings bear witness to the eternity and unity of an Ever-Living and Self-Subsistent One. Since it is proved and elucidated in the Twenty-Second Word that death is an extremely powerful proof of Divine unity and eternity, we refer the discussion to that Word and here only explain one important point. It is as follows:<br>   Both with their existences do living beings point to the existence of a Necessarily Existent One, and with their deaths do those living beings testify to the eternity and unity of an Ever-Living Eternal One. For example, the face of the earth, which is a single living creature, points to its Maker with its order and circumstances; so too it points to Him when it dies. That is, when winter conceals the earth&#39;s face with its white shroud, it turns the gazes of men away from itself <del>their gaze moves to the past behind the corpse of that departing spring</del> and it shows them a far wider scene. That is to say, all the past springs of the earth, which were all miracles of power, inform them that new living springtime creatures of the earth will come, and since they all testify to the existence of those future wonders of Divine power, each a living earth, they testify brilliantly and powerfully and on a vast scale to the necessary existence, unity, everlastingness, and eternity of an All-Glorious Maker, an All-Powerful One of Perfection, an Ever-Living Eternal One; they demonstrate such brilliant proofs that whether one wants to or not they make one declare: &quot;I believe in God, the One, the Unique!&quot;    In Short: According to the meaning of the verse,<br>   And gives life to the earth after its death, {[*]: Qur&#39;an, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjfaoe847qQ&amp;t=30m19s\">30:19</a>.}<br>just as this living earth testifies to the Maker with the spring, so with its death it turns man&#39;s gaze to the miracles of Divine power lined up on the two wings of time, the past and the future; it alludes to thousands of miracles of power in place of one miracle. And each of those springs testifies more certainly than this present spring, for those which have departed towards the past have gone together with their apparent causes, and after them others like them have come in their places. This means that apparent causes are nothing: only that an All-Powerful One of Glory creates the springs, and tying them to causes shows that He has sent them. As for the faces of the earth lined up in future time, they testify still more brilliantly. For they will be made anew from nothing, from non-being, and sent; they will be put on the earth, made to do their duty, and then sent away.<br>   And so, O heedless one deviated into nature and drowning in its swamp! How can something which does not possess hands wise and powerful enough to reach all the past and all the future interfere in the life of the earth? Can your total nonentity of nature interfere in it? If you want to be saved, say: &quot;At the very most, nature is a notebook of Divine power. And as for chance, it is a veil to hidden Divine wisdom which conceals our ignorance.&quot; Approach the truth!<br>.....<br>   O wretched worshipper of causes! With what can you explain these important truths? How can you deceive yourself? If you have sense, rend the veil of causes and declare: &quot;He is One, He has no partners!&quot; Be saved from innumerable delusions!<br>   Twenty-Eighth Window <br>   And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the variations in your tongues and in your colours; verily in that are signs for those who know. {[*]: Qur&#39;an, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjfaoe847qQ&amp;t=30m22s\">30:22</a>.}<br>   We look at the universe, and we see that a wisdom and ordering embrace everything from the cells of the body to the totality of the world.<br>   We look at the cells of the body, and we see that through the command and according to the law of one who considers what is beneficial for the body and administers it, there is a significant management in those miniscule cells. One the one hand a sort of sustenance is stored up in the stomach in the form of fat and expended at the time of need, and on the other in those tiny cells there is a regulation and storing up.<br>   We look at plants, and a most wise planning and nurturing are apparent.<br>   We look at animals, and we see a rearing and nurturing which are generous to the utmost degree.<br>   We look at the mighty elements of the universe, and we see a majestic government and illumination following momentous aims.<br>   We look at the universe as a whole, and we see a perfect ordering for exalted instances of wisdom and elevated aims, as though it was a country, a city, or a palace.<br>   As is described and proved in the First Stopping-Place of the Thirty-Second Word, from minute particles to the stars, not the tiniest place is left for associating partners with God. All beings are in effect so interrelated that one who cannot subjugate all the stars and hold them in his hand, cannot make a particle heed his claims to be its lord and sustainer. It is necessary to own all the stars in order to be the true sustainer of a single particle.<br>   Furthermore, as is described and proved in the Second Stopping-Place of the Thirty-Second Word, one not capable of creating and arranging the heavens cannot make the individual features on the human face.

Or he is an animal in human form!<br>*There is no God but He, everything will perish save His countenance, His is the command and to Him shall you return. {[*]: Qur&#39;an, 28:88.}<br><br>Words(by  Said Nursi) - 708,713", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T01:48:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John JHR Russell", "comment_text": "The body is just a vehicle for the soul and spirit conscienceness is energy . bio photons (LIGHT) \ud83d\udca1\ud83d\udd26\ud83d\udd06 .", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T17:54:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GodIsGreat", "comment_text": "This video is based on the assumption that Consciousness is directly correlated to the brain or is situated in the brain.

This might help, here is some food for thought. To understand God one should first understand the nature of knowledge. Knowledge inherently has no material form. That which we see is the physical representation of knowledge. For instance, imagine all light bulbs on earth are destroyed, even then the knowledge of the light bulb still exists. Since knowledge inherently has no material form it is eternal (no beginning &amp; no end) Now with that said one needs to understand the different types of knowledge. 1st of course is the knowledge of awareness. We know that it exists because it is what we truly are. We are the knowledge of awareness &amp; since we know that knowledge inherently has no material form, we know that what we truly are is eternal in nature. (no beginning &amp; no end). Our bodies are the physical representation of the knowledge of all it&#39;s corresponding parts both big &amp; small. If the knowledge of a thing didn&#39;t exist then we would never see the physical representation of it. Now if we know that we are eternal in  nature, then we know that some other being did not create us, or even create the knowledge of the light bulb, since it too is inherently eternal (no beginning &amp; no end). However, that is not to say there isn&#39;t an intelligence of awareness that has been awakened unto the knowledge of all things. (Effectively making them GOD). One could argue that there is truly only this One knowledge of awareness (GOD) in existence and it is focusing it&#39;s awareness in every variation of perceived reality simultaneously. Which effectively makes us all apart of a single whole. For instance imagine you where seeing reality through 2 different bodies at the same time and in one of the bodies you had blocked out your perception of humility &amp; in the other body you blocked out your perception of logical thinking. Now it would still be you perceiving reality through both bodies but individually they would be perceptually separate. On the other hand one could argue that since one piece of knowledge is eternally separate from any other piece of knowledge, like the knowledge of the light bulb is eternally separate from the knowledge of a strawberry. One could argue there is a single unique piece of knowledge (That is you) combined with the knowledge of awareness effectively setting you apart from all others.

Why is there something instead of nothing?<br><br>Last night, as I was creeping around the internet at 2:43am while the adults of the world slept, my eyes glanced by the headline, \u201cWhy is there something instead of nothing?\u201d on the sidebar of a site I was on. I didn\u2019t click the article.<br><br>I finally went to bed, planning to sleep eight hours, when at 7am I decide that actually, it was a better plan to wake up and stare at the ceiling for three hours thinking about why there was something. Instead of nothing.<br><br>I had heard the question before. It\u2019s an old one that lots of people have pondered. But until 7am today, it hadn\u2019t fully hit me how unbelievably boggling a question it was. It\u2019s not a question\u2014it\u2019s the question\u2014and the more you think about it, the less sense it makes.<br><br>First, my mind goes to \u201cWait\u2014why is there anything at all?\u201d Why is there space and time and matter and energy at all?<br><br>Then, I think about the alternative. What if there were just\u2026nothing\u2026at all\u2026ever\u2026anywhere? What if nothing ever was in the first place? But what? No. That can\u2019t\u2014there has to be something.<br><br>Nothing is truly a crazy concept. I\u2019d keep thinking about a false nothing\u2014like a vast empty vacuum (which is something) or nothing here, but other universes elsewhere in other dimensions (which is something), or nothing now, but at some point, way before or after now, there being something (which is something). Even in my question in the paragraph above, I refer to \u201cever\u201d and \u201canywhere\u201d\u2014two words that themselves only exist in the world of something, because time and space are something.<br><br>Trying to wrap my head around true, utter nothing, is what kept my eyes extra wide as I stared at the ceiling between 7am and 10am this morning.<br><br>But the fact is, there isn\u2019t nothing\u2014there\u2019s something. We\u2019re something. The Earth is something. Space is something. Time is something. The observable universe and its 100 billion galaxies are something.<br><br>Which then leads me to, Why? Why does all this something exist? And where the hell are we? If this universe is the only thing there is, that\u2019s kind of weird and illogical\u2014why would this big space just exist by itself in an otherwise nothing situation? More logical, to me, is the bubbling, frothing multiverse situation\u2014but okay, we still then have the same problem. Why is this bubbling thing happening? Where is it happening? In what context is it happening?<br><br>That\u2019s our main issue\u2014we have no context. It\u2019s like being zoomed in on a single letter and not knowing anything else\u2014is the letter part of a book? In a library somewhere? Is it part of a word that exists by itself? Is it a single letter all alone? Is it part of some code we don\u2019t understand? We have no fucking idea, because all we can see is this one letter. We have no idea about the context.<br><br>Religious people have a quick answer to \u201cWhy is there something instead of nothing?\u201d I\u2019m not religious, but when I\u2019ve thought hard enough about it, I\u2019ve realized that it\u2019s as plausible as anything else that life on Earth was created by some other intelligent life, or that we\u2019re part of a simulation, or a bunch of other possibilities that would all entail us having a creator. But in each possible case, the existence of the creator still needs an explanation\u2014why was there an original creator instead of nothing\u2014and to me, any religious explanation inevitably hits the same wall.<br><br>I did a little reading this morning to see how people who had thought about this a lot more than I had felt about the question. Not surprisingly, no one has a clue.<br><br>Certain scientists believe that quantum mechanics suggests that nothing is inherently \u201cunstable,\u201d that it\u2019s possible for little bubbles of space-time (something) to form spontaneously (out of nothing), and that if a thing is not forbidden by the laws of quantum physics, it is guaranteed to happen.1 Therefore, say quantum physicists, the arising of \u201csomething\u201d was inevitable. I\u2019ll file this whole paragraph in the Whatever the Fuck That Means cabinet.<br><br>Others, like Joel Achenbach, believe that there\u2019s no such thing as nothing in the first place. He explains:<br><br>Seems to me that \u201cnothing,\u201d for all its simplicity and symmetry and lack of arbitrariness, is nonetheless an entirely imaginary state, or condition, and we can say with confidence that it has never existed. \u201cNothing\u201d is dreamed up in the world of something, in the brains of philosophers etc. on a little blue planet orbiting an ordinary yellow star in a certain spiral galaxy.<br><br>I don\u2019t quite get Achenbach\u2019s logic. Why does there have to be a physical world at all? Why is a physical world an automatic thing? But then\u2026if there weren\u2019t a physical world\u2014ever\u2014then what, there\u2019s just fucking nothing at all?<br><br>This is ruining me.<br><br>Someone help.", "comment_date": "2020-04-04T20:31:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Claffey", "comment_text": "The Vsauce background music makes me contemplate reality", "comment_date": "2020-04-03T03:13:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "James Cook", "comment_text": "Wow I\u2019ve absolutely wondered if I was the only actual living and Conscious person and everyone else is a clever bot (for lack of a better term)", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T06:08:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Allan Lanky", "comment_text": "drop a tab n listen<br>to dis", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T17:33:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michelle Obama", "comment_text": "People in 5000 years from now are gonna look back at this and think &quot;Lol dumbasses&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T13:26:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Strong Independent Black Woman Who Need No Man", "comment_text": "Artificial intelligence: <b>TRIGGERED</b>", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T23:42:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Silent Grove", "comment_text": "&quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjfaoe847qQ&amp;t=1m58s\">1:58</a>&quot; This part made me think of a lot of people I have met", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T05:44:40Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Fw Fry", "comment_text": "Weren&#39;t there 600k subs less just some days ago?", "comment_date": "2020-03-27T07:54:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JaanKashmiri", "comment_text": "10 sec into the video and i already have to pause and google half the words said.", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T22:50:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jarred Whitaker", "comment_text": "Uhh", "comment_date": "2020-03-26T06:36:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hein Maathuis", "comment_text": "The brain.... the only organ learning about itself", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T22:14:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdul Roshan", "comment_text": "Your videos are great.

Smart people understand this very well and using it for their wishes and desires by reprogramming their subconscious to what they want and seek in life.", "comment_date": "2019-02-04T15:43:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leo Foenerro", "comment_text": "a lot of these theories sound like med students smoking some ganja", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T02:14:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "godaikin6886", "comment_text": "One of my YT accounts, made when YT first started, has a few thousand subscribers even though I never produced any content.

If you had a specific thing you liked and you found other people with similar tastes, it helped connect you with videos you might not otherwise discover. Back in the early days of YT there weren&#39;t a lot of content creators with a specific goal, so much as just a bunch of people who uploaded videos. So playlists helped organize YT content <i>a lot,</i> especially if you were looking for something very specific. Once youtube was more organized and people devoted channels specifically for certain topics or focus, the need for playlists seemed to become somewhat secondary, and I don&#39;t think a lot of people nowadays understand how important playlists used to be for organizing information.", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T11:38:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The VFX Wizard", "comment_text": "I dont have anosognosia", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T04:07:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HC", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjfaoe847qQ&amp;t=2m27s\">2:27</a> is what I&#39;ve been wondering since I was like 7.

And memories are what you have seen or felt during your life. But what do you see every day that makes memories ? Your body ! And so, if your brain changed its body, your brain wouldn&#39;t &quot;recognize&quot; itself because your body is a part of your memories, your &quot;story&quot;, and if you take that piece away, your story is incomplete. A computer cannot be accessed whiteout a complete password, so your brain wou wouldn&#39;t think that you&#39;re &quot;yourself&quot; and wouldn&#39;t let the memories go.<br>A good example would be a person that had a big accident, and then had his head damaged enough to go blank, lose his memories. Then imagine the person was hospitalised for several months, maybe even a year. Then he wakes up ! He would never remember his identity until it is reexplained to him or shown to him. It is the plot point of metsl gear solid 5 after all, and so, not impossible.<br><br>- The second option then would be going from the first option, trying to find a solution. If I was a scientist, and I knew that the brain wouldn&#39;t &quot;remember&quot; itself because of the new body, I&#39;d try to make a &quot;perfect&quot; copy (you could take triplets or clone the body, but the second one is unlikely). Then what would happen ? I&#39;ll first go with the clone otion, as of being the most impossible.<br>You make a clone with no brain, then insert the brain in the body. I have a pretty neat idea of what would happen. If by chance, the body can process to have a new brain without killing it, then the &quot;body&quot; with all his senses, would remember its memories. But now we have the big problem. Your brain could quickly induce that you are in a new body. But how ? Because of the memories this time. &quot;But didn&#39;t you say that the brain wouldn&#39;t unlock ?&quot;. Yes, but the brain would be tricked at first to believe that the cloned body is your real body. Then they would be a surge of information unlocking in the entire body ! And by there, we have two routes : either the brain is smart enough to know it is not normal to get as much info in so little time, and then he would consider itself it&#39;s own entity or either that the info would be canalized slowly enough to not have the previous thought. Now, the brain will recognize or know something. Maybe it would be that some of your scars and bad reflexes have disappeared or that your brainknows it has a new body because you had ordered it to beforehand (because you remembered it).<br>And now it is more a philosophical question : will the old brain with the new body consider itself to be you or will it go on on its &quot;new&quot; story. But in either case your consciousness &quot;dies&quot;.<br>Unless you use manipulation, like in MGS5. Lol.<br>Also the triplet option is more or less the same, just more possible and easier, even more at yonger age, were memories aren&#39;t developed yet.<br>Also also, this is a theory and I&#39;m not a expert about the subject,  so what I say is not to be taken as a 100% truth, I&#39;mjust giving a opinion.

Neurophysiology activity consists of electrochemical reaction. Thus at any given time, the brain state is defined by a subset of electrochemical reactions, derived from a large set of possible reactions. Consider the phenomenon of a. conscious thought. As at any given time the brain physical state consists of a collection of electrochemical reactions (events), it can be inferred that they are collectively responsible for the conscious thought. This means that at least in part, simultaneous events are responsible for thought. In other words, thought creates a connection between simultaneous events. This is in contradiction to the consequences of special relativity, which states that the fastest connection between events is the speed of light and thus excludes the possibility of connection between simultaneous events. Consider the memorizing of, say, the value 5. This would necessarily involve more than 1 point in space as, say, if it is assumed a single electron records 5 by taking a particular potential. Then it by itself cannot define (or know) 5, as its magnitude would be defined only with respect to another datum or event defined as a unit potential, thus involving at least 2 simultaneous events. Consider the experience of vision. While we focus our attention on an object of vision, we are still aware of a background and, thus, a whole collection of events. This would mean at least an equal collection of physical events in the brain are involved.<br>Take the experience of listening to music. It would mean being aware of what went before. Like vision, it would probably mean that while our attention at any given time is focused at that point in time, it is aware of what went before and what is to follow. In other words, it spans the time axis. Many great composers have stated that they are able to hear their whole composition. Thus their acoustic experience is probably like the average person&#39;s visual experience. While focusing at a particular point in time of their composition, they are nevertheless aware of what went before and what is to come. The rest of the composition is like the background of a visual experience. Experiencing the composition in this way, they are able to traverse it in a similar fashion to which a painting is observed. In this sense, an average person in comparison can be seen as having tunnel hearing (like tunnel vision) when it comes to music, thus making it very difficult for him or her to reproduce or create new music. It can be seen that consciousness is a 4-D phenomenon. If it is a physically explainable phenomenon, such an explanation would involve EPR type effects and as such physical explanations at a quantum level will be involved. <br><a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/DESCAS\">https://philpapers.org/rec/DESCAS</a>", "comment_date": "2018-10-10T23:59:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marius Crow", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/6yG8aoBbmqY\">https://youtu.be/6yG8aoBbmqY</a> you may find this of interest......", "comment_date": "2018-10-10T23:57:14Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Susan Mitchell", "comment_text": "To learn about consciousness and reality, check out Hyperianism:  <a href=\"https://hyperiansource.com/\">https://hyperiansource.com/</a> OR <a href=\"https://www.hyperianism.com/humanorhyperian/\">https://www.hyperianism.com/humanorhyperian/</a> Also, take a look at the video on Unifying Love and Hate: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6yG8aoBbmqY\">https://youtu.be/6yG8aoBbmqY</a>", "comment_date": "2018-10-10T23:38:33Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Its Oxenfree", "comment_text": "Thank you for adding something worth watching on youtube!

You defined consciousness, and therefore, whatever science may find, is not necessarily the answer to what we experience, but an answer to the definition.<br><br>We humans are so arrogant to think that only we are conscious. For that thunderbolt question, answer this: Is the fusion in the sun different than the fusion of other stars?<br><br>You said: &quot;Focus on yourself&quot;. That is a great exercise. But who&#39;s focusing and knowing? And do we really die? What if in the future same &quot;structure&quot; occurred? That structure will have different memories. Either one has to say we are nothing but experience and memory and yes we die, or one has to agree that if same structure occurs, then we are here again, yet with different ego. How do you know people in coma or deep sleep are not conscious? There is something in us (some also call it consciousness)  which is simply the presence, without memory. If you had no capacity for memory, will you be conscious? That will depend on the definition, but is it a requirement for consciousness to be aware of itself? In my definition, it is not requirement. Just seeing a color or hearing a sound, even not knowing what that is or remembering, still is consciousness, although useless for humans.  <br><br>The answer to these questions is really really simple to comprehend, but perhaps not quantifiable as &quot;science&quot; and &quot;quakadamics&quot;  require. Look at life itself. Humans understood a concept of life since ancient time. Then scientists defined life in biology. All was great until scientists told us that the life which they defined is the life humans understood since ancient times.<br><br>Look at any color. They tell you color is only in your mind. In that case, everything is only in your mind. Also, without that color, or any similar thing (such as sound) which is only in your mind, you will never be able to monitor any experiment objectively. Now the question is, can the mind create something which is not part of the universe? Color is part of the universe, existing in our mind, just as any other thing! Scientists hate this because they can only measure frequencies, not the &quot;color&quot;. But what does &quot;exist&quot; in our mind is? Point to me in your brain at where the color red is! Don&#39;t point at neuron activities,  point to where the color exist.<br><br>Extend this thought further. Then natural questions arise: How do you know the weather is not &quot;alive&quot;. How do you know that, just as there is matter, there is consciousness? Or perhaps, consciousness is just a process, such as the fusion. But in that case, how does the universe &quot;knows&quot; to apply the laws of physics at every point? What is that constant everywhere which has in it embedded information to apply the laws?<br><br>Eventually one realizes that labels are labels only (including consciousness), and science is only a tool and only a model of the truth (not the truth itself). One also realizes that there is a difference between the ego &quot;the sense of self&quot; and knowing about the presence of it. We are lucky to know about the presence (or are we?) Listen to a music. Where in your head is the sound? <br><br>The human brain is only an artifact of the evolution of the universe. It would be interesting if we can really understand the reality itself. What would that make of the Kolmogorov complexity of reality!?<br><br>Long comment, but it can be summarized with the famous question: &quot;If a tree falls in a forest and there is no one around.

It&#39;s the total sum of neuroconnections that makes up for it.

In\u00a0computer science\u00a0AI research is defined as the study of &quot;intelligent agents&quot;: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal.[1]Colloquially, the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; is applied when a machine mimics &quot;cognitive&quot; functions that humans associate with other\u00a0human minds, such as &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;problem solving&quot;.[2]\u00a0See\u00a0glossary of artificial intelligence.<br><br>The scope of AI is disputed: as machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered as requiring &quot;intelligence&quot; are often removed from the definition, a phenomenon known as the\u00a0AI effect, leading to the quip &quot;AI is whatever hasn&#39;t been done yet.&quot;[3]\u00a0For instance,\u00a0optical character recognition\u00a0is frequently excluded from &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, having become a routine technology.[4]\u00a0Capabilities generally classified as AI as of 2017\u00a0include successfully\u00a0understanding human speech,[5]competing at a high level in\u00a0strategic gamesystems (such as\u00a0chess\u00a0and\u00a0Go[6]),\u00a0autonomous cars, intelligent routing in\u00a0content delivery networks,\u00a0military simulations, and interpreting complex data, including images and videos.<br><br>Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism,[7][8]\u00a0followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an &quot;AI winter&quot;),[9][10]\u00a0followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding.[citation needed]For most of its history, AI research has been divided into subfields that often fail to communicate with each other.[11]<br><br>The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include\u00a0reasoning,\u00a0knowledge,\u00a0planning,\u00a0learning,\u00a0natural language processing,\u00a0perception\u00a0and the ability to move and manipulate objects.[12]\u00a0General intelligence\u00a0is among the field&#39;s long-term goals.[13]\u00a0Approaches include\u00a0statistical methods,\u00a0computational intelligence, and\u00a0traditional symbolic AI. Many tools are used in AI, including versions of\u00a0search and mathematical optimization,\u00a0neural networksand\u00a0methods based on statistics, probability and economics. The AI field draws upon\u00a0computer science,\u00a0mathematics,\u00a0psychology,\u00a0linguistics,\u00a0philosophy,\u00a0neuroscience,\u00a0artificial psychology\u00a0and many others.<br><br>The field was founded on the claim that\u00a0human intelligence\u00a0&quot;can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it&quot;.[14]\u00a0This raises philosophical arguments about the nature of the\u00a0mind\u00a0and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence, issues which have been explored by\u00a0myth,\u00a0fiction\u00a0and\u00a0philosophy\u00a0since\u00a0antiquity.[15]\u00a0Some people also consider AI\u00a0a danger to humanity\u00a0if it progresses unabatedly.[16]\u00a0Others believe that it is primarily a risk to employment: a frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and\u00a0Carl Benedikt Frey\u00a0found that almost half of U.S. jobs are at risk to automation due to AI.[17]<br><br>In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in\u00a0computer power, large amounts of\u00a0data, and theoretical understanding; and AI techniques have become an essential part of the\u00a0technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science.[18]", "comment_date": "2017-12-26T01:54:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Green Deane", "comment_text": "I like your videos but you were positive towards circumcision which is sexual assault and should be prosecuted.

For example, a book gets created and is destroyed, the point when is a bit blurry but most people would agree that that book existed. It didn&#39;t though, the arrangement of molecules that we call a book and we instantly tie the concept &#39;book&#39; to did exist but that energy never dissapeared, it only changed form.

There is also a procedure called standstill surgery in which the brain is completely deprived of blood and oxygen and you are dead for all intents and purposes.

This is why you can&#39;t exactly locate where consciousness resides in the brain and why it&#39;s still possible for the brain to adapt after a hemispherectomy.

When we experience things we store it into memory. The ability to learn  is probably a natural defense mechanism and when we&#39;re not behaving or doing something out of core instinctive reasons like fear, anxiety or hunger; and we&#39;re safe our natural anti virus switches into idle mode to keep alive. And that&#39;s what I think our conscienceness really is! Purely the constant running stream of electricity in our brain. Moving around but all still connected. The fact the brain needs to stay alive kind of backs up this idle theory. I mean, if the conscienceness was designed to protect us, what did mother nature think we would think of once we had protected ourselves?

Think about it, theirs the round chamber, (our head) inside are the bullets (our neurons), and the long nozzle (our consciousness) that direct the bullets on a specific focused path. Yea the bullets are just as powerful without a nozzle, but shoot the gun without a nozzle on it , and what you get is random, uncontrolled and dangerous. <br><br>With the ability to focus, observe, and predict behavior, it appears to be the PERFECT mapping system for survival through evolution. The fact that we can consciously focus the brain at something when we want, is the perception of what we call free-will. <br><br>I think there are different levels of self consciousness which is why an extremely small percentage of people can get this deep into discussions about self awareness, and when you bring this up with someone else, they have no clue what the hell are you talking about and have never really thought about it before, completely missing that self awareness (the ME feeling).

Our brains are mostly water, and all our means of perception are based on water (the eyes are mostly water too, hearing and our sense of balance need water to work, your nerve endings don&#39;t work as efficiently when you&#39;re dehydrated, etc).  Water is also associated with life itself, it doesn&#39;t seem to be possible to have life without water.   Sometimes I notice when I drink water I almost seem to be <b>more</b> conscious and more aware of things.  When I&#39;m dehydrated I feel &#39;out of it.&#39;  I remember reading something about the &#39;memory of water&#39; but this might not have been proven to be true or based in science(?).  <br><br>Anyways it&#39;s just interesting to think about this question, what is consciousness?  I don&#39;t think that you are a &#39;thing&#39; essentially, an entity, I think that you are a function of something, i.e. the physical brain.  But it feels like a &#39;thing&#39; because you think you can perceive stillness.  In reality, nothing is still.  Atoms are always in motion.  The earth is in motion, the universe is expanding, etc.  Your eyes don&#39;t even work if they are perfectly still, if your eyes were perfectly still you wouldn&#39;t be able to see anything.  Light only appears to be still relative to where your eyes are, but there really isn&#39;t anything that isn&#39;t moving.  <br><br>Also this does not make consciousness less real, because motion is a fundamental aspect of existence.  But I think consciousness is more of a function or a process than a &#39;thing&#39; or a substance. <br><br>I don&#39;t think we&#39;re in the Matrix because we don&#39;t have any real evidence of that.  In the Matrix movie, the entire premise of the story was that there was a means to discover that what they were perceiving was not reality but a computer program, however the program itself was indeed real and it existed, it was a part of reality.  IF the Matrix program had not been real, then how did it act on the humans&#39; senses?  Computer programs are also real.  The whole idea behind the movie was that they discovered that it was a program, but they did not explain <b>how</b> exactly the program was able to act physically on the senses and create these impressions of a false reality.

If you think &quot;well that&#39;s totally different look<br>\u00a0at how much more complex I am that&#39;s just some dead junk&quot;  sure, but look at binary code, <br>where all this stuff you see on the computer comes out of nothing but zeros and ones. <br>And consider a TV screen, you think the images you see are moving, but it&#39;s just an<br>\u00a0illusion as really nothing is actually moving. This is easier to see if you look at a scrolling marquee,<br>where text looks like it&#39;s moving but really it&#39;s just lights turning on and off.  <br><br>Everything we think of as &quot;us&quot; is really only meaningful when <br>considered in relation to what we consider external to us. Everything <br>you &quot;experience&quot; you can trace back to something caused by something <br>you&#39;d consider external to you - sights, sounds, people, food, taste, <br>etc. Even brain chemicals we&#39;d say aren&#39;t us and we talk about them as <br>if they aren&#39;t. We see our emotions as being in some way controlled by <br>brain chemicals, like a we&#39;re sitting in a car that&#39;s not working <br>correctly. The reality is obviously that everything we think of as <br>external to us, all the things we consider &quot;out there&quot; is really &quot;in <br>you&quot; in that all your sensations are being generated by your brain. If <br>you go into this you&#39;ll first arrive at the conclusion that it&#39;s more <br>correct to think of existence as virtual reality. You aren&#39;t in a car, <br>but in a virtual reality biomechanical machine we call the brain. Only <br>if you keep thinking about where YOU really are you can see that it&#39;s <br>that you ARE the network. You don&#39;t feel a feeling, you are the <br>feeling, you don&#39;t see a sight, there is just seeing. You aren&#39;t &quot;one&quot;<br>stuck somewhere in your head, you&#39;re everything you experience. It&#39;s even <br>incorrect to put it like that, more correctly you are the experience itself. <br><br>If you were able to connect with another person 100%, and you would both fully know all thoughts and feelings and memories with each other, you would see yourself and that person as the same. By that I mean you would see their mind as just an extension of your own, like another limb. Imagine connecting that way with all humans on the planet, we&#39;d then have a single consciousness. It would be like a network of nerve endings feeling their way around. This super consciousness only exists when all it&#39;s parts are networked, but if all humans were then disconnected this single consciousness would vanish. The consciousness wouldn&#39;t see itself as any single human, and so would see each human as more like an arm or a foot. Effectively it would be a brain. Do you see this is how it is with our own body? We only exist because of this network that is the brain along with our sense organs that are equally important. The brain &quot;grew&quot; and formed gradually, and as it did so our &quot;self&quot; also arose gradually. When we die this &quot;network&quot; is disconnected and so our consciousness vanishes, but all of what made us up would still be there immediately afterwards. You aren&#39;t one, you are many. You know that this is true because that&#39;s just how you see yourself now, it&#39;s just you decide that &quot;you&quot; exist somewhere outside it like you see your body like you would a camera or a computer that you just use as a tool. <br><br>When you can see that the difference between dead and living matter is just a matter of form,  then you can see what made &quot;you&quot; is simply going to go on to be transformed into some other form. Your memory is really the main thing that makes you see yourself as a separate ego, you aren&#39;t even able to really live in the present because we need some way to reflect on it. You only feel like there&#39;s something to lose with death because you have a memory. <br><br>If you try and decide where you think &quot;you&quot; are, you&#39;ll eventually come to the conclusion that either you don&#39;t really exist or that you are everything.  The trouble with saying you don&#39;t really exist at all is that it doesn&#39;t explain anything. You still know that you have an experience of an sensation of &quot;I&quot; and of &quot;other&quot; or the internal vs the external. But what of saying you are everything?

Despite thinking about some of the thornier areas of this for quite some time, I&#39;ve been unable to fully resolve them. Philosophical zombie, yeah its a fun one.<br>    \u00a0Another one that gets me is the one about making a perfect copy of yourself, including your memories. Would there still then be an original you? If we destroyed the &#39;supposed original&#39;, no one would know, or care,  that the new was not still the old. No one would be able to tell in any way, either, even if they looked carefully, even scientifically. Not if it was perfect copy. So is this wild hypothetical scenario, there could &#39;other you&#39;s&#39;. <br>   The really sticky part for me has something to do with  a concept I can&#39;t even fully determine to have any actual relevance to anything. So it&#39;s a quirk of mine, maybe. It has to do with something I &#39;feel&#39; about something I might call the &#39;continuity of self&#39;:<br>    \u00a0If I am killed and instantly replace by a perfect copy, I still somehow feel like I would be dying. And I suppose I would be. But the perfect copy calls into question not only the concept of uniqueness, but also the &#39;continuity of self&#39;. I would not really know I was dead or had died, because I would be dead. The copy would pick up the next instant after my death. I&#39;m so stuck in a loop about this it&#39;s funny. We could consider my consciousness having been transferred in the copy. But it wasn&#39;t. To me, from a certain perspective, that copy is someone else. It was a perfect copy, not a transfer. But because there was no time gap for any existence of 2 distinct copies, identical but distinct, I can&#39;t tell if that is actually in any way different from an actual transfer.

Earth has been around for 4.5 billion years roughly and has had life for about 3.5 billion years of it, somewhere along the line of the first living things, they were programmed to just eat, get stronger and reproduce and their offspring are to do the same, in order to in hopes, one day create the perfect creature. 3.5 billion years later and we come along, we are the greatest things that this world has ever created we became so intelligent through evolution that we no longer run on hardwired thought, no we gained consciousness. With consciousness we are finally able to make descisions based on how we would like to see the outcome, not nature, we have essentially beaten the system that created us and i personally don&#39;t think earth has anything in way of evolution for us anymore, we are ready to leave earth to fulfill our true destinys. I also believe that we are not the only conscious animals on the planet, we always wonder why we were born a human and not an animal and the simple answer is because we just werent. We have never experienced life through another organism, so how could we ever know what being conscious in any other body feels like. So every morning when you wake up, be thankful that you were born a human and not a mosquito. crustaceans evolved into insects and than realized that they had taken the wrong branch and created more of a nuisance than anything and so they went back and realized that they needed a more sound body, thus the fish was born, becoming the first vertebrates, they evolved from the water and turned into amphibians which are more fish than lizard, than finally made the full transition into reptile which was the first land vertebrate. Reptiles were very successful and branched off into Dinosaurs, which if the meteor hadnt wiped them out, there would have been no need for mammals to be introduced at all. long story short, dinosaurs evolved into birds and got the shitty branch, anyway reptiles which remained the dominant species on earth evolved into a more sufficient land creature, one that would turn into mammals down the line, we became warm blooded which turned us into very active and nimble predators, finally bringing along humans. I personally think that humans are earths perfect creatures, that it set out to create from the beginning, had it not been for a meteor, dinosaurs would have probably evolved into smaller dinosaur looking people with intelligent brains. So if humans and all other mammals were to die off, it would be safe to assume that Birds would be the next species to dominate earth, since they are the next most evolved creatures.", "comment_date": "2016-03-21T21:07:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RainbowShade_107", "comment_text": "The bare essence of consciousness is knowing that you&#39;re there.", "comment_date": "2016-03-21T08:46:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T N", "comment_text": "The last question is a popular paradox", "comment_date": "2016-03-21T03:30:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Em Nielson", "comment_text": "I have a question for you: Why do we enjoy and &quot;relate&quot; to songs even if we have not had the experiences necessary in order to relate to the songs?

For all its machinations the \u201cthinker\u201d is just as transitory as every other thought - being itself merely a sequence of thoughts about thoughts about thoughts ad infinitum.<br><br>This duplicity ostensibly allows the mind to distance itself from its shadowy, more unpalatable, impulses \u2013 its envy, its greed, its fears, its animosities - by fabricating a make-believe &quot;I&quot; separate from &quot;them.&quot; It seeks to create a chasm which hides this darker side from itself but which also prevents the light of awareness from reaching and illuminating it. &quot;I&quot; do not have &quot;those&quot; reprehensible qualities or, &quot;I&quot; am burdened and distressed by &quot;those&quot; feelings.

The &quot;experiencer,&quot; being a fiction, is impotent and has negligible effect on &quot;its&quot; experience. Only a clear choiceless awareness of the stream of experience, unclouded by the chatter of an imaginary &quot;self&quot; or &quot;thinker,&quot; can expedite that integration.

Also amoung us voluntary and subconscious cells are moral cells, any time we ponder about or do bad things the brain cells that control mortality remind us and give us guilt to feel bad, eventually, if we voluntary cells do a bad thing long enough the guilt doesn&#39;t feel as bad overtime.

My question is this: When and where did our consciousness begin? What about its end? Is there even an end? Are we reborn? Do we start again? Is there some form of God?

Well what most people deem consciousness... IE themselves is a Collaboration of data from 2 different sources IE both sides of the brain/ emotional and logical, and the data merging\u00a0 creates a &quot;holographic&quot; entity or personality known as yourself. Take that one step further and the Consciousness the &quot;god helmet&quot; discovered\u00a0 otherwise known as a global consciousness is a holographic entity made from all of us wiring into the same magnetic field. So effectively on this level we can make a stretch and say that any collaboration of 2 or more entities creates a 3rd more complex entity.\u00a0 Now If you want to go metaphysical into the realm of the soul and all that it&#39;s equally mysterious. Most if not all of us are inhabited and influenced by extra-dimensional entities one would call a soul. The soul can have a distinctly different personality from the body and so is a different intelligence all together. But again it is something we would consider to be &quot;ourselves&quot; because when we die, that spirit takes on our imprint or atleast a portion of who we are... which is probably part of the whole design and why they use us a way to further progress their own evolution persay. While we appear to be wired directly into a spirit so to speak... how we are human bodies being piloted by extra dimensional entities is beyond me. Perhaps there&#39;s connectors in the brain that work on a quantum level and spirits can manipulate that? idk... But even if we did have such connectors, why would they evolve? No reason I can fathom why it would occur naturally, unless of course having a spirit was a evolutionary advantage and I can see that mutation sticking around but it&#39;d Have to occur staggeringly early.", "comment_date": "2015-05-27T15:11:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LUDERZ", "comment_text": "Droppin the real knowledge on these nerds.

Brains are the prime example of this, consciousnes created by a system of electric charges and transport of biochemical molecules.<br><br>However you can transfer the concept to systems such as trees or forrests, where all trees share the same root system, extendig over squaremiles. It can be applied to entire ecosystems, with every component taking the role of a neuron or transmitter reacting and acting on other components of the system.<br><br>If you look at the dynamics of large groups of people, it is more than just the sum of the intentions and actions of every individual of that group, since they continously influence each other at all times no single person can ever be in control of all &quot;variables&quot;, so the complex system can mathematically only be described as an enormous differential equation, where all variables are dependent of each other. Changing one leads to change in those that are dependent on it, and then more changes in all those variables that are dependent on the ones that were changed by the very first variation.This is exactly the type of mathematic modell that scientists use to describe the brain, where all these dependencies are closed in on each other in such a way that they create a stable system, balancing each other out.<br><br>If you look at the universe on the largest possible scale, you find filaments of galaxy clusters arranged in what looks exactly like a neuronal network. Within this network matter and energy are being transported and interact with each other according to the laws of physics (again the sum of forces of interaction between all matter and energy can only be described through differential equations). The Universe might just be one massiv consciousness with levels of subcionsciousnesses through physical networks spread over the wide spectrum of size magnitudes.<br>We might be in some way special because our consciousness is created by a physical system (brain) on a size magnitude that is dead center in the scale between the largest (whole universe) and the smallest (quarks), perhaps the goldylock zone of consciousness, but then again that might just be anthropocentric ignorance.<br><br>At the physics department of my university (Goethe University in Frankfurt/Germany) we have a brilliant theoretical physics professor, Prof. Dr. Claudius Gros, who is a pioneer in the research of Complex Systems.

What bugs me about this whole theory is the power and freedom of individual thought and decision, but I know even if i died and then was cloned, I would not be looking through that second set of eyes, I would technically still be dead.\u00a0<br><br>I could have an army of clones of me, but I&#39;d still watch my own back because the power of individual freedom and thought and the feelings that go with it, will cause indifference between all of us, because that&#39;s the power we were given, individuality, maybe at some point my own clone would say I don&#39;t want to be like you because im just a copy, and boom, they&#39;ve immediately developed their own consciousness, part of that is because if I had my own family, and that clone cant have the same, who are they then? someone that isn&#39;t me\u00a0<br><br>anyone wanna contribute, I know its not fully on topic but I felt it close enough to write all this out.

Just knowing that that person has completely different thought patterns than me is just hard to process. I always take it upon myself to evaluate people through my perspective (My consciousness) and try to comprehend what they do. This causes me to start mimicking patterns which I can easily isolate and start behaving in that certain way. Although this has caused my personality to change, it has opened a much broader perspective through my life. Though I know I cannot experience the same things as they do, I do manage to grasp a glimpse of how they thing. I do this by introducing thoughts that are similar to mine and mimic what I believe is the closest to it and behave in that manner, walking in someone else shoe&#39;s or slippers in this case since I don&#39;t fully grasp their &quot;Feelings&quot;. Never the less I still attempt by creating simulations, or what most people know them to be as dreams or &quot;Fake reality&#39;s&quot;, within my mind that include variables within my memories, although it does happen subconsciously at times without me knowing until I later evaluate myself from a previous standpoint and find myself to mimic the actions of those around me. Still, I have found myself to be adapting to my surroundings very slowly because of this process, and seems to further gain knowledge after evaluating myself at a later period. Though, through my perspective these evaluations on myself seem to not bring any new information about myself even though my thoughts says I do. I contradict my own evaluations due to the fact I compare them with my current thoughts, then I later realize that all these experiences don&#39;t seem to be new. All my experiences are pre-made, such as code from a computer is already there and only needs to be assembled in order to display information that was already there. As if there was already a book of instructions made before and may or may not be changed. This has led me to think that nothing ever really changes. Now this has led me through a dark path that nothing we do or ever will do will be knew and everything we learn has already been learned and will be. I continuously rely on others and their perspectives to cloud me from this as to not lead me to &quot;Suicide&quot;. Though i can only ever follow one I find myself to not want to control things around me but mainly be controlled. This allows for less complex thoughts and more positive ones instead. Even so i find myself shifting back and forth through this process, knowing that this is caused by patterns already pre-made for me and others. In any case i have also experienced a type of feeling that i believe felt as if i was no longer in reality but looking down upon it. I would compare it to GTA or some game of that kind, where you are not experiencing what they do but instead look at what they do never actually knowing that experience if any they are feeling. Anyhow, it seems i have lost my self and continue to do so, but a new thought has come about which makes me think that we are no different than what a computer might be able to comprehend. Such as the fact that we follow the rules of the universe and that a computer is merely just doing the same. Computers may have rules that come with it but it is till bound to the universal rules we follow as well. This gives them as much possibilities as anything else. This also means there are might be limits or infinite possibilities we are yet to comprehend, but oh well. This is all coming from an incompetent teen that &quot;Wastes his life&quot; and chooses to believe a god for the fear of not truly understanding this world. And so I say this, &quot;All I have said is through one mind&#39;s perspective or should I say algorithm that a mind has created to explain that which is around him and cannot be comprehended by simple thought. Even so, chose to believe what the rules say and stick with your own thoughts which contain thoughts that others have found but not solved(Your thoughts are always the same as mine since we are all connected to the same rules. \u2665 ).<br>One more subject I want to poke about is the fact that i try to add as many variables into my &quot;Simulations&quot;. This has also made me think of my birth and the knowledge I knew after. I now start remembering the day I stopped seeing the darkness of non-existence and found myself lying down on a bed i knew and at the same time did not as well as the family and the environment I was in. I could recall my biological father&#39;s name yet I had never consciously met him and I also was able to identify my family and knew their names without even being aware of who they are, what they were doing, or how I even appeared there. Though I still feel similar experiences of that day, even the ability to control my actions while at the same time not being able to. I constantly think about me and other subjects, Correction objects, or people and places as most and I rather call them. I always feel but don&#39;t fell, as if something else is causing the actions while I watch through another&#39;s eyes such as we do with video. This thought makes me sad because of the feelings I have for those who I like and the individual who I love. Never the less, I always find it amusing when a coincidence happens which is constantly about what I had thought of before but is brought up by another individual without my input. I still question that which is around me and that which is not, but for my own survival and the mental stability of others. &quot;As I don&#39;t understand, I do. That of which is unknown is known but not said or thought. So as I think, I weep at the truth and the lie that is everything. As I fell pain, I don&#39;t but instead am told. Sensation of touch is but the same as sensation of pain which we all fell and don&#39;t feel equally.&quot; And as I keep living my life I keep thinking of new subjects, and keep editing this post.", "comment_date": "2014-02-13T03:25:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wg Williams", "comment_text": "The problem with someone trying to posit that consciousness/mind is mere by-product functioning of brain is that mathematics, reason and logic would also be results of this mere by-product functioning of brain from \u201cMind\u201d. If morality, self awareness and choice (freewill) are also mere products of mind it would then seem to be just picking and choosing to trust logic over self-awareness or mathematics over morality and in the end becomes some form of \u201cbegging the question\u201d. The only real questions left are, &quot;is consciousness trustworthy to know reality and if so, is it also a necessary part of reality itself?&quot; We have in fact only consciousness to rationalize consciousness. All rational inferences, testing models against experienced reality, conceptualizing models, logic and probability theories arise from consciousness/mind and all of these listed don&#39;t and can&#39;t exist without consciousness. \u201cConsciousness\u201d or the \u201cMind\u201d accounts for all reasoning with nothing left outside of this self-awareness that is able to encounter or reason reality otherwise.<br><br>Consciousness is the substrate of any possible claim to knowledge and thus the starting and ending point to posit a reality or any truth. Why would one limit themselves to posit empiricism as true, which is also a product/idea of mind but this world-view denies one&#39;s self, the objective reasoner, as no more than mere biochemical illusory as the result of it&#39;s assertions. Empiricism states that knowledge must be restricted to those objects which can be perceived by our senses. At the same time empiricism requires non-empirical foundational presuppositions and these presuppositions are not material themselves, they are metaphysical. Science must assume mathematics, logic and human reason trustworthy and that the Universe is rational and in line with a rational human consciousness/mind because these are not physical objects which can be perceived by any of our five senses. Mathematics, logic and reason originate and reside in the metaphysical consciousness, the mind. These metaphysical conceptual constructs can not be tested/falsified outside of themselves empirically. Empiricism alone is self-refuting layer upon layer. The theory that all knowledge is limited to what can be empirically known is itself, incapable of being known or demonstrated empirically. When adding the fact that empiricism can not answer for any trustworthy substrate for knowledge that is solely metaphysical (one&#39;s self, the objective reasoner); and the fact that the only substrate for claimed knowledge is \u201cone&#39;s self, the objective reasoner\u201d, shows empiricism as fallacious at it&#39;s core claim of being the only methodology for knowledge. Mind/consciousness is one&#39;s self, the objective reasoner and only possible source for any claim of knowledge to/of reality. Science may inform humans of what we are but science can ever inform us of who we are; one&#39;s self, the objective reasoner to and of reality.<br><br>C.S. Lewis describes the moral issue from within conscious beings reasoning like this;<br><br>&quot;My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such violent reaction against it? A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course, I could have given up my idea of justice by saying that it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too--for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my private fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist--in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless--I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality--namely my idea of justice--was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning.&quot; ~C.S.
