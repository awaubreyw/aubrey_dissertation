If two sides have agreed to go to war, and I controlled one, I would try to take advantage of my opponent and destroy them with every possible tactic I can use. In the Vsauce video about awkwardness, Michael talks about how there are four levels, the first being what is physically possible, the second being what is physically possible but against law.

It is a verb. Love itself in action, passively or otherwise, is a choice. <br><br>That is to say, anyone can claim to be in love but to have a truthful example of love is almost impossible in all the ways it has been portrayed as a reaction or chemical process. Let&#39;s then discuss Occam&#39;s razor in this. To say that love is an indefinable trait of life means that no one could ever describe even in allegory what it was, yet we have social constructs directly built around love, its purpose, weaknesses, and strengths as the said social construct. We understand it&#39;s base origins and needs to exist. Therefore it is not an ephemeral and abstract idea.  <br><br>With all of this in mind Love as a reaction is dismissive of the codependent nature of love. That it is something to simply disappear over time meaning it was never meant to be, to begin with, yet it is stated that Love is never wrong...A paradox if love is defined as a simple reactive process meant to attach people emotionally, and spiritually to the point of physical intimacy to produce children.  <br><br>Thusly Love as a reaction, is impossible. <br><br>Chemical processes themselves are an unreliable answer to this query as the brain itself can relay the decoded input from singular or repeated encounters with someone who releases the perfect mixture of pheromones behavior and social persona to create output in reaction. Yet, we&#39;ve already seen that love as a reaction is not a process that reaches the purpose of love. <br><br>At this stage, this argument against a chemical reaction would dive deep into the true presence of the brain as the core of who you are as a living breathing person. Nevertheless, that digression would be too absolute to worry ourselves with at this moment. Let us postpone that argument to simply discuss the true nature of love as a part of life, experiencing it and it&#39;s development as a behavior.<br><br>Thus, if love as a simple reaction to stimuli, and furthermore relegating love to simply a chemical reaction refutes the true purpose and birth of love, thus it makes far too many assumptions to be a viable explanation of love.<br><br>In this regard, the simplest and most complete explanation of Love as an aspect of life. More explicitly Human life, as a very specific moral, social, curious and self-actualizing creature. Love is a decision to become codependent with another being whom you hold or wish to hold in close regard. <br><br>Now, that may sound cold and mechanical in the favor of love, but that is the point of this discussion. The mechanics of love. Not the explicit practice of it. That too is simply far too complex to discuss.<br><br>Love itself is a choice, as proof simply in the argument, For love being a reaction. that it fades after time unless the connection is absolutely self-sufficient. That is to say, the bond does not require any attempts to adjust and course-correct the perceived person value of each action taken in the relationship. This in and of itself is foolish. As codependent or Symbiotic life forms require communication and consensus to survive. <br><br>With the purpose of survival, when it comes to life as we know it, being to reproduce and allow our genetic material to continue. Love is a higher moral plane of relating to a mate and a symbiote, that is to say, like any other need for sentient life to survive, much less thrive, There must be conscious decision and purpose in relating to another being that is going to trust in being symbiotic to you. <br><br>Thus, all being fair in love is nothing more than the foolish desire to e self-righteous in a society that values being known as correct above actually being truthful.", "comment_date": "2018-03-07T03:20:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samson Moses", "comment_text": "First!", "comment_date": "2018-02-26T00:06:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kitayuan", "comment_text": "Wait? so you cant just play dead and shoot people when they come walking past", "comment_date": "2018-02-24T02:55:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JipH29", "comment_text": "Zack and Cody\u2019s mom said it was okay...", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T20:44:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akshay Joshi", "comment_text": "Micheal has clearly never played Dark Souls.", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T14:53:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brendan M", "comment_text": "I thought the \u2018homo\u2019 in homosapiens meant something along the lines of \u2018wise\u2019 or \u2018thinking\u2019...?", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T13:47:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ned478", "comment_text": "all is fair in love and brostep", "comment_date": "2018-02-22T06:33:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lawrence overington", "comment_text": "ragatanga", "comment_date": "2018-02-21T23:15:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lawrence overington", "comment_text": "Hey vsauce, Lawrence here, are any two claps the same?", "comment_date": "2018-02-21T23:15:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "comicmouse", "comment_text": "The music he uses is so creepy during night", "comment_date": "2018-02-21T07:04:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SandwhichBread", "comment_text": "Talk to any Iraq war vet and see how importantly anyone held the rules of war out there.", "comment_date": "2018-02-21T00:09:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Santiago Chau Principe", "comment_text": "What would you do for love?<br><br>* ignites lightsaber to kill younglings *", "comment_date": "2018-02-20T19:43:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Martin Nastoupil", "comment_text": "Everyone knows this video is old beacause it has 9 mins 58 sec", "comment_date": "2018-02-20T17:39:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "internet exister", "comment_text": "<b>talking about love and war</b> &quot;Pencil lead is made out of carbon atoms....&quot; HOW DOES THAT FIT", "comment_date": "2018-02-17T22:36:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viligor", "comment_text": "why dont we all work togheter to manage bigger things and dont make it harder by breaking it", "comment_date": "2018-02-17T14:42:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan GdS", "comment_text": "Bro, are you saying playing dead is against the rules?

Love is not opposed to war, like he says, with war being created by humans and love not created by humans. Love is opposed to hatred, and none of the two are created by humans, and from both of these, some things created by humans follow. They are very similar in this sense. And saying that there is the Geneva convention for war, and that there is no equivalent for love is a bit far fetched. Geneva convention does not even forbid to kill people. Are you allowed to kill someone in a relationship ? Geneva convention forbids to use landmines and fragmentation bombs, this is a totally other level. Yes, in love, the law does not forbid you to try to seduce another woman when you are in a relationship, but you cannot compare this to the use of landmines that rip peoples legs off. You cannot argue that we have no obligation in morality in love relationships but we do in war. The law even forbids you to slap people, when Geneva convention does not even forbid you to kill them. It just argues about the way you do it. <br>And no, I don&#39;t think being faithful to the person I love is a barrier that I create for myself because of moral values. I don&#39;t do it because it is something that the person I love really wouldn&#39;t want, and it would hurt her. And loving someone precisely mean wanting that person to be happy. So it is not that I want to cheat on her but force myself not to, the thing is I simply DO NOT want to cheat on her. This all stems from the idea that our true nature is to be &quot;sinners&quot;, that we are all basically selfish people and we need moral laws to prevent us from doing all those things that we would really like to do deep down. Our true nature is to be good and to not want to hurt people. We do hurt people sometimes, not because of our true nature, but precisely because we are drawn away from our true nature because of confusion. Actually, the biggest reason why we do hurt people the most is BECAUSE we think our true nature is to be sinners and that others are too.", "comment_date": "2017-07-19T18:40:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Science potato", "comment_text": "yugoslavia doesnot exist", "comment_date": "2017-07-19T18:23:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yousif Osama", "comment_text": "My personal first rule of war:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Don&#39;t", "comment_date": "2017-07-19T18:20:35Z", "likes_count": 1034}, {"comment_by": "brian evans", "comment_text": "so close to 10 minutes, god thing this video was made when it was", "comment_date": "2017-07-19T15:42:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T.

Homosexuality, pedophilia, etc.  Love IS a condition, unavoidable, yet in certain cases we question people&#39;s motives, as if love was a means to some other nefarious end.  And in some cases, it seems so undeniable, as in pedophilia.  Those people are obviously sick and twisted.  Just like if someone were to drop a bowling ball on someone&#39;s head and claim, &quot;hey, I can&#39;t stop gravity!&quot;  I mean in a sense they&#39;re correct, but it was the way they manipulated gravity to their own ends that is the problem.

I think that probably the wrongest idea entertainment passes on to us is that love is more of a feeling than actions. To love and to feel passion isn&#39;t the same. Loving is a verb, therefore an action. There aren&#39;t verbs such as happing or sading or nervousing. Those are feelings or emotions. But there is the verb &quot;to love&quot;. Love IS actions, thoughts and intentions. Expecting to FEEL love all of the time is the reason why people don&#39;t stay together as a couple. Demanding to feel passionate is stupid and egoistical while loving would be more like trying to make the other person feel good WETHER OR NOT you feel good yourself. The trick for long-lasting relationships? Giving up on finding the person that will make you happy but becoming the person that makes the other happy instead. Now, you should never demand it, but if you&#39;re lucky, it may be that the other person learns it with you or simply feels like giving something back. Anyway, I don&#39;t think love should be seen as a condition but rather as a choice. I also think everything is fair in love. The thing is that the moment you decide to do something for your own interest and for the other person&#39;s detriment, it&#39;s simply not love!", "comment_date": "2016-06-16T02:24:50Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "pen_BERRIES", "comment_text": "&quot;Why don&#39;t enemies just come right at you (in video games)?&quot;<br>And thus, Dark Souls was born.", "comment_date": "2016-06-15T17:10:22Z", "likes_count": 8245}, {"comment_by": "N B", "comment_text": "What up im in the Red Cross Club at scholl Henry Dunant", "comment_date": "2016-06-15T15:00:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Riti Aggarwal", "comment_text": "I saw the title and thought, fine, now Michael&#39;s gonna do something stupid...

Everything depicted in it is real. It has long since been established that fertility rates are negatively correlated with intelligence and education level, meaning the dumber you are the more kids you have. Meanwhile, academics have fewer kids. Back in the day (pre-industrialism), this wasn&#39;t a problem. Because back then, negative Natural Selection was still hard at work killing off the shallow end of the gene pool. Dumber people were more likely to die simply on account of being dumb, since they would do stupid shit like try to wrestle a bear or climb a really high building with no safety equipment to impress their equally dumb friends/potential sexual partners. Their numbers were kept in check by their stupidity. Also, since they were generally poorer and there was no social safety net, they were the first to go in times of famine and disease epidemics. All of this is known as negative selection. Basically all of the factors that combine to kill you off before you can spread your defective genes. Positive selection is the opposite, it is all the traits and characteristics a person possesses that increase their chance of survival and passing on their genes, like intelligence, for instance. Intelligent people were more successful and wealthy, and therefore more likely to survive famines and disease outbreaks since they could afford the higher priced food and could retreat to their country homes in case of epidemics in the high density cities. This lead to average IQ going up through all of human history, since evolution positively selected intelligence, and negatively selected stupidity. But thanks to modern social safety nets, everybody gets taken care of and is protected from their own stupidity. If some idiot decides to juggle chainsaws to impress his gutter trash girlfriend and ends up losing a few limbs, society will expend much wealth and effort to patch him up and ensure he survives to pass on his defective genes. We have effectively disrupted the Natural Order of things. We have more or less eliminated negative selection for everybody, allowing everyone to procreate, no matter how useless they are. Even the lowest, dumbest, most useless and worthless gutter trash can grow up to spawn tens of worthless offspring these days. Famine and disease cannot touch them, since modern medicine and welfare benefits ensure nobody needs to starve or die of sickness. This isn&#39;t how it&#39;s supposed to be. And the effects of all this are starting to be felt. Throughout the 1900&#39;s, average IQ&#39;s have gone up due to the flynn effect, which is the increase in IQ due to education and good nutrition during adolescence. This is separate from innate IQ, which is the IQ you are born with and which cannot be changed by education. Everyone has a base level of IQ that they are born with, and then the flynn effect IQ gets added to it through education and good nutrition. But those can only add so many IQ points. Eventually, you reach a ceiling, beyond which IQ cannot increase. The higher the innate base IQ is, the higher the ceiling will be. but base IQ has actually gone down since the 1800&#39;s. the only reason average IQ&#39;s went up is due to education. but now we are reaching the limits of what education can do. the useless half-wits are outbreeding the non-useless segment of the population, and pulling average innate IQ&#39;s down. The only way to reverse this trend is to somehow lower their fertility rate. now, i&#39;m no social darwinist or nazi or anything. i certainly don&#39;t think we should kill them, but we definitely need some sort of license for having kids. If your IQ is lower than a certain percentile, you don&#39;t get to reproduce, period. If you reproduce anyway, you the child will be forcibly aborted, and the people responsible thrown in prison.

He is our guild leader and so clever, I am deputy guild leader and had to stop playing to prioritise my life. I hid inside the game all night so that I could escape what I was facing every day as my children were causing problems at home and at school. I had always gamed with the children, but only child like games, they all became great with computers. Then the temptation to try adult games is there when they are old enough. The problem then falls on the parents to make sure the other children don&#39;t see. I would stop awake for hours, waiting for my children to sleep. Some of them needed hardly any sleep and that was very hard. They were so clever, they just wanted to play games and listen to music and love to draw, paint, make things. It&#39;s an extremely difficult job to correctly care for any child and some people fail. I felt I had failed a few times, but I look at them all now and with the exception of my one son who needs a break from caring for his mates. He has lots of friends, but know that some of them are using him or saying things behind his back. This is where facebook should be moderated. If Adults choose to go on there, that is their choice! I do not believe in allowing my family to paste all over facebook and if they hadn&#39;t done so, I would never have been forced to defend myself. I know so many young girls who are copying their mothers and sharing everything, they are so vulnerable and yet nobody stops it. The police won&#39;t do anything, social services won&#39;t do anything, women&#39;s aid. I have called so many people, doctors to get help for my children and myself and still I am here, worrying. They give orders before they know any truth and will do everything they can to catch up, but I&#39;m afraid their work load is increasing and increasing. As long as my youngest is safe and he is, I really don&#39;t care what happens now. I want to sell my house and move, that&#39;s all I ever wanted. My husband refused to divorce me and still now is asking me to drop the divorce. He even did this at our first trial hearing and had to be removed and I was taken to a safe room. I had a lie down and said I would face it, which I did. He kept saying he didn&#39;t know, he knew right from the start. I have had to deal with everything and have no job. This has been so draining on everyone at times. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel and I strongly believe that we will be able to sell the house soon. I can&#39;t understand why this has not happened yet. I just hope I can help others like me in the future. Men and Women who need guidance in life. You always have to keep moving forward, accept our mistakes, make our apologies and then try again.

And infidelity and adultery was one of the earliest codified reasons to legally dissolve a marriage. In the last 100 years as the idea of romantic love was melded with the institution of marriage we began to see that emotional and physical abuse are now considered illegal behavior and also grounds to legally dissolve a marriage.

During the French revolution, for example, there could be no &quot;laws&quot; to which the revolutionaries abide by - they are in the processes of destroying an old order and a previous substrate from which laws were derived. The only law was the protection of the revolution by any means. Wars between nations, conversely, are fought for the fulfillment of interests (of capital) by any means. Which is why this is fucking stupid: War DOES have implicit rules, as those who go to war are not exercising the epitome of conflict, but fulfilling certain productive needs. During wars between Hellenistic states, for example, they possessed the same mode(s) of production and social foundations, these societies weren&#39;t really that different: The implicit rules of war were simple, that they abide by a certain constraint of production. The reason why there was an actual threat of total extinction during the cold war was because the Soviet Union and the United States were axiomatically different and represented a different order. Because war is an extension of politics, today nuclear war is (while possible) less likely - those responsible for war have definitive interests which don&#39;t include extinction. During the cold war, conversely, those in power were willing to risk everything, as the enemy meant the undoing of the system from which their rule derived. Look at WWI - was this truly a &quot;conflict&quot; in the true sense? No! All fronts, and all sides were EXACTLY the same. That is not &#39;war&#39;, that is a false conflict.\u00a0<br><br>Why? Because they are tied to specific interests - war is by nature an extension of politics and NOT the other way around. The only laws of war are the fulfillment the interests of those responsible for war - it&#39;s not &quot;human nature&quot;, it possesses a real systemic function.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T19:20:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silioni", "comment_text": "Did you hire Caravaggio as your camcorder man?", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T18:19:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hussein Abughosh", "comment_text": "Looks like michael broke some hearts!", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T16:39:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orenum", "comment_text": "You should do &quot;Is Time A Real Thing&quot;...", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T15:24:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "celroid532", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the song at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oThh3_Srxtc&amp;t=7m20s\">7:20</a>? the organ", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T14:29:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "malkinatorius", "comment_text": "who originaly started V sauce? or how did it started or why why do you V sauce guiz do what you \u00a0do ? and whats your driving force? is it the love to this work that pushes to make these videos? so anyway my main question here is what is your driving force that makes you do these videos? :)", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T14:00:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gerry Rivaldy", "comment_text": "We need Law Of Love, where you cant friendzone someone if he&#39;s to nice!", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T12:27:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kylepb07", "comment_text": "Niccolo Macciaveli said that &quot;When it is absolutely a question of the safety of ones&#39; country, there must be no consideration of just or unjust, of merciful or cruel, of praiseworthy or disgraceful; instead, setting aside every scruple, one must follow to the utmost any plan that will save her life and keep her liberty.&quot; Under that philosophy the end always justify the means in love or war so long as the outcome is important enough.", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T12:18:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MJ Dolla", "comment_text": "Is lasagna just spaghetti cake?<br>Let&#39;s take a look at nouns <br><br>Jk jk I love VSause  ", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T08:51:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Controlv5", "comment_text": "What is love", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T05:36:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zac Shelton", "comment_text": "fuck dis shit..............................................................................................................................................illuminati", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T04:44:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ralph Dekeyser", "comment_text": "I exploded my love grenade all over my love.", "comment_date": "2015-02-17T01:11:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Psychologiker", "comment_text": "Unbelievably great content.", "comment_date": "2015-02-16T22:42:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "somerandomdude3366", "comment_text": "This video gave me some feels near the end.

It is this, coupled with a Millenium of literature that has given us to-day, the idea that marriage is or should be about love, rather than a new stage of love, or necessity in joining families together in times of scarcity as it was in the Middle Ages. <br>", "comment_date": "2015-02-05T10:40:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Onix Otto", "comment_text": "Do a episode on magic please !!!

I find it ridiculous that these rules exist, so many wars could end so easily if only we&#39;d throw these pointless things out the window. War is war, and it is without a doubt evil and inhumane. I don&#39;t understand how killing someone isn&#39;t more evil than abusing the weather, torturing, etc. Honestly they are all evil and wrong, so why not just create a new rule that says you cannot kill each other? You might as well while you&#39;re at it, otherwise like I said before... That war is simply a game, a political game. It&#39;s exactly like chess, each piece can only move a certain way. A Bishop cannot ram through the board and shatter the king, no it and all the other pieces must follow the rules in order to obtain victory. Or die trying.

But EU and US have more than enough evidence, that almost anyone can easily found all over the internet, that Russia indeed invaded Ukraine, and it is basically acting as a terror organization.

Second, it&#39;s a violation of Budapest Memorandum from 1994, in which Russia, UK and US agreed: &quot;to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine&quot; and &quot;none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defence&quot;.<br>Russia is criminal state that lost any moral integrity and last scraps of its sanity, due to dictatorship regime and heavy fascistic propaganda.

War: Survival of nations, factions, or self. Love in a way is also survival, because it is for finding your desired mate, fulfilling self needs, and produce your own offspring to continue your legacy/genes. In a way, both things are selfish, and thus you are putting oneself before others, this is where all becomes fair. This is the nature of being human, and it is also inevitable.<br><br>Reasons why love &quot;unfairness&quot; does not get prosecuted is because it isn&#39;t as serious in compared to warfare. Warfare risks lives, and can determine the death or survival of many people at a time, whereas a person can always have another chance at love. History has treated some people who has committed &quot;love crimes&quot; such as adultery, cheating on spouse, or even being homosexual like criminals, but as our society began to be more open to the concept of love, more freedom brings less restrictions.<br><br>Rules of war is great and all, but it will never be perfect. The reason it has improved warfare is due to the mutual agreement of the majority of nations, producing a repercussion toward the violating party that will be harsher compared to the gains achieved through violating the rule in the first place. Chivalry and sportsmanship is not real, what is real is people measuring the gains of a quick (or several) victory against the risk/repercussions of being persecuted by others.\u00a0<br><br>Take an example of someone who has been convicted of a crime, and knows his only chance of survival would be to murder the single witness that is going to testify against him; if he is convicted of the crime he will be put into the electric chair (in this case). The odds of the person risking murdering the witness would probably out weigh following the rules or being chivalric because that brings a higher chance of survival.\u00a0<br><br>I am not trying to say anyone can do anything they want (which if you really think about it, you can), but just be prepared to face the consequences when you do.", "comment_date": "2015-01-20T22:38:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ModernGameArmy", "comment_text": "&quot;a law is only as powerful as you ability to enforce it&quot; -Carsen Berry 2014\ufeff", "comment_date": "2015-01-20T22:38:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ichigo Kurosaki", "comment_text": "I swear i thought he was doing cocaine.", "comment_date": "2015-01-20T22:38:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jared", "comment_text": "Totally favoriting this one.

You&#39;re a great man!<br><br>Second: I have a suggestion on a video you could make. How about you make a video about all the flaws with all three Back to the future movies? you know, all the paradoxes and errors that shouldn&#39;t occur when it did happen anyway. for example when Old biff in the second movie returns to his past, gives his younger self (in 1955) the sports almanack then returns to the future (2015). The paradox here is when Biff returns to 2015, it shouldn&#39;t bring him to the, &quot;now old 2015&quot; becuase he changed his past and made a new future for everyone else. I know my example might be alittle bad in\u00a0 grammar and problably just confusing in general, but I hope you get the idea since this is just one paradox from the movies. I would just LOVE to see your conclusions about these movies becuase they are just so GREAT.
