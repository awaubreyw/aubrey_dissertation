And indeed, you may have a point there. No less of an authority than <a href=\"http://dictionary.com/\">Dictionary.com</a> defines soup as \u201ca liquid food made by boiling or simmering meat, fish, or vegetables with various added ingredients.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>But aren\u2019t cold, liquid-base dishes like gazpacho (unless you like hot-spacho) and ceviche themselves soups? There\u2019s certainly a case that they are. And if meat and heat aren\u2019t requirements\u2014not to mention the fact that cereal grains like rice are acceptable in soup\u2014what\u2019s to say that a bowl of Cheerios can\u2019t count as a cold soup?\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Well, that depends on whether or not we\u2019re counting milk as a broth. Any broth-based meal served in a bowl would seem to fit the criteria for soup, regardless of its temperature. But while drinking a glass of milk is totally normal, you\u2019d get some weird looks if you decided to chug a pint of chicken stock. Does the act of placing any liquid into a bowl automatically merit its reclassification as a broth?\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Don\u2019t even get me started about oatmeal\u2019s role in all of this. Cereal\u2019s devious sibling reintroduces the warmth that strict-constructionist soup-ists find essential, but it loses some of the innate cereal-ness. That\u2019s because making oatmeal is more than a two-step process. Regardless, to introduce it into the discussion requires us to flip the script and define what cereal is. Not today, Satan.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>So who really knows if cereal is a soup. Exploring the issue has me feeling like I\u2019m further away from understanding the subject than when I started. It\u2019s one of those debates that will rage indefinitely without arriving at any sort of meaningful consensus. I\u2019m on the verge of dumping Lucky Charms into a bowl of Campbell\u2019s chicken noodle in some sort of misguided attempt at compromise.\r<br>\r<br>Perhaps what makes a bowl of breakfast cereal such a breakfast staple is that, much like the hot dog, it doesn\u2019t fit neatly into the rigid categories we rely on to introduce reason and order into our chaotic world. All I do know is that referring to your next bowl of cereal as \u201cthe famous sweet breakfast soup we all know and love\u201d is sure to spark a spirited discussion\u2014or some coffee thrown in your face.<br><br><br><br>And yes, I did copy and paste this.

Just like English speakers never (or at least, rarely) say &quot;I can stand this&quot;, you&#39;d never say &quot;jeg fordrar dette&quot; in Norwegian, &quot;fordra&quot; actually sounds very negative, and people tend to interpret the word itself as a synonym to hate, dislike, etc..

We ended on dinosaurs and I was so excited to discuss them with him the next day in nursery but I broke my arm and didn&#39;t go to nursery again (because it was near the end of the year). I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had such an imagination-driven conversation since then. I wish I could meet him again, see who he grew up to become (I&#39;m only 16, but still, most of your personality is formed by now) I have no idea what his surname was and can barely recall his first name-Konrad, but I can remember our vivid conversations like a narration of the world, unfolding with every excited word. I matured from discussing Santa clause and dinosaurs to time travel,  multiverses and higher dimensions and I wonder if he&#39;s the same. Now, i have no one to share my thoughts and ideas with, because my friends are more keen to discuss what a boy tweeted at them than quantum mechanics :(.

The words for the verb and noun in German are zeichnen and Zeichnung, respectively, with the -ung ending being pretty much a 1:1 equivalent to the English -ing ending. However, while English also uses the -ing ending to form a verb in the progressive aspect, German does not; it rather uses an ending of -end (e.g. zeichnend, bauend) for the equivalent of the English progressive aspect, while the -ung ending is strictly for substantives (nouns).

I imagine that if we discovered a way to make everyone live forever, but had to give up children at the same time (to prevent the quick overpopulation of the Earth), people would rue the day. Most would eventually find it to be the worst choice ever made and we&#39;d all wish for there to be a child in the world. We want what we can&#39;t have and what we would be sorry we got.

The examples are endless, and for me as a non-English native speaker it also makes me sound like an American hit in the head with an Oxford dictionary or something since I might mix and match both languages or dialects.<br><br>But, this is also kind of the charm with languages, and I recommend everyone to at least learn one foreign language.<br><br>Oh, and I refuse to see cereal and milk as a soup.", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T02:23:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jesse S.", "comment_text": "Hey Vsauce in my bible it said Michael Stevens edited it.", "comment_date": "2015-01-08T02:16:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ghosts289", "comment_text": "Hey Michael I have a question.

For example, homophobia, which is a fear or dislike of homosexuals and/or homosexuality. People use the fact that it contains the suffix &#39;phobia&#39; to argue that they&#39;re not homophobic because they only hate gay people, they&#39;re not afraid of them. Yet they don&#39;t argue to change words like lunacy (luna meaning moon), or the months September, October, November, December (because they&#39;re the ninth to twelfth months, not the seventh to tenth as the names would suggest.) The current definition always wins out above the meaning of the individual parts of the word. Similarly, someone can identify as bisexual and be attracted to men, women, and non-binary people.

In essence the CRPG became more prevalent and accepted than RPG and it toke over the term RPG. Today this means that if you say you are going to play RPG people assume you are playing a computer game. Presently the old RPG is missing an abbreviation.

Dry cereal can be eaten plain and you&#39;d still be eating cereal, where as you cannot eat lettuce plain and be eating a salad and you can&#39;t eat, say, chicken plain and be eating a soup. Milk is not a necessary component like how icing is not necessary on a cake for it to be a cake and ketchup on french fries is not a necessary component for them to be french fries. You could then argue that dressing, the liquid component, isn&#39;t necessary in a salad but I&#39;d argue that salads are whatever people commonly agree on calling a salad considering potato salad and fruit salad share almost no resemblance to traditional salads but we still call them salads. So there are pretty much no requirements to be a salad (you can very well have a salad on either a plate or a bowl) except people have to commonly agree on calling it a salad. So until I&#39;m eating sugary salads for breakfast it&#39;s a meal and condiment.

Everything you can think of, it all is meaningless without you to give it meaning. The problem with how we communicate, however, is that language is subjective. Something for one person could mean something totally different for another. So in the end what value does our language hold? If the sole purpose to communication is to allow us to understand eachother and our language is incapable of properly doing so, then is it not a failed system?
