So the wheel is responsible for usury and the division of society into classes as well.<br><br>So, I could envision a stationary aquatic lifeform which uses a wheel to bring food into itself faster than passive feeders. I could also envision it having a way to inject lipids into a chamber between the axel &amp; wheel to keep friction from tearing the organism apart. I think the biggest hinderance is developing an apendage which would evolve into detaching itself from the rest of the organism. Even then, to be sustained the wheel would have to have to consume some of the food it delivers to the main organism. It would also need a way to respire and remain in homeostasis.

The road gets built. <br><br>Government B also wants to move supplies/people between place A and place B, for the same reasons.

Species with multiple physiologically distinct castes (again, like eusocial insects) would be especially suited for this, since one or more castes could retain legs for the purpose of building new road systems more easily while a colony is still being established. Their exoskeletons also seem like a plausible starting point for the evolution of such a system, since chitin is strong, lightweight and easy (biologically) to work with, and could probably even evolve to be selectively mineralized (like the shells of some crustaceans) in the wheels for greater durability.<br><br>As for the benefit during the course of evolution, perhaps they evolved from small aquatic vortex feeders with small limbs inside the mouth with wheel-like structures on the end used to generate the aforementioned vortex to draw in food passively, but had to evolve a more active feeding mechanism due to changes in their local environment, leading to these limbs becoming externalized and used for propulsion, as well as the species gradually growing larger and more mobile. These limbs were coincidentally somewhat capable of traversing terrestrial environments similar to a wheeled vehicle, albeit not all that well, so they eventually evolved into some of the first partially (and later, fully) terrestrial animal life to feed on the at that time unexploited (and thus numerous) plant-like life on land.

Today I happen to think the same thing as the main reason. Like you said, passing nutrients etc. would be very difficult, but also sealing the contact point (circle/cylinder?) between axle and wheel, and having a &quot;bearing&quot; to maintain the constant rolling friction, these are not what a biological system would be good at. And if the wheel should be powered, how the hell would biology accomplish that?! Therefore evolution never &quot;tried&quot; it.

If you&#39;ve spent a while cruising the wilderness on an off road motorcycle or mountain bike, you&#39;ll know that animals absolutely do make trails that are smooth enough for wheels.  These trails are emergent rather than engineered; the trail is made just by the movement of animals, who prefer to use it because it&#39;s easier.  An automatic positive feedback loop.  You can go FOREVER on these trails.  They&#39;re actually dangerous because they let you go so far away from human-planned routes, VERY quickly.  You can get lost in the spider web in minutes.<br><br>Or consider this.  There exists such a thing as a motorcycle desert race.  Point A has a start line, point B has someone waiting for you with a gas can, and in between is just the Mojave.  Sand, brush, rocks, and wheeled vehicles hauling ASS across it.  If you think you&#39;re going to get on the Interstate and get in front of them, you&#39;d better have a good radar detector or be a fan of the back half of the pack.  <br><br>Roads definitely are required if you want a biological Mercedes E350 sedan to evolve.  But wheeled vehicles are pretty flexible, especially in regions with firmer and less obstructed ground like plains and deserts.  I think the bigger problem is the irreducible complexity, AND the mechanical question of getting blood and nerves past an axle &quot;bearing&quot;.  Axles and bearings also require some good lubrication if it&#39;s going to last any time, let alone a lifetime.  Then you need to come up with a kind of muscle that makes rotational motion rather than linear motion.  Those problems mostly go away at cellular scale so I think that&#39;s why the bacterial flagellum is about as close as you get.<br><br>By the way, you don&#39;t need taxes to build roads.

In the book, in a parallel universe, there exists a race called the mulefa. They&#39;re described as looking like a mix between elephants and antelopes, but with their limbs in a diamond shape instead of a rectangle shape, and they ride around on wheels. All across the terrain of this world are smooth &quot;roads&quot; made of volcanic rock, and immensely tall trees that bear hard flat circular seed pods. The mulefa&#39;s front and back legs have a single curved claw, which they put through the softer center of the seed pods. So the seed pod is the wheel and the claw is the axle.  The book describes the relationship between the mulefa and the trees as being symbiotic: riding on the seed pod wheels wears them down and causes them to crack open, which is the only way to release the seeds so they can be planted. In return, the oil from the center of the seed pods is absorbed into the mulefa&#39;s bodies through the claw and increases their intelligence.", "comment_date": "2017-09-09T20:28:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tronic Yaka", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAGEOKAG0zw&amp;t=0m43s\">0:43</a> what a balance!

In fact quite the opposite, other animals using the roads you make could provide a serious advantage in the sense that those animals would likely shift to not eating you in the hopes that you would make more roads as we have seen in many other symbiotic relationships. (crocodiles and birds, for instance) I would posit that the issue here is simply return on investment. A giraffe growing a slightly longer neck is not a huge leap in terms of the required resources it takes for the giraffe to survive. On the other hand, building the biological tools to make a semi-smooth road and then maintain it while also ensuring that whatever is on the other end of that road is worth all the effort is very challenging and requires specific circumstances to even be useful.<br><br>Let&#39;s make the assumption that an animal suddenly evolved the tools to build a mile long road within the span of a week and could maintain said road using 25% of the time it spends awake. Even assuming that the animal has already constructed the road and recouped the resources/energy used in doing so, what could be along this road that would radically improve the animals overall lifestyle? The only circumstance I can think of is connecting a reliable and good source of water that is not a good source of food (rare in and of itself) to an area that is conversely lacking water but a rich source of food. (perhaps even rarer) This does not even take into account that the wheel would likely get in the way of hunting off of the road which means it almost certainly would only work for an herbivore. So now we have an herbivore that has an extremely predictable lifestyle which is easy to find and can only flee or chase along a set path that is easy to follow and finite in length. Does this sound like a successful animal to you? It doesn&#39;t to me.<br><br>And as a side note, in a way ants and bees have taxes.

When it contacts the ground, it combines a small &quot;Arc&quot; of pushing force, not unlike spinning part of a wheel, and a bit of pushing force away from the ground, like a small jump.

Even in America, the interstate system was built by Eisenhower to make it easier to send equipment and resources from one side of the country to the other in case of a Soviet attack. If you actually look at where the interstates travel, most travel near various locations of military outposts and major cities, because that was where they were needed the most for defense.<br><br>Also, many animals make trails, most notably ants, which use them for efficient transport. Army ants are most famous for this hauling large amounts of prey along their trails after an attack. Humans also started with trails, and as you stated rails preceded roads in many places.

The wheels are not part of their body but are the seed-pods of trees that take roughly the shape of wheels and are coated in oil to allow frictionless movement, thus eliminating the problem of moving parts on the same body. This relationship between animal and tree is mutually beneficial, because the seed-pods crack open after a while and help to spread the seeds of the tree. The world that these creatures live in on the other hand is covered by road-like natural structures that (if i remember correctly) formed out of cooled lava and are smooth enough for the creatures to ride on extremely fast.

Seriously, let&#39;s think about it, when we evolve we don&#39;t have any say in what happens. If a creature has to move to a wetlands where they&#39;re normally in a dessert, and over time they develop gills and fins, it just sort of happened. I&#39;m no master of the universe, myself. But it&#39;s very clear they didn&#39;t /decide/ to get gills and fins BECAUSE it&#39;s easier to survive in the wetlands, but it just sort of happened and tends to help. Stop acting like it&#39;s a concious or subconcious act. We don&#39;t have wheels because humans invented the concept.

At first, the species weren&#39;t all that smart. They lived in caves, they simply hunted and reproduced for their survival. But, as the decades and ages went by, they got smarter, doing more and more ingenious things, evolving in a way that allowed them to create and do things they couldn&#39;t have done before. As even more time went by, the species ended up spending no where near as much time simply on survival, and more time on creating, building things, making things better. Trying to create a world that the species could live peacefully in, without any threats, any worries, be able to make the earth the perfect place for the generations to come. And that species did, obviously, create the wheel, but they have also created so much more. They created other inventions that have shaped the way the Earth is forever. They are in some ways making the physical Earth worse, harmful climate change, holes in the O-Zone layer, etc. But, they have also made and done things that no other animal or even the ancestors of the species could have ever dreamed of. That species, the one you have just read about that I spent my time describing, is you. The reader, so be proud of that fact. Be proud that your species has evolved so far from the cave-dwellers it used to be. Be proud that your species is the NUMBER ONE intelligent species on the face of the EARTH. And don&#39;t you waste this opportunity that you have to make this species even better, do all you can to be better, and make the world a better place for your siblings to live in.<br>Thank you for reading this wall of text, I hope it is useful and/or inspirational.

First off, roads aren&#39;t absolutely necessary for such animals to exist. There&#39;s a lot of flat surfaces that they can use to wheel around, dried lake beds for example. The problem with these surfaces is that if our creatures have no ability to control their movements, like tumbleweed that totally depends on wind, it wouldn&#39;t be a profitable evolutionary strategy because of the windrose which results in the log run in some kind of a drifting of all wheeled community to some corner of that lakebed where it would die out. But there&#39;s actually a kind of the wheel that nature could invent to make some animals evolutionary successful. Let&#39;s imagine some turtles who would shed their shell like snakes who shed their skin. Shellless &quot;turtles&quot; are helpless and could be easily eaten up so they would have to stay in their old shells until a new one has fully formed. Some of them would find out that they can use these shells to move around while being totally safe. And these hypothetical creatures would thrive if there would be some large flat lakebed around.

As sea levels fluctuate or other evolutionary pressures push it into dry land, it grows these secretions to spheres big enough to support its weight and roll around on. I know, it&#39;s not exactly a wheel, but it solves the problems of an axle or gear differentials, and the organism can still secrete stuff to grow/maintain the sphere.<br>Now for &quot;selfish&quot; roads:  in relatively flat terrain,  on the seashore or river  valley, these rollers may have limited mobility,  but enough to flatten the terrain with repeated use, wearing ruts that become proto- roads.  What are they going after?  Best bet for survival is to be omnivorous,  like bears. They can bushwhack through vegetation for the stuff they like, occasionally flushing out live prey to catch, and pooping out the seeds along the roadside.  Soon  the vegetation growing alongside the road is skewed towards what the rollers eat. More rollers come and expand the road,  encouraging spread of seeds and migration of prey animals who have easier transportation and abundant food along the way.  Now the rollers have &quot;speed traps&quot; <br>along their highways, running down the prey animals, or set up snares to lure them (think of Wile E. Coyote setting up free birdseed for the Road Runner). <br>Repeat this process over evolutionary time, and you can have a system of roads criss-crossing, overlapping, competing, altering the planetary landscape and encouraging the spread of numerous other species, with the rollers as maintenance crew and toll collectors. If you saw it from space, you might think it the work if an intelligent species.  But none if this would require a level of intelligence beyond giant beavers building dams and clearing woodlands (these actually existed during the Ice Ages,  I think).", "comment_date": "2014-04-13T06:45:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "00100000station", "comment_text": "Leave that ATAT baby ALONE!!", "comment_date": "2014-04-12T14:15:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "00100000station", "comment_text": "Geckos have wheels.", "comment_date": "2014-04-12T14:14:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rejeeve Smith", "comment_text": "That robot is gonna give me nightmares", "comment_date": "2014-04-11T06:37:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlinkDirt", "comment_text": "Ahh, at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAGEOKAG0zw&amp;t=0m47s\">0:47</a> the old youtube layout. : &#39; )", "comment_date": "2014-04-11T00:45:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Black Hole", "comment_text": "&quot;I Whe-ey mean that in the outro :PD", "comment_date": "2014-04-09T04:24:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rjmprod", "comment_text": "Because they can&#39;t afford the insurance?", "comment_date": "2014-04-08T00:59:35Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Andreas Bisgaard", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAGEOKAG0zw&amp;t=5m30s\">5:30</a><br>you were waiting the entire video to say that weren&#39;t you?<br>-_-", "comment_date": "2014-04-06T06:28:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Argonwolfproject", "comment_text": "I think the whole &quot;needing roads&quot; thing is a bit overblown.

You had mentioned a psyto-bacteria, so from your framing its not a matter of friction bases locomotion but rather the independence of mobility to an outlying mechanism of manipulation(gravity pushing as good as it pulls). not withstanding, I get what you&#39;re pointing to and agree that it is rather uncanny how environment has dictated to form the parameters of the means of function. That being said, lets follow a broader and deeper wave of evolutionary flux and recognize that with the interplay of evolution and the impact apon the environment of the species utilizing it, the evolution of the wheel may very well be an inevitability, as evolution is the product of adaptation and manipulation in increasingly equal parts. My favorite example of this is the feedback of culturo-centric-interface between the lifestyle and environment that accounts for the population density of eastern-Asia and the values at the crux of its indigenous population. Who&#39;s better at establishing an inner world in which to isolate and differentiate oneself than the &quot;orientals&quot;(I&#39;m Korean so its okay for me to use that term that way :)), That ability accomodated further movement anthropologically toward the conditions which necessitated them in the first place.
