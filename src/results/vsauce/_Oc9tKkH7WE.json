Before I arrived in Australia, I was in Singapore, where it was also beautiful but incredibly humid. The air felt thick to move through and breathe, but in actuality humid air is less dense then dry air. Derek, tell us about Avogadro&#39;s law.<br>Well, Avogadro came up with the idea that in a given volume of gas at a given temperature and pressure, there will be always the same number of gas particles. Doesn&#39;t matter what the gas is, If it&#39;s helium or nitrogen or oxygen.<br>And that holds truth for air which is a mixture of gases. That&#39;s right, So, it&#39;s got nitrogen and oxygen principally. But if it&#39;s humid air, then you replace some of those nitrogens and oxygens with water.<br>And water is wider than the diatomic nitrogen and oxygen that exists in our atmosphere.<br>That&#39;s right. Oxygen and nitrogen have masses of 32 and 28, whereas water is just 18. Humid air is actually much less dense than dry air. It&#39;s lighter and things can move through it more easily. This is especially true when it comes to baseballs. A baseball travels through humid air more easily and further, with the same amount of energy. If air becomes more humid and decreases drag by only five percent that can mean the difference between a fly ball and a home run. This became a problem when indoor baseball stadiums started to play around with the idea of turning on the air conditioning when the rival team came up to bat. Essentially, the air conditioning made the air dryer, therefore thicker and made the rivall team hit baseballs shorter distances. <br><br>The word normal, by the way, is homological.<br>What does that mean?<br>A homological adjective describes itself. For instance, the word tiny is pretty tiny. It&#39;s a small word. The word unhyphenated is unhyphenated. Normal is one of the top 1000 most commonly spoked and written words. The word normal is normal, it describes itself. But there are also words that are heterological ; adjectived that don&#39;t describe themselves. For instance, the word misspelled.<br>Yes well, if you don&#39;t misspell it.<br>If you don&#39;t misspell it. What about abbreviated? Ooo. I like that one, too. What about German? Not a German word. <br>That&#39;s a good one. How about monosyllabic? That&#39;s heterological because it doesn&#39;t describe itself. But polsyllabic? For sure. I especially love just how homological pentasyllabic is.<br>Yeah, five syllables. That is genius. Well, it&#39;s the way words are. The way they normally are. But what about you, are you normal?<br><br>Well a common way of defining normal is to say that something about you is normal, if you fall within just one standard deviation of the average for all people. But there are a lot of things about you. You can easily think of, say, 36 different independent variables. Different things to say about yourself. For instance, how tall you are, how many friends you have, how bad your breath is or, say, how often you lie. Now, the statistical probability that you would be normal for all 36 of those different attributes is actually one in a million. Which means, mathematically speaking,  it is quite abnormal to be normal.

The heliocentric theory, literally \u201cflying\u201d in the face of direct observation, experimental evidence and common sense, maintains that the ball-Earth is spinning around its axis at 1,000 miles per hour, revolving around the Sun at 67,000 miles per hour, while the entire solar system rotates around the Milky Way galaxy at 500,000 miles per hour, and the Milky Way speeds through the expanding Universe at over 670,000,000 miles per hour, yet no one in history has ever felt a thing! We can feel the slightest breeze on a summer\u2019s day, but never one iota of air displacement from these incredible speeds! Heliocentrists claim with a straight face that their ball-Earth spins at a constant velocity dragging the atmosphere in such a manner as to perfectly cancel all centrifugal, gravitational, and inertial forces so we do not feel the tiniest bit of motion, perturbation, wind or air resistance! Such back-peddling, damage-control reverse-engineered explanations certainly stretch the limits of credibility and the imagination, leaving much to be desired by discerning minds. If the Earth and atmosphere are constantly revolving Eastwards at 1,000 mph, how is it that clouds, wind, and weather patterns casually and unpredictably go every which way, often travelling in opposing directions simultaneously? Why can we feel the slightest Westward breeze but not the Earth\u2019s incredible supposed 1,000 mph Eastward spin!? And how is it that the magic velcro of gravity is strong enough to drag miles of Earth\u2019s atmosphere along, but weak enough to allow little bugs, birds, clouds and planes to travel freely unabated in any direction?</b> <br><br><b>We must take it on faith as mathematical proof doesn&#39;t exist.</b> <br><br><b>N.A.S.A. *</b><i>on Speed:</i>* <br><b>The Earth&#39;s orbital speed around the sun is 67,000 m.p.h.</b> <br><b>The sun&#39;s orbital speed around the galaxy is 450,000 m.p.h.</b> <br><b>The speed of the ground beneath your feet, as a result of the Earth&#39;s</b> <b>rotation is</b> <br><b>600 m.p.h. at the latitude of Sheffield (53 degrees);</b> <br><br><b>1,000 m.p.h. at the equator.</b> <br><b>The Earth travels 584 million miles per year (one trip around the sun); that&#39;s</b> <br><br><b>1,600,000 miles per day; 66,667 miles traveled each hour</b> <br><br><b>\u201cThe distance across St. George&#39;s Channel, between Holyhead and Kingstown Harbour, near Dublin, is at least 60 statute miles. It is not an uncommon thing for passengers to notice, when in, and for a considerable distance beyond the centre of the Channel, the Light on Holyhead Pier, and the Poolbeg Light in Dublin Bay.  The Lighthouse on Holyhead Pier shows a red light at an elevation of 44 feet above high water; and the Poolbeg Lighthouse exhibits two bright lights at an altitude of 68 feet; so that a vessel in the middle of the Channel would be 30 miles from each light; and allowing the observer to be on deck, and 24 feet above the water, the horizon on a globe would be 6 miles away. Deducting 6 miles from 30, the distance from the horizon to Holyhead, on the one hand, and to Dublin Bay on the other, would be 24 miles. The square of 24, multiplied by 8 inches, shows a declination of 384 feet. The altitude of the lights in Poolbeg Lighthouse is 68 feet; and of the red light on Holyhead Pier, 44 feet.

For instance: the light at Cape Hatteras is seen at such a distance (40 miles) that, according to theory, it ought to be nine-hundred feet higher above the level of the sea than it absolutely is, in order to be visible!

How about mentioning how much water is there in air at 100% relative humidity, which isn&#39;t much, but also happens to be a funciton of temperature. So I&#39;m guessing the effect of air conditioning in baseball stadium for the speed of the ball is more closely related to the density of the gas based on PV=nRT, than on the effect of water molecules, in the end water molecules will only have an effect depending on how many molecules of water there are for molecules of air. Assuming ideal gas (Raoult&#39;s law) on a hot day, say 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C), water vapour pressure is say 65 mbar (or 0,95 psia). Which means there will be about 6,5% water molecules in air. The molecular weight of air goes down from 28,8 to 28,1, or 2%, but the effect of density (on ideal gas law) is about 7%.<br>Also water will not entirely behave as an ideal mixture because it is at (for water) hig pressure and low temperature, ideal works best for high pressures and low temperatures. Probably some viral equations would be more accurate. Also viscosity is quite closely related to fluid flow, about the same as density (look at the Reynolds number), but it also depends on the mixture, and mixing rules for that are not quite as easy. Although also viscosity of gases increases with temperature, so maybe the baseball stadium is unexpected, but the explanation was a bit oversimplified for my taste (while it wasn&#39;t wrong).", "comment_date": "2015-09-11T15:33:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chappy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Oc9tKkH7WE&amp;t=8m02s\">8:02</a> no i m autistic.", "comment_date": "2015-09-10T19:05:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tytan", "comment_text": "Do more of these random/surprising things!", "comment_date": "2015-09-10T17:10:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Fitzgerald", "comment_text": "So is no one going to question the bathtub?

Youtube has started doing surveys before videos now!? :/ My reaction was, aloud, &quot;Ahhhhhh shit!&quot; Do we not get enough advertisements as it is? Now we&#39;re getting mined for information about what channels we watch and/or know of? Can&#39;t we just enjoy videos without all the distractions? YouTube is about CONTENT and quality of said content after all not solely views/revenue... This is why we can&#39;t have nice things! We just twist good things into monstrosities of profit like what YouTube has been slowly gravitating towards. By all means people deserve to get paid for the work they put into their quality content, setting up a set/camera, vlogging, research, etc but does YouTube really need to have more statistics on us when YouTube already has an analytics function? Y u no let me watch video!? <b>troll face</b> Lmfao :D\u00a0I had to rant because I saw an in-streaming survey that I had to answer (albeit a disingenuous answer) before watching your video, Michael.<br><br>And to answer the last question posed, no, I am most certainly NOT normal and that&#39;s a part of being intrinsically human. People are biologically and psychologically/socially built for complexity. Normality is a construct that we&#39;ve created to assess other people who are out of alignment with what our brain has experienced before. There are always variants even of labels or identifiers which are just descriptors of what we&#39;ve agreed upon to name things, groups, people, etc.<br><br>Another example is that even physical attributes like race or birthmarks in similar areas and of similar sizes on two people&#39;s bodies are variable and given to subjectivity by the person who possesses said attribute. Perspective plays a role and we can only experience our first hand account of externals. Take me for instance. My anxiety/mood shifts affects me deeply while the same stress inducing stimuli, say in a work situation when we have a lot to do, doesn&#39;t even phase my coworker. They even thrive on it. Neural pathways in my brain have been formed and triggers set. My brain has made my body accustomed to certain physical symptoms (chest pains, shortness of breath, etc.) when those triggers are &quot;tripped&quot;. So the person without anxiety is in THEIR version of &quot;normal&quot; which actually isn&#39;t totally &quot;normal&quot; as they also experience stress and anxiety to a lesser extent too in their own life. It&#39;s a matter of degrees plus perspective and the interplay between self and &quot;other&quot;. It all starts first with the individual perspective of those involved. But the only perspective you can know for certain is yours. Even with deductive reasoning about someone&#39;s thoughts, meanings and intentions you may only be half &quot;right&quot; as their feelings and thoughts make then an island. You can logically TRY to guess what someone thinks but you won&#39;t know for sure until you ask. And even then things can get misinterpreted or they don&#39;t tell the whole story in a clear effective way.<br><br>Our brains are, let&#39;s say, catalysts. The information within causes an action. Some of which like picking something up are on a subconscious instinctive level. We just pick things up without thinking. We do these things because they are actions that have been proven to produce a result. The old idea, that I heard years ago, goes that you don&#39;t think &quot;How do I sit in this chair?&quot; you simply sit down trusting that the chair is stable to sit in. Thoughts breed actions and then causation occurs. We create thoughts and then use those thoughts to garner movement to &quot;make shit happen&quot;! Lol Like a computer program. With a program you execute and then once it&#39;s running you have &quot;solved&quot; what is an idea i.e. causation. An idea in an idea. Ideaception! A computer program first started out as an idea in the perspective of one person possibly with colleagues. So our brains are all, metaphorically, computers. They both work in much the same way. We have a thought/desire and we execute based on synapses firing carrying information. We have figurative &quot;pockets&quot; and &quot;compartments&quot; in brain structure much like a computer&#39;s designated folders. While it is simplistic to call the brain a computer there are easily categorized similarities. With anxiety my brain decides it wants to run in safe mode ;) Anywho, I&#39;ve sufficiently rambled enough.\u00a0<br><br>Great video as usual with all these mind stretching facts. I&#39;ve been catching up with your videos and getting my daily dose of learning today. I&#39;m loving all this deep thinking I&#39;ve been doing while editing this novel of a comment.

And indeed this makes some painting or sculptures craft and not art. A statue made to realistically represent a person would be craft and so would be a purely realistic painting, one that is a pure attempt at capturing a moment. Like a photograph, it &#39;s a craft but not an art. (Sometimes phothraphs can be art, if something is captured in a way that makes it ambigues or when it is used as a metaphor)&quot;. So I argue to know &quot;if it is the &quot;artist&quot; that gives the multiple layers of ambiguity or metaphor to his work or is some else that finds them and so declares it art. I ask this because many now famous artist died unappreciated by their society and is only now and though our eyes that they became relevant. My point and question is: wasn&#39;t the extra layers already there? how did they go unseen if it is so obvious to us now? is art a universal constant or something dictated by each person or group of humans?&quot;. for the moment I&#39;m really caught up in this and I thought it can be a great topic for one of your videos. bye", "comment_date": "2014-06-14T21:26:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adamcoo", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not normal, I have 3 earlobes and that&#39;s away from the average of people.", "comment_date": "2014-06-14T21:23:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "marios alithineos", "comment_text": "VSAUCE AND VERITASIUM!?

While it is a nice, halfway ominous way to end the video, it also ignores the previously stated definition for normal wherein said person would need to fall within 1 standard deviation from the average of all people. This would make anyone with either 2 breasts or 0 breasts normal. This would also elicit the question - what is the average normality of a given person in all 36 categories?

If Kevin were to live, and Micheal could not be mentioned, that would remove Jake from the equation, making Kevin have a chance of 1 in 2.

Originally, the lack of information given to the prisoners would lead them to predicting either a scenario in which their chances of survival are 1 out of 3 if a survivor is chosen and the remaining prisoners are murdered, OR first 2 out of 3, then 1 out of 2, for a final survival rate of 1 out of 3, again, if victims are chosen at random one at a time. But knowing that one person will be murdered, doesn&#39;t change the outcome of the next random event. If you flip a coin and it lands tails up, then you flip the coin again there is still a 50% chance it will land tails up again. Everyone wants to say &quot;it&#39;s less likely to get tails twice in a row&quot; and sure, that is true, but the question isn&#39;t &quot;What is the likelihood of getting tails twice in a row?&quot; the question is &quot;What is the probability of this next coin toss being tails?&quot; Statistics, probability, it&#39;s all weird.", "comment_date": "2014-06-03T16:34:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Parks", "comment_text": "I know that this is a bit weird but I was thinking something that really made my mind wonder just what if.\u00a0 So here it is, this is what I was thinking.

While I was done with a test, my french teacher (I study in the french system, he&#39;s also a philosophy teacher though) gave me a paper on the Russel&#39;s paradox as he knows that I&#39;m fond of maths in general and he likes to tease at me that it is imperfect any way he can :P Anyway, we discussed it and I told him that, as I explained, the historical context was different, as the definition of sets in the set theory was unclear on that specific point at the time, because mathematicians were too busy discovering more and more properties and consequences rather than building a strong base for the theory itself. It was a mistake that was corrected, as such Russel&#39;s paradox is no longer relevant today, although I notice philosophy enthusiasts like to study it, still, for some reason. I&#39;m not anti-philosophy, very far from that, I just criticize the fact that some people analyze so-called &quot;paradoxes&quot; when they are simply the consequence of mistakes and ambiguity, they theoretically do not exist. I&#39;ll use the first sentence you posted &quot;Well, in philosophy, we seek to find theories that best describes our intuitions&quot;. The word here, is seek, I find that too vague. How can you possibly stumble on anything relevant if you merely wander aimlessly waiting for something to pop in front of you. I prefer the way of maths, you discover a logical property, and derive consequences and other properties from logical reasoning and thinking. And if you somehow discover something else without any basis, mathematicians will never accept it as a truth until you undeniably prove it. I mean, it is a far more efficient way to remove all doubt rather than to write essays and books about something that you will never be able to possibly completely convince someone of :) I hope I cleared my point of view on the matter.

If someone were to be normal, then they wouldn&#39;t be normal in every category, they would have to be normal within enough of the categories of normality to be within one standard deviation. Most people would be within one standard deviation. So most people are normal. In fact his conclusion is contradictory to what normal means, since to be 100% in all categories wouldn&#39;t be normal, it would be extraordinary. No one who is normal is expected to behave or possess perfect characteristics. Normality includes insufficiency, flaws, and irregularities, otherwise you would be perfect, and therefore not normal.\u00a0<br><br>Let&#39;s say it&#39;s 6 categories for one standard deviation. Then most people would be normal within 30-36 of 36 categories. And 30 out of 36 being normal sounds pretty damn normal to me.<br><br>Most people wouldn&#39;t be &quot;normal&quot; if it for example turned out that one standard deviation was something like 19 categories, because then you&#39;d have someone who&#39;s more than 50% out of sync with humanity, and that would definitely not be normal. \u00a0Of course anyone that knows the basics of normal distribution knows the central limit theorem. An average of averages from the same population will produce a normal distribution. Most people are invariably normal, and this includes the minor flaws or outlying aspects of them. This is a necessity of genetic propagation. If we were too diverse, we wouldn&#39;t be mutually compatible, and would then no longer be the same species.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T10:37:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daryll Phaneuf", "comment_text": "I really loved how you filmed a lot outside!

However, that&#39;s a rather sharp point to look at. It&#39;s not much unlike saying flipping 36 coins which all land on 1 is rather unlikely / abnormal. However, any other sequence of coin flips of that length, if you just look at that one single sequence, is just as unlikely. And yet, one of those possibilities is the case.<br>The improbability stems from specifying a single exact sequence as &quot;all ones&quot; or &quot;all zeros&quot; are. If you don&#39;t care about order, so you just ask for &quot;three zeros&quot;, then, of course you&#39;ll get higher probabilities.<br><br>A more sensible method of defining normality would be to take those 36 variables and take the expected value and standard deviation of 36 coin flips with according bias. If you fall on an interval one standard deviation within the expected value, you&#39;ll be normal. If you land there more often, you are &quot;supernormal&quot; and if you land there more rarely, you are &quot;subnormal&quot; or &quot;abnormal&quot;.<br><br>Assuming complete independence (which is unlikely in itself), that would mean roughly 21-27 ones out of 36. - 60.5% - 76.0%. So as long as you are normal in about 3/5 - 3/4 of the cases, you&#39;ll be normal. Anything above that starts becoming a bit spookily normal - e.g. &quot;supernormal&quot;.<br>In the limit of infinitely many variables, anything that deviates from about 68.3% will seem abnormal. If you were able to be tested in infinitely many independent tests, it would be infinitely unlikely that you&#39;d be more often normal than that.

If the inner circle represents the possible outcomes of who lives and the outer circle represents what the guard can tell you based on what those outcomes will be and the restrictions on what he can tell you (which I think is important; the outer circle is what the guard can tell you, not what the guard does tell you), then I fail to see how him telling you that Jake will die removes your chance of living from the side of the chart where he can tell you that Kevin will die; because there are no circumstances that would force the guard to name Kevin or Jake as one of the ones to die, in the circumstance that you live, it shouldn&#39;t divide that section of the chart. It&#39;s alternative. Once one of them is named to die, it removes the possibility of the other one being named as well (since he can&#39;t tell you the fate of both of them), ergo the whole top section of the chart that you divided up is EITHER he tells you Jake dies OR he tells you Kevin dies, not split between the two. Another way to look at it, if you live, telling you that Jake dies does not remove the possibility of him instead having told you in the first place that Kevin would die, thus it does not remove the section of the chart that represents you living where he can (not does) tell you Kevin lives, so that half of your chances of living you cut out still exists. If the guard tells you that Jake will die, the possibilities that exist then are all of those where Jake dies, not just those where the guard tells you that Jake dies. If he tells you Jake will die, then any outcome where Jake dies is viable. If you live and Kevin and Jake die and the guard tells you that Kevin will die, that is still an outcome wherein Jake dies, therefore that outcome still needs to be factored in.", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T08:13:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theagemon", "comment_text": "hmm guess you could say that almost all of us are abnormal wich makes us normal xD", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T08:13:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Bruin", "comment_text": "That&#39;s a nice picture of the Vsauce gang, good job to all 3 of you, keep it up, and thanks for all the entertainment", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T08:12:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheInnovator101", "comment_text": "Glad I&#39;m not the only one that&#39;s thought of this, I was wondering how fast our solar system is revolving around the galaxy.", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T08:11:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lord Orio", "comment_text": "I am ABNORMAL", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T08:11:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tadas", "comment_text": "if I grow beard will I be smart too?", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T08:10:50Z", "likes_count": 117}, {"comment_by": "Jason Last", "comment_text": "Wait so if heterological means a word that doesn&#39;t describe itself then it is therefore describing itself however if it&#39;s describing itself it can&#39;t be describing itself and so on...
