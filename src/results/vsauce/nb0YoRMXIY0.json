The words I&#39;m talking about are monsieur, cinq-cents, plaque, fauxbourg, and rendezvous. They all derive from french. (There may be more, coming from other languages, but I can&#39;t vouch for more than what I just listed as I only know english and french). Each is a bit of a different story. In the word Monsieur (in english, mister/Mr.) you do pronounce the N, but in the way that N is pronounced in french, in that situation. A subtle N sound sort of like &quot;awwn&quot; where the standard english N pronunciation isn&#39;t used. I have never heard of cinq-cents (five cents, or five hundred) used in english, and i couldn&#39;t find anywhere where it told plainly what it meant and how it&#39;s pronounced, but because of this, I would assume the french pronunciation of which you would pronounce the Q as if it were a C or K. It would be pronounced &quot;sank&quot;. Plaque and Fauxbourg are just normal words in french where you don&#39;t pronounce ending consonants, that were somehow adopted by the english language, but they aren&#39;t true english words, I wouldn&#39;t say, sort of like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu (already seen), or vice versa and carpe diem from latin; French/Latin words used to communicate in english, when in absense of an original word for the language. Finally, Rendezvous is near the same story as Monsieur, which is to say, that without the Z, it wouldn&#39;t be pronounced the same way. Instead of ron-day-voo (each syllable equally and evenly) it would be RON-dehh-VOO. The &quot;ez&quot; in this context makes it &quot;ay&quot;, and so without the Z the third syllable would be a complete alternative pronunciation. So this is an example of how some of these letters ARE pronounced, just not in a way that true english words would be. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. Btw, a &quot;true english&quot; word isn&#39;t a real linguistic term as far as I know. I just made it up to be used the way I needed it to be.

of my favorite things in Spanish is that the only silent letter we use is &quot;H&quot; (unless paired with a c &quot;CH&quot;). So, that way you can always know how a word should be pronounced just by looking at it (once you master how vowels and consonants sound in Spanish). English has so many silent letters in different words and situations that it&#39;s kinda hard sometimes, even for native speakers. Also spelling and pronunciation are hard in English.

It is the New Oxford American Dictionary&#39;s and The Trivia Encyclopedia&#39;s hard work that are paid for and that they have, in consequence, stolen; copying definitions out of free online dictionaries like Dictionary.com is unrespectable as well as inconsiderate (to slightly immoral if your site is popular), since your action is potentially steering away attention from the original site with its own definition. However, copying a definition from a dicitonary book (that is already on the path to extinction) or any other dictionary which demands payment is blatant theft. It is analogous (in a magnified analogy, of course) to the free providing of unpaid dictionaries, for permanent keeping, while legally those dictionaries should be sold.<br>I am not justifying &quot;copyright facts&quot;, I think they should be banned: however, any caught stealing definitions or the like using these &quot;copyright facts&quot; should still be punished -- they still committed the crime.<br><br>In addition, facts don&#39;t belong to everyone. They belong to no one. Facts are the endeavours of mankind to transcribe a perceptional phenomenological reality into a rendering of human thought as objective as such rendering can be. They are translations of reality into the conceivable. (The conceivable that is beyond mere perception.) Facts are derivations of reality and reality belongs to no one, they are truths in a sense and truth belongs to no one. Moreover, what is this notion of defintion being fact? The word itself is related or even derived from the very verb &#39;define&#39;. Definitions are subjective. Completely so.

But it&#39;s not ironic, which makes it ironic, but that would make it not ironic...<br>It&#39;s like Stephen Colbert&#39;s perception on the song &quot;That&#39;s What Makes You Beautiful&quot;. <br>The songs says: <br>&quot;You don&#39;t know you&#39;re beautiful,<br>that&#39;s what makes you beautiful&quot;<br>therefore informing the person of their beauty, which takes away their lack of knowledge towards their beauty which is what made them beautiful in the first place. It doesn&#39;t have exactly the same cycle affect as the irony song because after the person finding out their beautiful (in result making them not beautiful because not knowing is what made him/her beautiful) (s)he would have to be convinced of not being beautiful in order to become beautiful again.

Well, a lot of these are weird. For example, &quot;liar&quot; doesn&#39;t have a silent &quot;a.&quot; We pronounce it &quot;lie-er&quot; and the &quot;a&quot; is what makes the &quot;er&quot; sound. So, the &quot;a&quot; isn&#39;t silent, it&#39;s just making a different sound than usual. A lot of letters in this list are simply making new sounds. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s allowed or whatever, but their place is clearly there. In &quot;handsome&quot; there are quite a few people who pronounce it &quot;hand-some&quot; and simply say it fast. The &quot;d&quot; wouldn&#39;t be silent.<br><br>The &quot;l&quot; in &quot;talk&quot; should be an obvious mistake because here in the States we pronounce it &quot;tall-k&quot;. Lastly, my favorite, I&#39;ve heard some people say &quot;prayer&quot; similar to &quot;fair&quot;. However, in the States, a common pronunciation for the word is &quot;pray-yer&quot; but said fast similarly to handsome.

These days it is very popular to count the amount of calories you eat. Calories isn&#39;t something that exists in food but a unit of energy. Some one once told me that one calorie (or as what we call a calorie which is in fact 1000 calories or a KCAL &quot;Kilo-calorie&quot;) is the amount of energy needed to warm one cubic centimeter or a Centi-liter of water one degree. This might be wrong but it is what i have been told and it is from this perspective i form my question.<br><br>So, if humans like plants could use the sun as a form of energy source through photosynthesis:<br>1. How many calories would you get per minute?<br>2. For how long would you need to be in the sun each day?<br>3. How much sun would be too much?<br><br>But in real life we can&#39;t do photosynthesis so.. How many &quot;sun-calories&quot; are needed to make up a &quot;food-calorie&quot; when growing crops or farming animals. Since we grow food from the sun and farm animals like cows and pigs that eat food grown from the sun.<br><br>Well.. That is what i have pondered upon for a while but i haven&#39;t been able to isolate all the variables to ask the question they way that makes &quot;digestible&quot;.", "comment_date": "2014-08-13T20:25:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rodentsnipe", "comment_text": "What about &quot;third&quot; aswell? because it isn&#39;t threerd", "comment_date": "2014-08-13T20:22:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RaffiNGO", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb0YoRMXIY0&amp;t=5m09s\">5:09</a> Good old chubby Michael :D", "comment_date": "2014-08-13T20:19:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "greeniaKs", "comment_text": "Wow that last who let the dogs out fact killed me.

Now that was ironic.<br><br>The director of the company running the trolleybuses explained that it was hotter than they expected and that the doors were opened more often than in regular traffic. Everybod new it was BS... The problem was that the AC unit used was designed for regular buses and not trolleybuses. Trolleybuses experience regular shot outage in power supply when driving over crossings which happens very often when driving in the depot. The software of the AC had to be adjusted so that after a short power outage the AC will resume to previous operation without any action needed from the driver and will not go to default which was just air circulation without cooling.
