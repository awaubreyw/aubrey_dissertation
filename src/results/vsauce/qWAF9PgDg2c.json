Because its too smelly to eat! It&#39;s disgusting! Listen up, guys! Cats are too disgusting to eat. Are we on the same page so far? On the other hand, have you heard of a fish called &quot;sweetfish&quot;? Sweetfish don&#39;t eat bugs. They only eat algae. They&#39;re vegetarian. Usually fish guts are too bitter to eat, but sweetfish guts are delicious. It&#39;s because they&#39;re not carnivores. So with that logic in mind, all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals! Cows, pigs, and chickens! The better their food, the better they taste! Which leads us to this conclusion..

I was thinking about this last night... So, if you were to eat human flesh, would it taste good or bad? Just hear me out! Taking time to really think about what you\u2019re eating is connected to whether or not you\u2019re living a happy life. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s really important. So, there are animals that are carnivores, right? You know, like cats, lions and vultures. You won\u2019t find meat from carnivores like that at a restaurant. Why is that? Because it\u2019s too smelly to eat! It\u2019s disgusting! Listen up guys! Cats are too disgusting to eat. Are we on the same page so far? On the other hand, have you ever heard of a fish called \u201csweetfish\u201d? Sweetfish don\u2019t eat bugs. They only eat algae. They\u2019re vegetarian. Usually, fish guts are too bitter to eat, but sweetfish guts are delicious. It\u2019s because they\u2019re not carnivores. So with that logic in mind, all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals! Cows, pigs and chickens! The better their feed, the better they taste! Which leads us to this conclusion... Humans would taste gross because they eat meat! Well? How do you like the opinion I came up with?

Divide the batter evenly between the pans, smooth the tops, and bake for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until a cake tester comes out clean.<br>Step 4: Combine 1/2 cup granulated sugar with 1/2 cup lemon juice in a small saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar dissolves. When the cakes are done, allow to cool for 10 minutes. Remove the cakes from the pans and set them on a rack set over a tray or sheet pan; spoon the lemon syrup over them. Allow the cakes to cool completely.<br>Step 5:For the glaze, combine the confectioners&#39; sugar and the lemon juice in a bowl, mixing with a wire whisk until smooth. Pour over the tops of the cakes and allow the glaze to drizzle down the sides.", "comment_date": "2020-06-09T19:04:54Z", "likes_count": 178}, {"comment_by": "Half Life Cockroach", "comment_text": "I guess I\u2019m pretty human...", "comment_date": "2020-06-09T17:39:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "azhan64", "comment_text": "Why you can talk", "comment_date": "2020-06-09T14:48:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Rajeck", "comment_text": "DESCUSTING!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-06-09T11:54:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cosmic Pro", "comment_text": "Vsauce is scaring me", "comment_date": "2020-06-09T11:41:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Mekonnen", "comment_text": "Micheal: You are eating human right now <br>Police: \ud83d\ude26....BAN FOOD NOW BAN FOOD NOW!!!!<br>Strangers: <b>eats a kid</b> I\u2019m so dead", "comment_date": "2020-06-09T02:14:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Storm Weaver", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWAF9PgDg2c&amp;t=6m59s\">6:59</a><br>So That Means Im Constantly Eating A Powerful God That Creates And Controls All The Storms In The Universe?<br>I Didn\u2019t Think So", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T22:10:42Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Questionable Goods", "comment_text": "I am concerned.", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T21:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperiorBeans \ud83e\uded8", "comment_text": "Eww", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T20:13:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nolan", "comment_text": "\u201cYou are what you eat\u201d<br><br>I ate to much spaghetti <br><br><br><br><br><br>Now I regretti", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T17:40:48Z", "likes_count": 5047}, {"comment_by": "Rebecca Fredette", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWAF9PgDg2c&amp;t=0m01s\">0:01</a> why", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T15:39:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Faiaj Fida", "comment_text": "I wonder how does his bald taste like?

I was thinking about this last night... So, if you were to eat human flesh, would it taste good or bad? Just hear me out! Taking time to really think about what you\u2019re eating is connected to whether or not you\u2019re living a happy life. That\u2019s why I think it\u2019s really important. So, there are animals that are carnivores, right? You know, like cats, lions and vultures. You won\u2019t find meat from carnivores like that at a restaurant. Why is that? Because it\u2019s too smelly to eat! It\u2019s disgusting! Listen up guys! Cats are too disgusting to eat. Are we on the same page so far? On the other hand, have you ever heard of a fish called \u201csweetfish\u201d? Sweetfish don\u2019t eat bugs. They only eat algae. They\u2019re vegetarian. Usually, fish guts are too bitter to eat, but sweetfish guts are delicious. It\u2019s because they\u2019re not carnivores. So with that logic in mind, all the meat we consider delicious is from herbivorous animals! Cows, pigs and chickens! The better their feed, the better they taste! Which leads us to this conclusion...

You can eat human flesh to learn firsthand or you can ask someone/read the account of a someone who has already done so. In the case of the latter, you&#39;ll see that people who have eaten human flesh did so in a moment of psychosis or where they were otherwise not in their right mind. Indeed, the descriptions conflict with one another, and the parties involved admit to not being of sound mind in the moment. Therefore one cannot trust the accounts of these people. Thus in order to learn what human meat tastes like, you must taste it yourself. However most instances where you&#39;d get the chance would involve illegal activity, and much of this would probably require you to also not be in your right mind. Thus the paradox is made evident. This is an experience which you cannot gain information about based on firsthand accounts because of the nature of the experience, and you similarly cannot experience it for yourself either because

It lasted 8 days. <br>Turns out that most of the inmates used the mutiny to take revenge on a pretty devastating group of inmates that acted as an &quot;enforce task&quot; for corrupt cops, and killed them. Because almost everything within the prison was abandoned by the orders of a judge, the inmates could do almost anything (even attempt to escape via underground tunnels, which failed) and so the 12 Apostles took charge of the situation and started cooking for the rest of the prison&#39;s population and hostages. They used the kitchen&#39;s ovens to burn the bodies of this &quot;enforce task&quot; that was killed by the rest of the inmates.<br>But the horror (I honestly find it strangely interesting, not horrifying) doesn&#39;t stop there, they used the ASS of one of the dead inmates (not part of the &quot;enforce task&quot;, but was killed because some inmates thought he was an undercover cop; poor guy was literally mental) and made empanadas which then used to fed the hostages.<br><br>A few points I want to make: almost everything I know about it is from a book made by a journalist who interviewed one of the Apostles (he luckily made it out of prison and is living a kinda normal life). The 12 apostles weren&#39;t highly organized, but a group of 4 or 5 inmates who wanted to escape and had to accept other inmates that heard what they were planning so they didn&#39;t snitch to the guards.

See, chickens on need to eat a few grains per day, and when they&#39;re dead we&#39;ve got almost 2 kilos of meat, plus the eggs in her life time. A human needs to eat more than 5 chickens a month just to be (barely) alive. And I&#39;m not counting on the liters of water, the vegetables, fruits, milk, etc. And given that in a helthy 100kg adult 21kg are blood and bones(that technically are edible, but not optimal), you had all that work, all that investment, just to get 89kg of meat. Considering that a healthy adult eats 175g of meat everyday, give it or take, a single human would feed 4 people for 127 days. In comparison, a bull (the weight of his eskeleton was removes) gives you 210 kilos of meat, which woud feed those 4 people for 400 days.<br>\u00a0 Although I couldn&#39;t find numbers, it is safe to assume bulls are more effecient, since they&#39;re vegetarian, which means, secondary in the food chain, or, more efficient absortion of energy. What would be a better way to recycle our dead? I say lets bury them so their corpses fertilize land which we can use to produce plants, and, why not, bulls and chickens.<br>\u00a0 Another question comes to mind: why I did this small research?

So my point is, even if those animals who are highly carnivorus predators like say a lion or T-rex if they evolve sapient intelligence like us, they would still be very very much disturbed by the concept of cannibalism just the same as any Aisha, moogle xweetok, etc!
