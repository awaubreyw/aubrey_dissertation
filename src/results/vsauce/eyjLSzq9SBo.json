Link would probably have to use the Giant&#39;s Mask in response. Mario would probably begin thawing the field from above so Link would be smart to try and reflect those fireballs with the Mirror Shield.\u00a0<br><br>Though Mario would probably very easily dodge or reflect that back at Link again... who would do the same. Actually its hard to imagine either being clumsy enough to &#39;lose a turn&#39; at this, given that Mario is air-borne and has a lot of skill at reflecting and deflecting while Link is probably the most skilled video game character at it of all time.<br><br>So after awhile Mario would probably have gained a lot of altitude, especially after Link started throwing bombs into the mix. So it seems like Metal Mario would happen next, and that would mean Metal Mario slamming into the Mirror Shield at terminal velocity. - If you&#39;ve seen The Avenger&#39;s you can pretty much imagine what would happen. If not though, lets just say that that much kinetic energy hitting a super-shield probably leads to &quot;pretty lights&quot; and an energy pulse that would knock both combatants off balance, and thawing the surrounding ice.<br><br>I think after that during such an intense a fight Link would cast Nayru&#39;s Love before going any further, while Mario would access an invincibility star while charging at him. The two invincible warriors would both waste most of their remaining energy on one last attack each; perhaps their final Smashes if you accept them as canonical - if not then perhaps a hybrid of the first Skyward Strike, Super Spin Attack, and Hurricane Spin Attack for Link, and some variation of The Crazy Eight for Mario.\u00a0<br><br>Neither of which would likely have any effect since they&#39;d be invincible. I think Mario would be disheartened, but I know Link couldn&#39;t be by the very nature of his being. With them both so drained I think it would come down, completely, to who messed up first. I think Mario would, simply by getting desperate and doing one last charge. A clear mistake given Link&#39;s Sword being a lot sharper than Mario&#39;s fists.
