Even having 10 balls in one urn and 2 balls in the other just means that 2 ball urn is the smallest and your urn is the biggest, but you know you can&#39;t know how big is the biggest one, so, again, you do not know anything about the size of the urn you&#39;re in.", "comment_date": "2021-06-04T06:31:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sora", "comment_text": "I think corona could answer that question", "comment_date": "2021-06-03T22:19:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quasty Airsoft", "comment_text": "Why do I try to understand these videos", "comment_date": "2021-06-03T20:51:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NobodyWPlays", "comment_text": "I\u2019m gonna be in his space playlists forever", "comment_date": "2021-06-03T02:27:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NggaDatsDexxter", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXXZLoq2zFc&amp;t=0m40s\">0:40</a> EDP445 version: &quot;Is my life over?&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-06-01T18:16:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juli us", "comment_text": "thats technically what sans did,<br>so nobody can win", "comment_date": "2021-06-01T04:38:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hanyir", "comment_text": "6 year later covid 19", "comment_date": "2021-05-29T22:12:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Masternoob Junior", "comment_text": "J", "comment_date": "2021-05-29T18:30:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nazis STILL Hate Me (and Here's Why)", "comment_text": "Soulless life that feels they have to have something proven to them because they think all they are now is all they ever need to be.

It will rain fire over 2/3rd&#39;s of this planet! If you live anywhere near the Pacific, you need to move now!

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\r<br>\r<br>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\r<br>\r<br>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\r<br>\r<br>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\r<br>\r<br>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\r<br>\r<br>He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\r<br>\r<br>He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\r<br>\r<br>He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\r<br>\r<br>He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\r<br>\r<br>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r<br>\r<br>He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\r<br>\r<br>He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\r<br>\r<br>He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\r<br>\r<br>He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\r<br>\r<br>For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\r<br>\r<br>For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\r<br>\r<br>For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\r<br>\r<br>For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\r<br>\r<br>For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\r<br>\r<br>For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\r<br>\r<br>For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\r<br>\r<br>For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\r<br>\r<br>For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\r<br>\r<br>He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\r<br>\r<br>He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\r<br>\r<br>He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\r<br>\r<br>He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\r<br>\r<br>He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\r<br>\r<br>In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\r<br>\r<br>Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\r<br>\r<br>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T09:11:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shaan Singh", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXXZLoq2zFc&amp;t=7m06s\">7:06</a> the USA after fighting wars abroad for 20 years and doing nothing but destabilizing the government and causing havoc for the citizens", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T04:31:39Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "yerr", "comment_text": "we should NOT have rounded that 19% up to 20%", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T00:26:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Traitor's Playground", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXXZLoq2zFc&amp;t=5m33s\">5:33</a> holy shit I jolted upright!

Observing that you are, say, the 100 billionth human being is in no way equivalent to pulling a ball from a bag and seeing that it is labeled 100 billion. The only way it comes even close to being equivalent is if we just pretend that no one else has been pulling balls, I.E., we are the only relevant observer, I.E. forget the Copernican Principle. Much more analogous would be having the balls unlabeled and then making the observation that &quot;We have pulled 100 balls from the bag thusfar&quot;, but of course pulling some number of balls from a bag tells you nothing about the number of balls in the bag except that it is at least that big. It provides no useful information whatsoever about the likelihood of any given number of balls still in the bag. It&#39;s painfully obvious how bunk this is.<br><br>From every angle, the argument is a failure. Let us assume it to be true. Let us say that I observe myself to be the 100 billionth human being, and that I agree that it is quite unlikely that random chance would have me in the first 5% of all humans. The most likely scenario according to the Doomsday argument is that I am roughly 50% of the way through our lifespan as a species, and that there will be a final total of roughly 200 billion humans before our extinction. Great. Now fast forward a while to the 196 billionth human. What will be their perspective? Well, if the Doomsday Argument is true, they will be forced to concede that it is equally unlikely for them to be in the final 5% of humans as it is for me to be in the first 5%, so most likely, one or both of us is wrong-- but neither one of us has a leg to stand on over the other. I am just as likely to be 50% in as I am to be just 5%, and averaging those out only makes things worse. According to the doomsday hypothesis, the more humans there have been, the more humans there are likely to be because by the Copernican Principle it claims to uphold, every human throughout history is equally justified in asserting themselves as roughly halfway through the lifespan of the species-- both in the future and the past. In fact, the only way for the Doomsday argument to be valid for me right now is if it&#39;s also invalid for a huge proportion of the 100 billion humans who&#39;ve come prior-- I MUST be privileged as an observer for the Argument to hold, it DEMANDS it. <br><br>Stupid, stupid, stupid", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T03:09:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gwreeves1987 Reeves", "comment_text": "April 13th, 2029 - Wormwood meteor will hit Earth.

Doomsday argument is junk at a much more basic level than Michael suggests. The argument is a result of gross misunderstanding of what probability actually is. <br><br>&quot;Probability&quot; does not exist in reality. It is only a quantification of our very limited knowledge (ie. ignorance) with regards to the state of reality. For example, we cannot know for sure what numbers will be drawn in next month&#39;s lottery, because we do not know all the factors in play, nor they parameters. Hence, we can only guess based on previous experiences and come up with most likely answer. However, once the number draw is done, we know that this was the only draw that could happen, that its probability was 100% from the start, and probability of any other number combination was 0%. In reality, &quot;probability&quot; of all events (future and past) is/was ALWAYS either 100% or 0%. This makes use of this word nonsensical with regards to reality, rather than our ignorance of it. And using &quot;probability&quot; for past events is even worse.<br><br>This is why IF you knew ALL the factors, their dependencies and UNDERSTAND their influence on the result, you&#39;d know what any such result in the future will be.<br>And so, Doomsday Argument in entirely fallacious, because it treats your particular birth as something that could happen at any time during human species&#39; existence with equal probability. This is false, because your birth had 100% of happening on the day of your birth, and 0% happening on any other day, no matter how great or small the birth number for the entire existence of human species.<br><br>And as for speaking of &quot;probability&quot; or &quot;chances&quot; with regards to past events - it&#39;s quite funny. Let&#39;s look at some common examples:<br>&gt; &quot;Imagine what were the chances my dad would be hit by lightning during his round-the-world trip and end up in a hospital where he met my mum?&quot; - Well, 100%.<br>&gt; &quot;That meteorite hit my car!

Perhaps nature&#39;s intention was for us to create something technological that outlives us, since all technology stems from man that is of nature, and utilizes the Earth itself in it&#39;s production. Thus we were just a tiny grain of sand in a larger beach of nature honing and perfecting the production of organisms from biological as we understand it to technological to us (but perhaps natural to what ever it is we influenced the creation of through technological means)..Does not DNA and RNA resemble some sort of self assembling microscopic machines with their own intelligence? Of course I digress on this. <br><br><br>I invite what will come to pass, even if im not around to see it, because humankind is sick of humankind, so how the hell does it expect to survive or cling to life?", "comment_date": "2019-08-14T09:11:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "100 subscribers with no videos", "comment_text": "It\u2019s been 4 years and I still can\u2019t print Ebola", "comment_date": "2019-08-13T16:55:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Internetuser101", "comment_text": "genocide schmenocide", "comment_date": "2019-08-13T12:49:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Austrian Empire", "comment_text": "That first example are yes no bioterrorism will now be easy", "comment_date": "2019-08-13T01:58:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Moras", "comment_text": "video:human extinction<br>me:oh cool<br>micheal:do u want to get infected with ebola?<br>me : .......???? i&#39;m listening", "comment_date": "2019-08-12T15:44:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Choo", "comment_text": "If we pause a Vsauce video, it will never end", "comment_date": "2019-08-12T15:28:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fish nim", "comment_text": "I&#39;m nauseous", "comment_date": "2019-08-11T08:43:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Stone", "comment_text": "It is inevitable<br>I am inevitable", "comment_date": "2019-08-10T20:55:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Im_ Just better", "comment_text": "This got me fucked up", "comment_date": "2019-08-10T07:36:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The_Phantom_Cat", "comment_text": "We will kill ourselves off withen the next 100 years most likely", "comment_date": "2019-08-10T01:58:33Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mr.Freerobux", "comment_text": "PRO GAMER", "comment_date": "2019-08-10T00:03:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Forty", "comment_text": "Put a indistinguishable force filed around the earth \ud83c\udf0d", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T11:29:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nvhl34", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXXZLoq2zFc&amp;t=7m10s\">7:10</a> The computer must have played spec ops the line before that game.", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T06:23:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "carlstedtmattias", "comment_text": "&quot;The Doomsday argument is not uncontroversial.&quot;<br><br>A total load of bull, it is.

It is based on too many assumptions such as the Kardashev scale, which may turn out.  For example, we probably could be a Kardashev level 1 civilization with our current technology, if we put all our efforts into harnessing all the energy available on earth, but it&#39;s just not practical, and there is no need.  The same would likely be the case with level 2 and level 3 civilizations, in that building the megastructures needed might not be practical, and it may be impossible to keep the structures from collapsing into spheres, or tearing themselves apart due to tidal forces.  There are other ways to make a shitton of energy which might be far less visible, such as harnessing black holes.  As far as listening to radio signals, we might be able to detect a civilization as adanced as our own, if it was on a planet orbiting Alpha Centuri, maybe.  The signal still might be too weak for us to detect.  Even a much more advanced civilization might only be detectable from 10-20 light years, and only if they directed a powerful signal at us.

From that logic, the chance of 100 billion human ever being born was astronomically unlikely. <br><br>Which points out the slightly longer answer: The doomsday argument lacks any merit in the firstplace. It asks: &quot;If 100 trillion humans will exist in total, what are the chances YOU in particular will have been born at this particular time?&quot; As opposed to what, exactly? Somebody else being born in my place? And, how exactly, would that hypothetical person be different from me? If it had the same genes and experiences from me, wouldn&#39;t that still be me? I&#39;m not the product of being drawn from a big hat of potential humans, I&#39;m the product of the causalites that made me. (Genes, upbringing, and so forth)<br><br>And, even if that person was, on some intangliable level, a different person, like had a different &quot;soul&quot; ro whatever, the argument would SEEM equally valid to that person. Regardless of which of all potential humans he happened to be, one from 100 trillion of one from (all the humans born until today +1)<br><br>To phrase it differently: Me being me in particular is not a winning lottery ticket, since the argument would be equally valid for another person born in my stead. If every ticket is winning the lottery, then the chances of winning is 100%, no matter if there are 10 or 10 quadrillion tickets.<br><br>It&#39;s like asking what the chances are that humans enden up on earth in particular, of all the potentially trillions of habitable planets in the universe.

You go ahead and do that, and it is ball 4. <br>That&#39;s pretty strong evidence in favor of the ten ball condition, because drawing a 4 from a set of 1 through 10 is a 1 in 10 chance, but drawing 4 from a million different numbers is a 1 in 1,000,000 chance. By analogy, the size of YOUR Mutton Dagger is also a numbered ball. <br>You are a male who knows approximately what your Clam Hammer measurement is. It&#39;s probably somewhere around 5.5 inches. Importantly, you didn&#39;t get to decide which Johnson measurement you would have. So just like the number 4 ball, your Meat Popsicle is a random sample from the set of all men that will ever live. <br>The Dongsday argument points out that from a set of 10 males, there&#39;s a 50 percent chance that a randomly chosen male, like you, would be 5 inches or shorter. Whereas if a Wedding Wrecker could measure 10 trillion inches, there&#39;s only a 0.00000000001 percent chance that any given male, say you, would happen to have a dong size shorter than 10 inches.

Class reference problem? Sure. But it is also no more probable that you are in the early population than the latter especially given the size of the latter is not something that can be determined (it is in the future) and thus no probability calculation can include that greater set (the numerator is undefined). Finally, humans may have a maximum population possible within the restriction of living on Earth. That is, to support human life, there is only a finite amount of resources and thus some maximum population sustainable. Population is predicted to bottleneck itself at about 10 billion on Earth without nearly miraculous technologies to sustain a larger population. So there is a premise issue in the doomsday argument as well that renders it not sound. Organism populations cannot increase indefinitely; they are restricted by the conditions and resources of their environment. Thus, being human number 100 billion is not an indicator of any conclusion that can be modeled with probability.

New research indicates that the massive flooding of 12500 years ago was caused by several asteroid fragments that impacted the northern ice cap which caused a massive exctinction event that wiped out most of the megafauna of Earth. It also ended an advanced global civilization that existed prior to that event. All coastal communities vanished as the melt water started flooding the coastlines and the sea level got higher and higher. This event was followed roughly 1000 years later by another impact that caused a similar catastrophic flood (melt water pulse 1B) which caused the fauna on Earth to recede again. Humans went through a long period of low resources and most of the population died of starvation. However, a few tribes of humanity survived here and there and we flourished and repopulated the Earth. Some say that the ancient civilization helped us get a kick start on Humanity 2.0 by imparting some of their knowledge from their cycle.<br>So you see, if we can survive an impact catastrophy followed by a rapid change in climate catastrophy and a mass extinction of animal life, then we are here to stay for a long time.

(I&#39;m not smart enough to cite papers, just documentaries that I forget the names of) In around 2004 there was a documentary that described how our moon came to be- from a collision with one of the many hundreds of other planets that used to roam our solar system.  Our moon, in its current orbit, the way it happened here with earth, is a one in a billion (I&#39;m guessing). The moon stabilizes the earth&#39;s axis. Without this moon, the weather on the planet could not be as stable as it is, and almost all non-microbial life would be impossible. And, we may have gotten lucky with the iron core that the moon sort of gave us. Not to mention that we are lucky that this iron core is &quot;spinning.&quot; This core repels harmful solar radiation. The Ne part of the Drake equation is wrong. I believe that it is very unlikely that intelligent life can be found in numbers greater than 1 per thousand galaxies, and I believe this is a wildly conservative assumption (from someone who isn&#39;t a math wiz).", "comment_date": "2017-01-12T17:55:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wil Holland", "comment_text": "Fascinating, the mathematics outside of the problem. Something that I would like to see the math applied to- resources.  If human beings farm, and if human beings fish, the farmland degrades (topsoil disappears, dezertification) and fish stocks diminish. There is only so much topsoil and fish in the world. One belief is that technology can fix it or if it can&#39;t, after a massive famine event, humans would learn to live in balance with nature. This is incorrect. When human encroachment causes key ecosystems to collapse, those will cause larger ecosystems to collapse and they will not recover. When the famine starts, if it is mostly because of lack of topsoil, people will look to the oceans to collect food. If it mostly because of a lack of seafood, then people will look to crops to aid in famine relief. Either one of these eventualities will cause an &quot;Anoxic Event&quot; in the oceans. In the end, it will not be oil consumption, pollution, or greenhouse gases that cause the extinction (although those things do not help) but the act of individuals eating food and drinking water. Humans will not survive this. No technology will fix this.

Ancestors enabled our birth and we enable our ancenstors birth. By looking at the coin, no matter how deeply, it will not tell you how likly the coin is to be destroyed. It will only tell you what that pwercicular flip yeilded. You would have to lok outtside the coin to decipher how long thecoin had. Our lives are a chemicle reaction.

And as civilisations advance there is also a likely increase in the number of individuals being part of thet civilisations. So there are more and more individuum-causable ways fo self destruction and more and more individuums as time progresses, so extinctions becomes more and more likely as well, maybe even exponentially so. First we had the nuke, enabeling a country to destroy humanity, then there were bioweapons which could achieve the same feat from a rogue laboratory and now we see technologies like, bioprinting, self replicating nano bots, self programming ai on the horizon which could enable a single individuum with a bit of equipment to design their own armageddon. Maybe these technologies are the &#39;barriers&#39; which keep the overwhelming amount of civilisations to reach past a certain point in developement, since you would have to be extremely lucky to get all of them under &#39;control&#39; (like we kind of did with nukes) and no civilisations has yet stood strong against all these odds...

Almost like the Halo series. We need to colonize as many planets we can to ensure human survival. As we spread to inhabit our solar system maybe one day we can colonize other solar systems with newer technology. So even if a crazy asteroid wiped out Earth&#39;s humans, we would still have 15 more colonized planets with a healthy population of humans. So for all that to happen we need to have this discussed at a UN meeting where the world is split up into different leaders. Each continent (besides Antarctica) has one elected leader by the people of that continent. The 7th world leader can be anyone from any continent and is voted upon by the whole world. Over time people would learn to accept each other better and peace could ensue. Economic booms would happen and we could focus on space travel and studies.", "comment_date": "2016-07-12T06:27:44Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Shibhansh Dohare", "comment_text": "Doomsday argument is just a fuck logic <del>_</del>.<br>From guys who don&#39;t know maths.", "comment_date": "2016-07-12T05:52:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Rodriguez", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not gay I like vaginas.", "comment_date": "2016-07-11T23:47:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Alisha May", "comment_text": "don&#39;t worry the Winchesters will save us", "comment_date": "2016-07-11T18:31:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mjstirrup", "comment_text": "I could pause an online 2k game and pause it forever then I would lose", "comment_date": "2016-07-11T08:09:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Franklin Gillette", "comment_text": "Maybe we will enter an age of spiritual enlightenment.", "comment_date": "2016-07-10T13:56:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hans Lee", "comment_text": "I am still waiting to print Ebola...", "comment_date": "2016-07-10T03:26:58Z", "likes_count": 425}, {"comment_by": "Darrell Joe", "comment_text": "Can you do one on mind reading?", "comment_date": "2016-07-10T02:38:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SGU Sapling", "comment_text": "yo this dude needs to tack me", "comment_date": "2016-07-09T00:20:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vasil Zahariev", "comment_text": "That&#39;s all well and good, but can Polandball into space???", "comment_date": "2016-07-08T14:29:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saddam Hussein", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXXZLoq2zFc&amp;t=5m08s\">5:08</a> The reason we can&#39;t find any intelligent life out there is because whenever intelligent life starts to travel and colonize space, a race of sentient machines called reapers wakes up from hibernation and kill them off.", "comment_date": "2016-07-07T23:38:11Z", "likes_count": 366}, {"comment_by": "Shou Tucker", "comment_text": "of course I get a Mormon commercial on a science channel.", "comment_date": "2016-07-07T14:42:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JimMcnugget", "comment_text": "Thanks Micheal!

Then there had to be time to form a<br>new star with these elements (our sun), which also needed a lot of time itself.<br>Not to forget time to form the planet and life to emerge and develop.<br><br>So overall, there might be a chance that we are not the only ones in the universe.<br>But we are simply one of the first intelligent life forms, because it takes so<br>long to create a habitable zone, with a star the right size and enough<br>concentration of the heavier elements. <br><br>Maybe we do not see other life forms, simply because there isn&#39;t anyone there<br>yet capable of signaling. <br><br>Maybe, just maybe, WE are the pioneers in the universe, the very first one to<br>discover and travel through space.

There are many, many problems with it, but the most obvious (and readily falsifying) is that the fewer humans there have ever been (the lower your birth order) the more immediately imminent it will predict the end of a species. This reductio absurdum is due to the fact that it fails to acknowledge two things. First, a very low birth order is no less likely, given a random sample, than a very high birth order. So, assuming the same random birth order sampling the argument assumes, a sample in the first 10th of the range is equally likely as a sample in the 2nd, 3rd, or any other 10th of the range. It only seems significant after the fact. Second, and more importantly, the sample isn&#39;t actually random because time biases probability of birth order in descending order. That is to say, the less time humans have been around, the more likely that your birth order is going to be low. Now, just as the actual upper bound for the total of all humans ever is unknown and can be placed arbitrarily high or low, so can the ultimate longevity of the human species, and concurrently the weight of elapsed time changes accordingly, and so the two effects cancel each other out.", "comment_date": "2016-01-07T03:27:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ricaard", "comment_text": "&quot;...an interesting game...the only way to win, is not to play...how about a game of chess?&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-01-07T01:22:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MaroOn Ghan", "comment_text": "the soundtrack plzz .", "comment_date": "2016-01-07T00:34:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shawn P", "comment_text": "humans are not that smart,it&#39;s greed.", "comment_date": "2016-01-06T12:10:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aletheia Z", "comment_text": "Play on everybody!", "comment_date": "2016-01-06T02:18:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aletheia Z", "comment_text": "Doomsday Argument, huh?<br>May the 4s be with you.", "comment_date": "2016-01-06T02:06:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aletheia Z", "comment_text": "One of humanity&#39;s greatest weaknesses is overestimating ourselves, and that may as well get us killed off.", "comment_date": "2016-01-06T02:03:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trevor Williamson", "comment_text": "We will not be extincted but we will come very close.", "comment_date": "2016-01-05T19:37:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alt Puppy", "comment_text": "You&#39;re scaring me, Michael", "comment_date": "2016-01-05T07:02:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Issaknife", "comment_text": "the computer game thing is fucking insane", "comment_date": "2016-01-05T03:00:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Piano Man", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t have permission to access the ebola genome?", "comment_date": "2016-01-05T02:52:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Lima", "comment_text": "&quot;If you pause a game forever, you will never lose that game.&quot; Dat Thug Life Robot.", "comment_date": "2016-01-04T20:49:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Davidautofull", "comment_text": "so where are the other people in the universe? <br><br>maybe the same as us, stuck on a planet and there is no possible way to go to another one.", "comment_date": "2016-01-04T19:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "food channle", "comment_text": "u are so awesome. i freaking love u dude", "comment_date": "2016-01-04T16:36:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dual Iron", "comment_text": "That A.I. is pretty darn smart!", "comment_date": "2016-01-04T02:32:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valerie Polson", "comment_text": "Pretty interesting", "comment_date": "2016-01-03T03:27:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EportChris", "comment_text": "Michael, from a converted filistein I just want to say that your teachings blow my mind.", "comment_date": "2016-01-03T02:29:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anny Coto", "comment_text": "the end of the world is when god comes no won no&#39;s...\ud83d\ude11...", "comment_date": "2016-01-02T17:42:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Locrian08", "comment_text": "Hey Michael - @ <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXXZLoq2zFc&amp;t=7m00s\">7:00</a> is the real threat of AI.

The only problem being that though we may advance to a certain degree of knowledge throughout time and history, we have not ultimately saved ourselves from near extinction. I think every time we hit an extinction level event, some of our species survives(kind of like how we find some species that have genetic connections to dinosaurs in animals) and we have to start over from scratch, losing written word, science, medicine, technology, pretty much all of our advancements. I think this would explain why when we find remnants of past civilizations, and discover that even they possessed some modern technologies even before some of our greatest inventors, scientists, and creative minds have thought them up.

If we did decide to travel the universe our bodies would definitely alter because of the lack of gravity from outer space.

Following that scale we are but a tiny portion of the over all human sample. Using the same arguments as the doomsday argument, if we today account for 5% of the total human population ever and humanity has existed for, lets say for simplicity 10,000 years, then shouldn&#39;t we as 5% really be a tiny percentage of the total and not such a large percentage? Shouldn&#39;t the total population of humans at any given moment in time only be less than 1%? Meaning there should be another 300 billion humans before we become another, small, number. At 7 billion a generation we have another 900 years easy.

One day man invents a teleportation device. Since humans are assemblages of atoms, this machine works by scanning the exact atomic structure of your entire body in its current state, then disassembling those atoms, and ultimately re-assembling your body with different atoms (like a 3D print) from the template, but in another location. That&#39;s &quot;you&quot;, right? Your self, after all, is contained in your brain, which is part of your body. All hopes, ideas, memories, worries about Doomsday, etc. are determined by the state of your material brain. Now suppose the machine breaks, and it does not destroy the original &quot;you&quot;, but still reconstructs &quot;you&quot; elsewhere. Which &quot;you&quot; is &quot;you&quot;?<br><br>This relates to my point about the Doomsday Argument for the following reason. The idea that you &quot;could have been&quot; a person born in another time, say the future, is a non sequitur: it separates self, an illusory brain construct, from the objectivity of human brains, as if one&#39;s self could have equally been birthed into the brain-like shell of a different human being.", "comment_date": "2015-05-06T15:13:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BreakMeDown IV", "comment_text": "Ultron approves.", "comment_date": "2015-05-06T14:12:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Liberator", "comment_text": "Can you do one on nazi moon base?

Like all observations about life I take it from the Earth.  How did we come to be? <br><br> Well we know or assume that life requires a certain set of conditions.  Let&#39;s say maybe 1 of 10 planets could support some type of life.  <br><br>Doesn&#39;t look like it supports my argument so far, so next let&#39;s look at our evolutionary history.  We know trillions of species have lived on this planet and only one of which has our perception of intelligence.  To get here we had 4ish extinction events, which has lead to mammals becoming dominate and then humans. <br><br>Next I&#39;d look at our history, we needed to invent so many things to get to where we are.  Main example I&#39;d point to is agriculture, for which gave us a surplus in food which gave us time to invent other things.  We had discovered/invented math and sciences we had given us a chance to grow in our understanding.  We have invented language and writing which made it so we didn&#39;t have to rely on the brain to keep a thought.  We&#39;ve discovered ways of utilizing electricity and developing technology.  We have also expanded our knowledge about our world, the solar system and the universe.

This technology is currently heavily depended on fossil fuels, and even if we go beyond fossil fuels, who is to say we won&#39;t develop other technologies which can send and receive messages.

Let&#39;s assume we create a newer technology which makes our current tech obsolete within the next 100 years.  Let&#39;s assume we transmit data via gravitational waves or some other method because it&#39;s faster and better.

I thought it was cool because I wouldn&#39;t think of that solution, yet it&#39;s the most logical thing to do under the circumstances. The computer was coded to play the game. Playing the game means avoiding a loss. in the face of a certain loss, the computer made the best decision it could to avoid a loss, which is to pause the game.<br><br>But, when I think about it, was the loss avoidable? When I think of Tetris (mode A,) it starts out as a losing scenario. Mode B is different, but I <b>think</b> Tetris mode A cannot be won. Instead, you keep going until you lose.<br><br>Perhaps it speaks to both the practicality and the lack of foresight of the computer. The computer always did the option it considered was the best option to avoid a loss in the game. It further considered all possible options, including options which a human might not consider. this lead it to pause the game, which in my mind is quite ingenious on the computer&#39;s part.<br><br>But, what if the computer knew it couldn&#39;t win the game from the start? that no matter what it did, it would eventually lose? Would the computer have done the calculations ahead of time and performed the &quot;ultimate winning move&quot; by pausing the game immediately?<br><br>I also wonder if the computer &quot;knew&quot; that the game restarts when you lose, and it could try better next time. When I see an imminent loss, I know i lost the game, but it makes me think of ways I can avoid this from happening. Thinking about those ways makes me want to try again, to avoid the mistakes of the past, and to best my previous personal best. That&#39;s what makes me want to restart the game, perhaps eagerly so.<br><br>But, if the computer didn&#39;t know that, then perhaps that&#39;s why pausing the game like that became an acceptable solution. When the choice seems like a choice between &quot;stalemate forever&quot; or &quot;lose forever&quot; the stalemate can be considered to be a better option. At least it&#39;s not a loss.<br><br>...Or, maybe the computer <b>can</b> win tetris A, or at least keep playing the game forever. Since a computer has superhuman reflexes, perhaps if it learns how to play well enough, it <b>can</b> stalemate against tetris by playing it forever...<br><br>It also makes me wonder what the &quot;win&quot; state for a game of Tetris is. What exactly does it mean to &quot;play&quot; an unwinnable game? What is the goal of playing such a game? Perhaps the motivation for playing a game of tetris is simply to &quot;do well.&quot; Or, maybe the goal of playing such a game is to enjoy it while it lasts. Maybe the enjoyment of the game comes from &quot;not losing...&quot;, then idea being that as long as you&#39;re not losing then you&#39;re winning. But what does it mean to stave off a loss? What reward does one get for not losing when it&#39;s certain that the loss will happen anyway?<br><br>Maybe it comes from enjoyment. as long as you&#39;re enjoying the game, and it&#39;s keeping your mind active, then you&#39;re getting a payoff.

For interstellar travel, some sort of advanced nuclear reactor would most likely be the best fuel source. So in order to accomplish an interstellar journey you would need at least the will and ambition to do so, and some fairly advanced nuclear capabilities, and extensive collaboration and use of planetary resources. That&#39;s not to say that something better might not exist, merely that based on what we&#39;ve seen here, this is likely the first viable interstellar power source that a species would likely have access to. So if a species is ambitious enough to want to travel to other stars, they will need to garner resources from around their world, and likely possess a decent understanding of nuclear physics. This means that an aggressive or exceedingly ambitious race would need to have the ability to essentially wipe themselves out, before they would have a real chance of going to another star system. on the flip side of that, exceedingly passive creatures may not want to visit other star systems. they might be contented with where they are, or if they did they might not want to colonize new worlds, but merely view them, which would mean that there might not be the same systems set up that we would recognize. also a really passive race might be curious about what&#39;s out there, but might not have the drive needed to acquire the technology to explore space. At least as we&#39;ve come, it looks like in order to explore space to any great degree, you need to have the ability and potential to destroy yourself, and the control and temperance not to. That may just be a very unlikely balance to reach. Also as far as we&#39;ve found, Humans are the first dominant life forms on earth to achieve dominance through intellect rather than natural advantage.\u00a0 That need for advancement to survive, is what allows us to progress in the fashion we do. It seems fairly likely that many worlds containing intelligent life might have a dominant species that never needed to develop advanced technology, due to some innate ability or strength.

It is impossible to choose someone at random from a population unless the population is known initially, which it is not: the determination thereof is the point of the argument! Really, what you have is a population of N people, all who will ever live, (ordered by birth) and you are given that there is a #100,000,000,000 (you) in the population. Thus, all situations with fewer than 100,000,000,000 people in all are immediately eliminated, while all others are equally likely up to any additional information.<br>Another clear argument is one by contradiction: suppose that the Doomsday Argument were valid. Then as the population grew over time, each generation would conclude, just as we would according to the Doomsday Argument, for 100 billion is an arbitrary number, that humanity would be about to go extinct. This would continue up to any actual extinction: and if humanity never went extinct, then subscribers to the argument would be continuing to predict imminent extinction literally for forever! This shows that the argument is not a valid argument but rather a misleading effect of one&#39;s perspective as the 100 billionth person. It&#39;s basically the Lottery Argument (or something like that), which states that if a person claims to have won the lottery, they are probably a fraud, as it is extremely unlikely for a person to have actually won the lottery. The mistake in both arguments lies in realizing that neither you as the 100,000,000,000-th person nor a presumed lottery winner is a randomly-chosen person from the respective sample space.

It was an interesting thread, bummer I can&#39;t find it.<br><br>Philosophy deals with the same question. The problem demonstrated here is called the problem of induction and David Hume is credited with bringing it up (it&#39;s something we&#39;ve talked about in uni in my philosophy major as part of metaphysics and epistemology). Induction is a way science uses to test something - if you drop a cube of sugar into a cup of water and it dissolved every single time, you conclude that it always will. Hume showed, as you have naturally noticed, that&#39;s a bit tricky to go by. The full explanation is a bit technical so I&#39;d suggest you google it if you want to see how he fully explained the problem - But basically, if the inductive inference could be invalid in a situation that is plausible to our minds, then it&#39;s not 100% accurate. There are a number of solutions for this one, not one of which is perfect, but it IS interesting.\u00a0<br>The pragmatic solution suggests that we actually use an inductive <b>method</b> and not <b>inference</b> - meaning we strive to get as close to the truth as we can, given that it is not 100% possible to reach it (you could argue here - we could be so far off that trying is pointless).\u00a0<br>The solution based on common sense suggests inductive inferences are so woven into our decision making process that it&#39;s absurd to think it to be invalid. What else could we even go by? (one could argue that what we perceive as logical is dependent on what we <b>think</b> is common sense at a given time - when Galileo discovered that Jupiter has 7 moons, people thought he couldn&#39;t possibly be right for essentially theist reasons. But he was, in fact, right. The very possibility we could be wrong means making a proper conclusion is impossible in this line of logic.)<br>The a priori solution is my favorite out of the ones we&#39;ve learned. Karl Popper suggests the way we deduce things isn&#39;t actually induction, but a priori (=independent of experience) hypotheses that are meant to explain the reason we find natural order in our world. They&#39;re not dependent on a posteriori (=dependent on experience) knowledge, therefore not subjected to the issue of the results in tests and experiments that provide us with a posteriori knowledge.

Let me explain. The problem I see is that it is oriented in a single perspective ; yourself. Let&#39;s say that now you&#39;re born and you&#39;re the 100,000,000,000th human being. You&#39;re going to define every human\u00a0 being that ever existed by all the human that are alive while you are and every human beign that were alive before you. So you&#39;re going to say that if there was 200 trillion it would be improbable that you are &#39;&#39;lucky&#39;&#39; enough to be in that 100,000,000,000 first. The problem arise when you get out of your perspective. Let&#39;s say that you&#39;re the 200,000,000,00th human being, you&#39;re going to say that all human that ever existed and blah, blah, blah. i. e. You&#39;re going to define your &#39;&#39;luck&#39;&#39; the exact same way the 100,000,000,000th has defined it. Now, you could have done the same thing in the past. The 100,000,000th human being will also define is &#39;&#39;luck&#39;&#39; the same way, the thing is, we know that if someone did this 3000 years ago he would have been utterly wrong to come to the conclusion that the human race was going to be extinct soon, using this argument. This whole problem comes from the fact that time is linear(at least in our human mind) and that the human race population seems to always go up and that you can&#39;t experience nothing but your own perspective. So if anyone in far history would have been wrong to use this argument to justify the doomsday, what is the difference now. So, if you come to the conclusion that no matter if the doomsday was tomorrow or in a million years, you would have analyze this situation in the same way and come to the same conclusion, then you can&#39;t use this to justify the imminent doomsday.

It would kind of make sense if we only had two &quot;bowls&quot; with predetermined numbers of balls in them or rather, two possible periods of time in which humanity existed. But instead, we have an infinite amount of them. If you have an infinite amount of bowls with different, unknown numbers of balls in them, no matter what number you extract, chances are a lot higher that it came from a bowl with numbers that go a lot higher than the one you extracted, simply because there&#39;s an infinite amount of bowls with bigger numbers than the one you extracted, but a finite amount of balls with lower numbers.", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T15:34:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anish Sapkota", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t underestimate the power of human evolution...", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T15:32:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sean Moore", "comment_text": "The Fermi paradox is the most convincing reason were going extinct.

The fact is that for you and your brain to exist (which creates your conciousness), you need your exact parents!<br><br>Because this analogy relies on the assumption that your conciousness is the hand picking the ball with the number, it completely falls over after it&#39;s realized that the only way of picking the &quot;random&quot; human birht number is more or less sequential. Thus a beter original analogy would be that you start picking balls from one and stop at a certain ball and the balls are in order, but now the problem is that you cannot anymore say it is more likely that the ball number four you stopped picking the sequential balls is from the vase with 10 ball. The reason this is that set 1,2,3,4 is contained in both vases and both vases start with the same sequense, thus only way to rule one out is to see if the balls continue after 10.<br><br>Well OK now you could say that we could go ahead and point out a random person and assume a birthnumber close to the actual one and eliminate the assumption that it&#39;s the conciousness (i.e. you reading this) being the hand doing the picking. But then again we run into the same problem and we see that it&#39;s not really dependent on how you pick a person. The problem is that again yes the birth number itself is random but for that person to exist it is nessesary that he exists with more or less with his own birth number (we can have some leeway by specualting that the brithing could have taken +/- hour or so). The problem comes back to sequential brith numbers and the fact that the individual has to have more or less his/her own birth number to exist thus not being totally random in the sense that they could exist whenever.<br><br>To conclude this wall of text, first of all thanks for reading this far. By these premises the conclusion is that you cannot speculate the probability of how many people there will be with the number of people that has existed thus far, because of the nessesarily sequential birth numbers. To put it in other words the set of first 100 billion people will be contained in any possible number of people in that are going to live in total (minimum being the current one and maximum is not defined), thus making it stupid to use the doomsday argument as a predictor of impending doom. On the other hand as more time passes there is more time for catastrophic events to occur at random increasing the likelyhood of human demise, but it has nothing to do with the likelyhood of you existing now or later because the fact is that you can exist only NOW and continue to exist only through your life span.", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T11:52:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jase W/ SideFX", "comment_text": "42", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T11:51:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Schmeegle", "comment_text": "Next video idea:What makes things seem surreal? :D", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T11:50:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1ranjeeves21", "comment_text": "in all honesty if it doesn&#39;t happen in the next 100 years nobody here right now gives a shit...", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T11:50:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lieven Van loo", "comment_text": "600k views in 13 houres ... $_$", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T11:48:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Salty Candy", "comment_text": "This is your best video yet.", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T11:48:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Petrusss", "comment_text": "&quot;Humans are too smart to go extinct.&quot;<br>I think humans are too smart to not go extinct.

Is there anything that humans are trying to achieve, such as to document all knowledge that can be known, or to colonize the entirety of the universe? What is the overall goal of the human race? Or even our next short term goal, like to colonize Mars, or bring world peace, or make alien contact? Imagine that the world came to a balance, where everyone is fed, there are no wars, global warming is stopped, and the economy is stable. Everyone has jobs, crime is low, and people are generally happy. What would be next? What do people work toward, besides bettering their own lives? Is it to achieve such advanced technology that nobody has to work, food is free, and people can just enjoy life? Or to branch out among the stars, so that more people can live without overcrowding, and so that the human race could survive an extinction event by spreading life across multiple planets? Or some combination thereof? I think this would make for a very interesting video, and I would really appreciate it if you could consider making one for it.

But they&#39;re not humans, yet they&#39;re doing human things, and we judge their intelligence on their ability to cooperate with us.

Hey should do bird things in their weird ass bird ways. They don&#39;t care about world domination, or popularity, or what they look like, or how &quot;cool&quot; they are. But humans do. They&#39;re all fine with what they have, they don&#39;t need that. They live how they want and only kill in defense or for food. They don&#39;t worry about the future, or have sorrow over bad things that happened in the past, they just live in the now and are on the earth just because they are. That&#39;s what humans need to do, we just need to be human, not the environment polluting kind, but the kind of human that comes by nature.

I don&#39;t know enough about statistics to put exactly in to words what that fallacy is, but I&#39;ll try my best to explain. The argument goes that we are more likely to exist as human number 1,000,000,000 if there are fewer total humans across the existence of humanity. But that isn&#39;t the case. Our existence now is unaffected by the existence of future humans. The Doomsday Argument could also be used to say that the existence of the first humans is much, MUCH more likely if there are only 10,000 humans in total instead of the 1,000,000,000 we have now. When you look at it that way, you can kind of see how the statistical premise of the Doomsday Argument is silly. I will also link here the Anthropic Principle, a principle in philosophy that suffers from the same problem by assuming that our universe must have been created to support life because life exists in it. Again, I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t make my argument more succinctly.

No, humans won&#39;t go extinct through nuclear war. Many among us are over pepping for such a situation. We won&#39;t let an asteroid get near enough to wipe the planet clean of life or let a global epidemic infect every single human being on the earth&#39;s surface. The extinction event that is truly the biggest threat to man-kind could be caused by the hundreds of billions of material that humans have released into the atmosphere since you started reading this comment. The material I am referring to is CO2, a greenhouse gas that humans have been dumping into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. It has been the cause of the harshest winters, the hottest summers, the driest droughts and the heaviest downpours, and it&#39;s something that is being added to the atmosphere at approximately 3 million pounds per second. That&#39;s a whole Saturn V rocket made of CO2 every two seconds. The worst part is, it&#39;s not slowing down. The countries producing the most greenhouse gases are China, India, and the U.S which all have one thing in common. They are driven by consumerism. In the US especially, corporations are pushing more and more consumption of products which in turn forces factories across the US, India, and China to go into overdrive to meet the supply and demand quota. There&#39;s a trend here. The more corporations push consumerism, the more the factories work, the more CO2 they emit, the more times energy issues are brought before congress, the more the corporation lobbyists push for consumerism. It&#39;s a vicious cycle and it is eerily familiar to what CO2 was doing to the atmosphere of Venus (the planet) back in the early solar system. Venus was once a similar planet to Earth, much like Mars was for just the same reason. Mars had too little atmosphere, but Venus on the other hand had too much. In the beginning, Venus&#39;s surface was covered with rivers and oceans just like Earth today, but the larger amount of CO2 in its atmosphere caused a runaway greenhouse effect. Temperatures on the surface slowly rose and the water in the oceans and rivers began to evaporate and become its extremely potent greenhouse gas form. This caused temperatures to skyrocket and the pressure on the surface slowly rose to the staggering 1,323 pounds per square inch that it is today. Sadly, this is a likely fate for earth as well if human greenhouse gas emissions remain constant, and don&#39;t rise. The current levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are around 399.85 (as of January 2015), and it is generally believed that CO2 levels of 500 or higher would cause all of the right conditions for an ocean boiling runaway greenhouse effect right here on Planet Earth. If such a disaster isn&#39;t stopped, there is very little hope for mankind or any other living thing on this lonely planet in a vast universe that we call home. What&#39;s our plan to avoid this disaster waiting to happen?", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T02:20:16Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Muhd Aiman", "comment_text": "Also Science is not Everything and the doomsday isnt about all of that cuz its not true", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T02:19:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Osama Bin Trippin", "comment_text": "Think about the future and the years that go far.
