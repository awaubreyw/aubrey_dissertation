The crater created by the detonation of 500 tons starting at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdHRX7iIAQs&amp;t=3m28s\">3:28</a> on the video,  on the island is affectionately known by EOD as Sailor&#39;s Hat,  I cut my EOD teeth on that island learning up close and personal  the many types of ordnance that were dropped, shot, or projected from days gone by, a great learning experience for me. Spent many days per month supporting Marine ops, sweeps, blowing holes for tree planting, and escorts of visiting authorized civilian personnel. I was also blessed to spend many days there with one of my EOD  brothers for training, and just 2 Seabees down at smugglers cove while we were bivouacked at our hooch at LZ Seagull - 4 souls on the whole island - felt as if we owned the place. So many good memories there sitting on huge rocks outside our hooch watching the humpback whales breaching,  with Lanai, Molokai, and Maui in the backdrop. Flying around with Tom Hauptman escorting a vet out into, in and around the impact areas when the last goats were still there roaming around. Was on the first team to return as a civilian EOD operator to begin the enormous undertaking with many others to rid the island of unexploded ordnance and all traces of human intrusion, with the exception of the Hawaiian ancestors and their artifacts which are sacred to the island, and the Hawaiian people. I was proud to have done my part to help heal the island, it is a very special place to me. It&#39;s a beautiful place, and I wanted to share this story.  So many more stories I could speak of. To my active duty EOD brothers during that time &#39;87-&#39;90 , you know who you are, bless you all, and to all EOD operators past and present who earned the privilege to wear the Crab, God Bless and keep you in his care...as we say, &quot;Initial Success or Total Failure&quot;  This story is dedicated to the 1st.
