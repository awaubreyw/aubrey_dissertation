This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn7ZaT3AgoU&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly?<br>-<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once.<br>-<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current.<br>-<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor.<br>-<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING. This website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000s as a Vision of a 10-speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ <a href=\"http://free-energy.yolasite.com/\">http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity.<br>-<br>This is a diagram <a href=\"https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php\">https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php</a> that looks a lot like the wiring of this former \u201cscience experiment\u201d YouTube video if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology<br>-<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages.

Several other languages don&#39;t attribute their origin to Turkey, so they refer to it as bird of India, Calicut, French, Roman, Ethiopian, Dutch and Greek, depending on the language. None of languages were originally referring to the birds we know in North America, the turkeys everyone else in the Old World is talking about are what we call Guinea fowls. So English attributes the bird originally called turkeys to Guinea instead, and the birds we call turkeys are from America. I think it has something to do with trade lines in the Old World, so each country call the bird after the people they got them from, so like the Malay refer to them as Dutch, the French refer to them as Indian, the Khmer refer to them as French, and all of these are used interchangeably - for instance the French word for the bird we eat at thanksgiving is still d&#39;inde (of India) - despite the bird not coming from India. The Croatians and Hawaiians are closer to correct, they refer to the New World turkeys as Peruvian. New World turkeys weren&#39;t Incan though, they actually come from the Mayans. So not Peru. But close. The guinea fowl, the other bird involved, come from India. The reason the two are mixed up to begin with is sort of like why Indigenous Americans are called &quot;Indians&quot;. The New World turkeys were similar to the guinea fowls when cooked, so they just started using the same name.

But if you speak of the emotion that we call \u2018anger\u2019, you\u2019ll have to provide me with a well-consolidated reason to be angry with you. But what does it mean to be angry? Anger is an emotion that we exhibit when we are discontent with particular circumstances that either directly or indirectly affect us. But what does it mean to be direct? Well, to be sure, directness is the quality of being the brunt of the repercussions produced from engaging in a certain action. Indirectness is the quality of being affected in some fashion, but not in the jurisdiction, per se, in which the certain action occurred. But what does it mean to occur? In a chronology, an event occurs when it takes place, when all other events currently taking place cease to be acknowledged and the magnitude of this particular event is deemed to be of a higher caliber than all of the other events. But what does \u2018but\u2019 mean?

Regardless, the lion has became a major symbol of our country: our coat of arms has it, we have a national symbol that is a stylised lion&#39;s head, one of our two Youth Olympic Games mascots was a lion, and Singapore is often referred to as a Lion City. We even have a Chinese news and current affairs TV show that is literally named &quot;A Date with the Lion City&quot;.<br><br>Interestingly, I once heard a tale on a local paranormal research website (take it with a grain of salt) that the lion Sang Nila Utama saw might actually be a guardian spirit of Singapore in lion form, contemporaneous with one in the form of a tiger. There&#39;s some urban legends that Punggol, a place in the north-eastern part of Singapore, is haunted by the tiger spirit, and once killed several pigs in a pig farm way back when such farms were common here. The paranormal research society did some investigating many, many years back and found a shrine at the now-abolished bus terminus there dedicated to many Chinese deities, including a tiger.

My secondary school English teacher told us the &#39;It\u2019s actually the bell that is called Big Ben&#39; story, so I\u2019m pretty disappointed in him now haha. Never heard of kosher salt. Those oysters that aren\u2019t oysters are called &#39;Prairie oesters&#39; or &#39;Rocky Mountain oesters&#39; (oester = oysters), so we make that mistake and we also call those numbers Arabic and those fries French. There\u2019s no nut in my language\u2019s word for peanut, but there is in my language\u2019s word for coconut. The koala bear is called koala or &#39;buidelbeer\u2019 (which mean pouch bear). But no one says buidelbeer, we all say koala. Eggplant is called &#39;aubergine&#39; in my language (but that\u2019s also what\u2019s called in English right?). Dry cleaning is called &#39;chemisch reinigen&#39; which you can translate to &#39;cleaning chemically\u2019. I\u2019ve always know hamburgers were called after Hamburg. A guinea pigs is called a &#39;cavia\u2019 so no mention of the word pig in that (but again, cavia also an English word right?). Greenland is called &#39;Groenland&#39; (groen = green), so that\u2019s also a mistake we make. Parkway is &#39;parkweg&#39; in my language (way = weg), but &#39;to park&#39; is translated to &#39;parkeren\u2019 and &#39;park&#39; is translated to &#39;park\u2019, so parkway in my language does make sense.\u00a0<br><br>Funny how quite a lot of this misnomers are the same in a different language.", "comment_date": "2014-11-27T18:42:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "olivia", "comment_text": "Could you maybe do a video on Lucid dreaming", "comment_date": "2014-11-27T18:21:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DvL Legendaryy", "comment_text": "Boys name &#39;&#39;Hunter&#39;&#39; be like: c-c-c-combo breakerrrrr.

I&#39;m kind of new to this channel, but do you take requests?<br><br>If so, and if you haven&#39;t already addressed it in another video, I was wondering if you could answer something I&#39;VE been wondering for a while: What would happen if a unit of SPACE was erased/deleted?<br><br>It occurred to me one day when I was using the &quot;Cut&quot; function in either a Word document or a Paint program, and I saw how everything to the sides of it just immediately occupied the space. But, if you erased a unit (say, 1 cubic or spherical centimeter) of space, itself, what would happen? Please note that I&#39;m talking about actual SPACE; not matter, not energy, but the actual, physical fabric of reality. Would the entirety of the rest of the universe, down to subatomic level, all simultaneously (and instantaneously, seeing as it wouldn&#39;t be a matter of things actually MOVING to fill a suddenly empty space, but rather, that space just not existing anymore... this is REALLY hard for me to put into words) shift into that direction, effectively splitting/compressing every atom in existence? What, if any, effect would there be on time, seeing as space and time are linked (in a way I still don&#39;t quite understand)?

Canada has its own states (or provinces) that are united, and that is what makes up Canada. Then there is also calling citizens of the US &quot;Americans&quot; when that should really be anyone from the Americas. You&#39;d have to say Pan-American during discussions or people would be confused. Another one is &quot;Asian.&quot; Many Russians are indeed Asian, but people keep using Asian to describe orientals. People using race in place of species is annoying too, and when people use words that legitimately do not make sense as a name for races. African American is a dumb term for black &quot;Americans.&quot; What if a white guy was from Africa? Sure as hell no one would be calling them an African American, you&#39;d get weird looks. Heck, what if it&#39;s really an African Canadian you saw walking down the street? Or maybe, maybe they are just African? But of course, African isn&#39;t a race, so it shouldn&#39;t be used to describe one. I know words can&#39;t always be perfect, but it would be great if the words being used were actually more accurate and followed some sort of logic.
