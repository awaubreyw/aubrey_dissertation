That&#39;s all of us. All 7.159 billion of us\r<br>in one place. A species\r<br>portrait. It kinda puts humanity into perspective\r<br>and you. So does this. Everyday you produce about one to two litres\r<br>of spit, which means, in your entire lifetime\r<br>altogether, you will not produce enough spit\r<br>to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool.\r<br>So far, 560 billion Lego parts\r<br>have been manufactured and the total number of grains\r<br>of sand on Earth is estimated to be 7.5 times 10\r<br>to the 18th. But here&#39;s the thing:\r<br>how many things are there... total?\r<br>Well, how do you define a thing? Well, let&#39;s say it&#39;s a thing\r<br>if you can think about it or talk about it. If you can call it a thing,\r<br>it&#39;s a thing. This is going to be a lot of things.\r<br>Things can be real, imaginary,\r<br>impossible, ideas are things, things can be looked forward to and things can be in the past\r<br>or yellow or concrete or abstract things can\r<br>happen and some thing&#39;s probably won&#39;t.\r<br>Making a video about how many things there are.\r<br>That&#39;s a thing... that I&#39;m doing right now.\r<br>Let&#39;s count everything.\r<br>Right away, the answer seems obvious. The word\r<br>&#39;thing&#39; is so vague, the answer is clearly infinite...\r<br>possibly... not.\r<br>All we have to do is take the maximum number of physical things,\r<br>things out there in the real world, beyond our minds we could\r<br>in theory measure and add to that the total number of things we\r<br>could imagine. The total number of thoughts possible.\r<br>For the purposes of this video let&#39;s assume that numbers and math\r<br>and the laws of physics exist as part of the way\r<br>our universe is. But the names and representations they&#39;ve been given\r<br>are the products of thinking minds and those things\r<br>are, well, things that we can count.\r<br>And there&#39;s no reason to double count. All of the indivisible\r<br>pieces that make up me, particles or strings or whatever\r<br>are the same as the thing that has been named me.\r<br>Abraham Lincoln has a great quote about this.\r<br>&quot;How many legs does a sheep have if you call\r<br>its tail a leg?&quot;\r<br>Four.\r<br>Because calling a tail a leg doesn&#39;t make it one.\r<br>Okay, let&#39;s begin. When counting the number of\r<br>physical things in the universe we hit an unknown.\r<br>How big is the universe?\r<br>The entire universe could be infinite\r<br>or it could be finite, but edgeless for a variety of reasons. There could also be\r<br>other universes. But it&#39;s unclear whether we&#39;ll ever be able to actually see all these\r<br>things. Instead, what we are stuck with, and what we usually mean when we say\r<br>&#39;the universe&#39;, is the observable universe\r<br>whose future visibility limit has been estimated to be only 62\r<br>billion light-years in any direction.\r<br>That&#39;s it. This is likely the only inventoryable space we&#39;ll ever need\r<br>to worry about. And it contains roughly,\r<br>on average, ten to the eighty elementary particles. Particles with no\r<br>further internal parts as far as we currently now.\r<br>So that&#39;s our answer, right? There are ten to the eighty\r<br>physical things that exist out there, beyond our own minds.\r<br>Any other physical thing - water, dogs, planets,\r<br>saxophones - are just names given to particular arrangements of those same\r<br>ten to the eighty particles. But wait, what if,\r<br>in the future, we discover that what we call elementary particles today\r<br>are actually just made out of smaller things we should have counted\r<br>instead? Well, to cover ourselves let&#39;s count\r<br>the maximum possible number of the smallest measurable thing.\r<br>Something the size of a Planck volume.\r<br>10 to the power of 183\r<br>things that small could fit within our observable universe.\r<br>I like this number, 10 to the power of 183.\r<br>You couldn&#39;t easily argue there were more things than that\r<br>in the physical, real-world. But you could imagine.\r<br>A Planck length, a Planck volume. That&#39;s just\r<br>the smallest measurable amount of space, not the smallest\r<br>possible. You could imagine a\r<br>half Planck volume, a 10,000th of a Planck volume.\r<br>But, that would just be a thought and only ever\r<br>a thought. So, how many possible thoughts\r<br>are there? It&#39;s probably safe to say that the number of possible\r<br>thoughts is, indeed, infinite. For example,\r<br>numbers. You can&#39;t say there&#39;s a limit to the biggest number we can imagine.\r<br>But, unlike physical things that exist whether or not we have\r<br>discovered them, do unthought thoughts\r<br>already exist? It seems more like the pool of possible\r<br>thoughts is really just one thing an actual elements from that set don&#39;t\r<br>become things by themselves until we thing them\r<br>that is we or some other mind thinks about them\r<br>or talks about them and there&#39;s a limit to how many things\r<br>we or anything else could ever thing\r<br>our observable universe is only so big and it will contain usable energy\r<br>for only so long. After about 1 trillion to a hundred trillion years\r<br>the supply of gas needed to form new stars will be\r<br>exhausted and the lights will start going out\r<br>one-star at a time. After a\r<br>Google years the amount of usable energy left in the universe will be\r<br>0 and nothing will be able to happen\r<br>to calculate the maximum number up thoughts that could be\r<br>thought inside our observable universe let&#39;s take\r<br>all of its mass and turn it into human brains\r<br>that just think new and random thoughts from the beginning of time\r<br>until the universe runs out of usable energy, a Google years\r<br>of thinking. But wait, what if there are\r<br>alien brains or for all we know Earthling brains that\r<br>think faster than we can okay well to be safe\r<br>let&#39;s not turn all of that mass into human brains let&#39;s use it to build a\r<br>giant hypothetical machine that computes at the fastest speed possible given the\r<br>speed of light\r<br>in the uncertainty principle; Bremermann&#39;s Limit\r<br>its 1.36 times ten to the fifty bits per second per kilogram\r<br>of material, now a high-end estimate for the total mass of the observable universe\r<br>is 3.4 times ten to the the 60 kilograms\r<br>which used exclusively for the best possible computing machine could altogether\r<br>process 4.624 times ten to the 110\r<br>bits per second. Now with 3.154 times 10 to the 116\r<br>seconds available from the beginning of time to the heat death of the universe\r<br>and an assumption that the average thought takes about a sentance worth\r<br>of information to describe\r<br>say about 800 bits we get a total\r<br>of 1.458 times\r<br>ten to the 227 things that could\r<br>ever be thought or imagined. That number\r<br>is huge. In the observable universe\r<br>the universe as we will ever know it the number of thoughts that can be thought\r<br>is so much larger than the number of physical things there can be with out\r<br>imagination and if you were to combine the two totals\r<br>the number of physical things would barely\r<br>make a difference. So, funny enough\r<br>when it comes to every thing in the universe\r<br>it really is the thought that counts.\r<br>And as always,\r<br>thanks for watching.", "comment_date": "2020-05-09T16:18:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "amgK v2.0", "comment_text": "Total number of YouTube videos... impossible.

Ever. And they never will again, unless they read this comment. Nevertheless, that collection is a real &quot;thing,&quot; and so is every other such arbitrary collection I could come up with.

I&#39;m looking right at them. Or, I can touch them, I can feel them, they&#39;re right here and that&#39;s good. Your senses are a great way to learn things. In fact, we have way more than the usual five senses we talk about. For instance, your kinesthetic sense, proprioception. This is what the police evaluate during a field sobriety test. It allows you to tell where your fingers and arms and head and legs in your body is all in relation to each other without having to look or touch other things. We have way more than five senses, we have at least twice as many and then some. But they&#39;re not perfect.\r<br>\r<br>There are optical illusions, audio illusions, temperature sensation illusions, even tactile illusions. Can you turn your tongue upside down? If so, perfect. Try this. Run your finger along the outer edge of the tip of your upside down tongue. Your tongue will be able to feel your finger, but in the wrong place. Our brains never needed to develop an understanding of upside down tongue touch. So, when you touch the right side of your tongue when it&#39;s flipped over to your left side you perceive a sensation on the opposite side, where your tongue usually is but isn&#39;t when it&#39;s upside down. It&#39;s pretty freaky and cool and a little humbling, because it shows the limits of the accuracy of our senses, the only tools we have to get what&#39;s out there in here.\r<br>\r<br>The philosophy of knowledge, the study of knowing, is called epistemology. Plato famously said that the things we know are things that are true, that we believe and that we have justification for believing. those justifications might be irrational or they might be rational, they might be based on proof, but don&#39;t get too confident because proven is not a synonym for true. Luckily, there are things that we can know without needing proof, without needing to even leave the house, things that we can know as true by reason alone. These are things that we know a priori. An example would be the statement &quot;all bachelors are unmarried.&quot; I don&#39;t have to go survey every bachelor on earth to know that that is true. All bachelors are unmarried because that&#39;s how we define the word bachelor. Of course, you have to know what the words bachelor and unmarried mean in the first place. Oh, you do? Okay. Perfect. That&#39;s great. But how do you know?\r<br>\r<br>This time I mean functionally, how do you know? Where is knowledge biologically in the brain? What are memories made out of? We are a long way from being able to answer that question completely but research has shown that memories don&#39;t exist in the brain in single locations. Instead, what we call a memory is likely made up of many different complex relationships all over the brain between lots of brain cells, neurons. A major cellular mechanism thought to underlie the formation of memories is long-term potentiation or LTP. When one neuron stimulates another neuron repeatedly that signal can be enhanced overtime LTP, wiring them more strongly together and that connection can last a long time, even an entire lifetime. A collection of different brain cells, neurons that fire together in a particular order over and over again frequently and repeatedly can achieve long-term potentiation, becoming more sensitive to each other and more ready to fire in the exact same way later on in the future. They&#39;re a physical thing in your brain, firing together more easily because you strengthen that pattern of firing. You memorized. This branching forest of firing friends looks messy, but look closer. It could be the memory of your first kiss. A living souvenir of the event. If I were to go into your brain and cut out those cells, could I make you forget your first kiss or could I make you forget where your fingers are? Only if I cut out a lot of your brain. Because memories aren&#39;t just stored in one relationship, they&#39;re stored all over the brain. The events leading up to your first kiss are stored in one network, the way it felt to the way it smelled in different networks, all added up together making what you call the memory of your first kiss.\r<br>\r<br>How many memories can you fit inside your head? What is the storage capacity of the human brain? The best we can do is a rough estimate, but given the number of neurons in the brain involved with memory and the number of different connections a single neuron can make Paul Reber at Northwestern University estimated that we can store the digital equivalent of about 2.5 petabytes of information. That&#39;s the equivalent of recording a TV channel continuously for 300 years. That&#39;s a lot of information. That is a lot of information about skills you can do and facts and people you&#39;ve met, things in the real world. The world is real, right? How do you know?\r<br>\r<br>It&#39;s a difficult question, but it&#39;s not rocket science. Instead, it is asking whether or not rocket scientists even exist in the first place. The theory that the Sun moved around the earth worked great. It predicted that the Sun would rise every morning and it did. It wasn&#39;t until later that we realized what we thought was true might not be. So, do we or will we ever know true reality or are we stuck in a world where the best we can do is be approximately true? Discovering more and more useful theories every day but never actually reaching true objective actual reality. Can science or reason ever prove convincingly that your friends and YouTube videos and your fingers actually exist beyond your mind? That you don&#39;t just live in the matrix?\r<br>\r<br>No. Your mind is all that you have, even if you use instruments, like a telescope or particle accelerators. The final stop for all of that information is ultimately you. You are alone in your own brain, which technically makes it impossible to prove that anything else exists. It&#39;s called the egocentric predicament. Everything you know about the world out there depends on and is created inside your brain. This mattered so much to Charles Sanders Peirce that he drew a line between reality, the way the universe truly is, and what he called the phaneron, the world as filtered through our senses and bodies, the only information we can get. If you want to speak with certainty you live in, that is you react to and remember and experience your phaneron, not reality. The belief that only you exist and everything else, food, the universe, your friends are all figments of your mind is called solipsism. There is no way to convince a solipsist that the outside world is real. And there is no way to convince someone who doubts that the universe wasn&#39;t created just three seconds ago along with all of our memories. It&#39;s a frightening realization that we don&#39;t always know how to deal with. There&#39;s even The Matrix defense.\r<br>\r<br>In 2002 Tonda Lynn Ansley shot and killed her landlady. She argued that she believed she was in the matrix, that her crimes weren&#39;t real. By using the matrix defense, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity, because the opposite view is just way healthier and common. It&#39;s called realism. Realism is the belief that the outside world exists independently of your own phaneron. Rocks and stars and Thora Birch would continue to exist even if you weren&#39;t around to experience them. But you cannot know realism is true. All you can do is believe.\r<br>\r<br>Martin Gardner, a great source for math magic tricks, explained that he is not a solipsist because realism is just way more convenient and healthy and it works. As to whether it bothered him that he could never know realism was true, he wrote, &quot;If you ask me to tell you anything about the nature of what lies beyond the phaneron, my answer is how should I know? I&#39;m not dismayed by ultimate mysteries, I can no more grasp what is behind such questions as my cat can understand what is behind the clatter I make while I type this paragraph.&quot; Humble stuff. What strikes me is the cat.\r<br>\r<br>Cats do not understand keyboards, but they know the keyboards are a fun place to be. It&#39;s a great way to get the attention of a human, they&#39;re warm and exciting, surrounded by noises and flashing lights plus cats love to get their scent on whatever they can, a mark of their existence. We aren&#39;t that much different, except instead of keyboards we have the mysteries of the universe.

Nevertheless, this was a great mindgasm and yes I hear all of you about the heat death of the universe being depressing and terrifying but all of humanity will die before that ever happens, so ultimately it&#39;s not such a horrible thing. The REALLY bad thing will be the heat death of the multiverse and then no universes will ever &quot;use energy&quot; again, but you never know if it&#39;s all infinite, there must be EVEN more multiverses, so there&#39;s a good chance it&#39;s really not the end after all and maybe, just maybe, the state at which all matter/energy is motionless, and nothing at all can happen, will be the most peaceful state for everything at equilibrium, and consciousness can then, if it wants, step out or opt-out of that peaceful equilibrium and into other parallel realities until they reach equilibrium forever, or maybe the whole thing does eventually enjoy equilibrium all together. You never know. If no energy can be transferred then certainly no violence or suffering can take place.

This is going to be a lot of things.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m18s\">1:18</a><br>Things can be real, imaginary,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m21s\">1:21</a><br>impossible, ideas are things, things can be looked forward to and things can be in the past<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m27s\">1:27</a><br>or yellow or concrete or abstract things can<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m31s\">1:31</a><br>happen and some thing&#39;s probably won&#39;t.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m34s\">1:34</a><br>Making a video about how many things there are.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m38s\">1:38</a><br>That&#39;s a thing... that I&#39;m doing right now.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a><br>Let&#39;s count everything.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m44s\">1:44</a><br>Right away, the answer seems obvious. The word<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m47s\">1:47</a><br>&#39;thing&#39; is so vague, the answer is clearly infinite...<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a><br>possibly... not.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m55s\">1:55</a><br>All we have to do is take the maximum number of physical things,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=1m59s\">1:59</a><br>things out there in the real world, beyond our minds we could<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m02s\">2:02</a><br>in theory measure and add to that the total number of things we<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m07s\">2:07</a><br>could imagine. The total number of thoughts possible.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m11s\">2:11</a><br>For the purposes of this video let&#39;s assume that numbers and math<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m15s\">2:15</a><br>and the laws of physics exist as part of the way<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m18s\">2:18</a><br>our universe is. But the names and representations they&#39;ve been given<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m23s\">2:23</a><br>are the products of thinking minds and those things<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m27s\">2:27</a><br>are, well, things that we can count.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m30s\">2:30</a><br>And there&#39;s no reason to double count. All of the indivisible<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m34s\">2:34</a><br>pieces that make up me, particles or strings or whatever<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m38s\">2:38</a><br>are the same as the thing that has been named me.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m42s\">2:42</a><br>Abraham Lincoln has a great quote about this.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m45s\">2:45</a><br>&quot;How many legs does a sheep have if you call<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m48s\">2:48</a><br>its tail a leg?&quot;<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m51s\">2:51</a><br>Four.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m52s\">2:52</a><br>Because calling a tail a leg doesn&#39;t make it one.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m55s\">2:55</a><br>Okay, let&#39;s begin. When counting the number of<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=2m59s\">2:59</a><br>physical things in the universe we hit an unknown.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m03s\">3:03</a><br>How big is the universe?<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m06s\">3:06</a><br>The entire universe could be infinite<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m09s\">3:09</a><br>or it could be finite, but edgeless for a variety of reasons. There could also be<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m13s\">3:13</a><br>other universes. But it&#39;s unclear whether we&#39;ll ever be able to actually see all these<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a><br>things. Instead, what we are stuck with, and what we usually mean when we say<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m24s\">3:24</a><br>&#39;the universe&#39;, is the observable universe<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m28s\">3:28</a><br>whose future visibility limit has been estimated to be only 62<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m32s\">3:32</a><br>billion light-years in any direction.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m36s\">3:36</a><br>That&#39;s it. This is likely the only inventoryable space we&#39;ll ever need<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m42s\">3:42</a><br>to worry about. And it contains roughly,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m45s\">3:45</a><br>on average, ten to the eighty elementary particles. Particles with no<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m49s\">3:49</a><br>further internal parts as far as we currently now.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m52s\">3:52</a><br>So that&#39;s our answer, right? There are ten to the eighty<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m56s\">3:56</a><br>physical things that exist out there, beyond our own minds.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=3m59s\">3:59</a><br>Any other physical thing - water, dogs, planets,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m03s\">4:03</a><br>saxophones - are just names given to particular arrangements of those same<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m08s\">4:08</a><br>ten to the eighty particles. But wait, what if,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m11s\">4:11</a><br>in the future, we discover that what we call elementary particles today<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m16s\">4:16</a><br>are actually just made out of smaller things we should have counted<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m19s\">4:19</a><br>instead? Well, to cover ourselves let&#39;s count<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m23s\">4:23</a><br>the maximum possible number of the smallest measurable thing.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m28s\">4:28</a><br>Something the size of a Planck volume.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m31s\">4:31</a><br>10 to the power of 183<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m34s\">4:34</a><br>things that small could fit within our observable universe.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m38s\">4:38</a><br>I like this number, 10 to the power of 183.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m44s\">4:44</a><br>You couldn&#39;t easily argue there were more things than that<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m47s\">4:47</a><br>in the physical, real-world. But you could imagine.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m51s\">4:51</a><br>A Planck length, a Planck volume. That&#39;s just<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m54s\">4:54</a><br>the smallest measurable amount of space, not the smallest<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=4m58s\">4:58</a><br>possible. You could imagine a<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m02s\">5:02</a><br>half Planck volume, a 10,000th of a Planck volume.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m05s\">5:05</a><br>But, that would just be a thought and only ever<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m09s\">5:09</a><br>a thought. So, how many possible thoughts<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m12s\">5:12</a><br>are there? It&#39;s probably safe to say that the number of possible<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m17s\">5:17</a><br>thoughts is, indeed, infinite. For example,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m20s\">5:20</a><br>numbers. You can&#39;t say there&#39;s a limit to the biggest number we can imagine.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m24s\">5:24</a><br>But, unlike physical things that exist whether or not we have<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m29s\">5:29</a><br>discovered them, do unthought thoughts<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m32s\">5:32</a><br>already exist? It seems more like the pool of possible<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m38s\">5:38</a><br>thoughts is really just one thing an actual elements from that set don&#39;t<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m43s\">5:43</a><br>become things by themselves until we thing them<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m47s\">5:47</a><br>that is we or some other mind thinks about them<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m50s\">5:50</a><br>or talks about them and there&#39;s a limit to how many things<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m53s\">5:53</a><br>we or anything else could ever thing<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m57s\">5:57</a><br>our observable universe is only so big and it will contain usable energy<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m01s\">6:01</a><br>for only so long. After about 1 trillion to a hundred trillion years<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m07s\">6:07</a><br>the supply of gas needed to form new stars will be<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m11s\">6:11</a><br>exhausted and the lights will start going out<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m14s\">6:14</a><br>one-star at a time. After a<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m17s\">6:17</a><br>Google years the amount of usable energy left in the universe will be<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m22s\">6:22</a><br>0 and nothing will be able to happen<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m27s\">6:27</a><br>to calculate the maximum number up thoughts that could be<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m30s\">6:30</a><br>thought inside our observable universe let&#39;s take<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m33s\">6:33</a><br>all of its mass and turn it into human brains<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m37s\">6:37</a><br>that just think new and random thoughts from the beginning of time<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m41s\">6:41</a><br>until the universe runs out of usable energy, a Google years<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m44s\">6:44</a><br>of thinking. But wait, what if there are<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m48s\">6:48</a><br>alien brains or for all we know Earthling brains that<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m51s\">6:51</a><br>think faster than we can okay well to be safe<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m54s\">6:54</a><br>let&#39;s not turn all of that mass into human brains let&#39;s use it to build a<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m58s\">6:58</a><br>giant hypothetical machine that computes at the fastest speed possible given the<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m03s\">7:03</a><br>speed of light<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m04s\">7:04</a><br>in the uncertainty principle; Bremermann&#39;s Limit<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m07s\">7:07</a><br>its 1.36 times ten to the fifty bits per second per kilogram<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m12s\">7:12</a><br>of material, now a high-end estimate for the total mass of the observable universe<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m17s\">7:17</a><br>is 3.4 times ten to the the 60 kilograms<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m21s\">7:21</a><br>which used exclusively for the best possible computing machine could altogether<br>process 4.624 times ten to the 110<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m30s\">7:30</a><br>bits per second. Now with 3.154 times 10 to the 116<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m36s\">7:36</a><br>seconds available from the beginning of time to the heat death of the universe<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m40s\">7:40</a><br>and an assumption that the average thought takes about a sentance worth<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m44s\">7:44</a><br>of information to describe<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m45s\">7:45</a><br>say about 800 bits we get a total<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m49s\">7:49</a><br>of 1.458 times<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m52s\">7:52</a><br>ten to the 227 things that could<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m55s\">7:55</a><br>ever be thought or imagined. That number<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m59s\">7:59</a><br>is huge. In the observable universe<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=8m04s\">8:04</a><br>the universe as we will ever know it the number of thoughts that can be thought<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=8m08s\">8:08</a><br>is so much larger than the number of physical things there can be with out<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=8m12s\">8:12</a><br>imagination and if you were to combine the two totals<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=8m16s\">8:16</a><br>the number of physical things would barely<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=8m19s\">8:19</a><br>make a difference. So, funny enough<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=8m23s\">8:23</a><br>when it comes to every thing in the universe<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=8m26s\">8:26</a><br>it really is the thought that counts.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=8m29s\">8:29</a><br>And as always,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=8m31s\">8:31</a><br>thanks for watching.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=7m26s\">7:26</a>", "comment_date": "2016-12-09T08:28:00Z", "likes_count": 952}, {"comment_by": "Daniel deSimone", "comment_text": "QUESTION VSauce!<br>What is the optimal way to die so that the probability that these atoms form a human again is higher (than .00000000000001)?

Furthermore, as time progresses, these arrangements will constantly change. For instance, I think a car is a thing, and I think it&#39;s a different thing than the arrangement its raw materials had before it was made, even if they both contain the same atoms. So every moment sees new things created. Moreover, I think temporal patterns are things. For instance, I think humans are things, even though their constituent atoms are constantly changing. So a function from time to sets of particles is also a thing. If we want to do the usual thing for these estimates and break up time into divisions of the Planck time and calculate from the big bang to 10^100 years later (which is pretty arbitrary, but it&#39;s what you did), then we have a domain of cardinality 10^150 and as I said earlier, a range of cardinality 2^10^80, giving a total number of possible functions of (2^10^180)^(10^150) = 2^10^330 \u2248 10^10^329.5.<br><br>Separately, your calculation of the number of &quot;possible thoughts&quot; is simply a strict upper bound on the number of times a thing could be thought, not an actual estimate.

So obviously you can have 10^80 things in the form of single particles, but then you also have (10^80)/2 pairs of things and all possible permutations of those pairs of those things which is pretty astronomical. Then you have all possible triplets and their permutations, quadruplets and so on right up to the largest possible &#39;thing&#39; which is the universe itself (you also include &#39;nothing&#39; as a thing too). It turns out there is a really simple way of calculating this (the number of subsets of a set), and it turns out to be 2^n where n is simply the number of members of that set (in this case 10^80). So in fact there are actually 2^(10^80) possible things in the observable universe.

Assuming humans can live as long as we have energy to use, could we not then progress to a point where we could control fusion/fission appropriately? My position is that, if we could harvest atoms (of any particular flavor), and we were fully capable of controlling fusion AND fission, then theoretically, we could fuse atoms to make heavier ones, or better yet, break heavier ones down to lighter ones. If we could harvest enough light atoms (namely hydrogen), we could (with a ridiculous amount of energy) create a star. If this is possible, while our star is dying, and begins its merciless slow-burning onslaught of our solar system, we could, in theory, begin creating or accreting a new star somewhere else. Realistically, it wouldn&#39;t have to be as big as our star; just large enough to sustain life. Obviously, we then have to move the Earth to the new location, but all things considered, if the previous position is plausible, then I believe this is also possible. My physics knowledge is cursory, so I&#39;m sure there are some big loopholes I&#39;m missing here that crumble my hypothesis, but it was an interesting thought experiment to ride out.

Say you just attributed two possible states to a planck lenght (could be much more) than the real answer is 2 to the power of the total number of planck lenghts... which is way bigger. This is certainly not double counting, a different confiuration makes a different thing, by this fact itself.

Based on the assumption that the computational machine in question has been optimally built (it becomes unusable at the heat death of the universe), the mass has to be calculated based on the critical density. That is, the density limit where the heat death starts occouring. At the mass of 3.4*10^60 the universe would collapse in on itself long before 10^100 years.

Or it might, depending on your definition of \u2018imagine\u2019. If by imagine, you mean a person can essentially grasp how long/large it is, then there are only a finite number of such numbers. I\u2019m not going to argue semantics, but for the sake of the argument I\u2019m going to use that definition. We can\u2019t possibly imagine pi by that definition because it\u2019s infinitely long, nonrepeating and our heads would literally collapse into black holes due to the amount of information. That argument can be made for all irrational numbers, and a similar one can be made for extremely large numbers such as Graham\u2019s number.<br><br>It boils down to this: There are an infinite number of integers, 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, \u2026, but only a finite number of integers that our semi-evolved brains can comprehend. But then you might say, \u2018what about fractions?\u2019. If we define a fraction as the quotient of integers a and b (i.e. a/b, b=/=0), the textbook definition of what a rational number is, and the possibilities for both a and b are finite, then there are only a finite number of fractions we can imagine. A similar argument can be made for complex numbers of the form a + bi. That\u2019s overcounting by a lot too. So we have\u2026<br>(a finite number of rational numbers) + (0 irrational numbers) + (a finite number of complex numbers) = a finite number of numbers that we can imagine<br><br>The obvious first counterargument would concern the definition of the word imagine. We can imagine sqrt(2) as just that, but we can\u2019t imagine it as the infinitely long, nonrepeating number that it really is. Another counterargument would be to say that a/b might be able to be expressed as c/d + f/g or cd/fg, but those are expressions and not a numbers. Complex numbers are not expressions; technically a/b is an expression but what I\u2019ll say is that it\u2019s &quot;the most simplified version of an infinite possibility of other expressions\u201d.<br><br>If you made it through this ridiculously long comment, and you would watch a vsauce vid entitled \u201cHow many numbers can we imagine?\u201d please upvote this comment.

The amount of possible thoughts will infinitely expand also because there will always be new things to think about until, of course, the heat death of the universe, when all things cease to exist and the observable universe ceases to expand. <br> ", "comment_date": "2014-05-13T18:53:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "smugmcmuffin", "comment_text": "MY BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIN", "comment_date": "2014-05-13T16:37:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob E", "comment_text": "Adams are things ;)", "comment_date": "2014-05-13T15:47:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sir Isaac", "comment_text": "The answer is 42", "comment_date": "2014-05-13T15:11:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hai people", "comment_text": "Hi<br>", "comment_date": "2014-05-13T14:25:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Megadebt", "comment_text": "amazing research", "comment_date": "2014-05-13T14:11:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ham Burger", "comment_text": "Say whaat?", "comment_date": "2014-05-13T14:06:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRABIDdude", "comment_text": "...

Words are things. They are building blocks. Words are very important. Words are not the things. I get that. Words are entirely different things from the things they represent.\u00a0Saying you won&#39;t count them for purposes of this video makes the video null and void.\u00a0<br><br>I know you use Ben Franklin&#39;s sheep to explain this away, but when you name something, it becomes that too, even if in a metaphorical sense. Even if the tail is not a leg, if you call it a leg, that particular tail is now also a leg, cuz somebody, somewhere, attributed that word to it. Whether it&#39;s Ben Franklin or someone less important.\u00a0For the very reason you dismiss counting words, that&#39;s all the more reason why you have to include words. The name of the thing is not the same as the thing itself. However, a name of a thing is itself also a thing, separate from the thing itself, and must be counted separately.\u00a0<br><br>Every time you count a thing, you MUST count that thing&#39;s name as well, cuz names are things, and oftentimes things have more than one word or name associated with them.\u00a0A dog is both a dog, and a Bruno (or whatever its name is).. and it&#39;s also a pooch, and a doberman (or whatever breed it is), and probably a mutt too. There&#39;s pet names for things beyond pets, and there&#39;s even derogatory names for things. I won&#39;t cite examples cuz some people don&#39;t like cussing, but you know what I mean.\u00a0Sometimes a dog may have different names over its lifetime if it has multiple owners. This goes on and on, and I know this is why you dismissed this exercise, cuz it&#39;d warrant its own video, but words are things. Names are things. They&#39;re too important. You can&#39;t pretend they&#39;re not there and have this count mean anything.\u00a0<br><br>Every tangible thing outside our minds +\u00a0<br>Every intangible thing inside our minds +\u00a0<br>Every word aka name for each tangible and intangible thing. = OMGWTF<br><br>You could argue that once a combination of letters that make up a word is counted once, you don&#39;t have to count it again but you&#39;d be wrong. The safe in the bank (vault) is not the same safe as the one on the baseball diamond (rule determinant). The letters look the same, but they&#39;re different words, so for each word, you have to count every permutation of definition for that word. Every time a word comes up that name is a new thing being counted, that word has to be counted, even if its been associated with billions of other things, cuz the word that refers to MY cellphone is not the same word as the one that refers to YOUR cellphone. Each cellphone is A cellphone but none of them are THE only cellphone. Each cellphone is a different cellphone so the word that represents my cellphone has a different definition than the word that represents your cellphone.\u00a0<br><br>Then there&#39;s every word that has been printed in every book in the world. Each and every word on a printed page is itself a thing and all these things make up the thing that is that page of that book, which is also a thing. And every copy of that book that has ever been printed also has words on every page and each of those words is a thing. And each letter of each word is also in and of itself a thing. And all the punctuation marks. You can&#39;t just count twenty-six letters and be done. The two T&#39;s in &quot;letter&quot; are different T&#39;s. You can&#39;t just count a period once, cuz the period at the end of this sentence is a different period from the period in the last sentence.\u00a0Come to think of it, every youtube comment for every youtube video has words and letters and each of them are separate things too, and they would each need to be counted separately.\u00a0<br><br>Then there&#39;s multiple languages. Each language has its own word for each thing. So you&#39;d have to count what Italians call a dog, and what Spaniards or Mexicans or Latinos call a dog. Same with cellphone. Same with every thing you&#39;ve covered in English, you&#39;d have to go through the entire process again in every other language mankind has ever conceived. Yes. Even esperanto.\u00a0Sometimes it&#39;s the same word, but since it&#39;s an entirely different language, you have to count it again, cuz no in English is not the same as the no in Spanish. They are used in different ways, show up in sentence structure differently, etc.\u00a0<br><br>As Laurie Anderson once said, language is a virus. It&#39;s constantly growing and changing and adapting. Words are being made all the time.

If you can call it a thing, it&#39;s a thing&quot;<br><br>According to that definition, there is an infinite number things that you can think about. I do agree, at the moment, that there is a finite amount of physical things, but I don&#39;t understand why you don&#39;t include specific arrangements of physical things as things.<br><br>Thinkable Things:<br>Ok, so I am thinking of a number. The number is 327. This number is different than other numbers, and so it is a different thing than other numbers. I can even give it a specific name, three-two-seven. \u00a0Now pick any number, and lets call that number &quot;n&quot;. That number is a thing, because you can think about it.\u00a0<br><br>The Interesting thing about numbers is that they can go to infinity. Humanity will never be able to think about each number, but we can pick any number and think about that specific one. Since we <b>can</b> think about any specific one of the infinite amount of numbers, there are an infinite amount of thinkable things. The number of possible thoughts is infinite, although not every possible thought will actually be thought, and so not every thing will be thought about.<br><br><br>Physical Things:<br>Michael talked about the number of elementary particles, but there are also things that are combinations of these particles. The simplest example that I can think of is this. Lets suppose that we live in a universe that have the following elementary particles: Peanut butter, jelly and bread. Individually these are all things. The sum of elementary particles in this universe is three. They are three things.\u00a0<br><br>In some places in this universe the arrangement of \u00a0these elementary particles is such that it creates a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Together, the elementary particles form a different thing. Now we can count four physical thing in this universe. The amount of physical things in the universe is therefore greater than the sum of its parts, although it would still be finite.", "comment_date": "2014-05-02T05:02:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chris2shotgun", "comment_text": "&quot;Every time your doin&#39; that THING you do.&quot;", "comment_date": "2014-05-02T04:51:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Catsadilla", "comment_text": "And as always...mind blown!", "comment_date": "2014-05-02T04:48:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Croy", "comment_text": "lol plonck its planck", "comment_date": "2014-05-02T04:44:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CodyAlushin", "comment_text": "Well shit.", "comment_date": "2014-05-02T04:39:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZeoStorm", "comment_text": "If you care for another mindblow, just click my name.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-05-02T04:31:45Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Mitch Breese", "comment_text": "How small is a thought?

In addition to not mentioning the fact that planck length is merely a theoretical construct, he assumes that the occupation of space is the definition of an object and the arbiter of its existence. But what about &quot;things&quot; that don&#39;t occupy space such as photons? How are we to know how many of these mass-less particles exist out there? We still have not discovered dark matter and dark energy which accounts to 95.4% of the universe. Atoms only make up 4.6 of the universe!<br><br>Furthermore, can we really separate any object from any other object(and therefore quantify) simply because they are the smallest possible unit of matter? Elementary particles are elementary particles because of other elementary particles. Particles relate to other particles in accordance to the rules and patterns of this universe. Can a single particle even exist without the other particles? To think of a single elementary particle is to think of the conditions, rules and physical laws that allow for that one particle to exist. In a sense, \u00a0it is impossible to think of &quot;1&quot; thing in the context of the universe without unintentionally referencing a necessary environmental constant...because the universe is really just &quot;1&quot; inter-connected thing. The only thing you can accurately and absolutely &quot;count&quot; is the universe as a whole.<br><br>What is brilliantly illuminated in this video is how people underestimate not only infinity, but also how people also under-imagine or underestimate large numbers such as 10^180. 10^180 is such a huge number that, for humans, it is virtually infinite. But it isn&#39;t. I&#39;ve never acknowledged the idea that the human population was actually that small that we wouldn&#39;t even fit the grand canyon, nor the idea that the total number of sand grains is just a mere 7.5 x 10^18. Let alone that everything ever exist has or will could be reduced to a mere 10^180. Infinity is truly beautiful. Maybe the only way for it to be properly and empirically represented is not through the universe but through multiverses.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-30T18:23:00Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "skunkfacewoody", "comment_text": "Ouch does frying my brain count as a thing?

To calculate an accurate number of things that can exist within our universe we need first the number of Planck volumes in our universe (10^183) plus the number of possible pairs of these objects (5 x 10^365) plus the number of possible triplets of things (1.67 x 10^548) and so on, until we get to the single possible thing made of all 10^183 Planck volumes (the universe itself). Since there is such a magnitude difference between the terms, this entire series will be dominated by the largest term, where each term is given by &quot;n choose k&quot; = n!/(k!(n-k)!). The largest term occurs at k = 5 x 10^182, and by using Stirling&#39;s approximation we obtain an estimated number of possible things in the observable universe as 10^(3 x 10^182).\u00a0<br>So, if you were to write this number with one digit per Planck volume, it would take one third of the universe just to write the number itself.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-30T00:31:01Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "jbhaloguy27", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=0m19s\">0:19</a> that is one BIG orgy.", "comment_date": "2014-04-30T00:30:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "underedible", "comment_text": "Can you do a video on if people see different colors than other people?", "comment_date": "2014-04-30T00:29:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Pablo Torres", "comment_text": "most abstract and complicated vsauce ever. \u00a0Mind melted.", "comment_date": "2014-04-30T00:29:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Brown", "comment_text": "Wow.

By definition, these are phenomena unpredictable from the sole existence of the elements involved, and can only rise to existence once those elements interact. It&#39;s put down to layman&#39;s terms as &quot;the total is bigger than the sum of its parts&quot;, and technically speaking is due to the many non-linearities present in the real world. For instance, an orbital in an atom can only come from the interaction of the electron and the nucleus. This might seem unnecessary at first, but this concept is extensively used in biology to try and explain the &quot;appearance&quot; of life and consciousness. Just think about colors: does the white in the Youtube background exist? If so, how many colors could there be? Of course, a safe answer would be: as many as can be detected by living brains. But then, the colors are not made of elementary physical particles, right? This would extend the number of existing things with emergent properties like &quot;color&quot;. And since it depends on the interactions of &quot;elementary things&quot; (elements of a system), the actual number of such objects could get much greater than 10 to the 180th power (since the combinations increase factorially with the number of elements involved, although in non-linear ways). To complicate matters even further, there&#39;s no way to determine &quot;true&quot; emergent phenomena other than common sense as of yet (unless we agree with some restricting definition).<br><br>Other point is that we cannot imagine every possible number. We need a way to represent numbers in order to think of them, the most basic manner being in binary form, that takes a bit of information for each digit. Well, since there&#39;s a minimal amount of energy involved in the transference of one bit, one cannot think of increasingly longer strings of binary digits as it would require increasingly greater amounts of energy in our brains. There&#39;s a limit to the amount of energy present in a given volume at which a singularity will form and thus no more information could be stored at that volume (though the singularity would likely expand).", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T22:56:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eli Chambers", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=5m16s\">5:16</a> should be vsaus&#39;s youtube channel pic", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T22:56:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aiko Hernandez", "comment_text": "I feel like every Vsauce video I watch,my mind gets blow to smithereens...I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T22:55:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aiko Hernandez", "comment_text": "I feel like every Vsauce video I watch,my mind gets blow to smithereens...I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T22:55:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cesar Martinez", "comment_text": "Loved it at the end", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T22:54:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rotloch Studio", "comment_text": "Agh!

This would include every possible inclination of our universe and any universe that could exist under the same physical conditions. So this is not just everything that IS, but everything that COULD BE (assuming physical constants are the same)<br><br>\u00a0 To do this, we can assume that there 10^80 atoms in our universe and we&#39;ll assume that atoms are the base-bit that can be re-arrange (we won&#39;t use subatomic particles because then it&#39;d get too complicated, but would make the answer even bigger). We&#39;ll assume that the smallest measurement of distance is the planck length (1.616*10^-34), in which case we can come up with a planck volume (4.22*10^-105). The observable universe is about 3.5*10^80 m large, we can then say that the 10^80 atoms have 8.293*10^184 different positions they could be in (we&#39;ll assume positions next to each other lead to composite atoms, remember this is just a rough estimate)<br><br>\u00a0 Using arrangements, we can come up with the total number of combinations that occur with this measurement. Because physics tells us that every elementary particle is the same as any other elementary particle of the same type, we&#39;ll say that atoms are not unique, but the positions they can occupy are (Again atoms aren&#39;t elementary particles, but it&#39;s a useful approximation). This is a GIANT number, so big that no calculator, even on the internet, can appropriately express it. Unfortunately this means to express it, it must be algebraic. If we let n = 10^80 and k = 8.293*10^184, then the answer is<br><br>(n+k-1)! / (k-1)!n!<br><br>This number is absolutely massive, probably more than 10,000 zeros.", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T11:15:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allahu Akbruh", "comment_text": "Doesn&#39;t the size of the observable universe depend on how old you are?", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T11:15:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohamed Waheed", "comment_text": "Now I&#39;m officially nerd ))", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T11:15:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Olie", "comment_text": "What about the thoughts of other animals?", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T11:14:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BananaMan", "comment_text": "awesome vid but can you get a new mic? \u00a0 every time you pronounce the letter &#39;s&#39; \u00a0it makes like a cracking sound", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T11:13:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oxy Worgon", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6eOcd06kdk&amp;t=6m16s\">6:16</a><br>After a Google years......................that minecraft door will open.....", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T11:13:09Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "NewNecro", "comment_text": "I was expecting something like..

This brings up a split road: if so, any thought can be as short as possible (the thing with the smallest description). However if not so, an amount of unique things of your quantity would get enormously long description that takes a lot more processing time.<br>- The &quot;description&quot; of a thing I find an undefined idea. Assuming things need to be unique, in order not to get replicates of things, you need to be as precise as possible, resulting in chapters of books per thing, varying with the complexity of a thing.<br>- Things can be combined to make other things. I can use strings to create up and down quarks and gluons to make protons and neutrons, and combined with electrons and bosons I can create atoms which create molecules which create matter as we are common with it. You would need a whole sum of possible particle combinations while keeping in mind the laws of nature.<br>- All the matter in the universe is an easy, but improper way to measure the size of your &quot;thinking machine&quot;. Firstly because energy can be converted into matter, making up for a portion of the machine (but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s significant). Secondly, the biggest part of the universe is made of hydrogen, which needs to be turned into the necessary stuff needed for the machine, like crystals and silicon (and again, you could assume we could change ALL of the hydrogon, without any energy loss, into the machine compartments, though I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s simply possible).<br>- And as a funny side note, if you use all the matter in the universe to create a thinking machine, you don&#39;t have any mass to create other things with. Unless you say that we want the amount of hypothetical things, but then again we might as well turn our thinking computer on for an infinite universe lifetimes.<br>- Can existing and thought things be the same? If I see a rock or if I think of said rock, are those the same things? Why not, or why so?<br>- Furthermore there are similar or nitpicky problems, like the fact that the machine would likely collapse due to its own gravity, destroying the machine.<br>If any of my points are redundant or simply faulty, I&#39;d like to hear of you.", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T10:18:43Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Robert Hess", "comment_text": "Wow.

He claimed that the amount of <b>possible</b> thoughts was indeed (countably) infinite, and argued it by induction. He said that if you can think about the number n you can think about the number n+1, therefore the amount of numbers you can think about is unbounded.<br><br>Now this argument conflicts heavily with the physical reality that there are a finite number of particles (even going down to the fundamental level) in your neurological system that generates thoughts and mental states. Therefore even if you wanted to arrange them in every possible way, any way you think of doing it will give you a finite number of states at the end of the day. We also know that mental states are actually fairly broad as far as the states in which they can arise, and as such there is a <b>huge</b> amount of states which give rise to the exact same &quot;thought.&quot; This implies that the set of numbers you can think about is indeed finite, but you could also imagine that a conscious organism&#39;s neural existence could grow slowly over time, giving it the ability to think of more and more numbers. This would also rely on the universe being unbounded as well, however.\u00a0<br><br>This got me thinking about what it even means to &quot;think&quot; about something. It seems intuitive that if I can think about a number n then I can think about n+1, but the argument itself only actually uses 2 &quot;numbers&quot; which are really just abstract concepts which are two thoughts. If I think about the &quot;set of all natural numbers&quot; or even the &quot;set of all infinite decimal numbers&quot; (which is <b>uncountable</b>) then I&#39;m not really producing a countably or uncountably infinite number of <b>thoughts</b>, but actually just two thoughts about each of these entities. We like to think of the way we define mathematical objects as &quot;being&quot; those objects in a real way, but really the objects are merely the finite symbols we use in the definition. Kurt G\u00f6del was the mathematician who really plowed through this field and elucidated a vast array of these ideas, so if anyone reading this finds the subject interesting I would suggest reading about his work.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T06:27:26Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Jimmy Turner", "comment_text": "I&#39;m too high for this. \u00a0Or not high enough. \u00a0I&#39;m not the exact right amount of high.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T06:27:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sam jones", "comment_text": "Is every thing everything?", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T06:27:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jubba Fudgy", "comment_text": "Man, big fan of the band.

This number is \u00a02^(10^61 * ((10^183)!)).<br><br>Apologies for the wall of text, and feel free to refute me if you find any errors in my math.<br><br>-Planck units are the smallest physically possible units given our current understanding of physics, as they are bound by constants such as the speed of light, so there can be, as you stated, 10^183 different Planck volumes in the observable universe. Nothing smaller is possible given our current understanding of the laws of physics, so lets use that as a point for our fundamental particle.<br><br>-We don&#39;t know if there are specific fundamental units, but if we assume there is a different/distinct Planck volume at each 10^183 individual possible position, that leaves us with (10^183)! possible permutations of them. This is the total number of states the observable universe could ever possibly be in.<br><br>-Now, since we can define any physical object as any possible distinct subset of this, it is the total number of distinct subsets of all 10^183! permutations, or 2^((10^183)!).\u00a0Since electrons are on a much larger scale than the Planck volume, this will include every possible arrangement of thoughts and memories stored in brains, every possible file on any computer, so it will include every possible distinct thought at any distinct moment, any possible song or book or paper, etc.<br><br>Now if we want to say, well hey, thoughts themselves might be 4-dimensional, lets factor in time. I&#39;m not going to go into more dimensions than this, as I&#39;m sticking strictly in what we currently can observe, but lets consider time, as this will even give us motion vectors, so it&#39;ll give us every sound ever made and every signal ever sent out - effectively every piece of data to ever exist.<br><br>The universe can be in any of these (10^183)! states at any individual time, and the smallest measurable unit of time is a Planck second. There have been about 10^61 Planck seconds (iirc) since the universe has &quot;started&quot;. Discounting expansion and all that stuff, that means that each of these 10^61 planck seconds could have had the universe in any of (10^183)! possible permutations, or a total of 10^61*((10^183)!) possible 4 dimensional permutations of the observable universe from the start of time till now.<br><br>Since any distinct possible subset of these permutations can be considered a unique object, there is an upper max of 2^(10^61 * ((10^183)!)) possible objects that could ever have existed up until this point. This includes every sound ever made, every electromagnetic signal (light, radio, gamma, etc) ever broadcast...
