The report stated that there was a distinguishable downward trend that showed how music became measurably less and less good over time. This trend was actually caused by shifting practices of record companies. You see, previously, a record company scout would actively search for bands/performers who had a noticeable level of success and decide whether or not to take a risk on that group/performer. The risk was high and so was the reward when things turned out well. Just take a look at the Beatles or the Rolling Stones for example. But the failure was catastrophic when things did not turn out. Record companies recognized this pattern and started seeking out ways to minimize the risk of huge loss even at the cost of huge reward because more money can be made overall by several low-risk chances than by a few high-risk chances. So, record companies gradually began taking fewer and fewer risks and began turning away from seeking talented individuals/groups and started more and more to look for what has mass appeal. The turning point came in the 90&#39;s and the major record companies stopped the old practices altogether. Now, they use mathematical formulae to determine what has mass appeal and lasting residual effect. Songs use far fewer words and notes to drive up repetitiveness to increase the chance that a catchy tune will stick in your head better and longer. According to another report from just a few years ago, over 80% of all new pop music produced in the US was only being written by just 2 men whose job it was to write catchy tunes with mass appeal.<br>TLDR: Bands like Nirvana will never get the chance that they would&#39;ve gotten decades ago because greed has spoiled the industry.", "comment_date": "2020-08-13T09:14:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anon cyclist", "comment_text": "well if im in a motorbike im probably having quite a bad time already", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T09:16:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Haru's shitposts", "comment_text": "Nah we all gonna die now 2020 bois", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T05:08:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I D", "comment_text": "OK so my death will be in November 28th 2059", "comment_date": "2020-08-11T14:16:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "You got rick rolled", "comment_text": "imagine how weird it is that actually someone of the subscribers of vsauce will likely die on calculated time in 2059", "comment_date": "2020-08-11T10:04:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "i exist", "comment_text": "ha im 11 years old", "comment_date": "2020-08-11T01:47:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cubs", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-CK8VxMz9g&amp;t=2m13s\">2:13</a>   <br>me: instantly looks at obama<br>him: <b>here&#39;s a photo of me and my favorite youtube creators</b><br>me: wait a damn minute", "comment_date": "2020-08-10T21:34:00Z", "likes_count": 245}, {"comment_by": "\u6226Keihatsu", "comment_text": "When the anti-vax kid lives beyond the age of 12 <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-CK8VxMz9g&amp;t=00m01s\">00:01</a>", "comment_date": "2020-08-10T21:11:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chetan McGrath", "comment_text": "Whoo&#39;s watching in 2021, because if you are then I&#39;d like to know what&#39;s up with corona.

Researchers from the Center for Naval Analyses had conducted a study of the damage done to aircraft that had returned from missions, and had recommended that armor be added to the areas that showed the most damage. Wald noted that the study only considered the aircraft that had survived their missions\u2014the bombers that had been shot down were not present for the damage assessment. The holes in the returning aircraft, then, represented areas where a bomber could take damage and still return home safely. Wald proposed that the Navy instead reinforce the areas where the returning aircraft were unscathed, since those were the areas that, if hit, would cause the plane to be lost.[4][5] This is still considered today seminal work in the then-fledgling discipline of operational research.&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-06-11T09:52:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ronnie Rabell", "comment_text": "love these shows. vsauce is the best youtube channel i subscribe too \ud83d\ude0a\ud83c\udf0e\ud83d\udc4c", "comment_date": "2016-06-10T01:57:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackson Guillory", "comment_text": "2007-2131", "comment_date": "2016-06-09T23:36:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackson Guillory", "comment_text": "im 8", "comment_date": "2016-06-09T23:34:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Pablo Racca", "comment_text": "Oh shit in 2060 im dead..", "comment_date": "2016-06-09T21:54:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lud 166", "comment_text": "Could i be one of those 340 people?? \ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30\ud83d\ude30", "comment_date": "2016-06-09T19:20:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robyn Sirkowitz", "comment_text": "Anyone else immediately think of the Fifth Wave trilogy when they saw this title?", "comment_date": "2016-06-09T03:36:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KamiltheCamel", "comment_text": "How are cars safer than bikes", "comment_date": "2016-06-08T05:23:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "flarecat!", "comment_text": "well I survived 2 years after this video....<br>lets hope for 3! xD", "comment_date": "2016-06-08T04:01:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The_Mad_Bear", "comment_text": "you schould meet putin", "comment_date": "2016-06-07T14:20:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mert Antika", "comment_text": "Very ugly mustache Michael...", "comment_date": "2016-06-06T12:56:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chamath", "comment_text": "whats the music at the end?", "comment_date": "2016-06-06T04:07:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "angel", "comment_text": "I just realized that the majority of people who watch vsauce are male??

That&#39;s DEATH expectation. That&#39;s the mean of the probability distribution of people&#39;s age who die TODAY. But don&#39;t you get it? That has more to do with what the life expectation was 70 years ago than the life expectation of someone alive today who has yet to die. NOBODY knows what LIFE expectation is today, the mean of the probability distribution of the time of death of someone alive NOW, because no one knows what technologies will be available tomorrow to extend that someone&#39;s life. In other words, just because the average age of the people who DIE today is 70, that doesn&#39;t mean someone who is currently 35 should expect to have 35 years left on average, via new technology, that someone could be alive in 50, 100, or 1000 years, and no one has any idea what the probabilities are of that. The day the human race has no further developments and technology 50 years from now will be expected to be the same as it is today, THAT is the day that death expectation will equal life expectation. Why is anyone still going on about death expectation as if it&#39;s the same as life expectation? AND it gets worse than that. Because the 35 year old, even if life expectation WAS the same as death expectation, would expect to live longer than 35 years longer, because the average of 70 would include in its average, all those people who died before the age of 35, but the 35-year-old is already past that point, you would need to average the death age of everyone who is in the set of people who live to the age of 35 or more (in other words exclude from the group of people you&#39;re averaging, everyone younger than 35 when they died, and if they were included, they would lower the average death age, so leaving them out increases the average), so the 35 year old would expect to live 40 or 45 years more then on average, because it&#39;s a distribution on a conditional probability, maybe for every additional second he lives at the age of 35, that adds an additional 1/10 second on to the expected time of his death, while for a 80 year old, every additional second adds maybe half a second on to the expected time of death.", "comment_date": "2015-01-22T00:53:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "fortsXBot", "comment_text": ".", "comment_date": "2015-01-21T21:24:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hamymancan", "comment_text": "Well damn, the day just after my birthday, how nice", "comment_date": "2015-01-21T21:13:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paulius Pa\u017edagis", "comment_text": "There is no point in rubbing yourself into the fact that you statistically might die.

You have to press one or else you will die immediately and your whole family will also. Which one do you press?<br><br>Obviously the one that kills you in ten years.

Watching a loved one become slowly crippled by their nicotine addiction, reaching the point where you know there is nothing you can do and you are condemned to die, and then fighting off the diseases in a painful and often undignified fashion is a terrible thing.<br><br>For another, while it is statistically true that around one person a day dies from cigarette related illnesses, many people who don&#39;t necessarily die from cigarettes, they certainly are impacted in negative ways as well. Your lifespan is shortened. You will face health problems, which even if non-fatal still impact your quality of life. Your psychology is impacted, and not in a good way. You lose out on time, your relationships and career paths may suffer. I would much rather live a happy and meaningful existence, free from toxins in my bloodstream, and die suddenly one day than die a slow death grappling with an addiction.<br><br>Obviously this is still a really well done video and interesting as always Vsauce, but I thought I should point that out!", "comment_date": "2014-04-22T11:15:46Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "IndyStry", "comment_text": "Reminds me of Philosoraptor&#39;s famous quote:<br>&quot;We avoid risks in our life so that we can make it safely to death.&quot;<br>Such a goddamn powerful line.", "comment_date": "2014-04-22T07:35:52Z", "likes_count": 163}, {"comment_by": "Serban Anghel", "comment_text": "anyone knows what&#39;s the name of the song at the end of the video ?", "comment_date": "2014-04-22T07:17:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anneliese Jackson", "comment_text": "well guess im dying on my birthday...\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-22T04:51:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christian Herzberger", "comment_text": "I&#39;m 14 lol", "comment_date": "2014-04-22T04:47:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jankzon13154", "comment_text": "One of your more interesting vids in my opinion.", "comment_date": "2014-04-22T04:23:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jankzon13154", "comment_text": "In 2073, I&#39;ll be 71 years old...

Not a thing from twenty five years of life. His friend, Jack, has had to live through that experience and knows everything that happened since his memory starting point: childhood. John&#39;s memory starting point, however, would be from the point he regained consciousness. So mentally, he hasn&#39;t lived his past. Only his present. So for any person, would it be safe to say that if they can remember their past and current present that they won&#39;t lose their memories?

What makes the story so unnerving is the realistic-looking &quot;photograph&quot; of a baby sauropod that accompanies it, which looks a bit like the creepy baby in David Lynch&#39;s classic film Eraserhead. Needless to say, this &quot;news item&quot; is a complete hoax, albeit a very entertaining one.<br><br>Jurassic Park made it all look so easy: in a remote laboratory, a team of scientists extracts DNA from the guts of hundred-million-year-old mosquitoes petrified in amber (these pesky bugs, of course, feasted on dinosaur blood before they died). The dinosaur DNA is combined with frog DNA (an odd choice, considering that frogs are amphibians rather than reptiles), and then, by some mysterious process that&#39;s presumably too difficult for the average moviegoer to follow, the result is a living, breathing Velociraptor straight out of the Cretaceous period.<br><br>In real life, though, cloning a dinosaur would be a much, much more difficult undertaking. That hasn&#39;t prevented an eccentric Australian billionaire, Clive Palmer, from recently announcing his plans to clone dinosaurs for a real-life, down-under Jurassic Park. (One presumes that Palmer made his announcement in the same spirit that Donald Trump tested the waters for a presidential bid--as a way of attracting attention and headlines.) Is Palmer one shrimp short of a full barbie, or has he somehow mastered the scientific challenge of dinosaur cloning? Let&#39;s take a closer look at what&#39;s involved.<br><br><b>Dinosaur Cloning Step #1: Obtain a Dinosaur Genome</b><br><br>DNA--the molecule that encodes all of an organism&#39;s genetic information--has a notoriously complex, and easily breakable, structure consisting of millions of &quot;base pairs&quot; strung in a specific sequence. The fact is that it&#39;s extremely difficult to extract a full strand of DNA from a 10,000-year-old Woolly Mammoth frozen in permafrost; imagine what the odds are for a dinosaur, even an extremely well-fossilized one, that has been encased in sediment for over 65 million years. Jurassic Park had the right idea, DNA-extraction-wise; the trouble is that dinosaur DNA would degrade even in the relatively isolated confines of a mosquito&#39;s fossilized tummy.<br>The best we can reasonably hope for--and even that&#39;s a stretch--is to recover scattered fragments of a particular dinosaur&#39;s DNA, accounting for perhaps one or two percent of its entire genome. Then, the hand-waving argument goes, we might be able to supplement these DNA fragments with strands obtained from the modern descendants of dinosaurs, the birds. But which species of bird? How much of its DNA? And, without knowing what a complete Diplodocus genome looks like, how would we know where to insert the dinosaur DNA remnants?<br><br><b>Dinosaur Cloning Step 2: Find a Suitable Host</b><br><br>Ready for more disappointment? An intact dinosaur genome, even if one were ever miraculously to be found, wouldn&#39;t be sufficient, by itself, to clone a dinosaur. You can&#39;t just inject the DNA into, say, an unfertilized chicken egg, then sit back and wait for your Apatosaurus to hatch. The fact is that most vertebrates need to gestate in extremely specific conditions, and, at least for a short period of time, in a living body (even a fertilized chicken egg spends a day or two in the mother hen&#39;s oviduct before it&#39;s laid).<br><br>So what would be the ideal &quot;foster mom&quot; for a cloned dinosaur? Clearly, if we&#39;re talking about a genus on the larger end of the spectrum, we&#39;ll need a correspondingly hefty bird, if only because dinosaur eggs were much bigger than chicken eggs. (That&#39;s another reason you couldn&#39;t hatch a baby Apatosaurus out of a chicken egg; it&#39;s just not capacious enough.) An ostrich might fit the bill, but we&#39;re so far out on a speculative limb now that we might as well just consider cloning a giant, extinct bird like Gastornis or Argentavis!<br><br><b>Dinosaur Cloning Step 3: Cross Your Fingers (or Claws)</b><br><br>Let&#39;s put the odds of successfully cloning a dinosaur into perspective. Consider the common practice of artificial gestation involving human beings--i.e., in vitro fertilization. No cloning or manipulation of genetic material is involved, just introducing a sperm to an egg, cultivating the resulting zygote in a test-tube for a couple of days, and implanting the embryo-in-waiting into the mother&#39;s uterus. Even this technique fails more often than it succeeds; most times, the zygote simply doesn&#39;t &quot;take,&quot; and any genetic abnormalities will cause a termination of the pregnancy weeks, or months, after the implantation.<br><br>Compared to IVF, cloning a dinosaur is almost infinitely more complicated. We simply don&#39;t have access to the proper environment in which a dinosaur embryo can gestate, or the means to tease out the information encoded in dinosaur DNA in the proper sequence and with the proper timing. Even if we got as far as implanting a full dinosaur genome into an ostrich egg, the embryo would, in the vast majority of cases, simply fail to develop. Long story short: pending some major advancements in science, there&#39;s no need to book a trip to Australia&#39;s Jurassic Park!<br><br><br>Author: Bob Strauss", "comment_date": "2014-03-30T16:13:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DanceBeforeTheStorm", "comment_text": "Almost 2 million views in a week!<br>Glad to see there&#39;s a need for sense and science out there - thumbs up!", "comment_date": "2014-03-30T15:54:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Pancake", "comment_text": "michael: where do smells come from ( have they been around since the birth of the universe? ) and where do they go?<br>:)", "comment_date": "2014-03-30T15:12:42Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Malaama John Wachi", "comment_text": "O come on Vsauce what a way to start a video!

We might know what 5 cigarette a day for the average person does and then divide that by the shortened lifespan but that simply isn&#39;t accurate.<br><br>I could be 10 times worse or 10 times better than we think but these statistics are obscuring the fact that we don&#39;t actually know to any meaningful degree what the impact of 5 cigarettes actually is !<br><br><br>Have you ever read about the McNamara Fallacy \u00a0?<br><br><br>You talk about the natural biases that we suffer from but what about the artificial ones that lead us to believe things like dying from drawing the wrong explosive cigarette is the same as excess cancer rates in smokers.", "comment_date": "2014-03-30T02:35:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob3956332", "comment_text": "Im gonna die on my birthday...?<br>Well then", "comment_date": "2014-03-30T02:27:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Graham Thomas", "comment_text": "You should do an episode on taste and inherently why things taste bad.", "comment_date": "2014-03-30T01:28:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jake Mowbray", "comment_text": "how big would noahs ark have had to been", "comment_date": "2014-03-30T01:20:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "3lisa", "comment_text": "Poke my birthday is a scam, it says the same thing on each birthday...", "comment_date": "2014-03-30T01:16:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Connor Mooney", "comment_text": "Reading Vsauce comments restores my faith in humanity.

I just subscribed now but Ive been watching your channel for a while now. I watched that Universal Death Clock video, it was very interesting but it also left me with a question and maybe you might have an input on this. Why do things end? From birth to death, ancient civilizations, the start of the dinosaurs to their exinction, the start of humans to who knows when or how its gonna end for us. Whenever theres a beginning there will always be an ending. The earth, the stars, black holes, even the universe will eventually be no more. Kind of depressing but if you think about it whenever there is an ending there also has been a new beginning lol Just food for thought Id like to hear your input.
