I&#39;ve noticed that things I remember from early on are connected to strong emotions I felt at the time. Also, it seems that there&#39;s an order to it. My first memories are of happiness, fear, then sadness. Babies usually start off being happy, then as they get older and parents start to distance themselves, they develope fears of the dark, being alone, etc.. Later, something happens creating the feeling of sadness and loss.
