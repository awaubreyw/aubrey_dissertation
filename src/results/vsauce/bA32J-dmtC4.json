This means that with hundreds of millions of people alive who play cards, added with the history of cards being played since generations spanning centuries ago, all multiplied by everybcard shuffle performed, then added with every shuffle of every deck by every performing cardmagician, who may practice their craft for several hours a day. ( A single card magician could comfortably log in at least a thousand card shuffles in a single evening.)  While it may seem staggering to try and compute actual figures from all of this (very difficult considering the many variable concerning the regularity of an individuals number of shuffles per evening), Even just assuming that there are only one million card magic enthusiasts dedicated enough to log 1, 000 card shuffles per day, that still amounts to 1 billion shuffles(or deck configurations) per day.  Considering I think that 1 million card magic enthusiasts is probably an UNDERESTIMATION, even just in north america, and that this figure also completely excludes gambling addicts the world over, this all amounts to at least between tens of billions and hundreds of billions of card configurations per day. Now while the figure at the top; of total possible combinations, is vast, but only vast enough to ensure THAT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE that any specific random card combination will ever be reachieved. Some of these orders, or configurations will be, and many will not, but the tenet of randomness, that is , that every possible configuration is equally likely, IT IS possible that two different decks could be accidentally, or \u201crandomly\u201d put into the same order within the very same day, in two different parts of the world, completely by chance...", "comment_date": "2019-02-07T22:26:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moon", "comment_text": "I hate hazelnuts.<br>I hate cashews.<br>I have everything.<br>&quot;But do you want chocolate-covered honeycomb?&quot;<br>No...<br>YES!!!
