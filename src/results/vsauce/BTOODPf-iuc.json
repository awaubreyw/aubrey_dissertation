For example if the speed of light was really slow like 10m/s, it would take a long time for the light to travel from 60m down the road to where you are and therefore when the light reaches you, you are seeing in the past. Its the same with the actual speed of light but just to a smaller scale. So if you see an object 1000m metres away from you, it might take 0.001 seconds for the light to reach you and therefore you are seeing 0.001 seconds in the past. Every star we see we are seeing in the past but at different pasts. One star could be 1500 light years away and so we are seeing that star (when the light reaches us) 1500 years in the past. Another star could be 2000 light years away so we see that star 2000 years in the past.", "comment_date": "2021-06-17T20:03:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kilroy987", "comment_text": "It isn&#39;t like I could do anything in that 80ms anyway.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T14:41:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaurav Mishra", "comment_text": "What is even past ?

However today we know that this is false. Atoms are composed of electrons, neutrons and protons. Those neutrons and protons are made of quarks, and lately those quarks turned-out to be made of strings. However 1400 years ago the Quran contradicted the common knowledge of the time, it stated that the atom is not the smallest part.<br><br>[Quran 6.95] It is Allah Who splits the grains and the nuclei. He brings the living from the dead, and He brings the dead from the living. Such is Allah. So how could you deviate?<br><br><br><br>Nucleus In Arabic means &quot;Nawat \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0629&quot;. Its plural nuclei in Arabic is &quot;nawa \u0646\u0651\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0649\u0670&quot;. So the Quran says that God splits the nucleus. This means that the atom is not the smallest particle.<br><br> [Quran 10:61] Whatever you may be doing, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Quran, and whatever deed you may be doing, We [Allah] do witness when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden from your Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom on Earth nor in heaven, not less than that nor more but is (written) in a clear record (on the Preserved Tablet).<br><br><br><br>So the atom is not the smallest part of an atom. Today we know from String Theory that the smallest mass is the mass of a string.<br><br><br><br>The vibration of the string determines its mass. However this was portrayed in the Quran 1400 years before it was discovered. The Quran portrays the smallest particle as a wick.<br><br>[Quran4.49] Have you not considered those who claim purity for themselves? Rather, Allah purifies whom He wills, and they will not be wronged by a wick.<br><br><br><br>Fateel \u0641\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0644\u064b  means wick. The smallest thing is a wick.<br><br><br><br>The wick in the Quran looks exactly like the string in String Theory.<br><br>From String Theory we know that the smallest mass is the mass of a string. The vibration of the string determines its mass. However this was portrayed in the Quran 1400 years before it was discovered. The Quran says that the smallest mass is a pluck.<br><br>[Quran4.124] But whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, and is a believer, those will enter Paradise, and will not be wronged by a pluck.<br><br><br><br>Nakara \u0646\u0642\u0631 means pluck. Pluck the string of a musical instrument means \u0646\u0642\u0631 \u0623\u0648\u062a\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0648\u062f.  Nakir \u0646\u0642\u064a\u0631 means vibrations of a string. In this verse Nakiran  \u0646\u064e\u0642\u0650\u064a\u0631\u064b\u0627 means a single vibration of a string. So in the Quran the smallest mass is the single vibration of a string.<br><br>In this verse the smallest mass is a pluck and in the previous verse the smallest particle is a wick. Both verses are describing the same smallest particle. Today we know what it is, this is a vibrating string.<br><br>How could an illiterate man who lived 1400 years ago have known that the smallest particle is a vibrating string?<br><br>(The Bible says that stars burn like lamps, that is, it is a chemical reaction Revelation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTOODPf-iuc&amp;t=8m10s\">8:10</a>. However in reality there is no such thing as burning, instead atoms fuse inside stars by gravity, a nuclear reaction not a chemical one).<br><br>18- <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23planetary\">#Planetary</a> Orbits<br>All stars and planets have orbits.<br>For centuries it was believed that Earth is fixed and the sun, moon and planets revolve around it. However 1400 years ago the Quran said that not only the sun and moon but also Earth moves in a designated path:<br><br>[Quran 39.5] [Allah] Created the heavens and the Earth in truth. He overlaps the night over the day and overlaps the day over the night, and enslaved the sun and the moon, ALL MOVE (\u0643\u0644 \u064a\u062c\u0631\u064a) to a prerecorded destiny. Is He not the Exalted, the Forgiver?<br><br><br><br>Here the Quran is referring to ALL MOVING: not only the sun and moon but also Earth. In Arabic grammar there is difference between the singular (one), binary (two) and plural (three or more). The reference to binary is &quot;Kulahuma Yajreean \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0646&quot; however the Quran said &quot;Kullon yajree \u0643\u0644 \u064a\u062c\u0631\u064a&quot; referring to the plural (three or more). Since the sun and moon are just two but the Quran is referring to three or more then according to the Quran all the three move sun, moon and Earth.<br><br>[Quran 86.11] And the sky that returns.<br><br><br><br>&quot;Al-rajeh \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0651\u064e\u062c\u0652\u0639\u0650&quot;  means returns to the same location. Today we know that all planets return to the same locations in their respective orbits.<br><br>How could an illiterate man who lived 1400 years ago have known that planets return to their original locations?<br><br>Mistranslations: Quran 18.86 sun setting in a spring.<br><br>(The Christian Bible says that Earth is a 2 dimensional flat disk and the heaven is like a canopy solid like bronze: Isaiah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTOODPf-iuc&amp;t=40m22s\">40:22</a>)<br><br>2- <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shape\">#Shape</a> Of Universe<br>Curvature of space.<br>Every observer in the universe sees the observable universe around him as an expanding sphere, 93 light-years in diameter. This is true for any observer even those outside our observable universe. What we see and what they see is the same, an expanding sphere 93 light-years in diameter.<br><br>Assuming the universe is isotropic, the distance to the edge of the observable universe is roughly the same in every direction. That is, the observable universe has a spherical volume (a ball) centered on the observer. Every location in the universe has its own observable universe, which may or may not overlap with the one centered on Earth...<br><br>The radius of the observable universe is therefore estimated to be about 46.5 billion light-years and its diameter about 28.5 gigaparsecs (93 billion light-years...)<br>Wikipedia, Observable Universe, 2020<br>The observable universe is a sphere. This was known recently, however this was portrayed in the Quran 1400 years before it was discovered.<br><br>[Quran 55.33] O society of jinn and humans!

But you will not escape except with authorization.<br><br><br><br>&quot;Aktar \u0623\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0637\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650&quot; means diameters. But diameter is strictly property of circles or spheres. Since Earth and the heavens have diameters then the according to the Quran Earth and the observable universe are spheres. Man on Earth and the jinn in the heavens see the observable universe as a sphere.<br><br>How could an illiterate man who lived 1400 years ago have known that the observable universe is a sphere?<br><br>Observers everywhere see the same properties for the universe.<br><br>The cosmological principle is usually stated formally as &#39;Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers.&#39; This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the same physical laws apply throughout. In essence, this in a sense says that the universe is knowable and is playing fair with scientists.<br>Wikipedia, Cosmologic Principle, 2020<br>&quot;Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers&quot; this was known recently, however this was portrayed in the Quran 1400 years before it was discovered.<br><br>[Quran 79.27] Are you more difficult to create, or the heaven?

Today we know that this is correct because all observers see the same radius. (If Earth were flat and the sky were a dome, as some skeptics claim, then the height at the center would be bigger than height at the edges, hence observers would not see the same thickness.)<br><br>How could an illiterate man who lived 1400 years ago have known that all observers see equal radii?", "comment_date": "2020-08-08T16:28:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Piyush Raj", "comment_text": "Binod", "comment_date": "2020-08-08T09:30:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cutiecha", "comment_text": "<b>*Looks at sun*</b><br><br><br><br>Ah, sun looked nice 7 minutes ago", "comment_date": "2020-08-08T09:03:09Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Tom", "comment_text": "Well this was made 8 years ago so technically dude in this exact video, you live in the past", "comment_date": "2020-08-08T07:27:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brett Vasquez", "comment_text": "Did anyone just get really anxious all of the sudden?", "comment_date": "2020-08-08T01:03:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rico [Brawlstars]", "comment_text": "69 lakh views...lets keep it", "comment_date": "2020-08-07T09:17:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ola \u05e2\u05d5\u05de\u05e8", "comment_text": "Me: Pulls an uno reverse card &quot;no you&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T21:31:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sujan aryal", "comment_text": "So basically our brains lag", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T11:19:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlueKernel", "comment_text": "hahahaha, america lives 8 hours in the past", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T12:28:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julie Blue eyes", "comment_text": "The bible says you will find the end in the beginning, so how do you figure that one?", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T23:09:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Warwick Slater", "comment_text": "I bet it took you more than 80 ms to realise Michael&#39;s shirt is on inside out", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T19:00:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zombie", "comment_text": "Me commenting 8 years later: HA!", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:43:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "cicalinarrot", "comment_text": "YOU LIVE IN THE PAST<br>(8 years old video I\u2019ve already watched.

Here&#39;s why: <br><br>The coolest part about this video is understanding the fact that time is literally an illusion in the way that we percieve it, because of the way our brains are built. We are a sensory blob of flesh taking information in and building a perception of the world based off of this, and everything we think we see is actually a memory, so of course from the point in time we are born to the point in time that we die, we percieve time like an arrow going forward because we are constantly creating new memories. But in actuality, time is just a thing. The universe is just a thing. Heat death and the big bang are simultaneous. We just don&#39;t experience it that way because it&#39;s basically impossible to do so as a living, conscious being (as far as we know right now). Again, you exist and get to see the world in the time you, well, exist. And there&#39;s an infinite number of you ahead of you in time and behind you in time. You just feel like you&#39;re moving forward. Think of it kind of like an escalator. Each step comes out, moves to the end and then goes back in. And it cycles. Except the escalator never stops.<br><br>So yes I will call my life the Endless Escalator Endeavor now shut up and leave me alone", "comment_date": "2020-05-15T13:10:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ti", "comment_text": "So everybody is at a 80 millisecond delay, but what about Ninja?

In this theory we have an emergent uncertain future continuously coming into existence relative to the spontaneous absorption and emission of photon energy.

The future is unfolding with each photon electron coupling or dipole moment relative to the atoms of the periodic table and the wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum. As part of a universal process of energy exchange that forms the ever changing world of our everyday life the \u2018past\u2019 has gone forever. At the smallest scale of this process the \u2018past\u2019 is represented by anti-matter annihilation with the symmetry between matter and anti-matter representing the symmetry between the future and the past as the future unfolds photon by photon. In such a theory the mathematics of quantum mechanics represents the physics of \u2018time\u2019 with the classical physics of Newton representing processes over a period of time, as in Newton\u2019s differential equations.

For all its machinations the \u201cthinker\u201d is just as transitory as every other thought - being itself merely a sequence of thoughts about thoughts about thoughts ad infinitum.<br><br>This duplicity ostensibly allows the mind to distance itself from its shadowy, more unpalatable, impulses \u2013 its envy, its greed, its fears, its animosities - by fabricating a make-believe &quot;I&quot; separate from &quot;them.&quot; It seeks to create a chasm which hides this darker side from itself but which also prevents the light of awareness from reaching and illuminating it. &quot;I&quot; do not have &quot;those&quot; reprehensible qualities or, &quot;I&quot; am burdened and distressed by &quot;those&quot; feelings. The &quot;I&quot; can then make half-hearted efforts to change &quot;those&quot; unwelcome characteristics without fundamentally acknowledging &quot;them&quot; as itself. &quot;They&quot; are not me; &quot;they&quot; are &quot;happening&quot; to me. It is a devilish ruse meant to hamper the disconcerting recognition that the &quot;I&quot; is, in fact, &quot;those&quot; negative attributes. The mind, in effect, seeks to bury its head in the sand and pretend it is &quot;something&quot; other than &quot;those&quot; unacceptable parts of itself.<br><br>So long as that subterfuge persists - an &quot;observer&quot; or &quot;experiencer&quot; separate from its &quot;experience&quot; - there is little possibility of integrating and resolving the disowned impulses. The &quot;experiencer,&quot; being a fiction, is impotent and has negligible effect on &quot;its&quot; experience. Only a clear choiceless awareness of the stream of experience, unclouded by the chatter of an imaginary &quot;self&quot; or &quot;thinker,&quot; can expedite that integration. In that benevolent silence the mind can begin to spontaneously perceive the way out of its maze of &quot;self&quot;-imposed contradictions .<br><br>The undivided, \u201cself-less,\u201d mind bestows coherence and lucidity on all its encounters. It is the only truly sane mind amongst all.

But on earth time would accelerate immensely. So if you left earth, approached the horizon of a black hoe, and then left, when you returned to earth it could be 5 years 10 years or 1000 years in the future. This is all due to the fact that time is affected only by Gravity, and when we experience different gravity time changes at a different rate then anywhere that has different gravity relative to yours.

And when Im standing still I just turn around and someone really is behind me.

So having a healthy fear is not a bad thing after all, but could also ruin our given opportunities we can&#39;t recognise.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-06-03T22:22:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kira Smith", "comment_text": "This means eventually we will be able to have real matrix mode!\u00a0<br>As in what if we could genetically modify the brain to be faster when we want it to and to comparison all others people and things would be slower.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-06-03T18:35:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Legofan1401", "comment_text": "I feel stupid right now...Tapping my nose and my toe at the same time to see my brain&#39;s reaction time :S", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T21:37:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Jax", "comment_text": "am i the only one who thinks 80 milli seconds is kind of a lot?", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T17:27:09Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "iBattle2Win", "comment_text": "My brain hurts real bad!", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T16:13:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "josh leen", "comment_text": "Try tapping on each foot with nose", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T06:21:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "josh leen", "comment_text": "Yaaaaaaaaa", "comment_date": "2014-06-02T06:14:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Slickslider - GAMING AND STORYS", "comment_text": "no there really is no now", "comment_date": "2014-06-01T21:34:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Memz", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTOODPf-iuc&amp;t=0m53s\">0:53</a> I saw it in the middle", "comment_date": "2014-05-31T22:06:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hydroblitz", "comment_text": "dumb brain", "comment_date": "2014-05-31T00:05:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "808", "comment_text": "The song at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTOODPf-iuc&amp;t=3m01s\">3:01</a> is really weird.", "comment_date": "2014-05-30T13:54:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PenguinLord1911", "comment_text": "HES GONNA TAKE YOU BACK TO THE PAST!!!", "comment_date": "2014-05-30T02:16:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "starsmoke", "comment_text": "a matrix will take over the lag period until we are completely convinced of a false reality. dont flame me for lack of scientific basis its a half-joke", "comment_date": "2014-05-29T04:51:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Holidej", "comment_text": "wow...

I have been pondering the mind body problem. I feel this &quot;problem&quot; is not one to be &quot;solved&quot;. Because our mind and our body are not the true physical representation of what we are. They are infact a perception of real objects; yet skewed through this delayed perception mentioned above.<br>\u00a0Focus on the body, and the true now is realized! The source of &quot;I am&quot;. We are all the same I. . . Out of fear of being spammed by nuts on either side of the spectrum, I regress to the idea of free will. No matter the religious,political,ex. idea you hold free will is an universal phenomenon. If we realize the mind body connection, as a culture, as a species, and as an individual, driven by motive; we will know true peace. Peace, is the word we use to describe the absence of war. I believe this to be detrimental to the true meaning of peace. Peace is love. Peace is true. Peace is free. Peace is understanding. Peace is honest.\u00a0<br>So the war hawks LIE<br>Alienation is the strongest weapon against human beings, because if we realize our own potential, our TRUE value, the strong would take over this planet and live as free men once again.<br>Hare Krsna \u00a0", "comment_date": "2013-11-21T02:09:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sina Madani", "comment_text": "That ring experiment seems like a fail.
