So I feel the humans should have had no information. The humans being made believe they were on a game show and that they could &quot;keep all they money they got&quot; literally made them believe after getting money that they in turn had to do something to get the money. If they went in there with no information, no instructions, no idea of the premise what so ever, I think the outcome may have been different, or at the very least would have taken a lot longer to achieve or replicate. And Michael, You know as well as I do, that in order for the results of the test to be the most accurate, the test must be performed as EXACTLY the same as the previous test you are studying.  Anything else skews the results and dare i say makes them wrong. If a person believes they are going to win money while they are in a room for 10 minutes, as soon as the money gets spit out they are going to correlate something they did to the reason the money came out. Not only that, they are going to &quot;try&quot; to get as much money as possible cause that is the whole purpose they were even there in the first place.  It&#39;s just basic human nature. This leans heavily into &quot;confirmation bias&quot;. Game shows are not random and everybody knows that. And the object of a game show for the person who is playing is to win as much money as they can in the allotted time. I also assume if it was 30 minutes or 60 minutes, they would have realized the pattern was in the amount of time between dollars not in anything they did. It&#39;s basic cause and effect. And that&#39;s where anybody with no information about a situation would start, once things start happening. &quot;did I cause this&quot; &quot;let me try to replicate what i did, to see if I can replicate what the money did&quot;.

It is a harmonious relationship higher than a mere degradation to minerals that return to the earth. It is a harmonious melody in which all creatures declare the Mightyness and Flawlessness of GOD Allah the Almighty. <br>It is a relationship that you have directly with God. You don&#39;t have to have a messenger or transducer in between which I believe your second demonstration in this episode was up criticing. Actually this is in total alignement with Islam where God is Almighty and hears and sees everyone Himself, so I believe what you actually disproved was the work of the priests. In fact,  it is needless if everyone and anyone can be in direct contact with God. <br>In Islam everyone knows how to seek salvation for himself by himself there is no need for a priest or whoever.

Using the Skinnerbox for example, an individual coincidentally behaving uniquely, at the exact time necessary, would produce an outcome relative to their perspective. They would not be wrong, but rather merely ignorant. <br><br>Imagine that world and the difficulty convincing participants they&#39;re wrong. You&#39;re not imagining a world you don&#39;t already know because it&#39;s simply not possible. Your imagination is limited based on prior observations and the acquired knowledge. Superstitious beliefs in this context are constructs, and while I cannot see the precise connection here, I know for certain the Skinnbox doesn&#39;t accurately reflect what we think superstitious beliefs are. This needs to be examined from a different level or perspective, and perhaps one we&#39;re incapable of. Michael&#39;s expressed apprehension to the Skinnerbox test, indicates an intuitive suspicion of inherent flaws or inaccuracies. Maybe that&#39;s the superstitious result. This test, while not innately wrong, produced flaws in perspective and psychological methodology. <br><br>This may not be scientifically progressive and it may be detrimental. The hilarious paradox required in Science; You&#39;re required to remember that our best knowledge isn&#39;t absolute truth. That&#39;s fucking terrifying because the scientific inclination will inevitably produce studies, verifying the skinnerbox, within a test with a skinnerbox, within a test with a skinnerbox, et cetera... I&#39;m saddened by this because I fear science is discovering what&#39;s possible to already be known, while not discovering the unknowable. <br><br>If there&#39;s one thing I know for sure, it&#39;s that humans don&#39;t backtrack easily. Adapt and move forward at any cost. This mentality is a problem and it&#39;s fucking lazy. <br><br>Addendum because of laziness: I guess my point is, if we want to move forward we should fix what we&#39;ve messed up. This alone will create scientific progress where Science cannot.

Actually, the experiment can prove the opposite in that the persons involved immediately looked for a cause (after they were told that they &quot;had to do something&quot; ie get money). A better experiment would have been if (like the pigeons) people could - without any bias - approach the money giving machine, for instance in the street. Noone would have thought of dancing there ahah.<br><br>- Second, the second experimetn was unethical inmho. First of all you didn&#39;t prove at all that the &quot;faith&quot; of the persons invovled affected the results, because of an underestimated improtant factor...they were hypnotised! The psychiatrist used Eirksonian Neurolinguistic programming - pehrpas the strongest form of hypnosis - to induce patients into that state and then you used that state to prove a point. Secondly, the black woman that felt that &quot;something mystical&quot; happened was the saddest case. If you hear what she says you&#39;ll understand that she lost her mother, so doing an experiment where (as is obvious to all in the comment section) you indirectly mock people&#39;s sensitiivities is unethical. Either the persons invovled were actors or (worse) you abused their sensitivities. I love VSauce but this time was a big flop.

Your conclusion that the human mind is hard-wired to create spiritual/superstitious experience is excellent, but about 2\u00ba off-target.  What the human mind is designed to do is create ANSWERS to questions, mysteries, dilemmas.  They don&#39;t necessarily have to be metaphysical.  It all derives from the way that our species filled it&#39;s environmental niche in the Ice Age.  Our survival was not dependent on physical strength, long canine teeth, a thick fur coat, foot speed, hyper-acute vision etc.  No, it was our CREATIVITY that defined our niche.  It&#39;s important to understand that I don&#39;t mean &quot;intelligence.&quot;  Intelligence and creativity are different things.  Cetaceans, crows, other primates, some cephalopods (the octopus), elephants and others are all intelligent in their own ways.  Our survival depended, instead, on our ability to take old information from the environment and with it, make new things, routines, ideas, more complex and abstract creations.  With creativity our ancestors (people just like us, by the way) could make work-arounds, tools to compensate for the lack of the aforementioned teeth, insulating coat, speed, strength, hyper-vision, whatever.  Building on our experience with the tools at our disposal to that point, we were able to evolve culture, which expands as the supply of novel creations does, exponentially.  A spiritual experience is just one of many subsets of creations which served a purpose.", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T05:10:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HGCduke", "comment_text": "See, as soon as i saw a priest working with a scientist, I would know some bullshit was going on lol", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T01:31:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quentin Arrius", "comment_text": "I felt most of the experiments were a bit biased in this episode. :/<br><br>I would&#39;ve liked to know the previous beliefs of the participants of the reverse exorcism personnaly", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T00:47:30Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Sushi Roll", "comment_text": "My science teacher literally experimented on our whole grade, half of the grade, he said his exam was going to go hard, and the other half, easy, the first half was so mad at him when he told us about the experiment XD", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T22:24:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Ilie", "comment_text": "Man, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR-eMMCp7tg&amp;t=00m00s\">00:00</a>, he got me guys", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T21:14:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "N8", "comment_text": "Why is Rebecca so annoying", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T19:34:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zero", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR-eMMCp7tg&amp;t=8m48s\">8:48</a> thx random person, this video is now demonetized", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T18:04:46Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Zero", "comment_text": "that intro made me realize he didn&#39;t do his usual intro for the Mind Field series, the &quot;Hey Vsauce, Michael here&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-10-25T17:53:22Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "DasMilC", "comment_text": "you would like to experimentally induce a spirit possession experience.

Now, the person believes they are possessed, leading to the correspoinding behaviour.

We have to learn hard, now, because it&#39;s either a prosperous future with technology,  post-apocalyptic strangulation [death wave] and or back to the wilderness entirely.", "comment_date": "2019-10-05T02:37:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Escape Plan", "comment_text": "\u041b\u044e\u0434\u0438, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u044f\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0448\u043e\u0443 \u0441 \u0443\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0435\u043c \u041c\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0430 - \u0432\u044b \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u041c\u0430\u0439\u043b\u0430?", "comment_date": "2019-10-05T00:35:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BBB", "comment_text": "Michael: i feel like a should make a demon possess people", "comment_date": "2019-10-05T00:20:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "blind1337nedm", "comment_text": "a cross is the one without jesus, a crucifix has the jesus on it.", "comment_date": "2019-10-04T23:48:57Z", "likes_count": 32}, {"comment_by": "Brett Stafford", "comment_text": "every vsauce video: lets make random people look stupid and try to get them to believe ridiculous things", "comment_date": "2019-10-04T23:47:49Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Ryan", "comment_text": "Rebeca is so annoying!", "comment_date": "2019-10-04T22:30:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "viseversa", "comment_text": "Train episode \ud83d\ude82", "comment_date": "2019-10-04T21:02:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Michael Bay", "comment_text": "Our mindfield now", "comment_date": "2019-10-04T20:08:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DB Pixels", "comment_text": "that pizza floor though", "comment_date": "2019-10-04T17:05:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin Owens", "comment_text": "You don\u2019t know what you mess with.", "comment_date": "2019-10-04T16:12:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Gonzalez", "comment_text": "Booomb.

Michael....if given the choice are you going to do what I believe Steve Jobs did and upload your consciousness and jump in another vessel as a new  &quot;person&quot; with a new identity unbeknownst to the public. Sort of like that one Twilight Zone episode, I forget the title. To the world yes his body died of cancer but....where is his consciousness now? I believe he&#39;s in another vessel (could be a test tube , genetically altered body or maybe some sort of computer secretly. Life extension in exchange for relinquishment of some control of Apple company, possibly could be a reason. It&#39;s my personal belief I&#39;m not asking anyone to agree or disagree yet they can if they please....just putting it out there. And totally unrelated are you, sir ,operating under some alphabet agency? Theres agents everywhere....they even have stores and other civilian type establishments hidden in plain sight. Who&#39;s to say your friendly shopkeeper isn&#39;t an agent or anybody else for that matter. Like you proved with the &quot;actors&quot;. You never know who is who or or why/how they are operating. Even a step further beyond that who&#39;s to say that, that building one is looking at in their local city is in fact just a building....or if some part isn&#39;t even some apparatus emitting specific mind altering frequencies out into the public unbeknownst to manipulate peoples behavior on any given day for any given reason. Who&#39;s to say some of these videos aren&#39;t experiments on the viewers themselves? So who are you, really?  Reality is becoming truly as strange as fiction. One never knows that&#39;s why we have to observe very closely and question the possibility that something is not as it seems...just as you believe* it seems. Just like we know Google is figuratively fucking us up the ass every day yet we want to believe it&#39;s just a video upload website....when using YouTube you are the experiment.
