Now, the grossest thing I have ever smelled or even experienced was black mold, whose repulsive scent was so strong, that my body would not allow me to physically inhale it, my muscles controlling breathing involuntarily seized up upon detecting mold in such high concentrations, but then relaxed again once I was outside of its proximity. Never have I vomited from being grossed out, my body seems to skip that step. Or does it?

It kept on making that noise and some other frogs (im honestly not even kidding right now) tried to help it by kinda... its hard to explain... jump on it (for lack of a better word)\u00a0to distract the snake, but they only did it a few times. My dad and my friend and I kept on watching it making that horrible sound, unable to really do much besides watch because we were just amazed (and yet somewhat horrified) by what we saw. The snake latched on for at least 15 minutes before the frog stopped making the sound, and after that it still latched onto it for at least another 5 minutes before we moved on because we could tell that it was going to swallow it soon and maybe attack us. It was nothing extremely traumatizing (we didn&#39;t see anything gory, the snake just bit on the frog and no blood or anything came out), but I was just dumbfounded about seeing nature like that in its purest form.

Then of course he went to fight the fire.. well one thing that is very common with airplane accidents is generally there are no survivors, and I looked out the window and saw a whole lot of blood all over the ground near the smoldering ruins of a planes shell, it was a bit disturbing, so I told my dad I hadn&#39;t looked one thing that seeing that sort of thing does is give you a reality check, death is real, it&#39;s permanent and it&#39;s sad, and somewhat scary.", "comment_date": "2014-06-19T01:06:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Derper Herper", "comment_text": "A road kill squirrel with its eye ball missing the other was hanging out and it&#39;s gut we&#39;re spilling 0.0", "comment_date": "2014-06-18T23:53:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ski.

So at summer, my mom asked me to put them out in their cages on the balcony, in a little rack with doors. The only thing is that she closed the doors because of the smell one day.. and we ...forgot that the mice were there..for a month. No good air circulation, heat, and NO food. Guess what happened. Even the last survival died because of the germs and infections. Blood, bones ans skeleton everywhere. And, well, my mom wanted to keep the cages/aquariums, so guess who had to clean them ??! I wont even describe the odors.
