You must have a pretty clear view of the ceiling-wall joint.  This is now a horizontal line that is about 4 feet above you and at 45 degrees above level.  It is clearly straight and completely horizontal.\r<br>.<br>Now extend a straight, stiff arm out and up to point at the nearest point of the joint in a nazi-like salute with a flat palm downward so the thumb-pinky hand sort of mimics the line.\r<br>\r<br> *Step One to see true the geometry. * <br>Without turning your body, Swing your stiff arm and head to one side to follow that line and try to continue that pointing out to the vanishing point.  Your arm will be horizontal to your side as will be your gaze.  The vanishing point is at your private, local horizon\u2026always.  This clearly mimics you head-in-sphere diagram.\r<br>.<br> <b>Step two to grasp the illusion.</b> <br>Starting at the original nazi-like salute, hold your shoulder joint rigid, pointing upward, but now rotate your whole, STIFF body and arm (shoulder joint locked in position).  You are pointing way above the vanishing point! This is what your brain told you to believe. <br>.<br> This all works because the moon is up at an angle and the sun is really far away; essentially \u201cat\u201d the vanishing point.\r<br>.<br>Carrying this to the extreme would start with the moon over-head.\r<br>Although flat Earthers don\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d geometry, this is one of the proofs that the sun is far away.\r<br>Regards, Steve", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T18:05:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TomatoSauceKing", "comment_text": "Weird gamer tag flex but ok", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T16:58:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Sonic Sega Nerd", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2gTSjoEExc&amp;t=2m34s\">2:34</a> This is big brain time", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T06:44:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lauren Pinkie Pie", "comment_text": "for some reason combined with your forehead and the moon in the title i thought this vid was about the megamind(villian)effect", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T05:49:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "re", "comment_text": "VHead.", "comment_date": "2020-02-29T01:38:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Stefix5000", "comment_text": "Penis music", "comment_date": "2020-02-28T20:46:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Twister", "comment_text": "Nobody:<br><br>Michael at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2gTSjoEExc&amp;t=2m48s\">2:48</a>: <b>its big brain time</b>", "comment_date": "2020-02-28T19:10:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SLA JMY", "comment_text": "Woah", "comment_date": "2020-02-28T16:24:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brooks", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2gTSjoEExc&amp;t=2m48s\">2:48</a> Don\u2019t be shy put some more", "comment_date": "2020-02-27T22:20:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Migitri", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t help but hear <i>Sunlight Daze</i> by Mimicking Birds in my head when I watch this video.<br><br>&quot;Moonlight in its new phase<br>As the lunar parallactic shadow oscillates<br>The skylight frames the sky<br>Saw who I thought was you moving through a more luminant light<br><br>There&#39;s a lone sun bleached highway<br>That inches along between byways<br>Unilluminated we have no way<br>Of knowing what way&#39;s which way&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-02-27T09:19:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clickbait Cancer", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t believe we can&#39;t turn off post-sensation shortening in the settings menu, ugh...", "comment_date": "2020-02-26T23:13:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kaden Watt", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2gTSjoEExc&amp;t=0m49s\">0:49</a> you know when that beat drops you&#39;re about to get some mad knowledge thrown at you", "comment_date": "2020-02-26T13:22:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dazzledooper", "comment_text": "there should be a song called Vsauce mode with the zoom effect", "comment_date": "2020-02-26T00:54:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ElMarcusch", "comment_text": "Yep.

I remember looking out the window and wondering why the airplane seemed to be slowing down the higher we got, and at cruise seemed to just be hanging there, hardly moving. I knew there was an optical effect at play, but nobody was able to explain it (or even understand my question, often)...the epiphany came when I was staring out the window with the seat leaned back so that the rear of the window opening was cutting into my view. Then I realized that if I looked down, and spotted ground features I could identify and approximate the size of, I could watch them disappear right at the rear edge of the window, and imagine myself on the ground, moving that fast, like in a really fast car....finally I had the visual sensation of the speed involved. Distance from the ground plays hell with out perception of ground speed, even on a smaller scale. There is actually a formula that tells how many mph your perception is off according to how many feet above the ground you are. But I don&#39;t remember it. But if you ever get to ride in a big rig, it will be one of the first things you notice, when you get on the highway it will seem like you&#39;re going 40-45 mph but you&#39;re keeping up with traffic, and when you look you see you are doing 65-70 mph. Just being seated in a seat that&#39;s 6 feet off the ground so your eyes are 9 feet up or so knocks a good 20-25 mph off your normal car-based visual perception of speed, and you have to adjust to it. Then, when you DRIVE the truck for a month at a time, as I did, there&#39;s always a brief period of feeling like you&#39;re really flying at regular speeds when you go home and drive a regular vehicle again.

To foreshorten something is to make it appear to have <b>less depth</b> than it actually does. The apparent depth of, say, a cube is less when photographed with a telephoto lens than it is when photographed with a wide-angle lens (assuming the front surface of the cube is the same apparent size in both photographs).

This is only one example that came to mind during this video but psychedelics affect many other areas of the brain as well.<br><br>I think psychedelics are great tools for the research of human perception, since many of the systems that go into it are only apparent when disrupted.

Do they?  I have no data but I suspect not, which leaves me unsatisfied with the claim that it was deliberate.<br><br>The &quot;tricks&quot; to make art more realistic are <i>tools</i> of the artist, and tools are technology, and technology is invented at some point and then disseminated.  It seems more probable to me that the <i>technology</i> of accounting for perspective in art was simply not widespread, and also thus not an expectation of art-viewers of the period.  We live in a modern world where we expect movie SFX to be 100% photo realistic or we say they look &quot;bad&quot;.  But for 100 years people were impressed with a progression of movie effects that were far from photo realism.  We didn&#39;t expect photo realism until the tech was there to give us a taste of it.  Think of live theater where a special effect could be a &quot;comet&quot; on a stick movies by a stagehand.  No one in the audience is <i>tricked</i> to think &quot;OMG THERE&#39;S A COMET IN THE THEATER&quot;, but it&#39;s a representation of a comet for the sake of the story, and people get the message.  We no longer say &quot;wow that looks way better than <i>Le Voyage Dans la Lun</i>&quot;, we say &quot;ugh I can tell it&#39;s not real&quot;.  Instead of saying &quot;wow that painting looks way better than the generations preceding it&quot;, we say &quot;ugh it&#39;s not even close to as real as a photograph&quot;.<br><br>Artistic representations of things are just symbolic representations of those things to get the idea into the viewers head.  A drawing of a cat is a (simple symbol for a cat).  People got the message that the ball on a stick in the theater was supposed to represent a comet, and they were fine with that.  Pre-renaissanse artists probably just did not consider perspective or spend time worrying about it, they were probably much more focused on the simple inclusion of the object-representations they wanted to include in the piece.  This is a matter of technology and priorities, but does not mean they were stupid as 5 year olds, or that they were deliberately Picasso-ing their work.", "comment_date": "2015-09-04T01:21:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Gregg", "comment_text": "This is why the Parthenon was built with out strait line. to compensate for the curve effect.

It actually uses reverse perspective projection. That is it puts the &quot;horizon&quot; behind the viewer, rather than in front of the viewer. For example, look at the stool, the lines on the edges of it angle inwards toward the viewer making things in the foreground smaller and things in the background bigger rather than smaller things at the back and bigger things at the front. Apparently it was a somewhat popular style with bizantin paintings.<br><br>Another interesting thing with reverse perspective projection is that if you were to look at the front of a cube head on, you would be able to see the top, bottom, left and right side of the cube in addition to the front of it rather than just the front of it because things further away are larger than things that are closer in this perspective.<br><br>This effect can actually be seen in the back of the chair too. If you look at it the chair appears to &quot;bend&quot;\u00a0 or &quot;curve&quot; very slightly when compared with the front of the chair despite being drawn with visibly straight lines.

So as we see Moon practically right on time, the image of the sun is 8 mins delayed..

Strange that my brain on both eyes processes both of the perceived movement(slow and fast) but is kinda confused as it perceived some parts of the monitor fast and some parts slow while seeing only one moving video image.

Are such surviving stations possible in future.<br><br>2) In one of your video I saw comparisons of Planets and their moons. From that comparison I realized that Pluto (Dwarf Planet) is smaller than that of Jupiter and Saturn moons (Europa, Io and Titan). In fact even Mercury is also similar in sizes to these moons. So is it possible that gravity of these gas giants pull these planets (Pluto/Mercury) and make them orbit around them instead of Sun.<br><br>3) Is it possible that a medium sized star like our Sun can orbit a Hyper giant star like VY Canis Majoris, similarly like planets orbit our own sun.

It gets quite intuitive if you dwell long enough in this perspective, and it allows you to see more of an object, often allowing a view of the front and both sides of a cube in front of you due to the flared-out nature of everything. Inbetween reverse and normal perspective, is isometric perspective, where the vanishing point is infinitely far away and thus there is no forshortening and lines never appear to converge (as used in early tile-based 3D computer games).<br><br>There&#39;s also curvilinear perspective which can show a view of looking both forwards and backwards at the same time.

Of course, the moon isn&#39;t getting any bigger or smaller, and any changes in the distance between the moon and the eye are so (relatively) negligible, no difference should be noticeable. It--and I&#39;m very much simplifying this--is actually all down to the way the brain is perceiving the apparent size of the object, making it appear larger when near the horizon (and thus closer to a frame of reference)... similar to Michael&#39;s example of the cars on the road. In reality, the moon is actually ever so slightly SMALLER (relative to your visual field) in the vertical axis when nearer the horizon than it is otherwise due to atmospheric lensing!

But appeared to be lit from the wrong angle. The moon was clearly out of the earth&#39;s shadow because it was high in the sky at the same time the sun was up. If the moon is 237k miles away from us, and the sun 92 million miles from us, then the sun&#39;s rays would illuminate the moon fully... Right? <br><br>Unless they are actually closer then we are told.<br><br>Not that I fully buy that theory... Because it is just a theory. But it does have some merits. But when I saw the moon and the sun up at the same time last week and noticed the shadow thing, and thought about their distances from us, I began to scratch my head as to how this can be. <br><br>Picture our planet the moon and the sun. If the sun represents an omnidirectional flashlight orb, and the moon a reflector orb, and we are on an orbit in roughly the same plane. If the moon is above us and clearly visible some 237k miles away, then the flashlight sun&#39;s rays should not be influenced by the earth in the surface of the moon. It&#39;s June right now... Do you know how high in the sky the sun is at 3pm? It&#39;s just past straight up. No where near the horizon.<br><br>I draw it out on paper, and it just does not make sense.
