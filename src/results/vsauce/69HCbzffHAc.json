They just propelled their airplane with a catapult and used rails to let it run effortlessly until the speed was enough to go up, jumped with style and landed slowly a few meters away. In the 100th anniversary they tried to remake their feat and guess what? It didn&#39;t work.<br>But, years later the Wright Brothers pseudo-airplane feat, a guy called Alberto Santos Dummont, brazilian, expert in mechanics and fascinated with flying has built his 14-BIS airplane, full with an engine and wheels, and it ran by itself to gain speed, elevated by its own effort, flew a large distance and landed safely. It was registered and well documented. And guess what? The replica made for the 100th anniversary of his feat worked flawlessly! <br>I know it&#39;s hard for the North Americans to deal with the fact someone else made it happen, but it is the truth. A truth so painfully true that when Dummont saw airplanes bombing the town of S\u00e3o Paulo in the 30&#39;s revolution, he killed himself, because he thought his invention would unite mankind, not serve as a weapon. The only thing about mr. Dummont that is a lie is that he DIDN&#39;T invent the wrist watch. In fact he was gifted with one from a friend clockmaker to help him to measure time while flying without needing to take his hands out of the controls.  And by the way Mr. Dummont was gay, one of the possible reasons to some people simply deny his ownership of the airplane invention, but I believe just a few people knew about that at that time.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T06:29:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Acharya", "comment_text": "29th Feb 2012 People taking leaps<br>2020 Feb 29th Economy not taking leap", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T12:58:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antonio Curley", "comment_text": "Why don\u2019t we \u2018impregnate\u2019 other planets by firing off loads of potential life creating bacteria capsules in hopes that they might find a habitable planet and maybe in millions of years potentially create conscious life, not a bad idea.

What would kill people, is that the brains would be starved of oxygen (called celebral hypoxia) and die. How long it would take you to die from G force exposure depends on how long you were able to keep blood flow to your brain (to stay conscious), and then how long your brain could survive being starved of oxygen. Different cells survive oxygen starvation for different length of time, but the first cells would die after about 5 minutes. That doesn&#39;t mean the person dies, but if the person is revived he/she will suffer permanent brain damage. So vSauce got that one wrong, and the designer can not back up his claims. True, most people would pass out after the first loops, but they wouldn&#39;t die. And some people, most likely those that have been trained for it, would remain conscious during the whole ride.
