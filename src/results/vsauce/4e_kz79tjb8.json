This is why markets are so great - they are the purest form of democracy. If enough people think something is too expensive, they will refuse to buy it, and the sellers will be forced to lower the prices in order to cover their costs. If many people consider the price to be worth it, then the price will remain the same. If most people are willing to pay at that price and even higher, because the product is highly demanded, then the price will rise. Generally, even if the government-sanctioned experts do have legitimate expertise, they have been hand-selected out of a pool of experts with varying opinions, because their particular opinion will back up what the state already wants to do. They will be chosen because of their opinion which agrees with the state, and anyone who disagrees is opposing &quot;science&quot; or &quot;the experts&quot;.
