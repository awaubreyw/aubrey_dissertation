And what about the gaps between the light fixtures? When standing in the center of the aisle the light from a 5 ft light bulb has a reflection that appears much much longer with the dim Gap being visible and constantly seeming as though it&#39;s going away from you as you begin to walk down the aisle but you eventually catch up with it when you&#39;re directly below the gap between the fixtures so does that also mean that the entire floor is reflecting that dim Gap? All in all does the entire floor reflect both the bright and dim spots all over the floor at the same exact time so that if you could &quot;see&quot; the light it would be both cast in dimness and brightness?<br><br>I&#39;m not going to lie I&#39;m about as high as a high rise in Dubai and I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s the weed or my natural curiosity making me ask such a strange question, but to anybody reading this they&#39;re clearly watching a strange man who makes videos of the exact kind of high thoughts that I have so maybe it doesn&#39;t seem a strange question at all. <br><br>Totally unprompted thought but if crazy people don&#39;t realize that they are mentally ill does that mean that a psychotic who is aware he is sick actually sane or is he insane?", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T00:33:02Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "nate", "comment_text": "Wait so I&#39;m twice as fat irl", "comment_date": "2021-09-18T04:54:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snoop Dogg \u266a", "comment_text": "Now put a 360 cam i wanna see god in there", "comment_date": "2021-09-17T08:40:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deepfriedavocado", "comment_text": "Sphirror", "comment_date": "2021-09-17T06:57:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thirty9A", "comment_text": "make a mirror sphere out of 2 way glass and just look", "comment_date": "2021-09-15T00:54:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gamer X 2,000,000", "comment_text": "I had actually wondered about this!", "comment_date": "2021-09-12T05:33:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Locke Da'boss", "comment_text": "Spherical miracle", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T16:21:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Toaster Oven", "comment_text": "Mom: go play with the neighbor&#39;s kid<br>The neighbor&#39;s kid: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRP82omMX0g&amp;t=1m57s\">1:57</a>", "comment_date": "2021-09-09T23:49:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Promerious", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRP82omMX0g&amp;t=2m55s\">2:55</a> its been 8 years but I&#39;m still going to say this, probably because most of the phone or camera&#39;s lens will stretch your face horizontally and make your nose look bigger", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T13:58:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GamersPlanet", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRP82omMX0g&amp;t=2m15s\">2:15</a> I noticed something similar to this with a magnifying glass", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T00:41:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jason", "comment_text": "the size thing was a trip lol", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T15:55:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iamevn", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRP82omMX0g&amp;t=6m18s\">6:18</a> video reencode broke?", "comment_date": "2021-09-03T06:19:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viraj Khatri", "comment_text": "Fun fact: A perfect &quot;spherical&quot; mirror with 100% reflectivity exists!

I\u2019m not a big drinker, probably twice a year I may have a couple vodka cruisers , but I will def be trying the sprits\u2019s this weekend. Keep safe every one.<br><br>Now just one more topic not related to the video about to play, who is not getting the new Covina vaccines? I being diagnosed with MS will not be getting them, I\u2019m in the under 50\u2019s  category ( I\u2019m under 40 even) we have heard of the over 50\u2019s one to cause blood clots, but was that person already predisposed to having blood clots, or does this over 50\u2019s vaccine cause them<br><br>Also in the under 50\u2019s one, what\u2019s the difference???? Why can\u2019t we just all have the under 50\u2019s one \u261d\ufe0f it seems to be safer than the over 50s one and killing people. <br><br>A good friend of mine took her mum to get the over 50\u2019s one, and her mum has dementia. After having the over 50s Covina vaccine shot , as soon as she was taken home she started having high fevers, the sweats, and could not move her body. My friend Cath is fuming \ud83d\ude24!!!!  My friend Cath is just over 50 herself and will not be getting the vaccine, as I won\u2019t be and as one \u261d\ufe0f of my girlfriends Lis will not be. Too risky in my thinking and I\u2019m already unwell enough with MS bad spinal injuries from a car \ud83d\ude97 accident, so in constant agony. I don\u2019t want to risk getting sick \ud83e\udd15 over a vaccine, <br><br>My mum is due to have the over 50s one, and she isn\u2019t the healthiest person, and has an autoimmune illness ( diabetes) <br><br>My mother in-law is healthy and had the over 50\u2019s one, and she said she was so sick for a week I think \ud83e\udd14 she said, high fevers, feeling crap etc but is fine now. She is very very healthy and eats very well, if she wasn\u2019t healthy she probably would have had a worse reaction, I guess we will never know.<br><br>Ok \ud83d\udc4d enjoy the video. \ud83c\udf39\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\udd4a\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-05-23T17:30:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roger Kalaris", "comment_text": "The dark sail revealingly dream because cast conceivably produce underneath a toothsome activity. rambunctious, wry eagle", "comment_date": "2021-05-22T04:09:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peng Sun", "comment_text": "Half, or a quarter?

No dude, that doesn&#39;t have any relation to what&#39;s going on. In fact I don&#39;t even know what you think you meant by that. A mirror doesn&#39;t reverse an image left/right or up/down or diagonally. It reverses the image back to front. Here&#39;s an experiment that illustrates this. <br><br>Paint your left hand red and your right hand blue. Now press both hands on a mirror. Actually, a window would be better. As you look at your reflection in the glass, you see the red handprint on your left and the blue handprint on your right, same as where your real hands are. Now without washing your hands, go around and look through the window from the other side, the way other people see you. Your red hand is now where the blue handprint is, and your blue hand is where the red handprint is. This is because you are looking at the handprints from the back instead of the front. This is what a mirror does - it reverses the image front to back. <br><br>What about the up/down thing though? Try repeating the experiment lying on your left side. Pressing your hands on the glass makes a left (red) handprint by the floor and a right (blue) handprint higher up. Now go around, lie on your right side like someone would be facing you, and look back through the window. Your blue right hand is now by the floor where the red handprint is, and your red left hand is up in the air where the blue handprint is. So yes, it does seem like an up/down reversal. But the same reversal will happen if you do the experiment propped up diagonally. The difference is always that you&#39;re looking at the image from different sides of the glass, seeing it from the front and from the back. <br><br>That&#39;s what a mirror does - it reverses the image from front to back.", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T09:41:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Revenant Gaming", "comment_text": "If someone is perfectly symmetrical then they wouldn&#39;t have a problem", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T05:07:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NEDTHEPRODUCER", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve always wondered what would happen if you had a spherical positive magnet and dropped a positive magnet ball inside", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T04:49:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ps200306", "comment_text": "It&#39;s amazing how many people don&#39;t understand how mirrors work, and Vsauce is even more confused than most. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRP82omMX0g&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a> <i>&quot;mirrors reverse along axes perpendicular to their surfaces like left and right&quot;</i> (holds hand edge-on to the mirror to illustrate left and right). <i>&quot;They don&#39;t also flip things upside down, they don&#39;t also reverse up and down because those directions are parallel to the surface of the mirror&quot;</i> (holds hand parallel to the mirror to illustrate up and down).

The reflection in the mirror is also pointing to your left. Nothing is reversed. Instead of the arrow, hold out your left arm. The arm that is held out in the mirror is <i>also</i> on your left.

But you didn&#39;t. And even if you did, you could just as easily (well, not <i>quite</i> as easily) have gotten round the back by clambering over the top and flipping vertically.

Lord GOD, I lift my future to you and all my loved ones. May you straighten the path that I am walking. You decide for me. Please be with me on my journey, Lord. You will serve as my guide from now on. Lord, though I am a sinner, fragile in temptation and often my faith is weak, I pray that you will not let go of me. I hope you don&#39;t get tired of being with me. Lord, my people need you. Pour your love and forgiveness to the world. Touch each one of us to be your instrument for other people to know you. Give each of us enough intelligence to reveal your greatness. Dear Lord, we will not get tired of worshiping You. From the smallest to the biggest of your blessings I will look in debt until my death. May the love that first came from you reign in the life of every child reading this prayer. Use us po for your plans. Use us to be your instrument to be the source of your love and blessings to our children. Lord, I hope the spreading disease of COVID 19 in the world will be gone.

Ok, I&#39;ve wondered about this hypothetical scenario since I was a little kid. I am absolutely not satisfied with this description of what you would see. Here&#39;s why: because of the constant curve, objects placed within the sphere would be reflected in most every part of the sphere. Looking ahead, you would be reflected, looking to the sides, you would be reflected, looking up/down you would be reflected; looking in any direction you would be reflected, and these reflections would need to cancel each other out somehow since they would all overlap.  I&#39;m almost certain his explanation for what you would see falls short of the reality. I mean, for starters, he asserts that from the center, your reflected face would fill your field of view. How can this possibly be correct when every other part of you would be reflected as well?  Someone please build a room sized sphere with a mirror inside! Maybe I will one day. I also feel cheated that he spent less than half the video on the title topic and the rest just lumping in other mirror ideas.

Only the forward/backward axis is perpendicular to the mirror (normal to the mirror, if we&#39;re being pedantic).  The &quot;fact&quot; that mirrors preserve up/down and reverse left/right is just an artifact of how our minds interpreting the image.  It&#39;s just as valid, if less intuitive, to say that it preserves left/right and reverses up/down.<br><br>We think of it as reversing left/right because in our brains, we are imagining what would be where if instead of looking at a mirror, we had a clone that stepped forward and turned around (rotating from left to right) to face us.  Comparing this clone to the mirrored image, we see both have their head at our up and their feet at our down.  But looking to our left, we see the left hand of the mirror image but the right hand of the clone.  Likewise, looking to our right, we see the right hand of the mirror image but the left hand of the clone.  Thus, we interpret the mirror as having reversed left and right from what it would look like if you really stepped forward and turned around.<br><br>But now imagine instead that after the clone steps forward, instead of rotating left to right, he does a flip (top to bottom).  Now he is once again facing us, but is standing on his head.  Now if we compare the clone to the mirrored image, we see that both have their right hand to our right and their left hand to our left.  But looking to our up, we see the head of the mirror image but the feet of the clone.  Likewise, looking to our down, we see the feet of the mirror image but the feet of the clone.  Thus, you could interpret the mirror as having reversed up and down from what it would look like if you really stepped forward and flipped over.<br><br>As a second thought experiment, imagine you were laying sideways in front of a mirror, on a couch.  Now which axis is being reversed?  Left/right?  Or up/down?  And is that left/right and up/down from your orientation, or the mirror&#39;s?  Does the mirror even have an inherent up/right and left/down?  If not, then how could the mirror &quot;know&quot; which axis to reverse and which to not reverse?<br><br>Now, turning around left to right is a much more normal thing for a person to do than flipping over on one&#39;s head, so that is the intuitive way we imagine our virtual self turning around to compare to the image we see in the mirror.  It&#39;s much more natural for us to think of the mirror as reversing left and right, as we spend a lot more of our time turning left and right than we do flipping top to bottom, so our brains are geared for those kind of moves.  But in terms of what the mirror is physically doing, it&#39;s no more or less valid to say that the mirror reverses up and down.  It&#39;s all just a matter of how you imagine orienting your virtual self to compare the mirrored image to.", "comment_date": "2018-03-11T16:45:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Insert name here", "comment_text": "When the mirror came out I expected to see my own face", "comment_date": "2018-03-11T08:07:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ugandan Knuckles", "comment_text": "Just make one and go inside", "comment_date": "2018-03-11T03:35:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Docking", "comment_text": "I love how he pointed at himself when he said &quot;Michael here&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-03-10T22:55:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nonyagod Damnbusiness", "comment_text": "Pause the video at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRP82omMX0g&amp;t=3m07s\">3:07</a> and the T-shirt that says lovE says Hate in the mirror.  <br>QwAZ cool stuff", "comment_date": "2018-03-09T20:33:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LAssassin Raider", "comment_text": "Ive always wondered this", "comment_date": "2018-03-09T18:01:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheVertDeChine", "comment_text": "Trippiest fucking shit ever man good job \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb", "comment_date": "2018-03-09T16:24:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Analog Signal", "comment_text": "Michael, was this video shot in this visual trickery?", "comment_date": "2018-03-09T06:24:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajiib Shah", "comment_text": "Whos Vsauce I&#39;ve been having a severe existential crisis", "comment_date": "2018-03-08T08:45:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TrapGeek Studio", "comment_text": "Vsauce...

The Silver color is because of the way the Lower Dimensional Light Frequency of the microscopic Solar System of Chromium is crossing on the Giant Light Wave Frequencies from up here in this Higher Dimension of the World, the cross of the Lights insinuate the existence of the silver color we see to be Chromium, (It&#39;s a Glow between this part of the dimension and the microscopic part of the dimension, the glow looks silver.).<br><br>           It maintains its silvery glowing color while rejecting anything from our larger part of the Dimension, because, while micro specs of our Dimensional Light is leaking/Crossing on/down into the Light of Chromium to give it the color we see it to be; The Light from the Higher part of our Dimension is Too Big to fit in the micro-Dimension of the Chromium Solar System; so the Light we emit from our Bodies of Light; bounces off the Chromium Element and back in our Face. What we see; we can call a Reflection of our Spiritual Bio-Mass Light Emit-ion\u2026.<br><br>          When two mirrors are facing each other and there is nothing in-between them to reflect, the only thing that can be seen in the mirror is nothing, because nothing is reflecting, Thou, the element of the chromium that is the mirror, from on mirror to the other, if close enough, viewed from the perception of the microscopic Star System of the Chromium, like looking out into outer space, could see a bright dot in the black sky; someone living there could call a Star System that is no different from the one their  living in\u2026. and the glow of the Star Systems would not reflect off each other, similar to how we have to have a microscopic element in our world to have a mirror that reflects us\u2026\u2026\u2026 so even thou it seems like the Chromium mirror would reflect on itself, it won\u2019t, and it needs a micro-element in its world to have something to use as a mirror for it to see a reflection of itself.<br><br>          In addition,   \u2026..We cannot make a mirror out of any Dimensions bigger than us for us to see our reflection in, but people in a higher Dimension of us; can make one made of us, if the perception of the dimensions are at the right point in time and space.

If we turn around, we are no longer reversed with respect to the thing being viewed and it appears normal.  If a mirror ACTUALLY reversed left-to-right, then when we do an about-face and the mirror also reverses, the sign on the building or car behind us should appear  normal (excluding case such as ambulances that have &quot;mirror image&quot;  (rofl) lettering, but it does not.", "comment_date": "2017-09-29T10:25:51Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "DenisBlaster", "comment_text": "Guys my brain hurts.

If a mirror reverses forward to backward then it doesn&#39;t matter how it&#39;s rotated in the plane.  It is transformation invariant.  When you move your left hand, the hand that moves is on the left side of the mirror.<br>We can create a mirror that reverses left and right using a camera and a display.

Now, at the top of an area of the wall, moonlight was let in through a hole, shining light on only one spot in the mirror. In the dream I was drawn to this spot and the reflection of myself...but I&#39;m wondering what would that image REALLY look like? Dreams obviously don&#39;t take physics into account.   So, what would it look like in a circular room of mirrors with black ceilings and floors, and a small amount of light coming in through a small spot? Obviously the light would be reflected, the image in the mirror distorted. Also, I am IN the room and visible. What would I see, look like and what would the room look like?<br><br>Sorry this dream has been bugging me and I am not great with physics.

I would die from anxiety (long before suffocation) if I&#39;d ever be put into a reflecting sphere. Seriously: stuff of nightmares. Watching this I remembered another quite similar question I developed from reading a book about dimensions (I believe by Paul Davies). It goes something like this: Suppose space wraps into itself, like a 3D pacman field, so if you move in a straight (-ish?) line you&#39;d end up in the same place again. Start out with a big space, empty except for you and your little source of light: you would just see yourself in the distance, from the back and upside down (you would see an endless string of yourself if it were not for you blocking the view?). If you&#39;d move towards yourself (with your little jetpack) you would also fly away from yourself so this distance would never change. In the book this hypothetical astronaut has a glowstick in his hand, as he lets go of it he sees himself doing so in the distance. As he flies toward the glowstick in the distance, leaving it behind (the &quot;other&quot; one?!? ;p), he sees himself flying away from it too. When he approaches it and grabs it, he sees himself doing so in the distance and he has gone full circle. All fine? I dunno... Here&#39;s some questions: All this time we&#39;d imagine just looking straight forward into ones own back, upside down. But what if we&#39;d look up, we&#39;d see our feet from underneath? And what if we&#39;d look down our feet, would we look ourselves in a bent neck? The same goes for looking to the side and for looking whatever way. So wouldn&#39;t you really be seeing yourself everywhere around you, as if you were in the inside of your outsides?!? Now for the bonus horror: Let&#39;s shrink this space! Some of you might have seen the &#39;Portal&#39; set-up with a portal just in front of the subject a a portal just to the back. This person could tap itself on the back, right? Keep this in mind while imagining what would happen with the space-wrapped astronaut if you would shrink his space ever further... WTF right? Would his feet start to touch his head and vice versa, his left side touch his right side, all around himself he would be crushed into himself?!?<br><br>Please halp ;p", "comment_date": "2016-06-18T13:18:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gfcgamer orgone", "comment_text": "The enviroment reflects back in two channels for each eye. forming a six-star of rays of sight, from eyes to environment, and back to eyes A star of six points.", "comment_date": "2016-06-18T07:40:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gfcgamer orgone", "comment_text": "Stevens, we have two eyes.

Because I&#39;m expert in 19th Century photography (and making youtube videos about it), I must say that the image of a Lincon looks to me more a tintype (or ambrotype) then a print from a collodion negative.

However a reflection does not change something that is symmetrical.

The end result will depend on if your are photogenic or not. The people who are not photogenic usually end up looking super ugly and an completely different person.\u00a0<br><br>NOTE: yes the mirror does show your image \u201cunreflected\u201d BUT it completely alters your image while it is doing that. While the mirror does alter your image too, the only thing that it is doing to alter it is creating an an reflection of yourself which does not change how you really look it is only an reflection and as we know reflections do not change the appearance of something that is \u201csymmetrical\u201d.<br><br>I\u2019ve seen super attractive girls that look like complete shit in photos/ videos.\u00a0<br><br>THANK YOU.

Mirrors do no such thing, and the left-right axis is just as parallel to the mirror as the up-down axis. In fact, what is happening is that the mirror is reflecting front-to-back, as one would expect. However, when we see the reflected image of ourselves, we don&#39;t imagine it as our face being pulled through the back of our head. Instead, we imagine a person rotated around 180 degrees. Since left and right are described relative to the direction we are facing, we imagine &quot;that person&#39;s&quot; left and right as being opposite our own.<br><br>Let me put it another way. Imagine I am facing north and looking into a mirror, with my left hand facing west and my right hand facing east, with a ring on my left hand. My reflection in the mirror also has a ring on the hand on the west side. That hasn&#39;t changed. However, since the reflection is now facing the opposite direction, we say it is the reflection&#39;s &quot;right hand,&quot; even though that is still on our left.<br><br>Although we don&#39;t often think about it this way, we could just as easily say that mirrors &quot;reverse up and down&quot; rather than left and right, in the following sense: Instead of imagining the reflection to be a person rotated 180 degrees standing on the floor, imagine it flipping 180 degrees head-over-heels. Now instead of the ring seemingly being on the right hand instead of the left hand, we have the head seemingly being on the bottom half of the body instead of the top half of the body. Clearly the mirror has reversed up and down! The only reason we don&#39;t usually think about it that way is because we are bilaterally symmetric, so one type of rotation looks &quot;almost right&quot; (minus the ring being on the wrong side), while the other looks completely wrong.", "comment_date": "2015-03-10T05:02:41Z", "likes_count": 71}, {"comment_by": "Golden Nova", "comment_text": "cant someone just build one and test it?", "comment_date": "2015-03-09T18:53:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheTriforceCrusader", "comment_text": "I feel like it would be like being inside a time warp...", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T08:42:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ElliotIdiot", "comment_text": "Jesus the simulation freaks me out...", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T03:48:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ellamarie13", "comment_text": "I have already commented on another one of these videos, but this is one of my favorite channels on Youtube!

The reason we might check transformation in that order is to save thinking time/effort: Only when such an object topples will it&#39;s &#39;top&#39; change.<br><br>So when a person sees an object in the mirror that they identify with an object in the room they stand in, they first mentally move it without rotating it. Where that fails they rotate it around the vertical axis. When this makes an object that isn&#39;t symmetrical about left and right, but is otherwise the same the conclusion is that the object isn&#39;t &#39;the same&#39; unless the mirror has exchanged these two directions and the thought process ends there. In fact, this effect of switching directions is nothing special about left and right: The only reason left and right were flipped this time was because the person chose to rotate the object about the vertical axis first. You have only to rotate the object about it&#39;s horizontal axis instead to see that up and down would be reversed and left and right would be preserved.<br><br>So really the problem begins as soon as the person interprets the objects they see in the mirror as the result of a translation, a rotation about the vertical axis and finally a reflection. In fact the simplest way to transform their world into the reflected one is to exchange forwards and backwards, which is an unnatural way to identify objects for the brains of humans.", "comment_date": "2014-06-22T18:04:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "donepearce", "comment_text": "Mirrors do not flip left to right.

The focal length of the eye may differ from a camera thus morphing the face in unpredictable ways. For example, in portrait photography the common practice is to photograph a person using a 50mm or 85mm prime lens on a full frame camera standing a number of feet from the person. If you use a wide angle lens standing close to a person then this will literally flatten and distort the face, making the nose look really big relative to the rest of the face. A lot of people who like the way they look in the mirror but not in photos tend to take self portraits, and often times do so using a wide angle lens an arms length away, so their face gets distorted and they end up perplexed as to why they look horrible in the photograph and not in the mirror.", "comment_date": "2013-12-12T07:37:35Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "bathingatbaxters", "comment_text": "so im actually twice as fat as i see myself? :(", "comment_date": "2013-12-12T06:44:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "McCartneyLS", "comment_text": "....you make me question reality....", "comment_date": "2013-12-12T04:30:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarah Smith", "comment_text": "WOW O.O plz never stop making these videos!!!!

As bride for his son, Longshanks had chosen the daughter of\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>his rival, the King of France. It was widely whispered that for the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>princess to conceive, Longshanks would have to do the honors himself. That\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>may have been what he had in mind all along.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>Longshanks: Scotland, my land. The French will grovel to anyone with\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>strength, but how will they believe our strength when we can not rule the\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>whole of our own island?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>Longshanks: Where is my son?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>Isabella: Your pardon, my Lord.

The trouble with Scotland is that it&#39;s full\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>of Scots. Perhaps the time has come to reinstitute an old custom. Grant\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<br>them prima noctes.

There is no &#39;turning&#39; in a mirror image, only a depth inversion.", "comment_date": "2013-08-19T14:12:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shady Viking", "comment_text": "Arthur Van Melckebeke brought me here", "comment_date": "2013-08-19T14:05:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leonardo Barbosa", "comment_text": "mind... blown", "comment_date": "2013-08-19T13:44:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "REDACTED", "comment_text": "Science!", "comment_date": "2013-08-19T13:43:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yeet Loaf", "comment_text": "science is scary", "comment_date": "2013-08-19T13:39:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TruthNloV3", "comment_text": "Omg.
