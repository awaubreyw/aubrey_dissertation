A rhotic accent like that of Michael Stevens, has all R sounds pronounced in no matter where the &#39; R &#39; appears in a word. A non-rhotic accent has the &#39;R&#39; sound dropped or unpronounced after vowel sounds. Non rhotic accents include RP (basically &quot;standard&quot; British English ), Australian accents, some southern American accents, New England accents ( most notably Boston ), the accents native to NYC, most of New Zealand and parts of India. Rhotic accents include most American accents, Scottish and Irish accents, some varieties of English in India, areas of New Zealand and 99.9% of Canada. <br><br>Now, the rhoticity or non-rhoticity of an accent is not always absolute. For example, almost all non rhotic American accents pronounce the Rs in words like &#39; bird &#39; &#39; work &#39; and &#39; girl &#39; even if the accent is otherwise non rhotic. Moreover, most southern American accents and NYC accents have inconsistent rhoticity, this means that Rs sometimes get pronounced after vowel sounds and sometimes the Rs get dropped. <br><br>Examples of rhotic and non rhotic word differences<br><br>Rhotic<br>Car <br>There<br>Merely<br>Letter<br><br>Non rhotic<br>Cah<br>thea or theyuh<br>Meely or me-uhly<br>Lettuh or letta", "comment_date": "2019-02-09T06:38:58Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "ObeseTurtle", "comment_text": "I just got an ad in chinese", "comment_date": "2019-02-08T08:28:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tere Garc", "comment_text": "Oi <br>Hi<br>Hiya<br>Howdy<br>Hey<br>Eh", "comment_date": "2019-02-05T00:57:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "look a towel", "comment_text": "This man does mad research on the most unimportant meaningless shit lol", "comment_date": "2019-02-04T01:12:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jens Overby", "comment_text": "You completely forgot the viking influence on the English language in the 8th and 9th century:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/139-norse-words\">https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/139-norse-words</a><br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelaw\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danelaw</a>", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T19:24:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atI-JPGcF-k&amp;t=4m31s\">4:31</a> when black people arrived in america", "comment_date": "2019-01-28T03:40:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "pontikkapannu", "comment_text": "Many languages use the Roman writing system.

The English in Hattusa is written in cuneiform. The Hebrew name Terah is earth in  Latin and is why the 780-day Marduk calendar of Mars is mistaken for the Babel Epoch of Arpaxad as new earth conceived on the ark when Little Ararat arose, but born in the valley off the ark. Shulgi the king of Ur 1991-1943bc is the source of Dungi bullcrap, and his son AmarPal is the source of SIN as we know it. The record of Hattusa if you YouTube it teaches you that agua water means agua (verb to drink) and watar (water) the word for eat is German in Hattusa (etz). All this from 1640bc which is half-cycle 600-year Venus from babel foundation 2240bc. It is also 400 years after Gilgamesh went ot 930-year old Noah to declare that his matching Adams age meant he would never die. This 400 years exposes the 3-day solar drift (Gregorian) just 14 years before king Amizaduga&#39;s Venus dates expose year 744 as 180 solar leap days. So alot of English back in 1640bc. Mars is Kaldean for The Son (firstborn of the king, or of God), but it is also the sea (Mari) because the kings were scattered having false answers to longevity cut, and that was pretty bitter (mari), like sea water causing death. The 1460 years after Noah died kings were called Greek Christos claiming Noah Xisuthros was returned (560bc), but while Persia and India also called him Buddha (son of Maya) the man who went to heaven, they also called him Magi Mede priest Gaumata (523bc) and in India too which is English Gau is cow, and mata is mother. The Maya star in the Taurus cow in the month of May. Our handwriting varies more than all our languages.

A simple Google search reveals that &quot;pig&quot; probably came from the Old English word &quot;picbr\u00e9d&quot;, meaning &quot;acorn&quot;, which was then adapted in Middle English to refer to swine-food, thus the word &quot;pig&quot; was very likely back-formed from &quot;picbr\u00e9d&quot; or &quot;pig-bread&quot; (the &#39;-bred&#39; part of &quot;picbr\u00e9d&quot; being naturally confused for the almost identical sounding &#39;bread&#39;), and thus the word for swine-food became a new word for the swines themselves.<br><br>The etymology of &#39;dog&#39;, however, is less clear. It came from the Old English &quot;docga&quot;, which originally referred to a very rare and specific powerful breed of &quot;hund&quot; (hound) - but where exactly the word &quot;docga&quot; comes from - ?. All that is sure is that it mostly displaced the Germanic &quot;hund&quot;, so that now in English &quot;hound&quot; doesn&#39;t necessarily refer to every kind of dog, but mostly hunting breeds in particular. (interesting that in Old High Germanic the cognate for hound/hund is &quot;hunt&quot;, which is identical in sound and spelling to the English verb &quot;hunt&quot; - perhaps because long ago dogs and hunting were even more closely linked). The word &quot;canine&quot; is of course Latin, from caninus --&gt; canis (and so the French &quot;chien&quot; and the Italian &quot;cane&quot;). But the origin of Spanish &quot;perro&quot; is mysterious - probably from a long-forgotten Iberian tongue.", "comment_date": "2015-03-15T16:49:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "ellamarie13", "comment_text": "this episode is bringing 2 of my favorite channels together! key of awesome and vsauce!!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T10:19:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shaid Hosain", "comment_text": "oh snap! he&#39;s colabbed with ownage haha", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T03:24:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael.YouTube", "comment_text": "I never knew England got its name from a group of inhabitants called Angles, hence &quot;Angleland&quot; sounding like England.
