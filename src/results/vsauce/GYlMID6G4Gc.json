In the italian language articles are very common, and you have nouns divided into Feminine and Masculine (there is no Neuter). the alphabet has 21 letters, but 26 like english if you count the foreign based words. All the vowels are pronounced very openly and every single letter in every word is pronounced and never skipped. Double consonants are very frequent but to pronounce them correctly it&#39;s like there&#39;s a little stop &#39;  .   &quot;Mattone&quot; (brick) is pronounced ---&gt; M\u00e0&#39;tone [it&#39;s like there is a little stop]. To begin with actualy italian you have to know that this language follows the SVO method, Subject Verb Object, Verbs come in conjugations for every person and they have 21 different tenses divided in 7 groups and different for 3 groups of verbs called -are, -ere and -ire based on their suffixes to distinguish them and to know how to conjugate them. \r<br>Personal pronouns are:\r<br>Io               I\r<br>Tu              You\r<br>Lui/ Lei     He/ She\r<br>Noi            We\r<br>Voi            You all\r<br>Loro          They\r<br>\r<br>( Lei it&#39;s a formal way to talk to someone directly instead of Tu (you) ; in the south though instead of Lei it is used Voi )\r<br>irregular verbs exist with their different conjugations but to start a language you don&#39;t have to learn every single tense to complicate your life, you can just start with the present tense and go on from there.\r<br>It&#39;s very simple, with the Personal pronouns now you can see how conjugations work for the present tense, we said that the conjugations group are 3 so let&#39;s see:\r<br>[since you have conjugations you can omit the personal pronouns in sentences and it would still be correct, usually you say the personal pronoun to accentuate]\r<br>[also before the suffix -are you will see the stem of the verb, it will never change, you just have to learn the various endings based on the group and tense. to conclude when a stem ends with a vowel you must not put 2 same vowels near eachother because that&#39;s something that never occures in the italian language, if you have Mangiare (mangi-are, to eat) if you have endings starting with &quot;i&quot; you remove cette &quot;i&quot; to not double the same vowel]\r<br>\r<br>-are ---&gt; Cant-are (to sing)\r<br>Io cant-o\r<br>tu cant-i\r<br>lui cant-a\r<br>noi cant-iamo\r<br>voi cant-ate\r<br>loro cant-ano\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>-ere ---&gt; Cad-ere (to fall)\r<br>io cad-o\r<br>tu cad-i\r<br>lui cad-e\r<br>noi cad-iamo\r<br>voi cad-ete\r<br>loro cad-ono\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>-ire ---&gt; Dorm-ire (to sleep)\r<br>io dorm-o\r<br>tu dorm-i\r<br>lui dorm-e\r<br>noi dorm-iamo\r<br>voi dorm-ite\r<br>loro dorm-ono\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Irregular To be ----&gt; Essere\r<br>io sono\r<br>tu sei\r<br>lui \u00e8\r<br>noi siamo\r<br>voi siete\r<br>loro sono\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>irregular to have ----&gt; Avere\r<br>io ho\r<br>tu hai\r<br>lui ha\r<br>noi abbiamo\r<br>voi avete\r<br>loro hanno\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Articles on the other hand are also very useful; they are divided in Masculine Feminine, Singular and Plural:\r<br>\r<br>Definites: (&quot;The&quot; in english)\r<br>                                                                    Sing.

Surprisingly, he lasted more than 14 years since he had been diagnosed, and although it wasn&#39;t very extreme, the last year got very harsh. In the last few months, he had completely forgotten who any of us were (myself, my sister, my mother, his other daughters, his wife, etc), where he was, and what he was doing. He constantly had the urge to leave and &quot;go home.&quot; From what we understood, he thought he was still a kid and wanted to go back to his childhood home, and sometimes he even cried for his mother. His very last month got the most harsh. He had to be sent to the hospital multiple times. The only thing he remembered was his name during the last visit to the hospital. After his last visit, my mom and her two sisters were already preparing what he&#39;ll be wearing during his funeral. He had completely forgotten how to speak or interact. The last few days before he died, he fell in a coma. In short, he had no idea what was going on around him, the only thing he did was respond with sounds when he was hurting. His lungs got clogged up because he forgot how to swallow properly and all of his food went to his lungs instead. I believe that this was also the reason why he passed away.\r<br>\r<br>The sad thing about Alzheimer&#39;s is that it slowly drains the person away. Unlike other diseases which kill the person on the spot, Alzheimer&#39;s slowly and painfully drains the person like a sponge, until they forget their basic human functions and who they are. What kills them isn&#39;t Alzheimer&#39;s itself, but the effects of it. This is at least my point of view from my experience. Either way, I am grateful that people like Michael exist, big influencers who use their fame for a good cause. I&#39;ve seen many different fundraisers, but I have to say that Alzheimer&#39;s is one that touches me the most, which is why I will definitely consider donating. I could care less about the beard hair, the cause is what makes it all worth it. Thank you Michael for this fundraiser.

I am very glad to see that people are working hard against this terrible illness. But in all of the hurt you see in a person suffering from alzheimers you have a few moments where they are themselves for a while if it is a matter of hours or just a few minutes that joy is impossible to describe or measure. If anyone else has a friend or family member suffering from this i hope you have a lot of good moments. Because in the end, those good moments are everything that mattered.
