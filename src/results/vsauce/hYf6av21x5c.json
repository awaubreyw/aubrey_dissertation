We can fire it at least 14 times a day for each time the ISS orbits while using our shuttles to &#39;shuttle&#39; the cargo around in low orbit to the station.  A bio-sphere can be built within years and able to be landed on Mars while also separating from the chassis leaving it to orbit Mars and return to Earth on a slowed approach using orbital momentum.  Earth and Mars are at their closest every 10 years while it takes only 4 years to make the journey.  We could be colonizing in high speed by also tunneling into the surface and by creating air tight chambers capped by clear domes on the surface for surface level greenhouses.  Since Mars has a tiniest amount of atmosphere, would it be possible for cement/mortar to set under those conditions?  While having to only transport plexiglass window panes and bags of mortar and aluminium poles &amp; brackets to secure the plexiglass when assembling.  A couple boring machines could be launched into orbit and sent on an orbital momentum controlled remotely for guidance while being unmanned.  We could probably just shoot them out of the rail guns in the ground and send them there faster than using orbital momentum.

And A 10 year voyage would require only a modest 132,202 kilometres  / second, 44.175% of the speed of light... these speeds are going to be an enormous undertaking, and will require a similar method as the vessel &#39;new horizons&#39; used. i haven&#39;t calculated how long the vehicle would need to accelerate and decelerate at a rate that would not kill... for arguments sake i&#39;ll say 1 g, it would take around 1.5 (rough guess) years to accelerate to 264,202 kilometres / second and another 1.5 years (rough guess) to decelerate,  so to do that trip in 5 years means i would have to recalculate a minimum top speed, which i don&#39;t have time right now to do, so lets assume at 264,202 kilometres / second it would take 6 years (approx)... however you would still need to somehow reach 264,202 kilometres / second. which is still 88.128% of the speed of light. but surely the vehicle would accelerate faster than 1 g, more like 4 or 5 g with passengers  bodies placed in a coma state in water &quot;beds&quot; (sealed chambers for 1 filled with fluid) would be able to sustain higher acceleration...

Many of the ideas you are putting forth in this video are  just theory , yet they are stated it as if they were fact. <br><br>If you want to provoke thought, you would explain this. Teach people how to think, not what to think. But this is sadly much like the public school system, which indoctrinates minds, rather than enlightening them by encouraging them to truly think for themselves.<br><br> I know these are fun videos and I my intention is not to bash on you, and be a &quot;negative Nancy&quot;, but the thing is, people will inevitably just parrot these claims and not understand that there are differing ideas about how these things work, because they have not been told they are theories. <br><br>You may think this is an insignificant thing, but it is absolutely crucial as it relates to the future of our people. Children now-a-days are being taught what to think, while at the same time, made to believe that they are thinking critically. This has enslaved the minds of our boys and girls, and our men and women, who are more and more unlikely to come up with new ideas because they have been taught not to question the &quot;facts&quot; they have been handed . They have accepted the world as it was given to them, and know not how to challenge the accepted boundaries of  science and reality. <br><br>I hope one day the institutions of education will learn how to inspire true thought, and not stifle it by asserting theory as fact, and putting up barriers where no barrier exists. <br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>joshua", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T18:45:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u4eca\u665a\u6253\u80d6\u864e", "comment_text": "\u662f\u4e0d\u662f\u7ae0\u5317\u6d77\u6295\u8d44\u4f60\u62cd\u8fd9\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7684\uff1f\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T11:16:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TrumpFor TheGrave", "comment_text": "what&#39;s that music at the end?", "comment_date": "2016-01-23T01:49:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Qaderia Fatema", "comment_text": "What", "comment_date": "2016-01-21T12:32:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bakersmileyface", "comment_text": "But isn&#39;t the universe stretching, rather than expanding?

I&#39;ll answer for anyone else who might be wondering the same thing.  The question was :<br><br>&quot;How come stars closer to the center of the Milky Way orbit faster than the sun does&quot;.<br><br>The stars closer to the center of the Milky Way orbit faster than the sun for the same reason that Mercury orbits the sun faster than Jupiter.  The closer you are to your orbiting parent, the faster you must go in order to maintain that orbit.  It&#39;s basic orbital mechanics.  The force of gravity gets weaker the farther you are from the source of gravity.<br><br>Perhaps you should understand how orbits work :<br><br>Imagine you shoot a bullet out of a gun here on Earth from 1 meter above the ground - parallel to the ground.  This bullet will accelerate due to gravity at 9.8 m/s\u00b2 (ignoring drag) downward regardless of it&#39;s lateral velocity.  In a perfectly flat world, the bullet fired from the gun would reach the ground at the exact same time as a bullet that was simply dropped from the same height at the same time.  <br><br>In reality, the bullet fired from the gun took a TINY bit longer to reach the surface?  Why?  It&#39;s because the Earth is not flat.  It is a sphere, so the bullet that was fired actually traveled some distance across the surface of the Earth, and the Earth&#39;s curvature would very slightly come into play.  Now, a bullet fired from a regular gun won&#39;t go far enough in the time it takes it to fall to make a noticeable difference.  Suppose you had a super gun that could fire the bullet at any speed you like.<br><br>If you fired that bullet fast enough, you could make it so that in the time it takes the bullet to fall the 1 meter, it traveled so far across the surface of the Earth that the Earth actually curved away from the bullet by that same meter.  In all the time that bullet was falling, it never actually got any closer to the surface of the Earth.  Now, in reality - this could never work from 1 meter above the surface because the bullet would surely run into something and the air would slow it way down.  But, in space - you don&#39;t have to worry about any of those things.  So, if you get a satellite going fast enough laterally, it will be falling &quot;around&quot; the Earth - and never getting any closer.<br><br>Remember though, that the farther you are away, the weaker the gravitational force - which means the acceleration decreases.  So, the orbiting body doesn&#39;t fall DOWN as fast - therefore it doesn&#39;t need to be traveling across the surface as fast - because it takes the object longer to fall.  So, an object farther away has a slower orbital speed.", "comment_date": "2015-09-02T15:28:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Full Metal", "comment_text": "What&#39;s that green t-shirt mean?

If that chunk of ice were large enough, we would call it a comet and we would say it had a tail (the tail being the ice sublimated by the Sun&#39;s radiation heat).<br><br>Think of it as a nerd at school who is always being bullied by bullies who have a vacuum instead of a brain, so they are cold as shit. When she gets bullied, she only has two options: either to act tough or to fart on their faces. Those are the only two effective ways she has to withstand the bullying. She has also tried a third way which consists in pissing on those bullies, but she always gets beaten when she tries it.<br>One day, two girls decide to join forces and protect the nerd from the cold vacuum head bullies. One of those girls can perform &quot;bear hugs&quot; so strong that take the breath away from her rivals, and the other girl can slap them so fast that their faces turn hot. By combining their powers in the right way, the nerd is able to piss on the bullies, who then decide to leave her be. But some other times, her protectors either fall short or overdo it, they hit/hug too softly or too harshly (or a combination of both) and then the bullies don&#39;t stop. However, all this can only happen when her protectors are there, since the bullies revert to their previous behavior when they leave the nerd all by herself.<br>Keep in mind that this only works with this specific nerd, since the bullies act differently with other nerds, sometimes it takes much more effort to make them stop, sometimes it takes much less, it always depends on the nerd.<br><br>In this case, just think of the nerd as water and imagine that those two protectors are pressure and temperature: you can&#39;t have liquid water without the right amount of temperature and pressure, otherwise liquid water will either evaporate and/or solidify.<br><br>Remember, it&#39;s not the same to expose a chunk of ice to the vacuum of space as doing so using liquid water. A chunk of ice will remain mostly solid in space as long as radiation heat from stars/other sources remains low, it can partially sublimate if it isn&#39;t cold enough but its vapor will eventually desublimate if that region of space is cold enough (there&#39;s low radiation heat).<br>But liquid water, on the other hand, will always instantly boil first and, depending on the level of radiation heat, will either remain a gas or desublimate, it can&#39;t remain liquid because there&#39;s never enough pressure in a hard vacuum to force it into that state. \u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-05-01T21:02:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperShanko", "comment_text": "It&#39;s like Luthor said: We&#39;re all we&#39;ve got...&quot;", "comment_date": "2014-04-30T01:21:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sadgrill", "comment_text": "minute physics talks too fast for me...", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T18:59:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christoph Mcclelland", "comment_text": "I wonder what would happen if they poured liquid nitrogen on the sun instead of water.", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T18:22:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thelykane", "comment_text": "I clicked the link at the end of the video and then I did the same on the other video creating an infinite loop.", "comment_date": "2014-04-29T17:44:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "james furber", "comment_text": "due to their being no drag on the bullet it would only speed up, as does the space craft as it travels through space, so it in theory would speed up enough to reach the other cosmos?\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-28T20:25:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Zock Stop", "comment_text": "If there is no friction in space to slow the bullet down would that mean that there is no friction in space to stop the bullet from accelerating?

First off I am not going to use numbers or equations, because that just seems to confuse people even further. For starters infinity is a concept, not a number. So people who keep saying that there is only one infinity are wrong. Since infinity is a concept that means it is only limited to whatever numbers you include into infinity. Now going with what the guy in this video was saying if you counted on a number line from one to forever you would never reach infinity. Instead of putting this to practice most of us just think, &quot;Ok it goes on forever.&quot; well this is &quot;countable&quot;. Now let us throw in numbers we did not consider like decimals because we did not consider the full scope of what we were looking at before this, this is a new even bigger infinity. Now lets move to the final infinity with decimals, we can start to count one number say starting with 0 then we go to the next decimal. Except no matter how far we move the decimal place over we will NEVER reach the number that will finally let us take the first number in our list. So looking at this concept you reached infinity without even counting to one. :P", "comment_date": "2013-11-16T22:55:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mai Hassan", "comment_text": "you&#39;re awesome and smart", "comment_date": "2013-11-16T21:54:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "neobeeper", "comment_text": "So in order to even get to another galaxy, we&#39;d have to go at least 201km/s?
