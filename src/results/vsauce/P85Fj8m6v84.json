[{"comment_by": "Sarla Bhati", "comment_text": "2 days ago I defeated someone in online chess  the 1 time I was playing the guy near the start was cursing insanely what he was gonna do. Offcourse I KILLED HIS every piece and was standing with 4 pieces and 2 pawns. Then he requested to play again and even though he had a chance to draw he ended up loosing again in the same fashion. He stoped cursing and quit the game. I don&#39;t think iv ever felt anything remotely by actually acknowledging that I defeated someone miserably who was enthusiasticly cursing me and possibly made someone angry just by being better. But I don&#39;t feel anything. I understand how he must have changed through his chat. But i sont feel any good.", "comment_date": "2022-09-15T07:16:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SidBitGid", "comment_text": "Making your Asian parents say they are proud of you", "comment_date": "2022-09-10T16:19:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MoonTruther", "comment_text": "It&#39;s an honour to listen to you", "comment_date": "2022-09-07T21:07:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bas", "comment_text": "That cherry cola cap from Up", "comment_date": "2022-09-06T19:53:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bm0v", "comment_text": "Timeless.", "comment_date": "2022-09-05T19:39:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andreas Derycke", "comment_text": "After saying his inspiring words, Cato the Elder said: Furthermore, I want Carthage to be destroyed", "comment_date": "2022-09-02T21:55:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MarcoMa210", "comment_text": "Being called a bot in chess", "comment_date": "2022-09-02T09:52:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Julius Caesar\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6", "comment_text": "Using code judo", "comment_date": "2022-09-02T04:11:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarah Bell", "comment_text": "Not even going to lie I started tearing up at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P85Fj8m6v84&amp;t=7m10s\">7:10</a>.

Let me tell the tale of a man who won the Medal of Honor twice, and almost a third time, and lived to tell the tale. Every. Single. Time.<br><br>His first MoH was won during the Boxer Rebellion. PFC Daly was the sole Marine stationed in an entire city. One night, the enemy, a force of about 400 men, decided to attack. Using a machine gun, a bolt-action rifle, and a tripod, he fought off all of them at once. By morning, over 200 lay dead in front of the city gates.<br><br>The second was awarded during the occupation of Haiti. GySgt. Daly\u2019s platoon was crossing a river when they were ambushed. In the confusion, the wagon carrying their only machine gun was lost in the water. They made it to the other side and set up camp. In the night, Daly snuck out and recovered the machine gun by himself, without any sort of light. In the morning, his unit was able to repel the enemy.<br><br>His third action, and arguably the one that should have gotten him an MoH as well as the Silver Star, was in WWI, during the Battle of Belleau Wood. 1Sgt. Daly\u2019s men were fatigued and low on morale. They had been fighting for days and the Germans seemed like they would never stop. Suddenly, Daly jumped up with his rifle and shouted to them, \u201cCome on, you sons of bitches! Do you want to live forever?\u201d He proceeded to lead a successful charge which led to the Allies\u2019 victory along the front.<br><br>You thought he was done? HAHAHA! During the same battle, he rushed to put out a fire in an ammo dump. An ammo dump that could\u2019ve blown him sky high any second. He then went to look after several gun crews and captured a machine gun nest, again, solo, using his pistol and several grenades.<br>For this, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal and the Navy Cross.<br><br>And now he\u2019s done.", "comment_date": "2018-11-03T05:47:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felix Kolodziej", "comment_text": "I read &quot;Horror&quot;... :D", "comment_date": "2018-11-02T18:55:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ollie Cheung", "comment_text": "Getting an epic win", "comment_date": "2018-11-02T15:59:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D S", "comment_text": "Wow, too bad the  bad the Hero of Roblox honor award is not in this video....

I would like to express my idea of the greatest honour. I feel (notice, it seems relative to how we feel about it) that the greatest honour, is possibly virtuous self-condemnation. This may sound very strange, but let me explain. Not every person can live up to their own virtues... I am ashamed of my own inadequate ability (in serious situations), to have the courage necessary to follow my own virtues. I know I should defend the innocent, and should defend the right, but I have seen myself stand paralyzed when the moments came. I am intelligent, I am strong and of virtuous mind, but my physiology has not always been cooperative with my psychology. I have seen awful things happening to other people, and felt nothing but horror at my inability to act. I do not think there is anything about me, that I can surely respect, except that I have a mind honourable enough, that I can condemn nothing except myself. I do not blame anyone or anything, not even myself. But I condemn myself for those errors that have come from me, for those times I could have been a greater man. I know that I have done my best, and always do, but I cannot be proud of that. I can only respect that I condemn my own failures and errors, which is the only proof that I sought and seek to be more. Wouldn&#39;t a lot of us be superhuman if we could? wouldn&#39;t we be heroes if we could? I feel this one honour that is my own, that I mourn the pain of others, mourn that I am useless to those who need someone, those that need a hero. I am honoured to be, a hero wanna be. I am honoured to know that I will never respect myself, if I cannot be a man of honour, a man of my own virtues. I feel that there is a great honour in knowing, that no matter what you can or cannot do, there is something inside your mind that is cheering for the better, and cursing at the worse. Something that will not give you leniency from your own ethics or morals. Something that will say, &quot;you were wrong, be ashamed of yourself, be humiliated&quot;. Perhaps I am speaking of the &quot;conscience&quot; that people often refer to, but whatever the case, that great thing inside you, that asks too much, and only rewards great virtue, an condemns immorality.
