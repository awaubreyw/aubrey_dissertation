I had to use escape to port back to a nui statue to get out of it. uggggh they should make those trees and players non physical in the world.<br><br>Also, for wow, there are two other locations you can go into the ground down below and go inside of the game. The orgrimmar one is true but there is also one in Gilneas worgen starting zone area and in northrend ice crown near the Litch Kings raid tower its around the structure of the tower in a specific spikey corner and if done right you go down underneath the raid building and wind up in the next door area where its a pvp zone and glitch your way into the building that is normally locked to you unless your faction wins that zone in pvp to open the door. <br><br>the worgen one is a little more complex and you have to die right there in the first instance zone with the wild worgen enemies and then go to the spirit healer statue that is near where you track down sylvanas in the steeple way later on in the questline. from reviving there at the statue you go to the edge where the water is and swim out to the lighthouse through a series of turns to evade invisible walls to get to the lighthouse island. once you make it there you swim to shore from the lighthouse diagonally around all the invisible parameters and get to shore to find a HUGE CHUNK of land taken out of the hillside which nothing is loaded on the ground and it looks like a big empty square space glitched open into the ground. <br><br>if you jump down into it you will land after falling for a while right in the middle of elwynn forest near stormwind castle near the goldshire in and get out of the worgen starter zone early and low level. but be careful because this may prevent and lock your worgen toon from being able to get its worgen form and could mess up your toon. also one time i got frozen and lost my character which broke and that deleted all my bags i sent it, plus my gold and any other items i had mailed to the character.", "comment_date": "2022-04-18T01:32:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hvabehar", "comment_text": "Just about now I found these old vodeos of yours, out of procrastination, and I was like WTF VSauce has had a WTF playlist back in the days", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T19:54:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JdmCarGuy", "comment_text": "was minecraft invented in 2010????????", "comment_date": "2022-02-09T21:32:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdullah Mahmood", "comment_text": "wow haha", "comment_date": "2021-09-14T15:35:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tongue Twister", "comment_text": "I love the way he never changed", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T20:45:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Gold IV", "comment_text": "The Trilogy you never knew you needed", "comment_date": "2021-08-11T05:16:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AndreasGamingNerd", "comment_text": "The last thing that made me say WTF was that Vsauce used to be about gaming", "comment_date": "2021-07-01T15:06:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Hartge", "comment_text": "What makes me say WTF is the bong with Ronald Reagan (aka Beelzebub) on it.", "comment_date": "2021-06-25T11:39:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "agent debil", "comment_text": "wtf vsaouce play games lol", "comment_date": "2021-05-11T19:37:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zuzi", "comment_text": "Let me ask you this?
