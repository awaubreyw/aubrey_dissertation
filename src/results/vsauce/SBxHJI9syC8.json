As soon as they enter, it\u2019s on, as the man halfway finishes his number, he picked, the second round will begin. This number will increase from the first round, but with 12 to 13 year old kids. Halfway through the kids in the second round the third round will begin. Now the 9 to 10 year old kids will begin. This will continue, no breaks no halftime, fight till the end. This will continue until the man is down, or curled up in the fetal position crying. Each time a man believes that he will be the champion, he must, MUST, \u201cMUST\u201d, choose a higher number to begin. If he chooses 1 or some small number he will be made fun of during the pre fight show. No small bouts, no regionals, only champion fights. If a man loses his championship from anyone else, he can rematch, and be declared a double champion, loose it again, win again and be a triple champion. <br>So, who\u2019s ready?", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T23:36:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LeemSVG", "comment_text": "Asking for a friend", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T22:28:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sum Guy", "comment_text": "This is the Vsauce nobody talks about", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T21:54:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Derek Ellis", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;ve also been looking at DONGS.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T21:48:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swagmaster 47625", "comment_text": "I\u2019d say that anyone can fight an infinite amount of 5 year olds.
