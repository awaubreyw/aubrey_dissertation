He has enhanced Speed ,strength , durability &amp; reaction time.  No joke in combat he can see think and react as if everything around him is moving at slow and rapid pace at the same time.   His baseline estimated reaction time is 20 milliseconds.    Tony&#39;s reaction time to seeing something is 250 milliseconds.   Basically by the time Tony aka Iron Man&#39;s brain gets the message that a 7.2ft tall superhumans fist is coming at him at 60 plus mph and sends the oh shit move message to his body its to late the punch landed with hundreds of times more force than it takes to crush a human skull. <br><br>So in a fist fight Chief wins. <br><br>Now distance is where it gets interesting Tony&#39;s suit is impressive though not durable enough to go melee with Chief who can punch through a tank column by himself. <br><br>Plus MJOLNIR powered assualt armor . ( yes tony its named after thors hammer.  No Chief isn&#39;t a fan and no he didn&#39;t name the armor.) <br>Anyways this armor comes with some advanced sensor packs including the latest motion tracking ,radar, thermal imaging , etc.  It has a energy shield that can basically tank whatever weapons Tony can throw at it.  The Armor is designed to survive falling from space. <br><br>So thats basically Chiefs advantages.  Oh and Chief has actually fought way more battles . Chief and Tony are about the same age  Tony spent his teen years in college,  his 20s as a playboy billionaire making money off selling weapons.  It wasn&#39;t until a little trip to Afghan went wrong that he decided to fix all the shit he had been profiting off for years. <br><br>Master Chief or John-117 or just John to his friends  spent from age 6 to age 14 in a military training program that started with 150 conscripts all his age group.  At 14 he underwent augmentations of the 75 that made it this far 33 including himself would come out of it alive and uninjured.   from age 14  to his current age he has been deployed against rebels in anti terrorism opts and spent 30 years fighting the Covenant the latter years he found himself fighting both the Covenant and the Flood .  Which btw would eat Tony for breakfast.  <br><br>Chief is actually smarter than Tony with Chief&#39;s IQ being 300.  Where as Tony&#39;s IQ is  270.   The difference is Chief&#39;s mind has been molded for war.   Tony is a inventor who was educated to that end.  He is also physically just a normal human . <br><br>Chief wins due to biology , armor capabilities , military training and education and experience due to his over 30 years of combat experience.  <br><br>Tony is still the go to guy for tech . Even if MJOLNIR is more advanced which it is and would rip him apart if he tried to use it to give someone a high five. <br><br>Basically take Captain America add a so many augmentations that he wouldn&#39;t count as human anymore then add a lifetime of combat and training from childhood then neurologically link him to a powered exoskeleton that  increases his speed,strength,  agility and reaction time by a factor of 5 then add enhanced adrenaline response pushing his body and the suit to its limits .

I hate when people grab one random off-shoot story about a comic character where they are completely overpowered beyond any believability and pulled off something completely BS or survived some impossible crap. <br>Halo is a game...therefore the game needs to nerf the abilities of the player so they fit within a playable format. So we MUST go by the cannon to establish the abilities of the characters. With comics I would say we should at least stick with the mainstream stuff or the films. Because all too often comic book characters are so OP that its just insane. Its like some anime characters...they just keep getting more powerful until its just stupid.  <b>cough</b> Naruto <b>cough</b> Goku <b>cough</b><br>I think when comparisons are made for a VERSUS we need to set a premise of limitations for the characters. Marvel&#39;s universe is dynamic and always changing and we need to establish which version we are using. I personally like the current movie universe because they nerfed the characters to a believable and even relatable level. It is easy to understand and comprehend their abilities. Instead of them being nearly all powerful demigods. Spiderman is a great example. He started out with the abilities of a spider with his relative mass. Thus if he weighs 175 lbs he could lift ~1400 lbs. But then suddenly he can lift UP TO 4 TONS! But that&#39;s not enough its 10 tons! No...15 tons! Wait...20 tons! See where I&#39;m going with this? <br>Master Chief has had a steady and even list of abilities. And the writers are constrained by this. In comics the writers do whatever the hell they want. And buffing the abilities of their pet superhero is the norm. I wish somebody (Marvel...you know who you are) would make a STATIC list of abilities that constrains the writers within a given universe. Granted there are several marvel universes and they can do what they want with them. But at least one of them could be called the &quot;normal&quot; one and have static abilities and powers for the authors and fans to draw from.", "comment_date": "2015-10-31T16:09:21Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "zigzack54", "comment_text": "Iron man is battle hardened and Master chief isn&#39;t!???", "comment_date": "2015-10-29T04:30:38Z", "likes_count": 20}, {"comment_by": "Simon Terpening", "comment_text": "Chief has advantage in technology, experience, actual training, and has a lot greater experience fighting a wide range of enemies.", "comment_date": "2015-10-19T14:22:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lord Beerus", "comment_text": "master chief wins", "comment_date": "2015-10-12T02:05:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ten Iron Skulls Gaming", "comment_text": "Also he defeated an army of over a billion of different types of alien species that killed almost every Spartan in existence except for him and he still is alive and kicking ass.

(please understand that tony doesn&#39;t have any of his suits at his disposal other than the one he took on patrol which would be Mk5 or something and chief has his Mk6 armor and since I don&#39;t know the stats I&#39;m going to assume no omega super strength or special weapons for stark and chief only has his assault rifle pistol and other weapons found on Requiem like binary rifle and other stuff) Ok so by this LOGIC Tony whether or not he created the Chiefs armor would&#39;ve not known or is on an extremely early concept of it considering he hated creating anything for the army or as a weapon(HUGE HYPOCRITE by the way) and so that means he can&#39;t hack that shit and if he wanted to it would just be a hassle because he is in a middle of a fight. Okay now that we got the LOGIC of these made up characters fight out of the way we must think of who has the most experience so by this standard chief just about wins considering stark has a bit of a chance due to Jarvis constantly giving Stark tips on what to do. Now it&#39;s down to weapons and Stark has a vast amount like a shit ton but to remain with LOGIC he only took with him the amount he needed for a routine patrol and chief is on constant battle mode and with some many weapons he has just mastered the weapons would&#39;ve run out at around five minutes. So the Weapons and Experience and LOGIC are done with their fighting style would probably be a small factor but a factor nonetheless and so I&#39;m just gonna give this one straight up to chief because of his immense training even in future technique while stark has moves taught only by Captain America(just guessing anyone could add to this) so in the end I&#39;m giving it to chief because I just realized that this vid is four years old so I&#39;m done peace the fuck out", "comment_date": "2014-03-01T15:59:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alex marino", "comment_text": "If chiefs armour can take abuse from covenant energy weapons, then starks weapons are nothing", "comment_date": "2014-02-27T07:09:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kenteth Liles", "comment_text": "I vote 117!
