The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your \u2018left\u2019? Or the one on your \u2018right\u2019? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of \u2018right or left?\u2019! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals.\r<br>\r<br><br>-funny valentine", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T13:05:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Buddahbraham", "comment_text": "Came from that video,  you explained it way more poorly than the first 5 seconds of this video lol", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T06:57:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bijay Lawong", "comment_text": "That tshirt &#39;everything is terrible&#39; is terrible.", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T06:44:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "demetrius smith", "comment_text": "I got smooth brain\ud83e\udd24", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T03:41:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spoopy", "comment_text": "Me watching this video: i see.... i have no idea what any if that means \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2021-03-27T19:02:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pantheri0", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/o-ZQXkEWOek\">https://youtu.be/o-ZQXkEWOek</a> t", "comment_date": "2021-03-27T16:05:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "matt2eadgbe", "comment_text": "having flashbacks to high school and being frustrated when the teacher explains it too quickly.", "comment_date": "2021-03-27T02:52:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DuhC0mmunity", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=3m27s\">3:27</a> you lost me at PI aka 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679", "comment_date": "2021-03-26T05:26:00Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Raszerr", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve learned more math in 2 science videos than all my years in school", "comment_date": "2021-03-26T04:26:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "francisoco ruiz", "comment_text": "ufffff", "comment_date": "2021-03-25T21:53:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Basem", "comment_text": "What?", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T13:12:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sean Sullivan", "comment_text": "Yay!<br><br><br><br><br>With teeth", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T06:40:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the local bread guy", "comment_text": "Last", "comment_date": "2021-03-22T15:39:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Kacarski", "comment_text": "It&#39;s even a called napkin", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T21:13:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "omar miller", "comment_text": "my sleep paralysis demon at 3:00 am <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=0m50s\">0:50</a>", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T15:44:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abe Ham", "comment_text": "This video was actually boring", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T07:52:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drew M", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=5m25s\">5:25</a> You removed the exponent on one side but not the other by simply adding a square root sign?", "comment_date": "2021-03-20T03:25:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashten Bahr", "comment_text": "An anal bead!", "comment_date": "2021-03-19T08:02:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leggolem", "comment_text": "Something isn\u2019t clicking for me.

The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your \u2018left\u2019? Or the one on your \u2018right\u2019? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of \u2018right or left?\u2019! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals.\u201d", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T21:46:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elijah", "comment_text": "Whenever I have insomnia problems, I just return to this video<br><br>really gets ya in the mindset for sleep.", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T21:00:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CaptainMangles", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=9m22s\">9:22</a> who is this guy?", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T19:05:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raihan Sk \ud83d\udd78", "comment_text": "BTW, Orange Oil is Inflammable", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T13:14:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Davies", "comment_text": "Over my head lol", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T11:22:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M I", "comment_text": "The math put me to sleep , I am sorry \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T11:11:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "son of embry", "comment_text": "What", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T06:54:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P4rd0n3d Ph03n1x", "comment_text": "Me: *hears: \u201cby the way, orange oil is flammable.\u201d<br>Me: *proceeds to douse school in orange oil.", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T05:59:56Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Bal\u00e1zs", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=0m50s\">0:50</a> I expected Michael to dance exactly like that", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T03:08:11Z", "likes_count": 316}, {"comment_by": "Michael Kinghorn", "comment_text": "i laughed so hard when he did the intro idky XD", "comment_date": "2021-01-19T03:00:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Torian Cromar", "comment_text": "Your videos are weird, but fascinating", "comment_date": "2021-01-18T09:18:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sandwich Boy", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t exactly get it, why is the ring from the orange cut thinner than the tomato?

Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on this earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there are only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water.<br>-<br>WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don&#39;t try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years.<br>-<br>DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early &#39;90s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don&#39;t know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. + TRUTH about COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc</a> <br>-<br>Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly?<br>-<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once.<br>-<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current.<br>-<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor.<br>-<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING. This website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000s as a Vision of a 10-speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ <a href=\"http://free-energy.yolasite.com/\">http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity.<br>-<br>This is a diagram <a href=\"https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php\">https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php</a> that looks a lot like the wiring of this former \u201cscience experiment\u201d YouTube video if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology<br>-<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages.

The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your \u2018left\u2019? Or the one on your \u2018right\u2019? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of \u2018right or left?\u2019! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T10:57:50Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Charles Seyfert", "comment_text": "Anyone know the super jazzy music at the end of the video?", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T01:55:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfred James", "comment_text": "Doesn\u2019t simplify the roots this could have saved you work, to bad you aren\u2019t looking at the new comments", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T01:17:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric", "comment_text": "vsauce is just this gen bill nye", "comment_date": "2020-10-05T18:24:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris", "comment_text": "depending on the size of the cylinder that is cut out. wouldnt that change? if i cut a straw sized cylinder out of the earth, and cut a large cylinder size out of a golf ball. wouldnt the volume change?", "comment_date": "2020-10-05T16:33:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arindam Kalita", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=8m55s\">8:55</a> When Beyonce goes nerd...", "comment_date": "2020-10-05T14:33:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FD12", "comment_text": "oops i slept", "comment_date": "2020-10-05T13:59:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lance Coleman", "comment_text": "ima thing", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T21:54:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manas Deep", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who skipped the mathematical part?", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T13:06:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremey", "comment_text": "Thank you for solving the problem that I didn\u2019t know I wanted the answer to.", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T01:25:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mozzi AU", "comment_text": "Anyone else watched this like 10 time while trying to fall asleep and never really understood what is going on?", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T15:31:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hannah", "comment_text": "The most interesting part is thinking bout how he PEELED THAT FREAKIN ORANGE", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T06:49:31Z", "likes_count": 412}, {"comment_by": "Troy Rosin", "comment_text": "Olive", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T06:22:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Boing Patoing", "comment_text": "<b>YAY!</b> ..................................................................... <b>With teeth</b>", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T13:30:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "criar", "comment_text": "Yay!

Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of \u2018right or left?\u2019! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals.\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-05-06T13:03:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Rigdon", "comment_text": "Ima tell my math teacher after quarantine that orange oil is flamable", "comment_date": "2020-05-04T16:41:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChickenPower", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=0m50s\">0:50</a> Michael embracing his inner demons.", "comment_date": "2020-05-04T10:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRandomGuy", "comment_text": "Fact that I&#39;m gonna remember forever :<br>Orange oil", "comment_date": "2020-05-03T18:31:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "And I'm British", "comment_text": "What?", "comment_date": "2020-05-03T07:26:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "And I'm British", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve just made a breakthrough that will make you gasp so much your jaw will detach from your head and make you unable to eat until you get it fixed.

The napkins are in front of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your \u2018left\u2019? Or the one on your \u2018right\u2019? The one on your left side? Or the one on your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of \u2018right or left?\u2019! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals.\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-02-14T21:14:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ram avtar10", "comment_text": "Everything is TERRIBLE!", "comment_date": "2020-02-14T10:11:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Magik", "comment_text": "I was interested until he pulled out the math", "comment_date": "2020-02-14T02:16:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "318 Youngin", "comment_text": "This was a bunch of common since", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T08:14:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "oakwell rex", "comment_text": "Theory outcome will always be what you observe.", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T02:06:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ejg907", "comment_text": "Oh no that\u2019s weird.", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T00:37:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DisappointingPorn", "comment_text": "No. \ud83d\ude20 No, does not like.

Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they have no other option. This is \u2018society\u2019\u2026 Who are the ones that determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined by that same principle of \u2018right or left?\u2019! In a Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals.", "comment_date": "2020-01-31T16:00:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "choreomania", "comment_text": "Hey Michael!

Usually you would take the one on your left side. That is \u2018correct\u2019 too. But in a larger sense on society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute \u2018society\u2019 with the \u2018Universe\u2019. The correct answer is that \u2018It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin first.\u2019 \u2026Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to their right, then there\u2019s no choice but for others to also take the \u2018right\u2019 napkin. The same goes for the left.

There must have been someone who determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations?

In every era, this World has been operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \u2018takes the napkin first\u2019 must be someone who is respected by all. It\u2019s not that anyone can fulfill this role\u2026 Those that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the \u2018losers\u2019. In the case of this table, the \u2018eldest\u2019 or the \u2018Master of the party\u2019 will take the napkin first\u2026 Because everyone \u2018respects\u2019 those individuals.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T18:44:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Acumen", "comment_text": "Nice marriage saved, Thank you Vsauce.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T16:36:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maddux Smith", "comment_text": "By the way, orange oil is flammable.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T05:05:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lvygjm", "comment_text": "Half the video is made of math", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T02:01:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mohammed", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the song at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=6m20s\">6:20</a>?", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T06:11:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sulfur X", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=8m43s\">8:43</a><br><br>Now that\u2019s some facts!", "comment_date": "2019-12-15T00:44:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yuminous", "comment_text": "Please don\u2019t let YouTube translate the video title to my langauge it\u2019s horrible", "comment_date": "2019-12-14T20:26:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SHXDOW", "comment_text": "\u201cRight now we\u2019re talking about balls\u201d.              <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=0m51s\">0:51</a><br><br>                 -Michael,  2017", "comment_date": "2019-12-14T12:14:23Z", "likes_count": 406}, {"comment_by": "Ben Snow", "comment_text": "That intro", "comment_date": "2019-12-14T04:41:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kams", "comment_text": "You got something against napkins?", "comment_date": "2019-12-14T02:14:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brofenix", "comment_text": "Not one of the best Vsauce videos. :\\ Interesting but it was just a mathematical proof very slowly explained.", "comment_date": "2019-12-13T19:54:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cameron Dowden", "comment_text": "Why does Michael keep calling me vsauce", "comment_date": "2019-12-13T09:00:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ebit Lagger", "comment_text": "I understood everything he said except the &quot;putting ring on it&quot; part.

them) you cut a super small one, then got a sphere that had so much volume no matter how you cut the napkin ring it would always have more volume then the small one, and im talking down to the atomic

In calculus 1, you learn the disk method, a method of solving the volume of a shape that&#39;s orbiting around a certain line, and later, you learn the washer method, which excludes a smaller region. So if you were to take two napkin rings, you could say their formulas were... for example, sqrt(r^2-x^2). To cut out the center, you need a height first, which I used 2 and -2. To start, you plug in 2 for the radius to see where the height and circle connect for the sake of the washer method. My first circle was sqrt(16-x^2), and when I plugged in 2, I got sqrt(12). To find the volume, you&#39;ve gotta find the integral of the circle minus where it intersects the height from -2 to 2. This&#39;ll be about 1.449, and now we need to find the next washer, which I used sqrt(25-x^2). Once you plug in your height, you get sqrt(21), so you need to find the integral of sqrt(25-x^2)-sqrt(21) from -2 to 2 to find the volume.

At first glance it appears there is not enough information to solve the problem. Surely you need at least the diameter of the original sphere, or the the diameter of the cylindrical hole! I had no idea how to approach this mathematically, but then I figured  that since those dimensions were not given the answer must be the same for all sphere and cylinder diameters that result in a napkin ring of height 10cm. In the extreme case of a cylinder of radius 0, the &#39;napking ring&#39; of height 10cm is actually a solid sphere of diameter 10cm with a  hole of 0cm diameter, and the problem reduces to simply calculating the volume of a 10cm diameter sphere. :)", "comment_date": "2018-03-22T06:26:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Awbluefy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=7m30s\">7:30</a> should i have seen that?<br>yeah i think i remember that... wasnt really a total eclipse in my area... that shadow&#39;s a little big.", "comment_date": "2018-03-22T05:22:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Smuggerino", "comment_text": "I hate geometry....", "comment_date": "2018-03-22T04:34:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Itachi's Will", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude10....

Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix myself a sandwich. But then I found out that I&#39;m out of mayonnaise so I went to the store to get some. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I&#39;m really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I&#39;m a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she&#39;ll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quite happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can&#39;t sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can&#39;t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she&#39;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what&#39;s up.

I say this because if you remove a very small core from the Earth (as with the tiny tomato) and have a 1 inch high napkin ring, the volume would still be incredibly massive, compared to the volume from that tomato.  Wouldn&#39;t there be some limits on how thick the napkin ring could be?

The topic discussed here is not a common subject matter in everyday discourse thus providing the viewer new information in a relatively short span of time; which provides another effective marketing tool. Though the video itself is educational and informative, it is not a cumbersome one. The producer manages to refrain from both extremes, either making the video far to short, or far to long. Anyone truly interested on the subject could easily expend ten minutes of their day to view the video. <br>     The presenter is also charismatic, engaging, knowledgeable, and humerus providing another effective edge. His voice is not mundane and flavorless which works in his favor.<br>     The music in his video is not distracting either, but almost sounds as if it encourages curiosity and remain a pleasant background white noise.<br>     The producers also donate proceeds to Alzheimer&#39;s research, providing a charitable cause to possible donors. <br><br>Engaging:<br>     Since this is an educational video, it must be engaging. The presenter accomplishes this with an understanding of his topic and presenting the information in an understandable manner without a mundane voice or distracting music. He manages to capture his audience with his own quirky charm.<br><br>Improvement:<br>     Suggesting improvements are difficult since the channels is well run, the videos are well made and attractive.

Therefore the area of a cross-section of S1 taken from lower on S1 will be greater than the area of the cross section shown in the diagram from the large sphere. Therefore if one had two napkin bands like this and one was from a very large sphere and the other a small sphere, you could compare the small sphere&#39;s band to a band of the same height from the large sphere, but if the sphere&#39;s sizes were different, one would have to choose where to take the cross section of the large sphere from on the larger napkin band to compare to the smaller napkin band. There would be multiple napkin bands available from the large sphere to compare with different areas. It doesn&#39;t matter what height the napkin bands are, just how far away they are from the center of the sphere in height. The distance from the center of the spheres would have to be the same. Therefore, napkin bands only have the same area if we measure them in such a way that their areas are the same.

Did a bit of a different approach: The Volume of the Napkin Ring is the Volume of the Sphere minus the Volume of the inscribed Cylinder minus the Volume of the two Caps (Top and Bottom). The Volume of the cap required the most effort to compute (Calc 1 volumes of revolution) but in the end it turns out that if you name the height of the Cylinder as 2h, or name half the height of the cylinder as h, then the volume of the Napkin Ring becomes (4pi/3)h^3, which means that the volume of the Napkin Ring depends only on the height of the Napkin Ring, and another fun result that the Napkin Ring has the same volume as a Sphere of radius h (half the height of the cylinder).

Probability is my basic math weakness, so I have not been able to figure it out.   Your doctor gives you a bottle of pills.  He tells you to take 1/2 of one every day.  Instead of breaking all of them in half, you simply take one out the first day and break it in half.  You take your daily dose and then toss the other piece back in the bottle.  Assuming that you have an equal chance of selecting a full or a half pill the next day, you select one from the bottle (In the real world, the half pill is lighter, so the selection is not equal)  You continue to do this following this rule:  If you get a whole pill, you break it in half, take your dose and then toss the remaining piece back in the bottle.  If you get a half piece, you simply take your daily dose.  <br>Given N ( the number of pills in the bottle. Note that the number of days you will take these pills is 2N)) is there a general probability function that will give us the probability of selecting a whole pill on a given day? (If we let D be the given day with 1&lt;D&lt;2N.  On day one the probability of getting a whole pill is 1 and the probability of getting a whole pill on day 2N is 0.) What I am asking is (without knowing on a given day what number of each type of pill is in the bottle) if we can make a general probability function for this problem?

Michael has proven that the volume is independent of the radius, but what exactly is the volume then? Given a certain height <b>h</b> we can derive the formula for the volume from this proof, and here is how.<br><br>Michael has shown that for a given segment <b>y</b> of the napkin ring&#39;s height its area is given by A(y) = \u03c0 (h/2)^2 - \u03c0 y^2 = \u03c0 [(h/2)^2 - y^2]. The square brackets have no special meaning, I&#39;m just using them to make the formula easier to look at.<br><br>Now we know the area of a ring with respect to its offset from the center of the napkin ring. How do we get the volume from this? Easy, we stack all those flat rings on top of each other and add up their areas. Well, sort of, since these are two-dimensional areas we cannot just add them up, but the idea is sound. When you hear &quot;adding up&quot; you should immediately think of the integral, because that&#39;s the basic idea of the integral: you add up an infinite amount of infinitely thin segments in a given interval.<br><br>Now the only question that remains is the interval we have to integrate over.  We know that the area formula is relative to the center of the napkin ring, where the ring is the thickest. This means that if we want to sum up the areas from top to bottom (or the other way around) our interval is [-h/2, h/2].<br><br>Let&#39;s put it all together:<br><br>  V = \u222b_(-h/2)^(h/2) A(y) dy<br><br>I will be leaving out the integral interval from now on to keep things readable, but the interval borders are still there implicitly.<br><br>  V = \u222b \u03c0 [(h/2)^2 - y^2] dy<br><br>The number \u03c0 is a constant factor, so we can move it in front of the integral<br><br>  V = \u03c0 \u222b [(h/2)^2 - y^2] dy = \u03c0 \u222b h^2/4 - y^2 dy<br><br>Use the rules of inverse differentiation. Now the square brackets have the meaning they have when doing integrals.

I know that for volume to be equal across two napkin rings, their height must be the same. But what is it that causes the cylinder shaped hole in the earth to be so large relative to its mass, and the cylinder shaped hole in the cherry tomato to be alot smaller relative to the tomatoe&#39;s mass? If you have two spheres of the exact same size, what&#39;s stopping you from poking a gigantic chode through one of them, calling it a napkin ring, and then poking the other sphere with a skewer and creating a much more skinny cylinder, thus creating another napkin ring. Wouldn&#39;t that mean that the two spheres would have different volumes despite being the same height? Someone please explainto me what it is that determines the radius of the hole in a napkin ring.

By applying this principle, we can then come up with accurate estimations of matter distribution across the universe by using the napkin ring volume as a standard of measurement. This can allow us to calculate the estimated path taken and future trajectory of matter, indicating not only the ultimate fate of the universe (big crunch if the distribution exceeds the trajectory of diaspora vs heat death for the reverse), but also the properties of the big bang such as the actual amount of stuff we started with and how much had been &quot;lost&quot;. This in turn gives us insight to higher energy states that the universe had and how they relate to it&#39;s current state, which also provides insight into how laws might change should the universe enter a lower energy state. This would of course be skewed by the drainage and reception of stuff via micro quantum wormholes, but that skew would in turn reveal information about the properties and tendencies of such quantum events.", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T23:05:31Z", "likes_count": 86}, {"comment_by": "Jack Kraken", "comment_text": "I caught you Vsauce! <br>Trying to teach me math, nice try.", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T23:05:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hamza nemer", "comment_text": "you turnd this channel into a commercial channel", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T23:05:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kabloosh", "comment_text": "Suggestion: what shape is the universe?", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T23:04:55Z", "likes_count": 2011}, {"comment_by": "bobdoedoe5", "comment_text": "Ok, not the volume of the hole inside the napkin ring, the volume of the napkin ring itself.

This concept of course didn&#39;t seem to make sense to being with when thinking about it in a planetary level compared to something like an orange. The moment of clarity for it came not when looking at the math, but when realizing that at the much larger scale (such as with Earth, etc.), the outer curve of a object with the same height as one cut from something much smaller like the orange, would have a curve and thickness about as straight and flat as a piece of paper because of the shear size of the object and how gradual the curve is in a small point, where say a 40cm tall cylinder cut from an orange will be a much thicker (comparably) for that small height. Also similar to how you might see the ground in front of you as flat because of the scale even knowing that the Earth is a sphere, but if you were to look at a ball in your hand you would not see any part of it as being flat. <br><br>Summing this up, you or someone else trying to explain this concept, might do well to emphasize just how thin the outer section of\u00a0the more\u00a0massive\u00a0object is, especially when comparing these things on a large scale.<br><br>Slight side\u00a0note, it is sad looking through the comments and seeing so many\u00a0on this video complaining about the content. Yes it is a mundane math problem, but it is something that is interesting because of how counter intuitive it is. Yes it isn&#39;t something flashy and there was some written algebra here,\u00a0but it is still learning something even if you might not use it in your daily life, and that is the point of it. It is disturbing to see just how many are bothered by being pushed outside of their typical flashy Michael Bay style over the top videos with no real base content and are mad that they are shown a simple video teaching them a simple math problem they might not typically see.

I&#39;m only 17 and never really used more than basic math outside of the school but as I want to become a programmer it will definitely help me later in life.

Most of your videos have complicated paradoxes and theories that are hard to get and I can spend entire day thinking and explaining them to myself.

It&#39;s at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=3m09s\">3:09</a> that I understand... <br><br>1:   Pick two spheres of different sizes<br>2:   Pick a height that you want the &quot;napkin ring&quot; to be<br>3:   Go half height up and down from center of sphere and cut off the top and bottom so that both spheres are of identical height<br>4:   Now starting at the top edge of the sphere edge, cut out the center/hollow out the curved band, but you have to start at the furthest edge and cut straight down.<br><br>Step 4 is the part that i was confused on, I just figured you could cut the hole/radius of the inner circle however big you want, which would easily prove this wrong, but when you must pick the top/bottom radius and go straight through the sphere and core/hollow it out, it makes more sense.  The larger the sphere, the thinner the &quot;skin&quot;.<br><br>I did watch your episode with Adam and was confused when you mentioned this property before and was excited you did a video on it!  <br><br>Thanks!<br><br>edit.<br>And to be fair, the animation at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=0m18s\">0:18</a> seconds I think is what makes this so confusing.  The shape pictured is not a &quot;napkin ring&quot; that you&#39;re talking about, the red sphere is, because the top and bottom edges are to a point, sides curve into a point at top, but the animation leaves for a &quot;flat&quot; top where the radius isn&#39;t bound to the edge of the top of the sphere&#39;s height.   Sorry if i sound crazy and make no sense...  =(", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T16:32:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EvilJagan", "comment_text": "I offered my girlfriend a napkin ring, and she left me.", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T16:32:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Astillero", "comment_text": "notif: New VSauce video<br>me: work, porn, and facebook can wait", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T16:32:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andres", "comment_text": "Can anyone explain the bit at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J51ncHP_BrY&amp;t=5m10s\">5:10</a> to me?
