As you increase your energy you keep going faster, a rocket pumping out fuel will always feel like its accelerate to an observer. As you get closer to lightspeed however, space around you will contract. While some relatively stable observer might see two stars be 1ly apart, if your close to the speed of light from your perspective (assuming you are parallel to the stars) they are closer together. You&#39;re not traveling faster than light, your going some percent of it but now there&#39;s basically less distance to travel. Now lightspeed is consistent across all observers, yes, so your perspective of a 5 minute journey over what used to be 1ly would be seen as over a year long trip to an observer on Earth.", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T20:51:26Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "XShadowCatzX", "comment_text": "can someone tell me how to do that gradient thing from the beginning? i need to do this", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T00:12:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hyperion", "comment_text": "Ew", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T20:20:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CobraZRT600", "comment_text": "Space is so cool", "comment_date": "2022-06-04T15:52:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "crescnta", "comment_text": "where did bro get that shirt its hard", "comment_date": "2022-06-01T05:26:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DeathStory", "comment_text": "Our middle school needs to get better technology because it lags with like mouth movements all the time I hate it", "comment_date": "2022-05-31T05:31:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zer0Bot", "comment_text": "how did he make the effect? i was hoping there&#39;s a link for the software that he used", "comment_date": "2022-05-30T23:24:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wyatt Melton", "comment_text": "Watching vsauce while high is lit.

If you&#39;re not using neural nets which learn this fact on their own then that means you would have to manually program in a compensation for predicting where things further away actually are during any one frame of analysis. I guess that&#39;s why mixing 2D photos with 3D LIDAR scans gives a generally better picture of reality even though the laser is also lagging at the same rate the colors are, but at least there the travel time of light is intentionally used in the interpretation of the scan. Perhaps this is part of why we&#39;ve evolved to perceive images as &quot;slowly&quot; as we do (where the average human can barely tell the difference between 60, 120, and 240 fps) because if we perceived things as quickly as robots could then we might struggle to make sense of anything a stone&#39;s throw away from us. This is all really mind-bending, but since you can&#39;t interact with anything faster than you can bounce photons off of it then maybe this lag doesn&#39;t make a practical difference in how robots interact with the world around them....

That means if you threw a football to the image you see, you would miss by 3 feet.  But, after about a dozen throws, your brain would adjust your muscle memory to compensate!  And then, if that wasn&#39;t trippy enough, when you took off the glasses you would then throw 3 feet to the left for a few throws until your brain readjusted your muscle memory again!

For instance, sound can travel up to 7 times faster in steel than it can in water due to the collisions in the compression wave taking far less time to occur.  So if the board was made from a material with a density so high that it takes zero time for the collisions to occur, would it instantly cause the wave to transfer energy to the other end no matter how long it is?  Could our future generations use sound as a form of instant communication across our galaxy in the form of indestructible sound wires? I kinda doubt it since while sound travels faster and (I think) diffracts less in denser mediums, it also requires more energy to do so, therefore at incredibe densities, far more energy will be required to create a disturbance because the energy will be dispersed throught a much greater number of particles for the same amount of volume as the medium the energy was transferred through into the wire, also (idk if this next part is right), if a medium needs infinite density to create and instant reaction in a compression wave, then by the time we compressed a material dense enough, would it simply form a singularity, which occupies no space and therefore could not be used for a chain since it has no density? And unless we produced quite massive singularities, they would just decay and fizzle out in an incredibly short amount of time.  Also even if an object with infinite density somehow had volume, would it require infinite energy to transfer sound, as it would behave as though it had an infinite number of particals within it? I also wonder if infinite density is not needed to travel faster than light, and tightly packed subatmoic particals with no space between them like those in nuetron stars work?  Could a chain of neutrons that have somehow been bonded indestructibly make an infinitely fast compression wave? Or would the energy required to make a detectable disturbance simply warp space time so much that it just gives the space-time the wire occupies infinite curvature and just forms a singularity?<br><br>Well I&#39;m wrapping my speculations up here cause my thumbs are about to fall off.

The scientists put two wheels with a notch into a way of a pulsating light source, synchronized the pulses with an exact position of the notch and then projected the resulting image onto a screen. When the wheels were turning slowly, the notch on the screen was matching the notches at the wheels but as they rotated the wheels faster and faster, the image of the notch on the screen started to shrink. They increased the speed to the point where the image of the notch disappeared, took note of the speed of the wheels and then used this speed and a couple of other metrics (diameter of the wheels, distance between the wheels) to get the speed of light.", "comment_date": "2019-05-18T06:52:34Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "Jozef Behran", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ0hS7l9ckY&amp;t=0m32s\">0:32</a> Not just digital cameras.

Michael Here.<br><br>I am distorted. The pixels you are watching have been timed displaced. They&#39;ve been mapped onto a gradient and the darker the region they&#39;re mapped to, the further behind they lag. The effect is really fun but it&#39;s certainly not realistic.<br>Or is it?<br>* <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TN25ghkfgQA?t=2\">https://youtu.be/TN25ghkfgQA?t=2</a> *<br><br>Many, many popular digital cameras suffer from lag induced distortion, like what you just saw, though much, much more subtle. Usually completely unnoticeable. It&#39;s called a rolling shutter.<br><br>Instead of snapping a full exposure at once they quickly scan strips of each frame. It&#39;s usually undetectable. But when the subject changes faster than the camera scans, you get the famous geloey wobbly rolling <br>shutter effect. Really fast things, like vibrating guitar strings and<br>airplane propellers, are famous victims, but people can be too.<br>Luke Mandel submitted this photo to Boing Boing. His camera scans left to<br>right and, in this instance, managed to capture a blink, eyes closed when the scan began and then open in the<br>reflection scanned a fraction of a second later.<br><br>But the rolling shutter effect is not just a neat curiosity. It represents a fundamental and inescapable distortion that affects everything we see. Rolling shutter or not. First things first, let&#39;s talk about distortions.<br><br>A hallucination is a distortion of reality when there is no apparent stimulus. If you are merely misinterpreting an actual stimulus, that is an illusion. But some distortions occur before our sense organs and minds get in the way. They are called optical phenomena. They are not the result of sensation or perception gone wrong. Instead, optical phenomena are distortions<br>caused by the mere properties of light and matter in and of themselves.<br><br>If you look up at the sky and see a giant vivid drinking gourd, two-dimensional connect-the-dots<br>Big Dipper, you are seeing an illusion. It&#39;s an illusion because those dots merely appear to be on the same plane, like<br>holes poked in the dark roof of the sky. In reality, those dots are stars lightyears apart from one another in three dimensions.<br>As Celestron&#39;s brilliant free real-time 3D visualization of space shows, from different perspectives, besides our own, they look a lot less like a dipper or plough. In fact, all constellations and asterisms are geocentric illusions. From a wider perspective their outlines point inward, to the single lowly point in space that gave them their names.<br><br>But you can&#39;t blame us. I mean, Earth is the only perspective any human has ever had. And even Voyager 1, the most distant man-made object, is still not even close to being far<br>enough away for the constellations to look even remotely different than they do here on Earth. It&#39;s also not our fault, our eyes&#39; and brains&#39; fault, that distant, distant stars weren&#39;t included in our early cosmic connect-the-dot game. Sure, our eyesight could be better, but optical phenomena are also to blame. If it weren&#39;t for red shifting and the inverse square law and light extinction, distant things could be seen in all their glory. The night sky would look phenomenal. Many structures up there are huge. They&#39;re just too dim for their hugeness to be appreciated.<br>When we see Hubble Telescope images of distant objects, like the Helix Nebula, it&#39;s easy to think that, without a telescope to zoom in, the object must just be a tiny point in the sky. But in reality, even though the Helix Nebula is 700 light years away, it&#39;s 3 lightyears across. If we could make the Helix Nebula less dim, if our eyes could take a really long exposure of it, we would see the Helix Nebula as it really is - nearly 70% the apparent diameter of our Moon. This is a serious picture. That is how large the Helix Nebula would appear in the night sky from Earth if it just wasn&#39;t so dim. Our Moon is tiny in the sky, by the way. It&#39;s easy to think of the moon as this huge baseball-sized thing up there in the sky, but that&#39;s an illusion.<br><br>Try this the next time you see the Moon. Grab a sheet of notebook paper and you will notice that the angular<br>diameter of the Moon is the same size as a hole punched in a sheet of notebook paper held in arms-length away. Seriously, try it sometime. It shows just how cute and tiny our little moon is.<br>The Orion Nebula would appear even larger, if we saw all of its light. And the Andromeda Galaxy? Just a smudge in the sky to our eyes. But if our eyes were better at collecting dim light, we would see Andromeda&#39;s true extent in our sky. Of course, our night sky doesn&#39;t look like that. Distant objects are dimmer, that&#39;s a bummer.<br><br>But light still wins when it comes to speed. Light travels at the fastest speed. In fact, in a vacuum, light travels 300,000 kilometres a second. That&#39;s fast. But not really. I mean, not compared to how far apart things are in the universe. Sydney, Australia is 1/14th of a light second away from London. But the Andromeda Galaxy is 2,500,000 light years away from London. To put that in perspective let&#39;s take a light speed journey from London to Sydney. It would look like this... Ready? Three, two, one, go! Nice! Alright, alright.<br><br>Here&#39;s the Andromeda Galaxy. Okay, now, relativistic effects aside, let&#39;s take a look at what it would look like to travel toward the Andromeda Galaxy at the speed of light. Are you ready? Alright. Three, two, one, go! Yeah. I mean, seriously, it&#39;s pretty lame. Even at the speed of light, the fastest speed possible, a year from now we won&#39;t even be a millionth of the way there.<br><br>That&#39;s how far away Andromeda is. It&#39;s almost sad in a way. But this brings us back to the rolling shutter effect. The Andromeda Galaxy is huge. It&#39;s more than a hundred thousand light years across and our view of it is tilted. Which means that, on the plane we view it in, light from the back represents what Andromeda looked like thousands and thousands of years before what light from the front represents.Changes in its appearance reach us sooner from the front than from the back. Andromeda is rotating, spinning at hundreds of kilometers per second in some places. Now, a lag between light coming from near and far points on a spinning object, results in a skewed image. The rolling shutter effect on a cosmic scale applied to, say, a chessboard, seeing the front ahead of the back is pretty trippy and dramatic.<br><br>So, does that mean we see wobbly, funhouse mirror, rolling shutter effect versions of Andromeda and other distant galaxies? Well, technically yeah, but the distortion is negligible. It may as well be ignored. Why? Well, the speeds used in these visualizations are not to scale. On average, yes, matter within galaxies orbits the galactic center at hundreds<br>of kilometers per second but galaxies are so huge it takes them hundreds of millions of years to complete just one rotation. In other words, the lag between light reaching you from near and far points on a galaxy, is nothing compared to how much time it takes matter in the galaxy to travel that same distance.<br><br>In the case of Andromeda, if you insisted on seeing Andromeda as it really is, that is, corrected for any lag caused by the fact that the speed of light is finite, the most extreme points on the Galaxy would only need to be adjusted by about a 10,000th of the width of any image. In this case, less than a pixel. So, it&#39;s not a big deal. But it&#39;s not a nothing deal. It&#39;s real. In fact, everything we look at is, in some way, distorted by the fact that the speed of light is finite. Your own feet are about 5 to 6 light nano seconds away from your eyes, which means when you look at your feet you are seeing where they were 5 to 6 nano seconds ago. 5 to 6 nanoseconds in the past.<br><br>Of course, a delay that brief is pretty much undetectable but it is calculate-able. If it makes you feel a little sad to know that even with the sharpest mind or the best instruments, appearances still depend on where you are. That optical phenomena insure appearances are always relative(?) Don&#39;t feel bad. We call the people closest to us our relatives.<br><br>We&#39;re really just a family, a big family of reference frames that, like a family, don&#39;t always agree but do have plenty of cool things to look at.<br><br>I&#39;d like to thank my editor, Guy, for help with the rolling shutter effect in this video. And I&#39;d like to thank you, because, as always thanks for reading.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Oh, here&#39;s something cool. I will be at YouTube Fan Fest with HP in India very very soon.

Canon, Nikon, and to some extent Sony all suffer from this problem, not only because their sensors are large and dense, but also because the bus between their sensor and their image processor. <br><br>For the uninitiated, a BUS, in computing terms, is nothing more than the thing between two components that pushes data between the two components. Some components will have multiple busses to transmit data in parallel(though that rarely works all that well, and in most cases, isn&#39;t used anymore), some will have multiple busses used to transmit to and from different parts of the same component, but at the end of the day, the best way to think about it is that it&#39;s the connection between two things. Not quite as rudimentary as just being a cable, a bus is an actual controller of data moving from point A to point B, for the most part. In fact, you interact with one specific type of one every day, I&#39;m willing to bet. A bus that&#39;s universal, and passes data effectively in a single line, one bit at a time, or in a Serial pattern. A Universal, Serial bus. Or, for short, USB.<br><br>Now that we have a firm understanding of the bus between components, we have to take a closer look at the internals of your average digital camera. Typically, your sensor will be pulling data from the incoming light the whole time it is exposed, but your image processor will only be receiving the data it is given by the bus. Because it&#39;s a bit-by-bit transfer, if the bus is too slow, or it runs into an issue wherein the image processor does not have the available bandwidth to pull and push data fast enough, we can start to run into issues. Now, you can see this happening every day on your smartphone, or your computer, if you try to watch a streaming video, but your connection is too slow. For streaming video, you&#39;ll run into buffering issues, which might set you behind a few seconds at a time, but when you&#39;re processing realtime data, and you can&#39;t set things behind anymore, that gets... trickier.<br><br>Because capturing a moment as it happens is the core principal behind any digital camera worth its salt, the image sensor won&#39;t often bother to buffer the data(Some models do, but they&#39;re often substandard for reasons I&#39;ll get into later), and will simply transfer whatever it can, whenever it can, at the request of the image processor. So if the bus is too slow, or the processor hits peaks in its bandwidth of transfer speed, which in most cases is just fine handling a pretty broad amount of data at once unless conditions become less than ideal(again, more on that later), you can start to see distortion, and in some cases, even banding. <br><br>Let&#39;s start on that data buffering problem. Some cheaper cameras, usually Smartphone cameras, get around this problem by just... Turning down the data throughput. This variation of bit rate, appropriately referred to as Variable Bitrate, is, while functionally usable, inconsistent, and can result in some messy encoding issues, up to and including sound desync problems as re-encoding of the footage fails to take into account the timing between the sound and video. <br><br>But what about those ideal conditions? Processors of any kind work best when they&#39;re in their ideal thermal range, a range of temperatures wherein a processor won&#39;t start throwing errors, or running less and less efficiently in terms of thermal waste. Now you might think that an ASIC, or Application Specific Integrated Circuit, like you&#39;d find in a calculator or a camera, wouldn&#39;t have trouble overheating, but that&#39;s where you&#39;d be wrong. Camera processors have to take in all of the data from the sensor, encode it on the fly, and store it on whatever the storage media happens to be, typically an SD card. In processing terms, that&#39;s a lot of work. They also have to take all that data from the sensor, in real time, and push it to whatever viewscreens you have set up, whether it be the camera&#39;s built in screen, or an external monitor, and overlay any necessary information on top of that. They&#39;re busy little processors, but shouldn&#39;t they know how not to overheat? Wouldn&#39;t that be something that&#39;s tested thoroughly? Well, not exactly.<br><br>See, Camera manufacturers are in the business of making Cameras. They&#39;re not necessarily in the business of making Computers, and while some of the engineering challenges can be similar, if you don&#39;t have specialists in processor design that have a lengthy understanding of each new process node and how it functionally differs from the ones that came before it, you can run into issues wherein a processor is designed, manufactured, and sold, but with a lot more flaws. In fact, Camera manufacturers can actually run into issues just based on the level of fault tolerance they allow for in their system processors, and will often accept bins (a reference to slight variations in speed and heat handling) that are along a much broader scale of acceptability than a manufacturer of something like a Desktop processor. When you buy a desktop, you can generally guarantee that two 3.0GHz processors, as labelled, from the same manufacturer, same part number, all that, should be functionally identical, but with the broader tolerances, two cameras can have totally different ideal processing speeds, which means that two cameras can generate very different heat profiles. But what does this mean for the quality of the data? Well, as processors heat up, they use more power, which can actually start to affect the camera&#39;s power budget, taking power from the sensor amplifier circuitry, the camera&#39;s built in screen, and even just running into not having enough power to run the processor itself at that rate. The result is a loss of exposure control, usually very slight, or banding appearing on the main screen, wherein you will see black bars start passing down the screen, or at the absolute worst, signal interruptions in the encoding process, wherein you will get video footage with stutters, stops, and in some cases, an absolute failure to properly encode the stream, resulting in a catastrophic loss of everything you&#39;ve just recorded.<br><br>Most image processors shouldn&#39;t run into heat issues TOO often, but companies like Canon and Nikon still cling to image processors built on nodes prone to heat issues anyway, so that&#39;s an issue all on its own. But when you add in that slower bus, regardless of the processor&#39;s power, you&#39;re gonna run into problems. Companies like Panasonic get around this problem by not only incorporating a faster bus, but by also incorporating a processor that can better delineate tasks, and can handle encoding bitrates WELL beyond what other cameras can(with the GH4 model being able to handle up to a 200Mbps, which, while it creates HUGE files, results in video that is Amazing for editors and keying experts), but also by keeping the sensor relatively small. <br><br>At the end of the day, the issue of tearing, or the rolling shutter, is one not of just technology, but of a failure to use it properly. Things that are marketable get improved(i.e. &quot;IT HAS MORE MEGAPIXELS!&quot;), but like a megamall or a gigantic condominium tower, if the infrastructure isn&#39;t improved to handle the increased flow, you&#39;re going to run into problems.", "comment_date": "2018-06-01T14:11:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marko R.", "comment_text": "Or is it", "comment_date": "2018-05-29T09:41:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caleb Hawn", "comment_text": "Wow!

There is a way to check, if it synchronised, but there is no way to know how much it would progress or drift between measurements of both sides. Therefore measuring such great speeds is beyond any human capabilities at the moment and will stay that way most probably forever, as there will be no safe way to ever prove that there was no drift between time-sources at the time of measurement and the was no drift of speed of data (time) transmission or light did not get any faster or slower on the way.<br>technically measurement of speed of light is impossible with any reasonable accuracy.<br>I can for instance say that when I would hop on bus it is moving faster then 0mph and slower then 30mph, but without any precise measurement of time and environment through which bus is moving I cannot estimate bus speed with any better accuracy.

I wonder if (hopefully when) we start building large structures in space how large they could be?<br><br>The Halo game series comes to mind. There are space stations that are up to a few hundred miles in length. That&#39;s pretty massive.<br><br>But then there are the Halo rings which, if memory serves, are a few thousand kilometers in diameter and much longer in circumference.<br><br>And then there are shield worlds, which I guess would be about the diameter of the rings, but are actual spheres filled with matter.<br><br>And the there&#39;s the Ark, which I think is the largest object in the series. At the center it manufactures the Halo rings, but it extends out far beyond them. If I had to guess I&#39;d say it&#39;s maybe the size of one of the gas giants in our solar system. Maybe Neptune or something, not Jupiter.

According to Einstein&#39;s relativity theory, due to time dilation, from the reference frame of the travelling object, when you travel at the speed of light you arrive instantaneously at your destination. This is only true if you are travelling at exactly the speed of light. From the outside observer&#39;s point of view, the traveller would be travelling at the speed of light, but the traveller&#39;s observation would be that he is travelling at infinite speed. Another effect is that the traveller would be quashed to zero length in the direction he is travelling.<br><br>- edit - OK, after watching a second time I realise you said &quot;relativistic effects aside&quot;.

However, a telescope sees it better because it has a larger light-collecting aperture than our eyes and can make a time exposure. Hubble sees it better yet because in addition to an ordinary telescope&#39;s advantages, it is also outside the bulk of Earth&#39;s light-scattering and -distorting atmosphere. But what does the Andromeda galaxy look like to an unaided human eye from space? Have any astronauts or cosmonauts ever described it?
