It happened when I was dating online, a man I didn&#39;t know I swiped on seemed interested in me and we talked a lot. I could see from his pictures that there was a sense of purposelessness. Why? Because he was not Saved. He didn&#39;t believe in God either. Later on, another picture of his face, and I could see his whole spirit like a map, and there was a point of sharp light in his face like a star. It was the only indication there, an emotion of great sadness. I could see it deep and slightly covered by a haze, like it happened long ago, but that was it. There were no details of why the sadness was there, only that he had it and was still carrying it with him but he pushed it aside. I build up the courage to tell him what I saw. I ask him why hes sad, thinking that might be a better way to start. He is stubborn though. He says he hasn&#39;t been sad in a long time. He asks me if I&#39;m looking through a crystal ball at him and I say no because witchcraft is evil.

What she or Michael didn\u2019t say is the risks involved with AI, my boy Elon knows what I\u2019m talking about.  Nor did they say the current trade offs we experience now compared to even a few hundred years ago with tech being so involved.  In fact I Mc it were possible I would challenge that the average mans sense of purpose now vs 200 or 300 years ago is far less today than then.   Given all the tech we have that seems a bit strange... or does it.  And the further we allow AI into our lives,  I bet the less purpose we feel.  Almost like machines themselves.  Right now our Tech, machine and AI experience or simply guided versions, not necessarily interwoven ones.  So yeah I think it would be stupid to try and whether possible or not take human qualities away from humans.  Giving sense of purpose and importance and all time high.  More people on depression medicine and suicide at an even higher rate is not what we need.

All of this makes the actual substance feel way more inauthentic than it should, like you had to shoot it a bunch of times over. Luckily Michael is a great personality and can still carry the show on his shoulders. But it would be so much better if you used the tools you had to focus on the story and not try to mimic all those other shows. Use the production value to enhance the kind of content Michael is best at instead of putting him into a format you think will sell.", "comment_date": "2020-04-22T02:10:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DEADisBEAUTIFUL", "comment_text": "So, basically....we\u2019re watching Eternal Sunshine For The Spotless Mind in real life?", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T05:25:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saleh Al J", "comment_text": "Did you notice how Michael mirrors the body language of everyone he talks to?", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T05:25:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GUPTA The Beans", "comment_text": "Ya", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T05:04:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mia", "comment_text": "all of these MRI scans is gonna get michael in trouble", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T19:17:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Dada", "comment_text": "Vsuace made a YouTube channel called how to basic", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T13:56:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lamo Flamo", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgbeGFYluEA&amp;t=14m09s\">14:09</a> I need to do one of these because I don&#39;t see anything when I dream so that I can really know if I&#39;m actually dreaming about something or not", "comment_date": "2020-04-19T04:09:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JD_Kreeper", "comment_text": "I had a dream that I uploaded my dream to photoshop by using photoshop in the secondary dream then waking up still dreaming and going into photoshop on my computer and the dream was there as a video.", "comment_date": "2020-04-19T01:12:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Everydaypanda08", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s go home state or oregon", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T20:36:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexandra Delliou", "comment_text": "2020: 1735", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T16:37:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "liam tyler", "comment_text": "Tripping on shrooms and this shot is crazy", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T12:05:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chase H", "comment_text": "This show will give you an existential crisis", "comment_date": "2020-04-18T06:09:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mega Raph", "comment_text": "This is similar to the Crocodile Episode in Black Mirror.", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T14:16:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "doomer", "comment_text": "this could be used as a compulsory test after a certain number of years and the database could be used when they commit crimes to look at how, when and if they committed it. fucking scary", "comment_date": "2020-04-16T10:06:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "doomer", "comment_text": "imagine if companies put this tech into be headsets.", "comment_date": "2020-04-16T10:04:17Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "BreezyBri", "comment_text": "I was like, huh I like the idea of trying to record and reconstruct our dreams.<br>Then I thought...<br>New Noology Network!?!?!?", "comment_date": "2020-04-16T04:47:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mintaka mothkind", "comment_text": "&quot;So follow your dreams... and as soon as you can, show them to me.&quot; God I love Michael", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T19:58:35Z", "likes_count": 235}, {"comment_by": "Shin Chou", "comment_text": "Hmm so I have to know ALL about someone\u2019s personality just to know what they did, would do, or will do.... but... what if said person is.... bipolar?", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T11:49:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xrayrep", "comment_text": "The following article explains\u00a0how one researcher (Karl Pribram) believes that our consciousness and our memories are stored in our brain.

Most machine learning functions do this by having a whole bunch of inputs with their correct outputs (referred to as a dataset), and then having a computer run the machine learning algorithm on the data to &quot;discover&quot; f.<br><br>Getting more technical: Because of the nature of what they&#39;re doing in this episode, you can reverse engineer what their machine learning algorithm must have looked like. Since they&#39;re dealing with mapping fMRI to facial imagery, you can pretty much guarantee they&#39;re using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network. This type of machine learning model is also suggested by the fact that they needed to send Michael away &quot;process&quot; the images (or in other words, train their network on the 400-some-odd random &quot;non-celebrity&quot; fMRI to face pairs, and then feed in the 10 fMRI scans that should map to celebrities to see how it holds up in testing). And, judging by the fidelity of the output images, their working with a model that&#39;s been pretrained for facial image generation. It suggests that they might have taken the generative half of a trained Generative Adversarial Network and appended it to a Convolutional Neural Net that maps fMRI down to something like a 128-dimensional vector for the generative half to decode back into a face.<br><br>What does that say to me? It says that this is impressive, carefully considered work, but that it probably needs more time to refine, and probably needs more training instances to build confidence in their model (like they say in the episode, it could be michael&#39;s imperfect memory, or it could be the machine). I&#39;d be interested to see if their results improve when training on data from multiple people&#39;s fMRI sessions together, in part because it&#39;d mean a more robust training dataset, but honestly more because having a model like this improve its performance under those conditions would heavily suggest that brain functioning between individuals is largely consistent, if not nearly identical.", "comment_date": "2019-10-22T00:50:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Surr3al", "comment_text": "Ha suck it you guys paid while we waited and got it for free.

We are coming to a split decision as to whether who is &quot;correct&quot; and are hoping that you may be able to apply a solid scientific standard to identify which is fact; or who is &quot;more&quot; correct.<br><br><br>The question presented was, &quot;Given our earth, and referencing a satellite locked into a geostationary orbit, how long does it take for the satellite to complete one revolution around the earth?&quot;<br><br><br>We have come to two points of conclusion:<br><br><br>1. That a satellite is in an orbit around the earth, regardless of whether it is a geostationary or not. It develops that orbit by creating a motion path that &quot;encircles&quot; the earth and therefore follows the rules for a geosynchronous orbit time which equates to one sidereal day(approx 23hr 56min 4sec) to complete a revolution around the earth. This argument is further supported by thinking of the satellite orbit based on the center mass point of the earth being a &quot;single point&quot; in space as the reference and that the satellite orbits that center mass point(point in space not in motion).<br>This argument is countered with the logic that in order for the geostationary satellite to complete a revolution, its &quot;stationary&quot; position would have to be forgone and either the satellite itself must accelerate or decelerate in relation to the referenced point(earth) in order to complete its revolution; or vice-versa(earth accelerates/decelerates its rotation).<br>2. Since we are using the earth as the reference point, that the &quot;Geostationary&quot; orbit locks the &quot;0 degree&quot; reference point with the satellite to the ground point and degree reference on earth and as such, a geostationary satellite cannot complete one revolution around earth.<br>This argument is countered changing the point of view of the observer. If an observer is external to both the earth and it&#39;s geostationary satellite, it appears that the satellite will rotate around the earth(not accounting the earth&#39;s rotation)<br><br><br>Please help, does a geostationary satellite complete a revolution around the earth? If so, how often?<br><br><br>In the case that you make a video and\u00a0If you can prove that a geostationary satellite does not\u00a0make a revolution around the Earth, please say in your video, &quot;Curtis Longoria, you owe 1st Squad Pizza&quot; at some point towards the end.", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T10:25:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Jefferson", "comment_text": "????", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T09:04:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Smith", "comment_text": "makes you wonder if he may have just fed his subconscious imaging that may be used (by his subc..) later in life if he experiences Vision Loss Hallucinations in old age.

I think this needs more awareness as it is organic brain damage to the fetus when the mother is drinking and/or doing drugs while pregnant. Do people with FAS have split personalities? Do they really forget everything and all the details and events in their past specifically positive happy times? Do they ever feel guilt and shame later on in life for their actions that have not been normal and heartless like? What is the best way for them to control their wanting to be wanted by everyone as there is no cure for this syndrome? Do they feel regret on how they hurt their loved ones? What choices they make differ from those who have been fortunate to not have been exposed to this?What should one expect their life to be like when they don&#39;t seem to care or want emotional help from their family? How can they find happiness if they have these disconnects? How can one hope to have a successful happy relationship with them when they seem to struggle with commitment and choice making and cannot be alone for any period of time?
