He seems like a great kid, I just feel that autism may be misconstrued as just being ADHD in modern diagnoses.  I feel as if there is a stigma towards autism (in this context, its diagnosis), there&#39;s a bias in which practitioners would rather claim a child has ADHD rather than the more &quot;serious&quot; identification of autism.  Autism, to me, is a condition which I have a familiar relationship with- especially the negative connotation which parallels the diagnoses.  ADHD is a condition which can, and typically does, require a lesser load of therapeutic treatment- a deficiency which is supplemented by newer pharmaceuticals such as vyvanse and adderall.  I am completely unqualified to speak upon the effects of such drugs on a developing mind, and can therefore not speak on their effects, but the topic concerns me.  I worry about children being misdiagnosed, as having ADHD rather than their true condition which strips the child of receiving the personal treatment of which they are entitled to.  <br><br>Love your work Vsauce.", "comment_date": "2022-07-25T06:40:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Socko", "comment_text": "Sounds like the dog may have been a wonderful actor.

Granted I am now in remission after 4 years and once I crossed over the 12 months die date it didn&#39;t make it that much easier be of the pain but also they had given me medication to turn my mind off which I hated because it changed me and it also made me not able to talk which is not something you really want to happen when you feel you have a few months to a year to live. Before I had even known my cancer was gone I was ok if I died. You can say it could have been with my level of pain and how much cancer I had which was a crap ton. I had cancer from the top of my head to both my knees in every bone and so many tumors on my ovaries, endometrial lining that had eaten through the wall so I had a lot of cancer. I had to have many surgeries before even getting radiation like on my hip. I had to get a partial hip replacement and to think just 6 months prior to this I was running 6 to 10 miles a day. My one ovary was bleeding internally so my iron crashed to 2.6 and my hair and nails were falling out and off. I didn&#39;t eat for a month and my stomach wasn&#39;t growling because my body had shut down to bare minimum to try to save my vital organs. I was having seizures and one stroke because of my iron levels. I faught two months in the bed and bath tub because I was alone and lived a few hours from family and for a while I thought it was my autoimmune diseases because I have 5 at that time and by the time it got so bad I was going in and out of consciousness. I guess the pain for me after so long made it easier for me to accept my death along with the burden of knowing my mom was getting up in age and I didn&#39;t want her to spend her life taking care of me because I got to the point I was in the bed all day and night and it took every once I had to get up and shower for Dr&#39;s appt. My body was so tired. I was tired but for some reason I lived and not with a lot of treatments either and I know so many no longer believe in God but I surely do.

The decision I made [l will make] always feels like the &quot;the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back&quot;.

Last but not least, would you try to learn things if you didnt have death as a motivator? yes, obviously. What the fuck else are you going to do with eternity? I learn things because I fear boredom, death doesnt scare me because it goes black, the problem of life is suddenly not my problem anymore. Boredom scares me though, so obviously im going to do something with that time.", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T13:29:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "air fish boy", "comment_text": "Thanks for sploding my brain!!!!", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T10:35:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yung Speed", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t wanna say anything but i fell asleep on a Minecraft video and woke up to this...", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T08:32:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roy Kale", "comment_text": "You call this a marathon <br>I watched ALL of them in a week", "comment_date": "2021-02-17T16:17:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Madkirk74", "comment_text": "The person reveiwing episode 3 is blinking quite a lot...", "comment_date": "2021-02-17T07:28:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Some Random Person", "comment_text": "They mentioned season 4 but wondering why it\u2019s not out yet?", "comment_date": "2021-02-17T06:07:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Whitney", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=47m03s\">47:03</a> hell yeah fuck 45", "comment_date": "2021-02-17T05:08:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sh4dowveil", "comment_text": "2021, still free<br><br>Love that", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T04:52:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Merrill Phoenix", "comment_text": "Bloody marvellous!", "comment_date": "2021-02-15T00:52:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AMaDDeR HaTTeR", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=59m30s\">59:30</a> AaaaaaMazing!!!

It has happened to me. Also it is quite sad that I would never be able to heal with this method. I have a constant pain on my intestine, like having a big ball pushing outwards my body. I have visited doctors, surgeons, specialists. No one had done something to fix that pain, I have learned to live with it now after years of trying to fix it. Constant freaking pain. Suicide lurked my mind because of it. But once u went to a doctor that told me it was something that could be easily cured and gave me some pills. Magically after a few minutes the pain went away. It turns out that my anxiety was collecting itself in my instestine and the belief that I had a medicine that would work was enough to make be feel better. Of course the pain came back weeks later.<br><br>The only solution I figured out, because none of the dozens of specialists that I consulted thought about this, was to take anxiety medicine. And like magic again, the pain went away and this time for a longer time. As long as I take the medicine I don&#39;t have the pain. Turns out my anxiety collects itself in my intestine and jaw. So, for those with &quot;IBS&quot; I suggest you go to a psychiatrist. No f&#39;ing gastrologist Will never EVER think on referring you to a psychiatrist unless you present clear signs of mental issues. They will most likely give you medicine for the pain, but won&#39;t fix the root of the problem. This was mind blowing to me. How doctors don&#39;t view medicine or health with a holistic approach, thinking outside their field. I also saw this with dentists. They don&#39;t understand how patients don&#39;t brush their teeth when it is pretty obvious is because of depression. And because doctors are just humans that know medicine there are lots of dumb dumbs that can&#39;t connect 1 with 2. Some might but majority won&#39;t. It was infuriating to hear them say &quot;we don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong with you, you don&#39;t show any damage in the images&quot;. So frustrating.

And then those same ultrawealthy people talk about how they\u2019re \u201crisk takers\u201d and \u201cbold\u201d for being able to partake in medical experiments that they literally only have access to by being wealthy, as if EVERYONE wouldn\u2019t try to extend their life if it didn\u2019t cost $80,000+ to try; as if there was no problem with living in a country where the wealthy can pay to put their minds in robot bodies or freeze themselves to one day be cured of death while the average person not only will never have access to those extreme life extending processes but probably struggles to keep a roof over their head and food in their bellies.

Sure, patients who have already (unknowingly) benefitted from a placebo treatment may still retain that benefit after the deception is revealed. <br><br>However, I believe you are intentionally misleading the viewer. You seem to be implying that if an adult (who understood the placebo effect) is given a placebo, and BEFORE TAKING IT they are told in no uncertain terms that what they were being given was a gelatin capsule filled with dextrose, that they would still experience the placebo effect. This is patently false. At that point you might as well tell an adult that, if you just think about it hard enough and really focus, all humans can levitate. Of course it&#39;s not going to work! The man won&#39;t start levitating, and he won&#39;t even attempt to, because despite your garb and equipment, it flies in the face of everything they&#39;ve learned up until then. The only reason the placebo effect can continue even once revealed, is that it started before it was revealed. It takes a lot more fuel to start an engine compared to keeping it running...if you don&#39;t have that momentum in the first place, you&#39;ll need to call AAA...I can&#39;t figure out what the psychological equivalent of triple-A is, but I stand by the metaphor as a whole.<br><br>Regarding your honesty with the children: While in the strictest, most litigious definition of the word you did not lie to them, you also went way, far out of your way to <b>ensure</b> that the kids stood a 0% chance of understanding the literal meaning of your words, and a 100% chance of misinterpreting them or just straight up not understanding at all.<br><br>Let me put this out there: I do not care a single bit if researchers lie to kids (or adults) for psychological research, especially if it&#39;s not going to harm them in any way and there is a lot to gain as you clearly showed. But transparency when publishing the study is key. Do not pretend like there was no deception in play. Do not assert multiple times in the Abstract or Video Essay that you &quot;never lied to the kids&quot;, it just makes you sound insecure or guilty. Whether or not you explicitly told them that it was &quot;all in their mind&quot;, you absolutely implied that it wasn&#39;t. You said that &quot;the brain was going to heal itself&quot;, but you also said &quot;you have to get into this machine&quot; and &quot;this treatment will MAKE your brain heal itself&quot;. To a child, this is no different than any other treatment they might get at a legitimate hospital. My point is, you went so far out of your way to replicate the setting, equipment, and gravity of the situation, that no child could reasonably be expected to believe that it was all essentially just a good-natured prank, no matter WHAT you told them! You could have said &quot;Your parents are HIV+, and this is all a joke propped up to support YT Premium, now get in the f**king tube&quot; and they would have had the same results because they don&#39;t know what any of that verbal communication means, so they are relying solely on the non-verbal communication you all gave off (not much other than a notion of seriousness) and then fallen back on contextual clues and situational awareness; That&#39;s the problem. Even though they didn&#39;t understand the concepts that you technically made a minor attempt to convey, they didn&#39;t ask questions because they filled in the gaps with contextual clues from their environment. They&#39;ve all been to hospitals and doctor&#39;s offices, and it&#39;s completely normal for what they hear there to not make sense to them, but they trust their parents and the medical professionals. So for them, it&#39;s just another trip to the doctor&#39;s. Being surprised a placebo worked for them is like being surprised when celebrities get mad at Ashton Kutcher for &quot;punking&quot; them on MTV. Both are the intended effect. You cannot, I repeat, CANNOT extrapolate this data to any demographic other than small children. In my opinion, this study has both poor construct validity as well as non-existent external validity. <br><br>Even worse is your colleague&#39;s assertion that &quot;the more people are aware of the placebo effect, the more people can take advantage of it&quot; is so contradictory I feel as though I&#39;ve just dipped a Chinese dumpling into soy MILK. Research has proven that for most individuals, there HAS to be some degree of ambiguity for the placebo to work. I&#39;m drug trials, for example, both the experimental and control groups are not told which group their in, but they all ARE told that there is a <b>possibility</b> that they are in the experimental group. Without this deceit early on, the placebo effect falls flat. If the placebo effect works as you and your colleagues imply that it does, how come pharmaceutical trials require that the control group has absolutely no idea of knowing which group it is in? (Obviously they do this for the experimental/active group too, but in the end many of those patients will realize they took a drug, regardless of what they were told, unless the trial is for an expensive new extended release baby aspirin or something.<br><br>I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with temporarily lying to people of any age who are being studied for medical gain, as long as no harm can come to them that they weren&#39;t informed of, but lying about NOT LYING is not OK, regardless of ethics. It&#39;s a matter of data integrity.

My reaction to you choosing death, makes me want you to extend your life (if this is about what minds should be preserved to benefit the future of humanity).  I realize that the outcomes are almost certainly inconsequential whether or not you choose life extension or final death, but my thought experiment is about what kinds of minds do I want to persist given the option.  So many great minds are lost to us prematurely, giving me the feeling that their contribution to humanity was cut short.  Ultimately, though, my opinion of life extension leans toward &quot;those who think they should live longer, are probably not the kind of people who will better humanity with an extended life, given the exclusive nature of cryo preservation.&quot;  Does this bother me?  No; this is only a thought experiment about our current technologies and the almost certainly inconsequential impact on the future state of humanity by the extremely small number of participants who have invested in cryo preservation.  I think it is far more likely that those who are currently preserved will be future experiments in cellular resuscitation that will fail but will further the science.  Lastly, I think that the research into preservation and resuscitation is hugely important, so in a way, even if I don&#39;t care for those who choose cryo preservation in hopes of extending their lives, spending the money to do so helps, I think, contribute to the further research and benefits the progress of science.", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T09:51:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "K Tha Slasha The Hedgehog Official", "comment_text": "micheal commenting about a certain videogame at around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=2h32m19s\">2:32:19</a> made me kekw irl", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T09:34:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beastly Bongos", "comment_text": "They say you blink a lot when you&#39;re lying....<br>Daniel at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=2h21m15s\">2:21:15</a> -\ud83d\udc40\u2796\u2796\ud83d\udc40\u2796\u2796\ud83d\udc40\u2796\u2796\ud83d\udc40", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T08:41:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ud835\ude71\ud835\ude83-\ud835\udffd\ud835\udff8\ud835\udffd\ud835\udffa", "comment_text": "Go to sleep", "comment_date": "2020-09-06T05:29:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gromph Baenre", "comment_text": "now that the vail is lifted your placebo therapy wont work on anybody who hast whatched this<br>this wasnt so smart i would say", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T22:54:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ya boi skinny penis", "comment_text": "I meann i got adhd and i dont throw tantrums dammit nathen you&#39;re giving our sped asses a bad name", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T03:37:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UnrealThing", "comment_text": "No.. no i did not watch 3 hours of vsauce", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T19:57:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arpita singh", "comment_text": "Michael makes a video about watching Michael&#39;s videos:<br>3 million people : INTERESTING!", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T18:25:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vlogging with Chen", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t know how I got here I went to sleep and woke up on this", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T16:51:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JamMonsterFR&FO", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=5m10s\">5:10</a> for me at least the color blue makes me think of sadness and yellow makes me feel calm + green for happy :) luv ur stuff vsus- vsauce", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T09:25:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChefDoge293", "comment_text": ".", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T04:47:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kyle sundell", "comment_text": "Wheres isolation?", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T01:54:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kyrocide", "comment_text": "The main thing i love is the abstract music i hear in the background", "comment_date": "2020-09-03T23:51:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ExplosiveDude", "comment_text": "This episode is actually a placebo to convince us all that placebos are real and they do work.<br><br><br><br><br>Boom<br>Mindblown", "comment_date": "2020-09-03T22:35:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rue O'Leary Walker", "comment_text": "Anyone who tries to justify being awful to another person for &quot;character building&quot; needs to see and understand the first study with the kids.

And the outcomes were telling - no significant result. Why get caught up on the positive given the result - accept it was bad and go hard on it. If we didn&#39;t physicists would still be going on about the luminiferous aether. The experiment showed more about the experimenters than the subjects, which vindicates the focus on ethics of the whole situation. However, every time it skirted close to scratching a good critique, the guest just wandered into, &#39;oh that could really make people think&#39;. Sure, so would a baking soda and vinegar experiment. These topics and voyeur social experiments are great for hits, but we should be honest that&#39;s the priority - there doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be anything &#39;added&#39; to the audience, that&#39;s a coincidence and depends on a lot including us. Even in the broad scheme of social science, forcing the tm outcome around those psychologists assumptions didn&#39;t feel &#39;scientific&#39; and infotainment, as much as we all love it, is actually filling a gap in education funding/facilitation and standing in for actual participatory/citizen science.", "comment_date": "2020-07-15T10:25:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Kaplan", "comment_text": "Remember when ADHD was like this rare disease that if you had it was shocking?

I play pretty regularly, and I could be wrong, but I feel like I&#39;d be HORRIBLE at a maze like that the first time through.  Odds are I&#39;d do somewhat better than the non-gamer version of me the first time through since anytime I play a new game I&#39;m adopting on-the-fly to all sorts of new situations.<br><br><br>I&#39;m wondering about the improvement though.  By experiencing the maze and then playing video games in close proximity to that it seems like it&#39;d be hard NOT to come up with new/better strategies with a seemingly reasonable maze like this.  Maybe it&#39;s just something as simple as the level of motivation someone has to do well on it?  Someone who doesn&#39;t really play games probably doesn&#39;t have much use for putting time/thought into a maze since you wouldn&#39;t see it as something fun/interesting to figure out.  If you&#39;re playing games though, you tend to have quite a bit of motivation to get better and come up with better ways to solve problems a game might throw at you, ESPECIALLY in a game like League of Legends where it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;re letting down teammates who clearly have significant emotional investment into the game.<br><br><br>Super interesting stuff as always though.  It was awesome to hear about the second phase of the suggestion/placebo experiment that didn&#39;t make the episode, and hearing about the other children who had positive results was very encouraging.  I&#39;d love to see many more of these.  Single segments of certain episodes would be fascinating to hear more about as well if there isn&#39;t as much to add to other parts of the episode.  I&#39;m primarily thinking about &quot;The Box&quot; segment from &quot;The Freedom of Choice&quot; episode in Season 1.

If that individual has had some chronic and/or neurodegenerative disease (like Parkinson&#39;s / Alzheimer&#39;s / other forms of dementia), their healthspan dramatically decreases over time. While much research has gone into mitigating the effects of, or even preventing, those diseases, we are quite far from that point. This creates a burden on those who (medically) care for that individual as well as the general healthcare system as a whole. Currently, we spend a great deal of money on merely extending the lives of those whose life quality has greatly declined, for moral, ethical, and/or emotional reasons (which I won&#39;t elaborate on or criticize). However, if we were to extend the average lifespan to, say, 120 without increasing the life quality up to about 80 or 90, we would be looking at 20+ years of caring for someone who may or may not be able to reciprocate or even appreciate what is being done.

How that established gene pools are disappearing and that how many of the new citizens have large families just because it&#39;s what they are used to and how this props up statistics on the population.<br>  Then only to find that they also follow suit and fail to keep up their own gene pool after a generation or two. Thus bringing forth the inevitable constant introduction of new citizens into 1st world countries.<br>  I believe the main reason this happens is that big corp need people to make profit and the most profit to be made is in 1st world countries but they/we have allowed a system that is basically a huge recycling bin of genetics. Basically on average, anyone who is integrated into 1st world societies have subscribed to a slow motion suicide of the gene pool.<br>  People are no longer having 2.5 kids on average unless for example you are a new citizen with a large family.<br>Much of the reason for this is that we are too busy in education and too busy with work, women are also more career driven these days and it&#39;s so important to them that they have less time to be mothers.<br>  So, going by the law of nature 1st world is a huge fail as we fail to reproduce, we take the most motivated people from 3rd world and developing world countries and then eventually their genetics are\u00a0eradicated by way of embracing a system that fails to support the survival of it&#39;s own gene pool, it can only uphold it&#39;s population by means of introduction of new inhabitants.\u00a0<br>  The people who are the most powerful ie. the banks and the corps are also the ones who mould our laws and inevitably they decide how many people can enter a country officially (basically to keep their system balanced so that they may continue to profit).<br>  I believe we need to wake up the 1st world people to this fact as people do not see that they are destroying themselves or rather destroying the future of their genetics. I find that if you mention this to established 1st world citizens they believe they are doing a good thing by keeping the population down or that they just are not aware that a small family or no family is an issue. Basically they are accepting failure (in the law of nature) but at the same time thinking they are successful in their lives as they have a job a place to live money to spend etc.<br>  When approached on the subject many people resort to denial and sometimes show signs of anger or frustration but generally they don&#39;t accept the point that i am making here.<br>   It&#39;s sad to see the entire 1st world fail in nature (on average). Especially when we should be the ones who are best educated to be able to solve the worlds problems. People are not interested in the fix or perhaps unable to apply the fix due to the restrictions or limitations that such a society appears to impose on them. Or perhaps it&#39;s all brainwashing and people don&#39;t have enough power any more now that the most powerful people in the world are so well established that new generations find it difficult to compete with them thus making any new mode of thought virtually impossible to imply. Perhaps the best way is to vito every system or business that is too big and everything that keeps us away from success in nature? But how do you motivate entire populations to find some sort of solution when they are not even the slightest bit interested and how does one survive amongst such a generation of what i can only call fools even if i am one of them?!<br>  One strange way of looking at it is that people have always dreamed of eternal life or a longer life. The closest we could get to this might be cloning and programming but for now the closest thing we have to cloning is having children.

But the clear discrepancy indeliberation time cannot be directly ascribed to an effect of TMT. I believe I see a flaw in your experimental group approach, that could be cleared up with a third control group.\r<br>\r<br>Preliminary signalling of cues about mortality, and filling out questionaires put the subjects into a contemplative mind frame. However, their extended time of deliberation in the quiz may be simply due to being set up by any attention focusing prequel, and not to any specific subject matter. Their critical faculties have been warmed up, and in fact the researchers seem to be eliciting this state of mind by requiring a contemplated considered, detailed response to essay questions. This appears to have been transferred to the meting out justice session, as they carried over the general tone of expectations.\r<br>\r<br>The control group walked in cold and blasted their replies down quickly, perhaps due to the casual lack of preliminary mental warm-ups that filling out a questionaire demands. In fact they are told &quot;no right or wrong answers&quot;, and to go with their &quot;gut level reactions&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=1h10m49s\">1:10:49</a>). Its suggestive that the control group getting right to the quiz, (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=1h10m11s\">1:10:11</a>) is reflected in their getting right quick to each answer (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=1h13m07s\">1:13:07</a>). Perhaps I&#39;m missing where the control group was put through a similarly demanding questionaire with similar expectation for marshaling their faculties of reason.(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=1h10m45s\">1:10:45</a>) Or conversely I missed when the experimental group were also told to go with their &quot;gut level reactions&quot;. (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=1h36m39s\">1:36:39</a>) Yet the identical script was differently contextualized.\r<br>\r<br>A third control group, could be treated in a similar prequel process, with different topics of contemplation, say perhaps,an essay question on &quot;life on other planets&quot;, or &quot;ethical treatment of animals&quot; et. al. Then measure the deliberation time before answering. Some topics MAY turn out to pre-prime a state of deliberation more than others. Still, some if not all the effect may arise from the mere presence of such a preliminary session.

Yeah. I get what you are saying, I mean it does kinda feel self indulgent, to be able to say here I am, I&#39;m so special. I get to be one of the few that survived in the future. And I guess my counter argument to that is whenever, with any new technology, it&#39;s always initially only limited to a subset of people who are risk takers, early adopters, who have the financial means to do it, who have the sort of foresight or sort of long term perspective to want to do that in the first place. And just because that&#39;s a small set of the population doesn&#39;t mean that those people shouldn&#39;t do it.  In fact, on the contrary, that&#39;s the first step to making it accessible to everyone.&quot;<br><br>Michael further narrows his point she keeps avoiding, finally arriving with crazy lady Elizabeth, an EXECUTIVE PRODUCER of the damn show, concluding &quot;let&#39;s just see how it goes&quot; ...when danger to those in the future is made a possibility...<br><br>*Perhaps the first round...we just roll them into a volcano....?

Long story short, all of the subjects laugh, some irrepressibly, and when asked most of them said that it was actually pretty funny, even after knowing that it was an experiment. That has always left me thinking, and I theorized that the reason for this is because although Micheal meant for his joke to be nothing more than just random arrangement of words, the overall sentence did have relevant syntax and semantics of that of a joke. By that I mean it did make complete cohesive sense, &quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask&quot;, this is funny because it did make sense that the security officer at the air port might not ask the giraffe because its so tall.

I remember being annoyed at my dream&#39;s false advertising. Like &#39;this is X game&#39; No its not, its a game with themes similar to x but structure and everything is different. Style is similar, themes aren&#39;t identical. So That may reconfirm the theory that its to preserve old memories(from showing contrast to the old memories and the dreams). It clearly at least was responsible for differentiation. I remember some dreams back when I was 3 or 4, because as a twin I would socialize more with my brother and looked forward to discussing dreams and if some realistic dreams actually happened irl or not. I had a dream journal of about 550 dreams, most of which are just keywords to trigger a memory. Because the problem with detailing dreams too much is that they become their own stories as you read them and form new memories then it triggers those memories, not the dreams memories. So I would write concise titles like &#39;rescue girl with pizza from crocodile&#39;. But then the issue with reviewing those dreams, is when I would get new dreams, they would be similarly brief. So what you want is like, dream folders, or files. You title the files appropriately, then in the files you put everything you can remember from your latest recall from reading the title. Then you compare it to your old recall. But there are psychological problems with that method probably, but this method should increase dream detail recall. <br><br><br>Also when I was a kid I would lucid dream sometimes. On days with no school, and no saturday morning cartoons, I would sleep in repeatedly, dwelling on the good feelings that will happen when I lucid dream (evidence of the task positive network In my opinion). Then I would lucid dream, wake, sleep, lucid dream shorter, wake sleep, lucid dream shorter, wake fail to sleep, stay up, (give or take). <br><br><br>And I used to get night terrors and stuff, so my (rather inconsistent parent with undiagnosed borderline personality disorder with thyroid conditions) mother taught me from the library relaxation and meditation techniques, or such, Maybe she learned it from a daycare thing some of it. But basically you tense all your muscles n slowly relax them, and if your muscles were exhausted enough sleeping would be easier and more relaxed. I would Force those muscles into exhaustion to get myself straight from being awake, into dreams. When I closed my eyes I would see stars zooming by slow but accelerating, but if I moved my eyes at all, I would have to start all over again. Its like gazing past the stars in the middle of my vision, do not get distracted and look at any individual star that goes by. Then when I succeed, I had entered a void, and could start entering a dream from there. <br><br><br>I lost that ability once I was about 10, couldn&#39;t fully say why. Haven&#39;t given it a proper attempt after though.<br><br><br>I have an idea though.  Why not do hypnosis or suggestion or placebo etc, to get a person to be Half asleep and dreaming(literally half of their brain including 1 eye shut, sleeping, half of them). Then the other side can report on it with their eye typing(that eye sensor tech to type for the quadriplegics) or blinking for yes/no. The mind is a flexible organ. Maybe it could cause sleep issues for those individuals in the future if something like that were done, so you would need suggestions preventing that before, and suggestions ceasing the changes after. This idea is obviously experimental, and may fail entirely, but it&#39;d be quite interesting. I think there needs to be more extensive placebo stuff for season 4 before you consider something like this, just to see how far you can take people&#39;s suggestions to get an idea on if it&#39;d work or not.<br><br><br>Also the self-hypnosis community I partook in(well, mostly audio files, rare group chatroom stuff, some individual stuff (some of the members did tulpamancy)). Well, visualization helps alot. Also affirmations like &#39;x is true&#39;. I&#39;m not sure about tone or subtle techniques, you guys got that down pretty well in that Ritual experiment part of one of those episodes anyways. Perhaps you could explain to them what to expect, then the TPN makes it true, and its like the TPN is visualizing not the DMN. I have a theory on TPN and DMN. TPN is for religious states, its why their models of reality are centered on reaffirming reality as they expect it to be. The DMN is more critical and reconsiders with new information. I only learned about this because of a MAPs video about shrooms iirc, well thats how I formed an understanding on TPN vs DMN, I didn&#39;t double check to see if I was right or not, I just inferred it I may be wrong (but I sorta doubt it lol).", "comment_date": "2019-10-16T23:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cassie lee", "comment_text": "god i really loved this especially with the added post-commentary", "comment_date": "2019-10-16T23:34:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kaltzifer of fire", "comment_text": "Watched Michael&#39;s reaction on Mind Field episodes video... wait.", "comment_date": "2019-10-16T23:29:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kris Does Art", "comment_text": "Wow, only 6 midrolls in a 3 hour movie?

I think all the potential dowsides and issues of it can be solved as long as we are alive and have countless great minds working together to make everyone&#39;s lives better... So, you know. <br>But I don&#39;t think it necessary should conflict with acceptance of death. It&#39;s statistically more likely to happen over time, adjusted by how able we&#39;d be to survive certain threats in the future. Even from the purely physical standpoint, at least how we understand it, complete abolition of death seems unlikely. <br><br>One of the good ideas I heard somewhere is that it isn&#39;t a radical life extension or immortality that should we focus on but an autonomy. A choice, how much we want to give a life. Will we ever be ready to live? Would there ever be enough accomplishment and fulfillment in a single lifetime for everyone? Is it that bad, to take things slow? Aren&#39;t we kind of insane, for thinking we can healthily prioritize our leisure, our loved ones, our survival and our legacy, like a mad joggler and everything is on fire?..<br><br>The question about old people having old ideas I think should very much rely on the studies of why old people hold on more to their beliefs, than accept new ones. Is it age? Is it their experience of age and shifting world? Is it in their brain? <br><br>The thing we tend to forget about technologies is that they advance simultaneously with other technologies and often depend on them as well.<br><br>If humanity have inbuilt survival strategies and istincts that are incompatible or insufficient for extremely long-lasting people, why should we keep them? It&#39;s not a toolbox, where you pick and choose the mind components, but it may be slow proccess of controlled evolution, changing the trends in our thinking ever so slightly, but not only in new people, but in old as well. And that&#39;s just one idea. It might not work that way. But there might be slmething else we don&#39;t know about yet.<br><br>Concerning personal choice of treating death, I guess I&#39;m not an activist to do more, than just sharing my thoughts. I don&#39;t see much in terms of controlling my life&#39;s expected timeframe now, I don&#39;t have money to afford experimental, unproven treatments (a gamble with a technology is still a gamble, it may pay off for somebody, but it probably won&#39;t be me). I accept, that my death is more likely to end me, than a radical life extension procedure being developed during my lifetime. I believe, that woundrous things are possible even when we don&#39;t think of them as such, but I don&#39;t put my money on magical thinking and miracles. <br><br>And as a consequence of nihilism, I don&#39;t really care, what happens to me after I&#39;m dead. That last ounces of legal control, that I might get from signing a piece of a paper, a legal ghost, that says other how to or not to grieve or the correct ways of honoring my wishes. I find neither solace nor strength in that. I don&#39;t care what happens to my body once &quot;I&quot; stop being a part of it. I believe I am part of this universe when I am alive as I am dead, it&#39;s just that there would be less information, afterwards, so I can&#39;t give atoms of my body to the universe... because I never had them to begin with. I am made of stuff, that is this universe. I am run by laws, that this universe is governed by. I am <b>&quot;of this universe&quot;.</b> Alive or dead. It might not mean anything, certainly it doesn&#39;t bring me to a conclusion of me possessing some kind of significance or special wisdom, but it affects how I <i>can&#39;t</i> treat death.", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T14:00:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trevor Philips", "comment_text": "stick your beard hair on your head with glue", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T14:00:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brennen P", "comment_text": "He leaked season 4?!?!", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T13:53:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "auretta meier", "comment_text": "oh wow", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T13:49:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Kane", "comment_text": "So Kratos from &#39;God of War&#39; was based on a real-life figure, huh.", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T13:48:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray Gean", "comment_text": "God.

I guess there are lots of promising research projects out there competing for the same funds, though.<br><br>I would LOVE to see you get hypnotized, Michael! You&#39;ve done so many disturbing things for Mind Field already that I was nodding when you said you&#39;ve done worse stuff. Indeed! I&#39;ve been hypnotized before, and it was actually very pleasant and enjoyable for me. <br><br>I think the biggest factor for success is wanting to be hypnotized. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard of people entering a &quot;flow state&quot; before where they get caught up in what they&#39;re doing and they lose sense of time and are absorbed in whatever activity they&#39;re engaged in; you may have discussed it before on your channel. I would say entering into a hypnotic state felt like achieving a flow state for me. It was pleasurable, and I was relaxed. I don&#39;t really remember being hypnotized, but I remember how I felt going into it and coming out of it, and it felt like entering and coming out of flow. <br><br>I wish you could get Derren Brown to hypnotize you, but 1) he&#39;s performing on Broadway right now and is a busy magician/mentalist, and 2) he says he&#39;s not as interested in hypnosis these days as when he was younger (although he was great at it and probably still is). So many of your episodes on Mind Field cover the same psychological topics Brown has covered in his shows over the years, I&#39;ve wondered if you or members of your writing team or crew are fans of his. I often watch Mind Field and think, oh Derren Brown covered this idea in this show of his. X)<br><br>Keith Barry is another magician who does a lot of hypnosis actively these days; he currently has a show on TV where he hypnotizes people. I think either of these guys could hypnotize you pretty easily if you wanted it to happen (but I realize you might feel more comfortable going to a therapist instead of a magician to get hypnotized). I&#39;d be thrilled to get hypnotized by Derren Brown; I&#39;ve loved his work for years, but you should go for whatever approach appeals to you. I do hope you try it.

However, when they were discussing this, all the points she brings up in defense of it to Michael&#39;s questions just came off really arrogant and self centered. I know that she explained it wasnt like that, but with Michael prodding her, all the rebuttals were sorta disturbing. But really i dont blame her for choosing that, and I dont really see much wrong with it. I am just a bit creeped out by some of the advancements and how they are being implemented. With the cyro sleeps and things like genetic modifications, the means and justifications all come off really creepy and dystopian. Maybe it is just from seeing worst case scenarios like in black mirror or etika or other syfy media, but I have to say, even as a proponent of medicine and tech, there is a very blurry line that I feel needs to be respected. But again, don&#39;t hold it against anyone who is on the other side of the argument and I am open minded, just a bit reluctant and suspicious.<br><br>Edit: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0cakXwiZ8s&amp;t=2h11m43s\">2:11:43</a> THIS. This reponse is the sort of thing that comes off discerning to me. Its almost like hearing a cult member convincing an outsider. NOT saying these guys are cults or bad people, I am just explaining my vibes and feelings and honestly that kinda reaction is what I experienced. No offense to her, she is doing great work with the show and it was a great episode and she brings valuable discussions and viewpoints and I am not trying to dismiss or minimize her points. I just did not notice discussion of this in the comments. Mostly just &quot;omg free mindfield&quot; (which I&#39;m very happy about) but i wanted more discussions about the episode.", "comment_date": "2019-10-14T19:17:22Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "The One", "comment_text": "Recently I haven&#39;t been doing so well.

To me, it seems like the episodes don&#39;t trust me to be interested and pay attention like they expect me to not be able to follow along properly so they constantly try to repeat things to make sure I don&#39;t miss essentials and try to emotionally trap my attention. In short, it seems to take me for a fool.<br> I can tell that a lot of the actual research is far above that but the format itself, in my opinion, cheapens the high-quality research to something boring I feel like I have seen hundreds of times before. <br>I know this is a narrative pushed by many people and I don&#39;t think I am projecting this bias here but to me, this really feels like youtube tries desperately to be TV even tho they already have something much better. The biggest mistake of TV, in my opinion, is that they don&#39;t take their audience seriously and mind field seems to make the exact same mistake.", "comment_date": "2019-10-14T16:54:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phil Sim", "comment_text": "If funding&#39;s such an issue, why not crowdfund it, get VSauce to advertise it", "comment_date": "2019-10-14T16:54:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Primacia", "comment_text": "Michael calls 3 episodes a marathon... what am I doing with my life?", "comment_date": "2019-10-14T16:54:25Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "\u0421\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u043e\u0436\u0443\u0445\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "I read &quot;I watch 3 episodes of mind field &quot; and I remembered that today I watched 3-5 episodes of s1.
