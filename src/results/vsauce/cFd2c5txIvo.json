This explains that if you use a triangle to create three circles, they would have four lines that meet certain criteria. This makes sense because circles have infinite sides and are closer to squares than a triangle as if you draw a line through a circle, you get the perpendicular angle at the other side if you start with one. This is also true with rectangles but not with triangles, so using a circle to explain triangle sides is flawed. Triangles have three sides, with a total of 180\u00b0 inside angles. But congrats on trying to get an award for the guy that needed to say he accomplished something by using the properties of circles to redefine triangles, even though all we see is how the circles interact to create a new four sided shape that cannot exist because to do so would mean chopping of the end point and thus altering all the circles which are defined by said points, thus is unstable and can&#39;t exist.", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T16:43:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Teletubbies Harvest", "comment_text": "the little dance", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T16:40:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Math adventures", "comment_text": "Stupid that\u2019s not part of the triangle", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T16:36:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "starfoxnes", "comment_text": "I think this is reaching too much \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T11:30:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sofie Van den Braembussche", "comment_text": "Triangles have two sides.

Here&#39;s what I understand so far.<br>There are 3 circles used to measure the properties of a triangle, or actually, they just happen to line up in this particular triangle in this particular way. The first 2 are the incircle and the outer circle, which are simple to understand. The other circle is called the 9 point circle, and it is connected on 9 different points in this triangle&#39;s measurements. Those points are: the 3 points that are half the distance to the triangle&#39;s orthocenter, the 3 points that are at the &quot;foot&quot; of each of it&#39;s altitudes, and the 3 midpoints of each side, all of those 9 points line up on that third circle. That third circle, as far as I can tell, is unique to this specific triangle&#39;s measurements, and allows for a fourth &quot;side&quot; which is basically just a line that is a perfect mimic of the other sides in this triangle. It falls on the same points, and holds all the same measurements. That is why it is considered a POSSIBLE side, but it technically isn&#39;t a side because it isn&#39;t connected and enclosed in the triangle, also because it simply would make the triangle a different shape if it WERE connected because triangles don&#39;t have more than 3 sides, and if the triangle DID have 4 sides, it wouldn&#39;t work with all of those measurements, therefore the triangle wouldn&#39;t even have that fourth side, so it is an endless loop. But the fourth side can never be a side because it only passes through the triangle in a way that holds the same properties as the other 3 except for the fact that it is passing through rather than creating a shape that isn&#39;t just a line on its own. That is the only property it doesn&#39;t share, as far as I understand.<br>To explain what the 9 points are that make that 9 point circle: The orthocenter is the point where the 3 altitudes that stem from each of the vertices to the opposite side, all of those lines meet in that middle. Altitude means the height, it&#39;s like where all the heights of the triangle point to. There are more than one altitudes because you can flip the triangle around and call it the &quot;height.&quot; So basically, on each of those lines that meet in the orthocenter, you divide those lines in half to get your first 3 points on the 9 point circle. The next 3 points are at the &quot;foot&quot; of each altitude, which is just the place on the side where the vertices land to make the full &quot;height&quot; or altitude. It is like, when you connect the vertices to their opposite sides, that point in the middle of the triangle&#39;s side where the line lands, is the foot because it&#39;s the ending spot. And then the final 3 points for that triangle come from the 3 midpoints of each side of the triangle which is basically just half of each side. I&#39;m not sure if a 9 point circle can be made for every type of triangle or what it is used for.", "comment_date": "2021-09-15T20:55:18Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "BlueMoonFoxi", "comment_text": "So we just calling triangles squares now?", "comment_date": "2021-09-15T20:34:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JH Kock", "comment_text": "Does the line follow the other points of the nine-point circle as well?

Jesus said, <br>&quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery <br>already with her in his heart.&quot; Ever looked with lust?

How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or <br>guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That&#39;s not<br> God&#39;s will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son <br>to take your punishment: &quot;God commended His love toward us, in that, <br>while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Jesus then rose from the<br> dead and defeated death.

There were 15 video uploads in the last year, 12 of those being less than 60 seconds in length.  Only 3 videos were traditional, long-form, informative Vsauce content, while the rest of the content didn&#39;t have much information, sometimes literally none.  7 out of these 15 uploads were solely ads for products he&#39;s selling,  with the most recent 8 uploads on the channel containing 6 of those ads and the other two videos just being short clips about farts. <br> <br>\r<br>\r<br>Comparatively, eight years ago, there were 41 videos in the year.  During that year, 40 of them were the traditional long-form videos, ranging between 5 - 16 minutes each, none of them being advertisements, each packed with research and clever/fascinating information and explanation.  The only outlier was a 5 minute video from his &quot;L\u00dcT&quot; series, which reviews and examines weird and interesting things found on the internet.  It was like an entire different channel than today&#39;s Vsauce.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>I get he&#39;s probably busy with new projects that are much more profitable for him and he&#39;s already made enough money that he never <b>has</b> to make another video, but it&#39;s just sad.  Vsauce was known for being one of the best channels on the platform, which inspired people to learn, presenting concepts in science, math, language, philosophy, etc., in an intuitive and creative fashion.  Now the channel has been operating as a social media marketing vehicle, with a focus of selling products and keeping engagement up with short clips during the absence of real content.  <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>I don&#39;t blame Michael for it, he has to make money for his family, just like everyone.  As his focus turns to business ventures, he probably doesn&#39;t have the time to make new content.  Michael has been doing it a long time too, I&#39;m guessing he doesn&#39;t have the same passion for, and isn&#39;t excited about creating content that encourages viewers to learn.  Still, he has provided YouTube with so much top-tier content, and doesn&#39;t owe us anything.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours.
