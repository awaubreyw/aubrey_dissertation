However the one thing that I am getting is a strong sense of nostalgia, I mean a really big wave of it!

I.e. those ten dollars will have clear value for you, regardless what you believe (assuming you don&#39;t want to go to jail). <br><br><br><br>This shows you where the value of fiat money comes from - taxes. The Federal Government doesn&#39;t tax in order to get the money to spend (that is ridiculous - they create USD). Taxes are what give value to their otherwise valueless pieces of paper. <br><br><br><br>And the banks of virtually no country use the Fractional Reserve system. That&#39;s one of the biggest misconceptions of our age. When someone takes out a loan, there is a simple asset exchange. The bank gives you bank credit (bank money, credit to your deposit account) in exchange for your IOU - which is a valuable asset as long as you have good credit. They don&#39;t need any reserves of anything in order to do this. It is simply an exchange of IOUs. <br><br><br><br>Finally you make a big deal about what would happen if Canada invaded us -  as if that is supposed to show that commodity money is somehow better than fiat money.

You try to answer questions that blow people&#39;s mind, or make us think about something in a new light. I have been thinking about this my entire life. I&#39;m 24 now and I remember being 8 years old and asking my Elementary School teacher this question. She basically just said &quot;God.&quot; Which I wasn&#39;t satisfied with. I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t believe in God, or that there is no God. I don&#39;t even want to cross that bridge. I just think there&#39;s a Scientific answer out there somewhere. And youre the ONLY PERSON I trust to answer this. Mainly because I love your channel and videos. But also because I feel like you&#39;ll actually take it seriously and give me an answer that you really thought about. SO PLEASE. Answer this for me...<br><br>Is everyone on Earth related to one another? Like if you go back far enough, wouldn&#39;t we all be under one HUGE Family Tree? Like what&#39;s the furthest back you can trace someone&#39;s lineage or bloodline? Where does it begin? What was before that? It has to start somewhere. Like you know when you see a Family Tree and at the top there&#39;s two people who kicked things off. They had children, and then those children had children, and then those children had children, etc. etc. If we were graphing, the two people who started everything would have the coordinates (0,0). So If you go back far enough, who&#39;s the (0,0) to us all? There has to be someone. It&#39;s not like one day there was nothing and the next day we just appeared. At some point in time something happened that snowballed into what we all are today. What was that something? If we&#39;re sticking with Family Tree&#39;s and Women giving Birth being the cause of our growth as a species. Who were the first two people who had the first baby? Did that Baby get with their Brother or Sister and then they had a baby? And so on and so forth. And if that&#39;s the case, then those very first two people. How did they get here? Who put them here? Or what? <b>X-Files Theme Song starts playing</b> - LMFAO!<br><br>- But no, I&#39;m being 100% serious right now. Is there anyways you can at least try your best to answer this? Because this is just one question that scares me. The other one is, what happens when we die? Like is there really a Heaven and Hell? If there is, are we really there forever? Like I can&#39;t even comprehend forever. Like I&#39;m living now and I&#39;m living my life knowing that one day I will die.Just like us all. But that&#39;s just it, I know that one day there is going to be an end. There&#39;s something coming that will change everything. But if you&#39;re in Heaven or Hell forever, then there is no end. There is nothing that will eventually happen that will change everything. That&#39;s just how thins are now, forever. Like FOREVER?????? <br><br>- If that&#39;s not the case and there is no Heaven or Hell, then what happens to us then? Is it like a computer and we just shut off? Are we no longer a conscious being? And is that forever? How will I even comprehend forever if I have no conscious? You can&#39;t even experience space or time without a conscious. Is it just pitch black? OMG my head hurts os bad right now. I&#39;m done. I can&#39;t keep thinking about any of this. I&#39;m legit scared.

Also I&#39;m not a money expert but i&#39;ve never really agreed with the idea that the bank is &#39;creating money&#39; by giving out a loan.. Because that person who took out the loan typically has to pay that money back... The money used to pay back that loaned money basically has to be money printed/at least earned.. Money isn&#39;t really born by a bank giving out a loan... Same when someone writes a check money still has to be transferred at some point.. Reflecting on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2tKg3E53DM&amp;t=5m10s\">5:10</a> section on video. Also want to watch the mind field series but hate the idea of youtube red. I study history etc and honestly the banking crisis issues I feel are most certainly related to this ideal I typed out here. And interest makes everything even more complicated because its almost like you have to pay back money that &#39;doesn&#39;t exist&#39; because nothing was &#39;created&#39;. The interest is typically how the banks profit. So instead of 5 coins the banks will get 6 or 10 coins because of interest. Plus there are a few people who together own more money together then entire civilizations/multiple large towns put together. So point being money is sooooo tough to get even-though its sooo &#39;fake&#39; and that what is being calculated as whats circulating, isn&#39;t circulating as much as what is calculated.. Not trying to &#39;be cheap&#39; or fight against bitcoin/printing money.

The value of certain commodities such as precious metals and gemstones absolutely can be (and often are) controlled through a notion called artificial scarcity, wherein the bulk of the supply of certain commodities is sequestered from public circulation to artificially inflate its value. For example, the reason diamonds are so expensive (aside from ridiculous jewelry store markups,) is not because they are rare (they really aren&#39;t,) but because diamond mining corporations such as the DeBeers Group have a huge portion of the world&#39;s diamonds locked away in secure vaults, essentially controlling the world&#39;s diamond supply and making them artificially rare. If DeBeers and other prominent diamond mining groups were to suddenly unleash the entire world&#39;s diamond supply to the market, even the Hope Diamond, a 45.52 carat rock valued at $350 million dollars, would become as valuable as a glass replica.", "comment_date": "2015-06-25T18:30:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cory Sane", "comment_text": "Haha...invading Canadians.", "comment_date": "2015-06-25T08:03:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sonicgail", "comment_text": "give me an example of something that becomes true if we believe in it and I can actually believe it... probably", "comment_date": "2015-06-24T21:57:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alan", "comment_text": "Gold is fiat money, it has literally no use for a common human, the only reason it has value is because society THINKS it has value.", "comment_date": "2015-06-24T21:12:40Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Evil Morgan freeman", "comment_text": "You are in the U.S. Why do you talk in pounds", "comment_date": "2015-06-24T20:45:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke Molwitz", "comment_text": "Children with cash, minors with money, youth with Yen, little ones with loot, tykes with treasure, babies with bucks!", "comment_date": "2015-06-24T13:22:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LibertyLikes", "comment_text": "But if most people in the invaded US still accept US dollars for goods and services even thought the Canadians decreed it useless, the dollar is still valuable ", "comment_date": "2015-06-21T23:16:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sabstil", "comment_text": "Kan i have that 20 euro", "comment_date": "2015-06-21T13:25:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aexur", "comment_text": "Well all this would be true if there actually was gold to represent the money in the American economy but........yeah........

With the power of human imagination, there isn&#39;t really any reason why it wouldn&#39;t make god real through believing.
