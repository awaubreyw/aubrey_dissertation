Humans are always more tuned towards the negative rather than the positive, and happiness is often just a feeling of contentment and not the bright and joyful bliss that some may imagine. The negative things bright out stronger emotions in us and more focused attention, we notice negative things more than the positive ones in life in general. This is because humans who are more aware of negative things tend to survive. We are just wired that way. The rest of the reasons are just supporting. The reason I enjoy horror movies is not because I feel &quot;tougher&quot; for sitting through them, but because they create a fight or flight response, and when the movie is over and brings you closure, the relaxation you feel as the result of the movie resolution is quite profound. Of course, you&#39;re still haunted by the imagery, but your nerves are more calm than before watching the movie. It&#39;s the best stress relief aside from a vacation. Besides, I think the thrill you feel during a suspenseful movie but remain unhurt releases some sort of pleasure hormone, similar to when you ride a roller coaster. It&#39;s a lucky survivor&#39;s joy I guess.

My talk will be about curiosity, and the idea came thanks to you and this magnificent video, and so, I just wanted to ask if it would be okay to take the example of the psychologist Carney Landis and his experiment, and that cool mnemonic of yours: S.C.R.E.A.M. It would be awesome, but of course I need your consent\ud83d\ude01.Oh and also, just in case you\u2019re curious about this conference, everyone\u2019s talk (we\u2019ll be approximatively 10) will be filmed while held on stage, and published on our school\u2019s website (chateaubriand in Rome) and maybe the AEFE\u2019s official site as well. If you want to see mine I\u2019m MIARA Ghali from tenth grade, or, as french systems call it: seconde or 2nd\ud83e\udd17. Anyways, it\u2019ll be the 13th April. Thanks for your awesome videos!

Or at least be told anywhere on the internet. Why not here?<br>Reason for doing so:<br>I was prepared for that, what was coming towards me - by watching NSFL content...<br><br>Here it goes, had been writing like an full hour... Damn...<br><br>I can remember really good that ONE DAY in 2016 - while not really knowing anything else from that year (nothing special)...<br>I had a 1-day-vacation for doing all my training proof for my employer, I really know, it was a Wednesday when suddenly my pager (right word for it??) went of, telling me translated something like &quot;Car accident - 2 Vehicles (Lorry) frontally Crashed - 2 Injured - First Responder&quot;...<br>I really not knew, that this...<br>Would change my entire life...<br>My mates and I had to be the first and - for a decent amount of time - the ONLY paramedic team at this accident, with the knowing that professional help (I do this as a hobby, in my freetime, I am a volunteer - and I like it!) will arrive in a minimum of about 10 - 15 minutes. Meaning, WE have to do our very very best, to maybe allow the be rescued within the &quot;golden hour&quot;...<br><br>This was my very first car accident where I have been as a paramedic. I was really soooo glad to know how a...<br>Choped human leg... A arm... A... Smashed head...<br>...looks like...<br><br>Cause..:<br><br>Well...<br><br>Just look by yourself, this link will get you to the pictures, made by the newspaper. You wont see, what I saw, but you could then understand the following sentence...<br><br>The concrete mixer driver - I think I have seen him before in our town, not sure, just was glad, I dont knew him...<br>But... His head... Look at the picture, the mixers driver-cell... Look where the driver has been sitting. Just imagine the moment, where the lorry fully dented the mixer... His head was... Well, not that nice... <br><br>And the lorry driver... HE was still ALIVE, the mixer driver was already silent, but HE made at least some noise. No help screams or something, it was just pure noise, we hadn&#39;t been moving fast, we had been teleporting - thats how I remember it, but yeah, we were running as hell... <br>His lag was... Not choped off, but like... Ripped in parts??<br>When the firefighters had arrived with their technical vehicle, they began to secure the lorry. The loading was laying with its full weight on the really thin GFK (fiberglass reinforced plastic) case of the lorrys driver-cell. It could have been breaking every moment, with me and my mates standing right under it, trying to somehow spot the injuries and do a first contact to this guy.<br><br>As we were sure that the lorry is pretty much secured and the co-driver door was opend - his fckin kneecap fall down. Right in front of me, letting me spot - who guessed it, him and his injuries...<br><br>#####<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23tl\">#tl</a>;dr#####<br>Have been here as paramedic - first car accident I have been to - lorry hit concret mixer frontally.<br><br>Link:<br><a href=\"https://www.nonstopnews.de/galerie/22655\">https://www.nonstopnews.de/galerie/22655</a><br><br>I will never forget this smell of hydraulic oil and diesel, leaking out of the wracks. I have seen some really heavy hydraulic pistons which had to flew really far - in opposite direction as they were moving before.<br>That told me, what forces there really were playing at this accident...<br>Everything just, because a stupid tire exploded and the lorry driver could not hold the lorry on his lane.<br>Imagine this, there could also have been ME driving on right this street, its about less than 1km away from my home and I drive this part of the street nearly every day...<br>I really dont believe in him but...<br>Thank god it wasnt me, anyone I knew or even worse, any of my family members. I did everything I could do for him, I gave 250% more, than I normally would be able to do.<br>But sadly it took too long to get him out of the wrack and he had too bad injuries inside of him.<br>His lungs filled up with blood and that was the end of this existence. <br>His wife came the last two years to this place, putting him new flowers on &quot;his place&quot;.<br><br><br>Sorry, but just needed to tell this someone...<br>Even if I knew how all the pain sounds like, all these possible wounds look like...<br><br>It is just not the same, as picking up someones kneecap and running like hell with oxygen in one hand, in the other a kneecap of someone who is pretty sure about to die.<br>Seeing him to... Try... Scratching in his face...<br>With a nearly fully broken and smashed and just destroyed arm, with just some fingers which look like fingers... FUCK!!<br><br>That made me really depressive for a while.<br><br>IT came even back after this happening.<br><br>My (ex-)girlfriend just made me be still alive now. And that is really awesome, even if my life is a whole horrortrip and I really hoped that it will end soon, I now am pretty much stable and can even think of what happend there again, without getting small tears in my eyes which will get even bigger the more I think of it.<br><br>Well, as I said, sorry for this comment. <br>If you did read this all till the end - thank you for not having Schadenfreude and just dont make jokes over this and me just because I have feelings too.<br>Im just a human and I am supposed to have feelings. Thanks. <br><br>Short note: <br>As this happend, I was only 18 years old, so... Really, dont make jokes over people who really want to end their live and or had been seeing bad things.

We want to understand lots of different things because we feel it makes us more. And yeah, I do think we&#39;re curious about how we&#39;re going to feel. I definitely feel that. That&#39;s the &quot;meaning&quot; part. I, um... Heads up, trigger warning here for a particularly gruesome suicide. You still here? Ok, here it is: my mother killed herself by setting herself on fire. I didn&#39;t have to look at the aftermath, but I chose to, because I thought... Well, I was morbidly curious. I did feel like I was taking a risk with my emotional well being, but I wanted to know. It&#39;s true that she&#39;d been catatonically depressed for a long time, and we&#39;d had kind of a strained relationship before that; if I hadn&#39;t already become somewhat detached by that point, I may very well have made a different decision.<br><br>And I also get the part about testing yourself. I watched a shock video wherein a politician named Bud Dwyer kills himself by shooting himself in the head during a news conference. I thought, I&#39;ve seen some shit, I&#39;ll be fine! ...I wasn&#39;t fine. I didn&#39;t have much of a reaction at first, but when I was watching other people&#39;s reaction videos... I could hear screaming from the original video in the background, and I started to feel sick. I tried to recover, but I couldn&#39;t, I was going to throw up. So I stood up to go to the bathroom, but on my way, I started to black out. I laid down on the floor before I passed out, but my vision still went completely black, and I got really hot and broke out in a cold sweat. That&#39;s the first and only time I&#39;ve ever experienced something like that. Up until that point, I really didn&#39;t have much of an emotional reaction to second-hand tragedy. That&#39;s sort of started to change more recently, but... It&#39;s interesting, when someone tells me bad news, like they broke up with their boyfriend or something, I usually don&#39;t feel bad emotionally, but I&#39;ll feel kind of a physical shock.

And its not that it has happened one or two times it happens every second. Due to that i have to always think negative so that the positive might happen. I searched on many search engines and visited many websites but mostly they say its a &quot;PSYCHIC&quot; problem. This thing is very annoying sometimes very frustrating and depressing.\u00a0 I believe there may be a scientific reason for all this stuff that is happening to me.

Entertainment happens when there is a change in emotion.When our mood changes or increases in either positive or negetive side, we get entertained.. when we are happy, we are entertained. But even when we are sad , we are entertained again. This explains why people watch emotional movies. Even fear is an emotion. When we get scared/disturbed, we are entertained. This is why many people like watching Horror movies...Talk about movies..most of the movies use this change in emotion to entertain their fans...You will never see a movie which is completely a happy story or a completely sad story.. you will see that the movies have dilemma, tragedy and triumph. The dilemma helps the tragedy to happen and the ending is mostly change of tragedy to triumph which entertain the fans.<br>You might have had the mood to just stay sad atleast one day...that is because even sadness gives us entertainment as mentioned before. For those who have a &#39;sad life&#39;. They just have as much of an entertaining life as a person with the same amount of &#39;happiness&#39; in his life.<br>If you are a poor person and if you get a simple car and smartphones and money out of nowhere, u will be very entertained. But offcourse, if u are already rich, even the best things cannot entertain u cause there is no a big change.<br>Entertainment also depends on Expectations, and Outcome.If you had expected less and the outcome was high, then you will be more entertained...this explains why a poor person will be more happy then a rich person if he gets those things out of no where...cause he never expected it. Same happens in movies, if the outcome is totally unexpected you get more entertained than you would&#39;ve if you were already expecting that.<br>So Mathematically ,<br><br>Entertainment = (Change in emotion)(Outcome) /(Expectations)", "comment_date": "2014-10-09T07:23:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gay fish", "comment_text": "Vscause, Y do we Darude???1?", "comment_date": "2014-10-09T07:23:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The Marsquatch", "comment_text": "", "comment_date": "2014-10-09T07:13:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyr Myrmidon", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t like scary and repulsive stuff<br>I&#39;m weak", "comment_date": "2014-10-09T07:13:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Inazuma TheRipper", "comment_text": "end song please", "comment_date": "2014-10-09T07:12:54Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Paul Foppele", "comment_text": "for who wants to know, the song at the end is\u00a0Conversation - Bob Bradley feat.

I thought that people only choose to do the wrong because they&#39;re told that they can&#39;t. As if they&#39;re doing it only to proves others wrong. Had they never been told that they couldn&#39;t, they never would of tried to do it in the first place. However there&#39;s this opposite conflicting idea that rules only exist because someone already did it. Like those warning on coffee cups that tell you the coffee is hot only exist because someone was stupid enough not to know that and burned themselves. Chainsaws have warnings not to use on genitals because apparently someone actually tried to use a chain saw on their genitals. To some people this sounds so stupid that they really don&#39;t feel like they had to be told the obvious but to others they are so stupid that they did need to be told the obvious. But did putting a warning do not use chain saw on genitals stop anyone else from doing it or was there a boomerang effect causing people to do it only because they were told not to?

I look to these sorts of offerings for continued learning in my older years.<br>After watching and self analyzing, I have to admit I was never born or conditioned to enjoy or seek the misfortune of others- I did not rubber neck car accidents and in fact would have no trouble keeping my eyes ahead- I did not want to see it. I never enjoyed horror movies, and I certainly know myself enough to know for sure I gain no satisfaction whatsoever in causing or seeing another living creature suffer- not even a little.<br>The only odd thing about what i notice in myself is that I do not seem to muster a fraction of the empathy for humans as I do for animals... especially domesticated. I carry guilt sometimes that my emotions will go awry so quickly over an animal suffering than a human. I have even gone so far as to imply that animals are truly innocent where humans are not- and we all know that is inherently fallacious reasoning.<br>Great topic, even if it makes me uncomfortable to dwell on it.
