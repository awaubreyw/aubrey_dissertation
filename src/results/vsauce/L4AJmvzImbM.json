The only thing you prove is that it&#39;s unlikely that you can do it. To prove something impossible you would have to do it in Infinity and never do it. But seeing as Infinity is infinity... Well, you would never stop. So yeah, saying something is impossible is really a stupid thing to do because no one has ever proven it is impossible.

I think that human intelligence will have decreased in a thousand years and will become a less knowledgeable and worse species. The theory behind this is that humans are starting to get more reliant on technology. The first ever innovation, fire, allowed human skulls to become thinner and grow bigger and better brains which allowed us to gain traits that no other species had ever gained on Earth. As time went on technology improved and helped us with our tasks, making our lives easier for us.<br><br>Then there became a point, in the late 20th century, where humans started to rely on technology to live with the rise of computers and the internet (e.g. money transaction relies heavily on networks and storage units). We have allowed computers to become so vital that no access to ICT for a modern and developed civilization for a prolonged period of time will spell disaster for everyone in that civilization.<br><br>Computers and machines\u00a0have taken over tasks that humans used to do which makes our lives easier but we gradually loose skills that were necessary to survive in an older world without machines. As time goes on, the need for these skills slowly fade away and there will be a generation that would never have any necessary\u00a0skills as they will not need to learn them.<br><br>A world where humans\u00a0rely entirely\u00a0on machines to do basic tasks and use our intelligence for us would mean that this future\u00a0generation would not need to use their brain.This lack of usage of intelligence would mean that there will be a point where humans will have a far lower intelligence than today.<br><br>Now imagine a catastrophe where the machines that this future generation relies on so desperately failed. What would happen to them? They would suffer and because they lack\u00a0basic skills they would not be able to survive for long\u00a0and possibly the human race could be extinct. Also, we would forget how the machine that we rely on works as we would take it for granted and therefore we wouldn&#39;t be able to repair it.<br><br>In the 1950s, if the machines that were needed failed and couldn&#39;t be repaired for a prolonged period of time we would have done fine (even though it would&#39;ve been a bit of a nuisance) because we weren&#39;t reliant on technology.

Any mammals would have likely been small redent sized creatures that digged DEEP and lived off of small things similar to what the birds ate. Any large reptiles or other large creatures that survived, only did so because they likely were dependent on there being water. i.e. komodo dragons, alligators, crocodiles, which depending the species were either more or less fantastic way back then. There were quite a lot of other large sea-based creatures that had survived, but their source of food was annihilated if they acquired anything on land, and many of the large oceanic reptiles still hunted on shorelines.<br><br>Another thing, dinosaurs pretty much for the most part stayed far away from both freezing and tropical places.

And if you have just one cell with a full set of chromosomes than you can clone it. Some of you may remember Dolly the sheep, they took the full set of chromosomes from a cell of the sheep and removed the half set within a egg gamete, placed the full set in the now empty gamete, then placed the egg back into a female sheep, the egg with a full set of chromosomes begins dividing exponentially and as a result the sheep gives birth to a clone. Much of this process is done in invitrofertilization for the purpose of surrogate moms and females with poor fertility. the only difference is that in invitrofertilization they take the dna from both parents instead of just one. so using this blueprint they could theoretically bring back any animal so long as they have its dna. In fact there has been legitamate discussions about rather or not to attempt to clone a willy mammoth and also a dodo bird.
