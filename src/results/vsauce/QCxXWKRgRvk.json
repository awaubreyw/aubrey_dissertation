Why settle for a 60cm radius satelite dish, and why use 5800 mirrors?\nIf you can do a bit of calculus, and have some woodshop and/or metalshop skills, you can make your own parable dish (with your own desirable focus point) with a bigger radius and just cover it in aluminum foil.\nFor every m^2 (9sqft) of dish, you get roughly1KW of power on a sunny day. That satelite dish couldn&#39;t give more than 1-1,5KW.
