Ironically meaning there is 2 answers to the dumb riddle. Paradox and Existence.<br>Lastly the butter fly paradox would be the only real paradox we could create in our own time line. Most importantly it would not need anything to be changed because the future as  we know it, is co-creation; this means even doing nothing changes quantum fluctuations while the macro verse generally ignores this any influence random actions can change are subject to change. To sum this up one could not send the winning lottery numbers back in time if the numbers are actually randomly generated. This is because the more time allowed between events the larger influence of  change. <br>This being said time travelers would never risk showing up in person because if it were possible we would simply un-create our selves and time would simply move forward no paradox. Or to be more precise we would have to blow up the universe as we know it to go back into the past which would simply  change  the likely hood of trying to blow up the universe to pointlessly go back into time.

Because as an observer.. I can watch you with my own eyeballs do it.. and for me time wouldnt change at all. Think about it.. what.. your gonna come back down to earth and encounter another version of yourself? No cause YOUR on a ship.. so by simply going back in time even 1 day is a paradox. A butterfly effect.. would ensue. Dont you think it would hurt all of a sudden going back in time? Your body would shrink as if you were becoming a kid again... or you stay exactly the same and come back to find another one of you but as a child.. what about the football game you threw the game winning touchdown pass.. that just didnt happen anymore? You would just be moving extremely fast... It would have 0 effect on time. because i can click my stopwatch and time how long it takes you to make your journey and watch you orbiting the earth. When you come back my clock is still going to be ticking.. but your saying you would never come back.. because how can you if your going back in time? Sorry but the answer to time travel has absolutely nothing to do with how fast your moving. The truth is time doesnt really exist.. days dont exist.. weeks dont exist. Its just something we developed as humans because were on a spinning planet that gives us &quot;night and day&quot; Technically there is no night.. there is just day. How would you keep track of what time it is if the earth wasnt spinning? sure we have atomic clocks.. but its still something we developed as humans. The earth could slow down to half the speed its at now.. and you wouldnt suddenly live longer.. or shorter.. you would just have longer days and longer nights. And have 0 effect on &quot;time&quot; Im watching you go around the earth at light speed.. time is still moving forward for me watching you do it.

As you approach the speed of light, time will slow down for you, meaning it will speed up for the rest of us. \u00a0If you travel away from the earth for 10 light years, at a speed that is close to the speed of light, then it would seem to you that you hadn&#39;t been traveling for very long at all. \u00a0If \u00a0you turn around and travel back, again at a speed that approaches the speed of light, then you would find upon returning that everyone other than you had aged 20 years during what seemed like a short amount of time for you&quot;.<br><br>so what you implied was, that moving lightspeed or purely just below light speed for 10 years would not seem like you had been traveling for very long at all. and you say that&#39;s because, TIME* would slow down for you the TRAVELER. and upon returning at those near light speeds, everyone would have aged and lived their 20 years, while the traveler only &quot;travelled for what felt like a short period of time.<br><br>now where im stuck is, the concept of a LIGHTYEAR. a measurement of time, and distance. a light year away means, on a traditional format of time that us humans use, if light moved at its\u00a0 lightspeed for a whole 365 days in a year. the light could be &quot;x&quot; amount of distance away. so\u00a0a lightyear is how far light could travel in just 1 year going at roughly 167 thousand miles per second!<br><br>so back to your statement of &quot;time feeling very short for the traveller after going 10 light years away from earth.&quot; if your in this flying\u00a0machine travelling space at near lightspeeds and you have an earth time clock in the ship\u00a0that still flows in its normal time.,\u00a0the people on earth\u00a0take\u00a0their next foot\u00a0step on earths surface\u00a0within a second time frame, while\u00a0your ship travelling through space would be roughly 167,000 miles away from earth..<br><br>soooo, what I don&#39;t understand still is how you say &quot;10 years of travelling at near light speed\u00a0will seem very small to you because you&#39;re moving so fast&quot; if you have the earth time clock with you, contrary to how fast your going and &quot;slowing the process of time with your speed&quot; you still are claiming to go THE DISTANCE OF &quot;10\u00a0LIGHT YEARS\u00a0away from the earth. soo no matter how fast you go, your still going to a destination that is going to take you 10 years, if its 10 light years away. therefore, you should still feel as if you just travelled for 10 years lol..<br><br>pretty much where im all caught up is just the part where you said it would seem like a small time for the person travelling, and at the end of the travels, everyone would have aged those 20 years, but you the traveler, feel as if you&#39;ve only been gone for a day or maybe a week etc.<br><br>nothing is being clarified to as how this near lightspeed travel is being achieved.<br><br>\u00a0its not like say superman, where when hes going way beyond light speed, even at those speeds, he still processes and takes in the world around him as he moves that fast, so rather than seeing nothing but streaks of light and blurriness while he travels, he moves lightspeeds and has the mental capability to process everything he passes which then makes a tricky conversation because hes moving so fast and time is at a standstill, but he can still view everything at a traditional human speed within his lightspeed although everything else is frozen in time\u00a0. with this case and your theory you posted. this is not superman so the topic becomes less tricky, and if its just a traveller within a ship that blasts at ridiculous near lightspeeds, the traveller wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t process those speeds and making it more scientifically confusing. the traveller would essentially feel and see time as normal as anyone on earth, except hes moving at near light speed, and the people on earth are at a walkers pace.<br><br><br>now lastly if a lightyear travel\u00a0starts at 1 and goes all the way to 2 for example. 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2.\u00a0 and your ship distorts space and time because that&#39;s somehow the only way to have a ship go near lightspeed,( different from the propulsion theory making you boom that fast)\u00a0and creates a wrinkle in the fabrics of space and time making 1and 2 side by side like this\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,2\u00a0\u00a0 thenn the distance you travelled would feel short because its like you just folded yourself to the other destination a light year away. doing that same procedure to return to earth would then appear as if you weren&#39;t gone for long, because it didn&#39;t actually take you what felt like a year even though it was. if that makes sense..<br><br>im tired as hell and cant believe I just typed out all this, without even looking it over im just gonna press send incase it erases, thus making me rage myself to a horrid shitty sleep.", "comment_date": "2014-11-29T19:17:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eugene Kim", "comment_text": "the answer is the letter e", "comment_date": "2014-11-29T13:23:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lunyx Appocalypse", "comment_text": "Tardis", "comment_date": "2014-11-29T04:08:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "420smoker", "comment_text": "i believe the answer to the riddle is gravity!", "comment_date": "2014-11-29T01:02:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dylan takach", "comment_text": "If I had a time machine, I&#39;d probably do nothing with it.<br>", "comment_date": "2014-11-27T04:10:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheEnglish muffin", "comment_text": "the anser to the riddle is darkness or antimatter", "comment_date": "2014-11-25T17:14:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SonicXRage", "comment_text": "If I had a time machine, I&#39;d screw the elections in 2008.

Once you understand &quot;time&quot; as our subjective perception of the constant passage of events, you can immediately understand how ridiculous it is to try and &quot;travel&quot; to a set of events that no longer exists, because it was a fleeting snapshot in a passage of events that happened once and is now gone. You obviously can&#39;t also travel forward in time... because those events haven&#39;t happened yet. The only form of &quot;time travel&quot; that could be possible is time viewing... which would only be possible through an infinite understanding of causal relationships.
