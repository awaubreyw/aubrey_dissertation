What does that mean? Well, it means that it&#39;s possible that you have farted on the moon. Molecules in our atmosphere are always bumping into each other. A collision can slow a molecule down, but it can also speed a molecule up. Astronomer James Jeans showed that a collision or a series of collisions can even accelerate a molecule in our atmosphere to earth&#39;s escape velocity. Under the right conditions, such a molecule can leave earth forever to be free, to roam the solar system. This process is called Jeans escape. It&#39;s why we found oxygen from earth on the moon. It and related mechanisms are why earth loses 3 kilograms of hydrogen every single second. And a human fart can be 50% hydrogen.

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T03:02:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samuray", "comment_text": "Didn&#39;t  know my butthole was a mini nasa", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T03:02:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lego All Around", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVaAP4mh08&amp;t=0m10s\">0:10</a> When you hear this music que, you know your about to get a little smarter! \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T03:00:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jean-Christian C\u00f4t\u00e9", "comment_text": "Are you telling me the moon might smell like shit?", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:58:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kmi", "comment_text": "God damn the moon must smell so bad then", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:48:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Dickson[Luto's potential surname shareholder]", "comment_text": "Am i the only one who thought the scientist looks like Chris Broad from Abroad in Japan?", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:46:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Robles", "comment_text": "Im waiting for part 5", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mouchlas G", "comment_text": "this is how memes are made kids", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:36:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lola", "comment_text": "So space is full of farts? \ud83e\udd14 that&#39;s interesting!", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:27:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "chuckufarly5", "comment_text": "i never heard anyone call it &quot;bake an air muffin&quot; before... and in the end, i just learned a new way to say i passed some gas lol", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:26:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Willis", "comment_text": "All I know is that Diarrhea is hereditary,  it Runs in your Jean&#39;s!!!", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:26:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Midwest Pyro614", "comment_text": "&quot;Shlosing&quot; came to mind when you I read &quot;Farts are limitless&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:19:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patty Rice", "comment_text": "fun fact- i happened to fart right when i<br>clicked on the video", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:17:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SsSploogeJ2", "comment_text": "Where are your fingers", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:09:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jay Peterson", "comment_text": "Devo was right.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:04:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Worldsmith", "comment_text": "HOW DO YOU EVEN DO THIS IN A SHORT?", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T02:03:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lil Igloo", "comment_text": "Everyone\u2019s growing a beard these days consciousness likes beards.

Hallelujah!!! But as impossible as this sounds, like so many of the true stories in scripture, our bibles have all been supernaturally changed by Satan in the last several years, right in our homes, in the fulfillment of prophecy. It&#39;s being done to prepare for the reign of the antichrist. All languages and all translations have been changed with black magic along with concordances, encyclopedias, dictionaries, history books, the ancient\u00a0 Hebrew, Greek, Latin and Aramaic manuscripts. Even the Dead Sea Scrolls have been changed!</b>\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 <b>I&#39;m 68, was saved when I was 10, and have read only the exact same copy of the King James bible my church gave me in 1961. (This does not mean I was a King James onlyist)\u00a0 I had memorized many scriptures from it through the years. Then in 2014 I started seeing changes in it that I couldn&#39;t explain. I have an exceptional memory, I remember my 3rd birthday party and can draw a picture of my baby stroller. I had never owned a computer and had never heard of the Mandela Effect back then. But after finding out about this phenomenon a year and a half later, I finally found out why I had been noticing all of the oddities in my bible. I then started diligently studying what should actually be called the Daniel 7:25 effect. That&#39;s where God said He would give the antichrist the power to do this. We&#39;re seeing the fulfillment of end time prophecies happening SUPERNATURALLY! This is some of the &quot;lying signs and wonders&quot; in 2nd Thessalonians chapter two!</b><br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0<b>God said in the end of days, (NOW!) that He would send us a famine for hearing His words in Amos </b><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdVaAP4mh08&amp;t=8m11s\">8:11</a></b><b> and that He would give the antichrist the ability to do this in Daniel 7:25. In Daniel 12:4 He told him to seal his book until the end days. He told John </b><b><i>not</i></b><b> to seal his book because the end time is at hand in Revelation 22:10. One of the definitions of seal in Strongs concordance is \u201cto protect from Satan\u201d. He also told us to \u201cwrite His words in our hearts\u201d, which meant memorize, if not word for word at least the essence of what was written, because He knew this was going to happen. He also warned us in second Thessalonians chapter two, that He would send a strong delusion to all that didn\u2019t receive the love of the truth. I&#39;m convinced that this is at least part of it! (not seeing the changes) The only scary thing about this is that hardly any Christians have noticed any of the </b><b><i>thousands</i></b><b> of changes yet!</b>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 <b>God commanded us to &quot;prove all things&quot;, and people </b><b><i>better</i></b><b> obey Him, especially on this subject.
