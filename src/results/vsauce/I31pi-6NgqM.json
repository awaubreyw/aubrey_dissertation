Also I have a history of imprinting aka love at first site 3 times. Seriously want to get to be with a person I&#39;ve had love at first site for. But can&#39;t accept being married to a woman I love because its being a thief, if i make her fall in love with me, as emotions manipulate in communication with a person, and logic is manipulated in speaking, from natural skill. Therefore how do I get her to fall in love with me without utilising superior nature making her love me because in being myself I manipulate her passively, and am intentionaly trying not to do so, but at the same time I love women I love my wife, and I want to be with her. How do I get her to be with me, but at the same time do it without using communication that naturally manipulates her into being with me?

Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on this earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there are only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water.<br>-<br>WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don&#39;t try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years.<br>-<br>DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early &#39;90s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don&#39;t know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. + TRUTH about COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc</a> <br>-<br>Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I31pi-6NgqM&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly?<br>-<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once.<br>-<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current.<br>-<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor.<br>-<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING. This website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000s as a Vision of a 10-speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ <a href=\"http://free-energy.yolasite.com/\">http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity.<br>-<br>This is a diagram <a href=\"https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php\">https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php</a> that looks a lot like the wiring of this former \u201cscience experiment\u201d YouTube video if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology<br>-<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages. Or even better, convince the government to start generating it for us, getting rid of the pollution that we put into the air, and the radioactive stuff completely.<br>-<br>Have you ever heard of the MANDELA Effect?

If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) If you have done this, you have violated God\u2019s moral law, you admit that you are a liar, a thief, a blasphemer, and an adulterer at heart. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God&#39;s eyes. Don\u2019t ask for forgiveness, try it in court: Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again. You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve. His resurrection proved that His death( more accurately, His sacrifical Blood) was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must believe (have faith in Jesus for our salvation, His finished work on the Cross). That&#39;s it!

I looked online and there is no known phobia so I just kinda keep it to myself for the most part.  well now im putting it in the comments so the cats outta the bag.  oh and to add.  i didnt know I had a fear of coffee until about a year after when a friend put coffee in my face and said, coffee?  thats about when I flinched a bit and we figured it out.  I knew I didnt want to drink it but didnt realize my brain would go in to panic mode at the scent or thought of drinking it.
