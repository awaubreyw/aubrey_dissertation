Only 25% talk but that&#39;s still a big chance, so you&#39;ll have to kill them anyway. You have to be really violent otherwise to reduce your odds and make sure they&#39;re traumatized. Have your fun first and then get violent. Yo only have to hit so hard in the right places and apply the right type of pain that scares them into post traumatic stress disorder. If you keep them for many days or months 25% of them develop stockholme syndrome. You&#39;re probably going to want to kill them. Slow torture is good. Get all of the money you can from them. Get some practice and raid their house. You can make them cease to exist if you put their body in a furnace right away so there&#39;s nothing remaining of them. Make sure that furnace is really hot. If you like her and don&#39;t want to kill her make sure she can&#39;t recognize you. You can use chloroform and that puts then out quickly. You can choke them into being unconscious, but make sure you choke them hard enough so they can&#39;t make any loud screams. When she&#39;s unconscious that&#39;s when you can take her to a location she can&#39;t locate you at. Make sure she doesn&#39;t find out the route to the location. If you let her go you&#39;ll want to choke her unconscious again, but not long enough to kill her. When you take her away from the location unconscious make sure there&#39;s no way she can find out where that location was, and that there&#39;s no way she can find out where you are. Handcuffs and a strong metal harness would do the trick while she is laying so she has no leverage to escape. If you have a good amount of money and you don&#39;t like her drop her into a volcano alive if you have access to a volcano and know how to get here there. Volcanoes are 5000 degrees Fahrenheit from what I know,\u00a0 so you can set up something much hotter than a volcano. Extremely hot liquid at a higher temperature than that would do it.", "comment_date": "2014-03-23T02:20:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nebulastorm", "comment_text": "What happened to IMG?", "comment_date": "2014-03-21T00:21:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfie Reeves", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://youtu.be/xR1sLdupUDs?t=00m51s\">00:51</a>", "comment_date": "2014-03-20T23:34:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfie Reeves", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://youtu.be/xR1sLdupUDs?t=0m51s\">0:51</a>", "comment_date": "2014-03-20T23:34:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Murray", "comment_text": "last name peanis breath", "comment_date": "2014-03-20T12:54:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timblebits", "comment_text": "To think Vsauce used to make this kind of stuff...", "comment_date": "2014-03-20T02:55:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lLoyall X", "comment_text": " <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Dogsloveeverything\">#Dogsloveeverything</a> \u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-03-15T00:15:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Autumn Pacheco", "comment_text": "CAN YOU FIND THE CAT! yes i can on laptop go to wide screen and shake the screen quickly left to right and a vauge cat form will appear", "comment_date": "2014-03-14T22:13:44Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "ProPlayerKiller", "comment_text": "Damn at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xR1sLdupUDs&amp;t=1m10s\">1:10</a> ! anyone could see the&#39;s girl&#39;s pussy hair at the left ?!", "comment_date": "2014-03-14T13:35:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eos Achilleus", "comment_text": "Where is that f*cking Cat?!
