And when it comes to these two men going to the party, could we build a machine(even theoretically) that predicts are they going or not.

Asked differently: are there (or can there even be) sources of randomness? <br><br>There are sources of unpredictability (like rolling dice), but whether our universe is deterministic or non-deterministic is unknown - whether it contains (or is linked to inside or outside) sources of randomness.<br><br>Let&#39;s roll two dice, your eyes will see the result and let&#39;s assume your result R0 is governed by randomness. But to determine the outcome of your dice, there must be &quot;something/someone&quot;, unseen in the background, that &quot;rolled his own dice&quot; (R1), to determine the result of your dice in the first place! But to get randomness into R1, there must be a R2, which in turn needs a R3 to feed its randomness, then a R4 etc.<br><br>The whole concept of &quot;source of randomness&quot; becomes an infinite loop!<br><br>So from this point of view two scenarios appear on the surface: A) there is a &quot;God of Randomness&quot; / &quot;God of Chaos&quot; or B) randomness does not exist, our universe is 100% deterministic.<br><br>Gods throwing their &quot;magical dice&quot; (rock bottom randomness; results even unknown to them!) to determine outcomes, used where they don&#39;t want to decide the outcome themselves, sounds quite crazy.<br><br>Although, on closer inspection the concept of (source of) randomness is crazy in itself! Logic, mathematics or physics can&#39;t find, expose, create, generate or explain (sources of) randomness. Maths and computer programs can only create sequences of pseudo-random numbers.

And from there you can even mention how we would probably hit another wall and eventually you wonder if we&#39;ll truly understand the smallest possible unit of measurement. I just think if we are to assume something that probably will always be on the edge of science&#39;s understanding, aka whether the universe is random or pre determined, we should go with the option that is the most consistent with reality. What&#39;s more consistent an orderly universe created from pure randomness, or an orderly universe created from an infinitely deep function that will always appear random if you go deeper than you should but still functions orderly no matter how deep you understand.

I&#39;ve seen experiments that supposedly disprove this, but they all still boil down to something that can be determined at any measurement point. The one that comes closest is the one minutephysics goes over in the multiple polarized lens experiments, and I keep having to go back to them to try to really wrap my head around it, but in the end, the nature of the problem remains: how do you do an experiment that proves that the property is determined when it&#39;s measured, rather than that the property was established?<br><br>Even the uncertainty principle only makes statements about the impossibility of performing a measurement without disrupting the system to the point that you can&#39;t perform another measurement that has meaning. i.e., all testing is destructive, so even if you measure a property, you can&#39;t any longer know the property you just measured because you disrupted it in measuring it.<br><br>Further, it is typical, but ultimately foolish, for us to assume it is human observation that matters in determining a quantum state. The quanta add up to macrostates, and those macrostates are imminently predictable. Now, yes, they&#39;re predictable due to an overwhelming addition of myriad probabilities. That is, they&#39;re as predictable as saying that the average of all numbers rolled on a fair d6 will be 3.5 after a significantly large number of rolls.<br><br>But what that means is that something other than humans are measuring their values, and they are, in fact, aggregating their probabilities without ever being individually measured, but creating macrostates.<br><br>I know the pop sci interpretation - which quantum physicists often use, so I am not dismissing it based on it being popular science - is that this means they&#39;re ONLY probabilities, and the deterministic macrostate is just a sum of the underlying unobserved probabilities, but this isn&#39;t really supported by any of the basis for QM as I understand it. (This could mean I still lack understanding; QM isn&#39;t my field of physics.) QM, as I understand it, only gives us the fact that we can&#39;t KNOW it until we observe it, and that observing it changes it. <br><br>It does give us particles that can self-interfere as if they were waves, but that&#39;s a function of energy being quantized and the &quot;particle&quot; being just a wave that has its smallest possible amount of energy while still existing.<br><br>But these quantum states exist, and I have yet to see evidence that they truly are in a literal, physical superposition of all possible states until &quot;observed.&quot; Because, again, what does &quot;observation&quot; mean? By who or what? There is no functional difference, perhaps, between it having a probability of having decayed or not that is determined only when the fact that it is or is not decayed matters, and it having actually decayed or not decayed by the time it matters. But by the same token, then, why insist on this strange, hard-to-understand idea that it&#39;s &quot;determined when measured?&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s certainly <i>discovered</i> only when measured. And if we treat it like that, a lot of QM makes more sense to the layperson. I&#39;m really struggling to see how these experiments show that this is a false way of looking at it, and if I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;d like to grasp how and why.<br><br>But &quot;what is observing?&quot; is crucial. We discuss it with terms of detectors, but in practice, for a baseball to be hit by a bat, all those quantum states must add up to the sum that leads to Newton&#39;s Laws holding true. And you could say, &quot;Well, you&#39;re observing all of them,&quot; but, no, you&#39;re not. You&#39;re observing a macrostate that is a sum of them. Nobody has measured that baseball&#39;s every quantum state. Nobody ever will; that baseball has already been hit and those states long-ago changed. But the process of &quot;observation&quot; by the fellow particles has occurred. At what point were they observed, however? All the other observers were also in superpositions. How do any of them observe each other, when they&#39;re not sure when they&#39;ll interact?<br><br>And again, how does the end result differ from if they all are in defined quantum states that are just too hard to measure to predict until they interact with each other in their definite states?<br><br>It&#39;s the randomness of a deck of cards compared to the randomness of a die in motion.", "comment_date": "2020-09-01T17:30:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Pecora", "comment_text": "I like how at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=3m55s\">3:55</a> the bench says; I like worms, isn\u2019t that \u201crandom\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-09-01T01:56:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evandro Carlo Ciaccia", "comment_text": "I", "comment_date": "2020-08-30T23:09:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny Sj\u00f6\u00f6", "comment_text": "I wonder if everything is predestined by the exact properties of the big bang.

Independently of a outcome distribution type being more random or less random, it would not be expected that a human being could actually understand, explain and predict a certain outcome type or a certain sequence of happening. We as human beings are limited in our capabilities, intelligence, comprehension, etc. Possible outcome distribution types or sequences are influenced and conditioned by an almost infinite group of factors and variables. To fully understand why something behaves the way it does, one would have to simultaneously embrace and dominate all these variables. If a outcome type is truly random to it&#39;s fullest extent than we would have to admit that there are no variables or external factors that are influencing and restricting the outcomes.

While you are walking, it starts being awfully windy. The moment this happens, you happen to pass by a 2 storey house with a balcony. So a plant falls from the balcony on your head and you die. <br>Before you start complaining that the setting is too much, i will say that the randomness in this, is the facts you decided to get out for a walk and that you passed by a 2 storey house with a balcony that had some plants on it. Your choice to go for a walk had nothing to do with the outcome nor was it the reason of it. Now if you want to call a choice passing below a 2 storey house with a balcony on a windy day be my guest, but probably you wouldn&#39;t even notice in that situation. The reason was the windy day, that would have happened even if you didn&#39;t go out for a walk that day.<br>As to why it is random for a day to become windy, you sure go out of your house every day right? Is it always windy?

Do you move your hand in any way after you catapult the coin, which can influence the number of flips in mid air. Does the angle at which it lands on your hand is enough to stop, or will it friction through for an extra final flip to the other side.

0 percent uncertain/certain to 100 percent uncertain/completely unexpected? 90 percent uncertain is like pick a whole number between 0 and 11 (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or 10) 10 options without any further knowledge like knowing the biases of the person what numbers they don&#39;t like what numbers they do and so forth like me i would almost always pick 7 is my favorite number but without knowing that it would seem to be 1 out of 10 chance to think or expect what would be the outcome. to be random i think it needs to be more then just one angle not just the uncertainty but the lack of being able to determine what the outcome could be like pick a whole number between 0 and 11 and the outcome is chosen to be waffle that could be considered random but having a computer &quot;randomly pick a password&quot; 8 to 16 characters long u know the parameters there is a lot of options but it is still expected to be something. if the outcome was more then 16 characters it could be random or if it used characters not part of the options something you wouldn&#39;t expect. basically i think random should mean;    random = no pattern + unexpected + unlikely. the less ignorant someone is the less things would be random to them. so is something random or are you just too ignorant and cant &quot;think outside the box&quot;? if you could calculate the chance of something u would have prior knowledge to the possible outcomes and it wouldn&#39;t be expected to begin with also if you saw a pattern it wouldn&#39;t be expected so really random is simply something unexpected so if u filled ur mind with enough information enough possibilities eventually nothing would be random because u would have seen it before you could have the idea of it happening again. pick a number between 0 and 11 person chooses the answer to be waffle not random u heard that outcome before it wasn&#39;t unexpected whats the point of the word random if it literally means unexpected? unanticipated\r if someone is completely ignorant everything is random if someone is all knowing nothing is random. you don&#39;t have to be able to guarantee something will happen for it to not be random technically you cant guarantee anything but things can be unexpected until it is expected while it is unexpected its random when its no longer unexpected its no longer random.", "comment_date": "2019-09-26T08:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andr\u00e9 Vidal", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=8m00s\">8:00</a><br>That face tho", "comment_date": "2019-09-25T16:38:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zach Schermerhorn", "comment_text": "Nothing is more random than your video topics.", "comment_date": "2019-09-25T15:34:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matias", "comment_text": "&quot;EL PODER ES DEMASIADO, VOY A IMPLOSIONAR&quot; jpg.", "comment_date": "2019-09-25T12:18:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MessyAndDepressy", "comment_text": "It&#39;s the Australian fifty cent from fifty cent: blood on the sand", "comment_date": "2019-09-25T11:17:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tigertank909", "comment_text": "lol im subed to that guy with the laptop on yotube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=0m20s\">0:20</a>", "comment_date": "2019-09-25T01:55:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jhon Karston", "comment_text": "Greetings from germany, great vid but I have to correct you but Einstein said : &quot;Gott w\u00fcrfelt nicht.&quot; What literally means: &quot;god dosend play dice.&quot; Keep going I love what you are doing.", "comment_date": "2019-09-24T22:52:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kiwi", "comment_text": "Can I please get a link to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=2m52s\">2:52</a>", "comment_date": "2019-09-24T16:51:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "No Name", "comment_text": "Me: I&#39;m bouta use a random number generator<br>Vsauce: <b>OR ArE YOu</b><br><br><br><br>Also Vsace after watching the video: how long is your penis actually<br>Me: 6.4<br>Michael: or is it?<br>*Music starts playing", "comment_date": "2019-09-23T04:50:27Z", "likes_count": 373}, {"comment_by": "Aleriz", "comment_text": "who else looked up im so random deal with it", "comment_date": "2019-09-22T16:12:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beanie", "comment_text": "Have a great time with you and I hope you&#39;re doing bettering your day today so much and then I am going on my own time to see if I wanna is this a month for you and i was the", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T17:43:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Layla Dai", "comment_text": "Benedict Cumberbatch name generator.", "comment_date": "2019-09-21T03:19:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u2022_Bells_\u2022", "comment_text": "I love how when I act like him I\u2019m \u201ca smartass\u201d but when a child does it it\u2019s \u201cannoying\u201d and when he does it he\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d wtf", "comment_date": "2019-09-20T04:44:34Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Wilma Harrysson", "comment_text": "This was a random vid", "comment_date": "2019-09-19T22:01:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "snackychan420", "comment_text": "This video", "comment_date": "2019-09-18T19:22:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vendsoin", "comment_text": "This principle of randomness on quantum level actually guarantees throwing dice or flipping coin is partially random.

I actually typed &quot;typo&quot; instead of that one &quot;type&quot; followed by the &quot;...&quot; AND the typing of typo in &quot; &quot; took me more than 3 tries...<br>I think that&#39;s enough for now.<br>Illusion of sentience status = restored.", "comment_date": "2019-05-13T22:13:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Delos Santos", "comment_text": "How random is randomness?", "comment_date": "2019-05-13T04:31:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eduardo Benavides  ", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/9rIy0xY99a0\">https://youtu.be/9rIy0xY99a0</a>", "comment_date": "2019-05-13T02:04:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seirasip Xuz", "comment_text": "the bleep", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T19:58:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom\u00e1s Avenda\u00f1o G\u00f3mez", "comment_text": "The best part was when he said random", "comment_date": "2019-05-10T02:59:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Calcium", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=2m53s\">2:53</a> that is fucking terrifying", "comment_date": "2019-05-08T12:41:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Haniff Mohd", "comment_text": "Referee : head or tail?<br>Me : what coin are we using?", "comment_date": "2019-05-08T05:55:28Z", "likes_count": 2328}, {"comment_by": "Lucid", "comment_text": "easy, the eric andre show", "comment_date": "2019-05-08T01:20:46Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Mony Bogoev", "comment_text": "Can I have the Lev u don&#39;t have lunch", "comment_date": "2019-05-06T10:22:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P lebko", "comment_text": "Ok so isnt the Pi random?", "comment_date": "2019-05-05T13:30:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahsan Bulbul", "comment_text": "oh really?<br>can scientist make a tie (not head or tail) in a precisely calculated toss? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2019-05-05T04:31:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I'm socially Awkward", "comment_text": "As I was watching this video I looked out my window and saw a car going backwards, it hit a bush and it drove away like nothing, now thats random xD.", "comment_date": "2019-05-04T18:05:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Your resident cat boy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=4m09s\">4:09</a> the bench says I like worms", "comment_date": "2019-05-04T01:52:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Enavoid", "comment_text": "heads or tails in portuguese:<br>face or crown<br>(cara ou coroa)", "comment_date": "2019-05-02T21:18:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TTB - Teodor The Best - Second Channel", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=5m34s\">5:34</a> fake! just look from up to down on the border.

What\u2019s implied in the above study is the notion that what we usually think of as \u201crandom\u201d is not mathematical at base, but fundamentally perceptual. This is illustrated by the various sets of short black-white runs considered above, some of which seem more \u201crandom\u201d than others, despite the fact that so few elements are involved that the law of large numbers which defines randomness mathematically doesn\u2019t apply. In other words, it would seem that, at base, our notion of randomness is fundamentally intuitive rather than strictly mathematical. Another way of\u00a0looking at it is to consider a run of, say, 2,3,6,2,3,6,2,3,6, 2,3,6. Though this does not look random, strictly speaking it could have been produced through some \u201crandom\u201d process, such as tossing a die 12 times. So while there is no way to determine whether any set of outcomes could have been produced by a random method when only a small number of events is involved, it\u00a0is\u00a0possible to characterize such a small run as either \u201crandom\u201d or not through purely intuitive methods.\u00a0<a href=\"https://antacticstructures.blogspot.com/2018/12/a-theory-of-pure-film-part-ii-only.html\">https://antacticstructures.blogspot.com/2018/12/a-theory-of-pure-film-part-ii-only.html</a>", "comment_date": "2019-04-20T20:22:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikael R.", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=11m11s\">11:11</a>", "comment_date": "2019-04-20T11:44:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TABBY", "comment_text": "It\u2019s an awful 2009 type of humour.<br><br>Example: potato unicorn xd", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T16:24:01Z", "likes_count": 45}, {"comment_by": "Test Monkey", "comment_text": "PICKLES!!<br>Hehe im so random XD", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T14:53:23Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Sherry Galloway", "comment_text": "Is the benefit of beauty in randomness and what is the alternative?", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T09:30:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bento Emanuel", "comment_text": "What&#39;s random?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>This video", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T03:52:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akash Kumar", "comment_text": "I just paused my video at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=0m27s\">0:27</a> because I need to take sometime to laugh at that pun he just made.

Atmospheric noise is not deterministic in any ultimate sense. Even with absolute knowledge of every particle, spin, position, velocity, and knowing all the different sources of radiation interacting with the atmosphere, and knowing all the sources of noise we produce, and those produced by other sources in nature, we could not create a deterministic model for the noise in the atmosphere. It is truly noise. It is affected by quantum vacuum fluctuations and Brownian motion both of which are truly and absolutely random in every sense of that word. Anything made of atoms or even sub particles is going to have velocities and positions that cannot be truly deterministic. The universe itself prohibits absolute determinism which is why we have a limitation on the meaning of length and time, something we call Planck length and Planck time. Below those limits, our ability to meaningfully measure either quantity is impossible due to the inherent fluctuations of the quantum realm. <br><br>For example, you cannot with any precision at all, predict where an electron will be in it&#39;s shell around an atomic nucleus. It is simply impossible to ascertain, no matter how good your technology. The best anyone could do is define the electron by its probabilistic set of positions, which tells us the shape of the electron shell. In fact, there is no point at which it is valid to say the electron IS at any one position, even if we admit we cannot know that position. An electron doesn&#39;t occupy a single position in space in that sense. <br><br>Similarly, any pattern we detect in flipping coins is only a buffering effect of true randomness. Radiation sources affect the spin and flipping in subtle but real ways such that over time, your determinism will be violated RANDOMLY. The trick is to make the buffering effect strong enough to overcome the subtle fluctuations of space time. In the case of coins, if you make a precision-flipper machine, you effectively cancel out any possibility of an quantum fluctuation affecting that macroscopic device and process. But radio noise, or atmospheric noise, are completely randomized because they are caused by interactions at the particle level. <br><br>The point of a radio amplifier in signal transmission is to buffer against that noise so profoundly that a clear pattern can be established above the noise floor, which can then be ignored. But even that pattern will have subtle fluctuations embedded inside that pattern that are truly random because that noise floor still exists. If you were transmitting a series of notes of music, you have no guarantee that any particular note will be received at exactly 13.0 decibel microvolts per meter by the receiver, even if the transmitter is adjusted manually and carefully to achieve that reading in a constant way. Even if the transmitter and receiver were but a foot apart, and the guy tuning the transmitter could see the readout on the receiver, he could never get a desired reception measurement. There will always be some decimal point difference in the desired deterministic reception strength and the actual reception strength because one is dealing with moving electromagnetic waves in space-time, which must interact with the fluctuating fabric thereof in truly random ways. The universe causes truly random noise that can affect all processes. <br><br>Finally, a nice macroscopic size example of randomness is the height of any ship on the sea with respect to sea level. The waves on the ocean are not truly deterministic because they are affected by subtle changes in air movement, planetary movement, rotational speed variations, the Moon&#39;s changing position, the fluctuating radiation level of the Sun, and even cosmic rays. The last two in particular are truly random sources, much like static. As water absorbs or releases heat, it changes in density and volume, thus changing the size of wave undulating on it&#39;s surface in random ways. You might see a 20 foot wave, but even if you measured it precisely at a given time, you could always zoom in closer and closer to the edge of that wave to discover there IS NO EDGE and thus no definite boundary in space-time between the top of the wave and the air above. In addition, the spacing between the molecules of water and other compounds will randomly fluctuate such that even if there WERE an absolute top of the wave at the molecular level, the fluctuating spacing between the molecules beneath that top will cause the height to change in a truly random way nobody, even with absolute knowledge, could predict.<br><br>Absolute determinism is a dead concept.", "comment_date": "2019-01-07T06:47:14Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Random Marshall", "comment_text": "oh wait actually, I think that&#39;s me right here", "comment_date": "2019-01-07T05:38:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harshit", "comment_text": "Every outcome is predictable, but it&#39;s just to little to be considered... that&#39;s all", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T15:03:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dinkar Pathak", "comment_text": "The video&#39;s length is 11 11..isn&#39;t that random..", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T05:36:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kaRu", "comment_text": "Vsauce has proved one thing<br><br><br><br><b>You don&#39;t randomly lose in the casino</b>", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T01:35:53Z", "likes_count": 531}, {"comment_by": "Relix", "comment_text": "well the first flip had 1\u20ac Euro", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T23:48:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paris", "comment_text": "Wow thats so random vsauce", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T23:25:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Xora", "comment_text": "there&#39;s the word &#39;haphazard&#39;, you know?", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T21:23:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Calvin Utomo", "comment_text": "Regarding randomness (the dice that god played), if we were return to the beginning of time and set everything exactly the same as in our timeline, press the play button, wait until today, would today be exactly the same as today or different (even slightly)", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T19:52:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HARLEY QU\u0130N", "comment_text": "bar\u0131\u015f \u00f6zcandan geldim", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T16:39:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zaarc Baan", "comment_text": "tbh, we just don&#39;t know the factors to predict quantum randomness, once we figure them out, they should be predictable as well.", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T15:44:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luxurious03", "comment_text": "What is random?<br><br><b><i>stares at Michael</i></b>*", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T04:42:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "L", "comment_text": "im sooo random", "comment_date": "2019-01-05T00:20:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jannik", "comment_text": "Random isnt real..<br>Hahahaha saved u 11 min", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T20:18:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zoomer4548", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://random.org/\">random.org</a> <br>you&#39;re welcome", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T20:14:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xmedix", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/SkMmzKAzodM\">https://youtu.be/SkMmzKAzodM</a>", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T11:51:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sad and Depressed", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Porn-QKrRLg\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Porn-QKrRLg</a>", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T04:07:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anas Al-ameen", "comment_text": "This video is nothing but two youtubers showing off their intelligence", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T00:12:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "n0 n4m3", "comment_text": "This video is random", "comment_date": "2019-01-03T16:40:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rrrrr", "comment_text": "Banana is an elephant.

But if you were as fast as a computer, you could go and quickly clean the extra room up the instant they went to peek in there. It&#39;s only clean because your date looked in there. If they hadn&#39;t looked, it would be chaos.<br><br>It&#39;s what the &quot;Matrix&quot; (or whatever you want to call it) does with quantum particles. And yes, a tree falling in the woods with nobody to observe it does not make any noise. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23LastThursdayism\">#LastThursdayism</a>", "comment_date": "2018-07-12T23:45:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rad Lord", "comment_text": "sexy sauce", "comment_date": "2018-07-12T19:54:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shiloh Schwartz", "comment_text": ",mju76tgvvfredsxswqvgyujmkol,<br><br>random text.", "comment_date": "2018-07-12T06:49:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reuben", "comment_text": "&quot;God may place dice with the universe, but they are the best dice in the universe.&quot;<br><br>This made me cry.", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T21:04:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Folsom", "comment_text": "I like worms", "comment_date": "2018-07-11T15:18:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Youssef.

If you showed a historic person (Say 12th century) a computer and electricity and technology we have today they wouldn&#39;t have a clue how the hell it works or what it is or anything. They would call it magic or witchcraft or the devils work. Quantum mechanics to us is similar to magic. We entangle particles and see that 1 influences another as if by magic. Seems to me like scientists came up with an explanation that sort of fit so they went with it. For example humans used to give sacrifices to prevent bad weather and volcanic eruptions etc because they thought that&#39;s how the world worked. There was a god who was unhappy. Then we figured out that it&#39;s just part of the earths weather patterns and we now predict changes in weather. One day in the distant future someone will predict the spin of a particle by some new measuring device that measures something we don&#39;t understand and it will give them a the correct spin every time they measure it. The universe is too precise. Too perfect to be random. It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we look deep enough in 14 billions years we will know that everything in the universe works on a simple counter that ticks by every tiny amount of time and that number determines everything that has ever and will ever happen.", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T03:58:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hqu00", "comment_text": "this is beautiful", "comment_date": "2018-07-04T02:42:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LiezAllLiez", "comment_text": "Random = chaotic = unpredictable.

There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I&#39;m really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I&#39;m a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she&#39;ll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quite happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can&#39;t sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can&#39;t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she&#39;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what&#39;s up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I&#39;ve been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer.

There was a problem on a test, about whether there&#39;s a fifty percent chance it&#39;ll rain tomorrow, since there are only two conditions. I got the question wrong, but I got why: what&#39;s going to happen is based on physical forces. But then I thought, wait, couldn&#39;t you say the same about a coin toss? The only difference is our ability to predict it.<br><br>As for quantum randomness... Yeah, I don&#39;t buy it. Because everything we observe is made of those quantum particles. Therefore, if they all operated randomly, wouldn&#39;t we live in a universe without cause and effect? Wouldn&#39;t there be no patterns whatsoever? Seems like nothing could really take shape that way. I don&#39;t really know much about it, but hearing you talk about it... It almost seems to me that the act of observing is what causes the particles to be particles. Like, before that, they&#39;re just formless energy. Or something. But anyway, that energy would still follow laws, even if we don&#39;t understand them. I feel like it&#39;s a form of matter that&#39;s just alien to us. We literally can&#39;t measure or describe its laws, because it doesn&#39;t exist in that form when we observe it. <br><br>As for why the word &quot;random&quot; has risen in popularity to describe quirky behavior... I think it has to do with the fact that that kind of behavior is based on following impulses, doing what you feel like, and ignoring social conventions. So, rather than moderating your behavior, acting on feelings, which you can&#39;t predict or plan. Supposedly-- a lot of it is calculated to look original, but anyway, being &quot;original&quot; was considered desirable. But anyway, we needed a word for it. &quot;Quirky&quot; doesn&#39;t quite fit, because there&#39;s still a pattern there, just one that differs from most. The popularity of that behavior had to do with personalities promoted in media, and humor therein, I think... In our culture, we place a lot of emphasis on individuality, but that&#39;s always been true. This particular style was popular in the late 90s and early 2000s, it seems. I say &quot;was,&quot; because it seems like we&#39;re sick of it. We know that people do it on purpose, and it&#39;s obnoxious rather than endearing.", "comment_date": "2017-07-08T02:09:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u039a\u03c9\u03bd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=2m10s\">2:10</a> Heeeeeey I feel weird because I am Greek..", "comment_date": "2017-07-07T17:40:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CLINTON JONES", "comment_text": "...sounds like you are sweeping the floor with your assumptions.

To do I must abandon my unique time perspective and enter into an &#39;on going&#39; perspective. From this perspective all kinds of variables in the condition of dice, my hands, my throw, the air, the landing surface, etc will effect the dice in ways that may inhibit randomness.

Thank you for making them. I still think that if we grab the universe at some time t, and run it twice, the immediate &quot;future&quot; state should be the same for all particles in both runs. If not, then what would cause the difference? Maybe somewhere in the universe a particle went left instead of right? But why? Could it do so for not reason at all? I don&#39;t think so.<br><br>It&#39;s a beautiful question. Just as is what is time? It seems that nothing prevents time from moving in the negative direction. Although I would imagine it would require energy to make it reverse. Nevertheless, let&#39;s imagine we could indeed reverse time. If we did so, then we would have to end up in a previous state. We wouldn&#39;t really experience it, as apparently we can only experience one direction of time. But in order to actually go backwards transitions would have to deterministic. So, why would transitions behave non-deterministically when moving forward in time? <br><br>No playing dice in my universe...

The classic argument for the uncertainty principle and observation problem.  The problem with the uncertainty principle is that we can never directly determine both the position and velocity of a subatomic particle at any given moment because our observations require adding a nontrivial amount of energy into the system thereby changing the behavior of the subatomic particles we want to observe.  Scientists, and indeed most laymen, debate about the meaning and nature of &quot;observation,&quot; which is epitomized by Schrodinger&#39;s hypothetical cat.  The idea was to challenge the notion of and clarify the nature of observation by linking quantum events with a macro event: a cat in an opaque box being subjected to some sort of poison with a device that&#39;s triggered by the decay of a radioactive isotope.  Since we don&#39;t know when the atoms will decay, we don&#39;t know when the poison will be triggered, and therefore we don&#39;t know the life/death state of the cat until we observe it.  So at any given time is the cat alive or dead?  To which a bunch of idiots suggest that it&#39;s in a superimposed state where it&#39;s both alive and dead at the same time until we open the box, which is nonsense.  This of course has little to do with quantum entanglement or the speed of information transfer, but people go on to conflate those subjects with this all the time as well.  And so quantum mechanics is viewed by many as some mystic, existential, mind-bending subject that only the geniuses among us can understand, when in fact it&#39;s just the razor edge of human technology and understanding as we know it which continues to move ever forward and deeper into the unknown.", "comment_date": "2017-03-17T10:56:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Xinzar", "comment_text": "I am Rando(M).

For instance, place both palms face down on a desk and randomly lift up fingers and place them back down, continuously and at a fast pace. You certainly aren&#39;t deciding which fingers to move with your brain. The actions are too quick for even you to predict. Some of these actions are perhaps influenced by muscle memory.

This one was especially interesting for me as I am a physicist. Although simplified,  I enjoyed your explanation of the quantum eraser experiment. However, since you always pay attention to detail, one thing might be interesting for you in case you didn&#39;t know. There are in fact quite a few theories which postulate that particles don&#39;t actually act as random as quantum mechanics (as awesome as it may be) teaches us. One of these theories is the Bohmian mechanics, which basically says that just like with the coin toss particles don&#39;t behave randomly at all. It&#39;s just that we don&#39;t know all the forces that causes them to act wave-like. Now there are some problems with this theory that need clarification like a certain experiment considering the polarisation of photons,  but it&#39;s still note worthy, because,  if proven true, there will officially be no true randomness in the Universe.

Someone please explain this to me. The entangled(meaning they have similar qualities) particles are connected or WERE connected right? So if we determine one of them and that determines how the other one will be determined with other properties and vice versa why wouldn&#39;t that mean that they corresponded BEFORE being separated? Or are they constantly changing between 2 states or something like that?\u00a0And how &quot;Quantum qualities don&#39;t preexist.&quot; Just because we don&#39;t know them doesn&#39;t mean they haven&#39;t existed yet. I&#39;m getting confused. From wiki : &quot;In the quantum formalism, the result of a spin measurement on one of the particles is a collapse into a state in which each particle has a definite spin (either up or down) along the axis of measurement. The outcome is taken to be random, with each possibility having a probability of 50%. However, if both spins are measured along the same axis, they are found to be anti-correlated.&quot; Doesn&#39;t that mean the particles are different and spinning them would obviously result different states meaning we spin them, they go into a state and then we look. Or are they changing states constantly and when we determine one the other one which is still changing states is sure to be determined opposite of the first?", "comment_date": "2015-03-08T22:10:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zAdrenaline", "comment_text": "I see around a lot the number 11, like the clock, book page, newspaper etc so I checked out this video to see if it could help me understand.

Take the lottery where say 50 Ping-Pong balls are in a bin, six are taken at random and you get a result. If it&#39;s a total random number isn&#39;t it possible that the resulting numbers chosen are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? Sure the probability of it happening is practically infinite, those six numbers in that specific order, yet it is possible. Now the resulting response would be that the game is probably rigged, no way can that result ever happen naturally, no bleeping way. The question I have is, is there an actual term for denying the result of a random turnout, in whatever forum? If I was to &quot;mulligan&quot; that&#39;s an actual term in golf say, usually meaning a request for a do-over. But if I as an observer would throw out the results of a given set of random numbers simply because of a belief that, though it is random and it is possible, couldn&#39;t be possible. If you toss a coin ten times and they all land on heads, it&#39;s possible but no way could it be possible, right? So the act of denying a legitimate outcome based only on the feeling or belief, whether right or wrong, that it must be illegitimate because, well, just because. So there.

I remember when I was going through High School, mumblemumble years ago, when I learned programming in BASIC to use the RND command which would generate a random number. Only, it wasn\u2019t really random, PCs can\u2019t really generate random numbers. CPUs only work in 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s, the normal operation has to be \u201cknown\u201d otherwise there\u2019s bad programming, \u201cillegal operation\u201d error messages, and all that. What the \u201crandom\u201d feature of a PC was a list of numbers that was pre-programmed into the OS of numbers that, during a program\u2019s operation, could read off of. However even that was limited as there was only a given list of pre-programmed numbers.<br>\u00a0<br>So let\u2019s take an example. I tell you to pick a random number between 1 and 10. That\u2019s already a non-random number, there\u2019s limitations on it. If the number picked by a CPU was then therefore 11 say there would be instability. It also assumes a format, such as you might pick \u201c2\u201d. Why not two-and-a-half? It is a number between 1 and 10 isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s an automatic assumption that it\u2019s a whole number instead of fractions or decimal. \u201cMy number is 4.2353329801\u201d.<br>\u00a0<br>Anyway, just a PC logic point-of-view.", "comment_date": "2014-12-01T18:05:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GeoSmasher", "comment_text": "I went to <a href=\"http://random.org\">random.org</a> and I chose 1 of 100, generated it, and got 78 on the first try.

It&#39;s about probabilities, and in a way, randomness.<br>Let&#39;s illustrate the problem I have been struggling with. Imagine you go to a casino. In that casino, there&#39;s a game where you roll dice and bet on which number you will get (I&#39;m keeping it pretty simple). So basically, you bet on a number from 1 to 6, you roll a dice (die ?) and you get the money if you&#39;re right.<br><br>Now right away, you would think that you get a 1/6 chance to win. But... is it, really ? Because we also know that, for instance, rolling 10 times in a row the same number is EXTREMELY rare. So if you arrive at the casino, watch people play and the number 6 appears 4 times in a row, and then decide to play - should you rather NOT bet on the number 6 ? Have the probabilities changed ?<br><br>To go even further, imagine you have the same scenario, except you DIDN&#39;T see the previous results (but the number 6 still rolled 4 times in a row) - what happens then if you bet on the number 6 ? To you, it&#39;s just a 1/6 chance just like any other number - but to the people who were there before and have seen the previous results, it&#39;s not, since they know that it has already been 6 quite a few times ?

For example, this was Albert Einstein\u2019s assumption when he began to apply his general theory of relativity. The scientific community was at first very reluctant of the big bang theory because they did not want to accept<br>he idea that the universe had a beginning. And so because the standard big bang model predicts an absolute beginning of the universe then it provides amazing scientific confirmation of the second premise of the following argument: <br>1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause <br>2. The universe began to exist <br>3. Therefore the universe has a cause <br>Therefore, because nothing can come from Nothingness, the universe must therefore be a transcendent cause beyond the universe. Therefore we Christians affirm that the cause, or the Big Banger to your Big Bang, is God, who is the un-caused first cause who transcends time and space, because He created it, and so He is a time-less, space-less, immaterial being of unfathomable power. <br>\u00a0Also, the Christian God is the one and only true God, and therefore any other gods are false gods. I would be happy to provide specific evidences for this but biblical Christianity is the only one that can stand up to any objections, for the Bible is without error, and it answers the questions about life\u2019s objective meaning, value and purpose and it all revolves around Jesus Christ and the redemption o f mankind\u2019s fall back to God. If there is no God then there is no meaning, value, purpose, or objective moral values in life. Without God it is all meaningless. And let\u2019s remember, even if there was no proof for God\u2019s existence, that\u2019s no proof that He doesn\u2019t exist. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. A suspected murdered might still be the murdered even though there is no evidence to prove it. So, to rule out God\u2019s existence the atheists need more than just absence of evidence, they need positive evidence of absence, which they do not have.

In fact, both processes are the polar opposite of random. Quantum Physics is easily the <i>least</i> random science there is; the predictability and accuracy of the theory is second to none. And while genetic mutation IS random...Natural Selection is NON-random. If Natural Selection <i>was</i> random...adaptation would be impossible.<br><br>But yeah...easy mistakes to make(which luckily Vsauce didn&#39;t make in this video). Then again, personally, I question the entire idea that &quot;randomness&quot; is even real, let alone a valid possibility. In a truly deterministic universe(which we have every reason to assume IS the case with our universe), true randomness is an impossibility. True randomness would cascade outward...propagating until the entire universe became nothing but an undifferentiated mess of low-entropy white noise.<br><br>My own hunch is that, just like the beginning of the universe, the end of the universe is book-ended by a singularity...a singularity which draws space-time-energy-matter into higher and higher entropic states. Teilhard de Chardin and Terence McKenna were big proponents of this idea....and I&#39;m inclined to agree with them.

Cool video. Not sure if it was mistake but it&#39;s: &quot;God doesn&#39;t play dice...&quot; \u00a0was Einstein&#39;s quote that&#39;s why the universe is knowable thus man&#39;s effort with the God science we have which has sought some patterns (repeatable) laws in the universe. Random is relative, for mankind really complex things is random coz&#39; he&#39;s incapable of comprehending the motion of most of the universe because since all particles in the universe affect one another (not counting the decisions of man aka events of man) coz&#39; every particle now, even now are doing the domino effect, affecting one another. The particles in the known universe is guessed at 10^80 power (80 zeros after 1, Graham&#39;s number is 10^more than trillions of zeros after 1) but for God who is Knowledge Itself, the Alpha &amp; Omega, He doesn&#39;t predict but knows exactly everything (including the affects of particles and forces science doesn&#39;t know yet to what it knows) for He knows the future. The next being that can predict what for man (and machines tech or applied science that is just an extension of man&#39;s senses, so it&#39;s still man who put the calculations in machines) is random are the angels who have a higher chance of predicting things than us for they have infused knowledge (that is at any moment, they know all the events of man and where each particle is at and what the forces are doing in the universe although they know all that, they don&#39;t know the future so it&#39;s still not omniscient like God who again is Knowledge Itself, Alpha and the Omega, in short- The Infinite knows everything about the finite universe). Next to the angels were Adam and Eve before the fall (infused knowledge but not at the level of angels. It&#39;s like a gallon full vs. a pint full, both are full but in different degrees). Next to Adam and Eve is Mother Mary (infused knowledge also but it&#39;s more on things of God, not the laws of the natural world/universe). In short for a baby (like we all were), things were random before but now it&#39;s not so random anymore. Random is relative but for simplicity&#39;s sake it&#39;s mostly random, like the weather which we can&#39;t predict yet accurately even with 500 world supercomputers (clusters of CPUs) combined which is 274 PFlops coz&#39; weather particles for sure are also affected by particles outside the solar system and beyond.

What is the blackest thing on Earth?", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T08:56:35Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "chris may", "comment_text": "Why do we laugh?", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T08:04:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RK4000", "comment_text": "correction, coin toss robot will not predict the result 100% of the time due to the always present margin of error. it would be 99.999999 but not 100% :D", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T07:57:10Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Ben Lao", "comment_text": "whenever i get completely sick of studying, i just go for a vsauce marathon.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T07:50:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Artemis Aegis", "comment_text": "I love how every Vsauce video I watch makes me question my existence.", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T07:38:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oddball", "comment_text": "Ha!", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T07:30:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rossco686", "comment_text": "Random ass video...", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T07:19:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ItsMisterDavid", "comment_text": "I love when\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T06:57:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrBla56bla", "comment_text": "This video has HA in it.\u00a0<br>HA take that!", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T05:35:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c \u0411", "comment_text": "\u041e, \u0437\u0431\u0441 \u0432\u044b\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a, \u043a\u0430\u043a \u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0442\u043e \u0447\u0442\u043e \u0445\u043e\u0442\u0435\u043b \u0443\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0442\u044c ", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T05:24:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chopper2986", "comment_text": "Vsauce, I subscribed to you to watch your videos because they blew my mind.

Until you saw it written down. Of course, it&#39;s not completely random in a sense, the person writing this only has 106 different combinations of button presses to achieve different predetermined values to make legible and understandable <b>English</b> text. So, that being the case, anyone that knows the person writing this would be able to predict what they wrote even before they wrote it or it was read. Someone who doesn&#39;t know the person writing this wouldn&#39;t even be absolutely sure that I am a male, sure, the videos on my channel and my Profile Picture all show the same person, but you, in your position right now, cannot be certain that I even exist, as your entire exposure to me has been filtered through so much technology that looking at it would be unrecognizable.<br><br>Look at the piece of words that tells you how long ago this was written. It may say thirty seconds, 6 hours, 3 days, or even 20 years, but this text didn&#39;t exist in your reality, until you read it. How can you be positive that that little grey piece of text is reliable or not? Sure every time you look at it the time will always, if a bit vaguely, refer back to the exact time this was published, but in all cases, this text couldn&#39;t have possibly existed until <b>you</b> bared witness to it&#39;s existence. Sure someone else might say that this text is pretty cool and you should read it, but it didn&#39;t really exist until you actually read it.<br><br>When someone tells you to read something, there is a 50% chance that you will actually read it. You mightn&#39;t be in the position at that time to search it up reducing the likelihood that you will read it, but then again, you might have a smartphone on you at all times so you will always be in a position to read it, but then you might be out of range of any cellular or internet up-link areas, reducing the chance, but then you might have payed a lot of money for you to be able to connect to the internet wherever you are... but then your phone might be dead. There are unlimited variables possible for there to be any more, or any less than a 50% chance that you, anyone, or anything will do something.<br><br>For example, reaching the end of this text. That is a chance on it&#39;s own. You might get bored about halfway through and stop, you might have already read something similar to this before, so you left or you might even lose the ability to read this before you even get to the end of this text (power outage, screen malfunction, computer virus, a sudden case of severe dyslexia), so technically speaking, there is a very low chance that you will get this far... but then you have now haven&#39;t you? Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be reading this now.<br><br>I mean look how far you&#39;ve gone in reading this text, so far, four paragraphs have passed and about 3-5 minutes of reading has gone out of your way. I can type literally anything here that I want, because something this far down couldn&#39;t exist with you pushing the &#39;Read More&#39; button and taking the time out of your day to read all the way down here. So anything that you haven&#39;t read so far, is a complete and total enigma. There isn&#39;t even a solid chance that I can finish what I&#39;m typing for you to read it. I mean, what happens if my browser crashes? Then where would you be?<br><br>Well, you wouldn&#39;t be reading this for one thing. In fact, the only person, right now that will lose anything if this isn&#39;t finished correctly is me... because I have now spent 10 or so minutes of my time writing this. Where would I be then if I can&#39;t finish this? Well, I&#39;d be pretty annoyed, now wouldn&#39;t I?<br><br>Now, look back, to the top of this monster of a wall of text, and remember what I typed about how this can only literally be an improbable string of only 106 different combinations of keystrokes. What did I really mean by that? Well, the keyboard I have now has about 53 different keys to push:<br><br>`1234567890-=qwertyuiop[]\\asdfghjkl;&#39;zxcvbnm,./ and Enter, but also everything again, but with shift pushed.<br><br>~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+QWERTYUIOP{}|ASDFGHJKL:&quot;ZXCVBNM&lt;&gt;?<br><br>And I could quite simply just push any random string of those characters... but is it really random? At this point, it is, because right now, at the time of writing this the string that I have planned to write is absolutely up to chance... but is it? I could chose anything, the combination is fluctuating constantly in my mind right now. I&#39;m thinking of a million different combinations of letters in my mind right now, but then, is it so random? I mean I could chose anything, so why don&#39;t I exploit this? The power of the control over your interest, I mean I wouldn&#39;t have your interest right now, if you didn&#39;t read this far. You wouldn&#39;t even know that I was gunning for the control of your interest if you didn&#39;t read this far.<br><br>So right now, at this moment, your interest is mine for what ever I wish, but is it really? Nothing but your interest, you computer&#39;s reliability and your middle finger is keeping you here. A simple press of the backspace key would make you go back a page and I would lose all of your interest, because you are not here anymore. Although, you still haven&#39;t done it yet, because you&#39;re still here reading, but can I really say that? How can I know that you haven&#39;t pressed backspace and then simply hit the forward button and scrolled down back to here to continue reading? The answer is, I don&#39;t, but it&#39;s a possibility.<br><br>But this point, you have either forgotten about the possible string of text I mentioned earlier, yet are still interested in this text, or you have remembered the string and are simply waiting for me to pull through with it. Of course, I don&#39;t need to, but I could. So, as of now, I, myself, have grown bored with writing this text so I will end it here with one last improbable random string of text.<br><br>I started writing this text at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=1m03s\">1:03</a> GMT+10, the 20th of July 2014.

Even so far as to going through &quot;Psychology&quot;, which is the study of the human psychological condition, there is no way to accurately predetermine how a person will behave 100% of the time. So instead of trying to argue who is and who is not being random, why not look at all the random choices throughout life that has brought you to this exact point, reading the other comments and commenting on them? (Yes, I believe life experiences are random, as the more interactions anything has with anything else the more unpredictable it may become. Therefore: Your life choices plus personal interactions you&#39;ve had in life have caused an unpredictable outcome. Although, the longer you live the more predictable it all is.

Even if we flip a coin over 9000 times, and get heads, we can&#39;t say we will get heads 100% of the time. There is always the chance it may land tails. Even with those robots. A small gust of wind, a slight malfunction etc. could always give the other result. Also, from which point did they start measuring getting the correct results? From the first ever build of the robot, or from the newest? The oldest build will have got some wrong, but still have got some right. The scientists are still predicting the coin toss, so even with calculations, they are still predicting without being fully sure. It could be pure coincidence that they are always getting the right results. Their presence as observers will change the outcome, and they will get what they expect/want from the experiment, as they will accidentally change things. People normally prove things right, as they have one mindset, and when the results are different from what they want, they say it is wrong and change it. When they do get what they wanted from the experiment, they call it to a stop and use it as confirmation, even if they have done something wrong. We can never be 100% sure, as everything is more complex and random than we may ever think.", "comment_date": "2014-07-18T14:57:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richman", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0&amp;t=4m05s\">4:05</a> And i like trains", "comment_date": "2014-07-18T14:48:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Goelz", "comment_text": "Finally...

I&#39;m not convinced that randomness exists but I can understand why many scientists do. Personally I think that when you get down to the minute details of quantum mechanics and sub-atomic activity the universe does meet it&#39;s base, something that cannot be explained by further matter of any kind. So to give Einstein a theory of what&#39;s truly going on, I&#39;d say you have the energy of &quot;awareness&quot; itself sustaining the universe. No amount of science will ever explain how a person is able to be &quot;aware&quot; or anything, or how thoughts and emotions truly exist, but perhaps the question must be reversed. Maybe life explains how physical realities exist.

The problem is that our most precise measurement devices in our time work with quantum properties as well. We use for ex. lasers in some cases, and a laser beam is made out of photons which has quantum properties. The laser beam interferes with the quantum state and destroys it but this doesnt mean that the uncertain behaviour of quantum particles are not \u00a0deterministic at a much much much smaller scale.\u00a0<br><br>I think that if the universe is deterministic and while it is , it does also mean that the past is enshrined, and so the present and the future has to be as well.

In this example, human beings have advanced far enough to be able to measure the speed and location of electrons well enough to be able to track them through the billions of years of expansion and change the universe has undergone. Supposing we ever achieve this feat, could it then be said that nothing is truly random, as we could plug the massive amount of original data into our hugely advanced and complicated equation, to arrive with a precise answer of how we can expect any one electron to be acting at any particular moment? Should this be true, then could one say that nothing innately random - but only seemingly is random due to our ignorance in this field (in this case being quantum mechanics)?<br>Thank you for taking the time to consider this.

If we then leave those particles alone i.e. do not disturb the system they remain in sync/in opposition to themselves until we again decides to measure/entangle one of them with the environment.<br><br>Once we do that we discover its state and <b>by definition</b> the other particle has to be in the opposite state - absolutely no mystery here.<br><br>To better visualize this think of two 12 hour analog clocks. Entanglement/measurement means that we set one of the clocks for example to 6 o&#39;clock and the other then has to be set to 12 o&#39;clock. Then we cover them with two identical cloths i.e. isolate the system to prevent measurement/de-coherence.<br><br>Provided we do not reset i.e. measure any of those clocks again, we can wait as long as we want not even counting the time passed and we can still be sure that once we peek under one cloth i.e. measure the state of one clock, that the other clock will show exactly the opposite hour on it&#39;s dial. We <i>measure</i> 3 o&#39;clock, the other one will show 9 o&#39;clock.<br><br>In real life one might use atomic clocks and once relativistic effects kick in, even when perfectly isolated, the spontaneous de-coherence of the clocks should be roughly proportional to the relative speed of the clocks and difference of gravitational potential between their positions.<br><br>The question then shifts from how does one particle knows the state of the other one - it does not, they are both synchronized/anti-correlated from the beginning - to how does that happen that they become anti-correltated at the initial entanglement. I am not a physicists, though if I was forced to guess, I would bet on some aspect of energy conservation.<br><br>Of course I can be wrong and all above is fluff.

While it&#39;s true that if we could know the exact conditions it would take to make a coin land on heads every time the only condition that&#39;s actually important is that we want it to land on heads every time. A normal coin flip is still technically random because we have no control over which side it&#39;s going to land on. The chances of one side over the other don&#39;t necessarily have to be 50/50 to qualify as random. It only really stops being random when we can predict the outcome and we would only be able to predict the outcome because it will land on the side that we want it to. That&#39;s not even really a true prediction because we&#39;ve decided which side it will land on before we even made the coin flip. It&#39;s a decision, not a prediction. Basically anything that we don&#39;t have any control over, anything we didn&#39;t contentiously calculate and decide before hand, is random. So you could never truly predict the result of a coin toss because you can&#39;t know the outcome without calculating and deciding what that outcome will be. Anything that happens without intelligent thought, that is not calculated and decided by a thinking mind, is random. That being said the example you gave of running into someone you know at a popular club is not random because you both decided to go there. You may of had no way of knowing you were going to see each other there but the fact that you both made a deliberate decision to be there means it isn&#39;t just some random event though running into them in a crowded place when you had no idea they would be there is. You didn&#39;t plan on meeting them there so it&#39;s technically both random and calculated at the same time. It is possible for two people who know each other to be in the same place without ever seeing each other there. A few weeks ago I was at Wal Mart with my ex except we never planned to meet there, had no idea we were both there at the same time, and never actually saw each other while we were there. The chances of running into someone you know are kind of random unless you actually planned to meet there. You have to be able to calculate every variable for something to stop being random, including the interference of other people.", "comment_date": "2014-07-16T20:57:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julius Lungys", "comment_text": "So u just took the idea from no game no life and made video cool.

Let&#39;s assume at one time it&#39;s 600.458148452 seconds (600458148452 nanoseconds) so you can convert it to a more precise value like 600.458148452*1000=600458.148452 and you trim the decimal value so you get 0.148452 that changes over time so you get milliseconds between 0.0 and 0.999999. A millisecond is the thousandth of a second, but if we look at the decimal value as whole we are still in the precision of a nanosecond. Let&#39;s assume we want a number between 0 and 100, so we calculate 100*0.148452=14~ and you get 14 only in 148 microseconds. Let&#39;s see for example you click a button to request a random number, so you click it when the time is 0.148452 you get 14 then you click 1 second later to get the same results BUT it means you have to be 10 microsecond precise between clicks that&#39;s impossible for humans. In automatic operations like encryptions it may result in the same number since the code that runs on the computer can run in almost the same interval, but if you add it to video games that is controlled by user input then pseudo-randomness is perfect. Or when you obfuscate randomness with randomness for example you delay the calculations for random microseconds, so it should calculate more things before the next random number is requested. Speaking of that CPU clock cycle is determined by the crystal oscillator that is affected by its temperature and the temperature is pretty much random over time, so the cycle delays itself in a very little amount of ticks. And you can even call it true randomness since the result comes from so many quantum factors that it&#39;s almost unpredictable.", "comment_date": "2014-07-16T20:17:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DeadStarlin", "comment_text": "Awesome!

Even if a die was cast to perfection, wouldn&#39;t the side with the six be lightest?  Because the dots cut out to make a six would reduce the weight right?  And if that is true then the side with the one would be heaviest.  And since every opposite side equals 7, the one and six are opposite; thus, the heaviest and lightest sides are opposite.  I don&#39;t claim to know how this would effect it and maybe it doesn&#39;t.  Maybe the imperfections in the dice countereffect it?  At any rate I have never seen anything to suggest what number you get to be weighted unevenly to one or two numbers when rolling dice.<br><br>Also another factor that statiscally doesnt seem to matter, but I was thinking about is the different amount of dimples should change the way the die spins right?  Just taking a large leap from Veritasium&#39;s video with the Australian professor that figured out the reason baseballs curve and other such facts.

I believe everything that has/will ever happen in the universe was predetermined by something else and there is/was only one possible outcome of the universe. It is impossible for a human to make a decision randomly because previous experiences affect our cognitions, even if it was a really difficult decision, the decision was already made for you by your previous experiences. This therefore suggests that we are not in control of our own actions and in a sense, our lives are being lived for us and we&#39;re just along for the ride. As you said in the video, even coin flips are redetermined by the forces which act upon them, which in tern is determined by the strength in your thumb, which is determined by things such as genes and nutrition.

The human rolls the dice and this really fast computer can calculate the exact landing point, rolling path and outcome of the dice as soon as the dice looses contact with the human at a 100% success rate. Now lets assume that over the next year the computer was improved even furthe. It can now sense the electronic waves in the brain of the human and is able to tell that the dice will be rolled in 4.6432blabla seconds with the exact acceleration of bla. Now it perfectly calculates the outcome before the dice is even rolled! Many years later the computer might have better sensors to eventually scan the whole earth and calculate EVERYTHING. Ladies and Gentlewomen, we now have a hypothetical computer that can predict the fucking future! Scientist, make it happen!
