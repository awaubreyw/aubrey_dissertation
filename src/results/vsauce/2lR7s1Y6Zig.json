Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on this earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there are only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water.<br>-<br>WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don&#39;t try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years.<br>-<br>DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early &#39;90s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don&#39;t know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. + TRUTH about COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc</a> <br>-<br>Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lR7s1Y6Zig&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly?<br>-<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once.<br>-<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current.<br>-<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor.<br>-<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING. This website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000s as a Vision of a 10-speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ <a href=\"http://free-energy.yolasite.com/\">http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity.<br>-<br>This is a diagram <a href=\"https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php\">https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php</a> that looks a lot like the wiring of this former \u201cscience experiment\u201d YouTube video if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology<br>-<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages.

If you pay attention you&#39;ll realize that the entire thread of conversation is coming from YOU, a back and forth of thoughts made of your own biased expected responses. So if you thinks aliens are talking to you then if you ask a question YOU: what planet are you from? (and you expect or really want the answer to be Mars the person then your Gamer will purposely let you will hear your biased expectation) ALien: I&#39;m from Mars. This is your gamer purposely letting you hear your thoughts in a way that makes you think someone&#39;s talking to you.<br><br>Examples: Your thought 1: Are you an alien? (Person believes in ghosts, the brains works really fast) &quot;Ghost&quot;: No I&#39;m a ghost<br><br>Your thought #2: Is this Nikola Tesla ( Person really wants believe it, gamer sees our thoughts and allows the response thought)<br><br>&quot;Tesla&quot;: Yes this is I, Nikola.<br><br>(Often the person will imagine the voice in the way they imagine it) IF YOU PAY ATTENTION, THIS&#39;LL HELP ALOT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY&#39;RE HEARING VOICES, YOU&#39;LL REALIZE THAT YOU&#39;RE POWERING THE ENTIRE CONVERSATION YOURSELF AND YOU CAN START THINKING NORMALLY BY PRACTICING THINKING IN FIRST PERSON. THINK IN FIRST PERSON AND THE 2ND VOICE WILL DISAPPEAR, BOTH VOICES ARE YOURS; IT&#39;S ONLY YOUR MIND CREATING BIASED RESPONSES a.k.a RESPONSES THAT YOU EXPECT/DESIRE.<br><br><br>YOUr thought 1: SHOULD I GET A DOG (YOU WANT A DOG)<br><br>PLANT: YEA, GET A DOG, BUT DON&#39;T FORGET ME. with practice talking in 1st person (lots of practice) your thoughts will streamline and you&#39;ll be able to make more conscious/complex/detailed decisions YOUR STREAMLINED thought 1: SHOULD I GET A DOG (YOU WANT A DOG), maybe, i&#39;ve been taking care of my plant better, hmm, i think i&#39;m ready to take of something more, but wait i don&#39;t really have room, maybe i could get a small dog or a,m.m. cat, maybe it&#39;s time for a move?<br><br>There are no characters in your head, this is good news because it&#39;s a simple healthy psychological function of your mind that&#39;s being manipulated by our gamers. (Your mind thinking/predicting multiple responses to whatever you&#39;re thinking). All you have to do is practice realizing that both voices are yours and thinking to yourself in a more fluid way.<br><br>For people who hear voices tell them to do terrible things, the answer is simply this; Pandas. If someone tells you not to think of pandas it&#39;s much more likely that you&#39;re going to think of pandas. People who hear hateful voices are suffering from of perversion of a healthy function (Your mind thinking/predicting multiple responses to whatever you&#39;re thinking) EXCEPT these people are CONSTANTLY SUFFERING THE OEDIPAL/IRONIC fate of hearing the thing they don&#39;t want to hear/trying to hear.<br><br>YOU: I don&#39;t want to do drugs anymore.<br><br>Oedipal thoughts responds :Do drugs do drugs!<br><br>Eventually you might turn the response voice person or an alien or an evil sounding voice. Why would our gamers take a healthy, normal brain function and turn it schizophrenic. Easy; AGAIN, it&#39;s a preemptive crippling of people who they know have a higher chance of having high awareness/ being conscious/being aware of the simulation and the peculiarities that reveal we&#39;re in a simulation.<br><br>At the end of the day treat schizophrenia like a trick being played on you that never ends because you&#39;re being played the fool,you&#39;re thinking and the response you Thinking/expecting is constantly relayed back to you so the conversation could practically go on forever. So people with schiz think they&#39;re having a convo with someone; Picture this you place a thought in a hole in a wall and then whatever response you were/expecting thinking comes back out the hole, you think someone&#39;s talking back too you but it&#39;ss just the answer that your mind expect. SO there&#39;s practically a response to every query/thought. this will result in you thinking you&#39;re talking to someone. Especially if you instinctively, naturally, or as a creative person make the voice into another person. or ironically create more voice [in the sense that you&#39;re NOT trying to hear the voices and more thoughts come because you end up thinking harder about the thoughts you don&#39;t want.] a good method is to think a thought to death; suppressing/rejecting something like a powerful/important thought can force to circle through your head more harmfully and powerfully", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T14:10:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Univ0ider", "comment_text": "Are you blind?", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T19:29:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "louis menne", "comment_text": "the earth is flat dont let them convince u otherwise", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T08:12:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SleepingOmen", "comment_text": "flat-earther: a flat circle", "comment_date": "2019-03-11T08:00:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim Brow", "comment_text": "How can someone argue that the Earth is flat when there are dozens  of satellites in orbit as we speak.

Usually the frequency is totally blocked out by regular white light so we don&#39;t see it. But these goggles block out all white light but allow at the very least, near-infrared. It turns your whole world into a world of fucking rich bright reds, strange purplish blues. All green tree foliage turns this velvety looking, beautiful exquisite red, quite deep but bright as well. It&#39;s an incredibly unique experience and I highly recommend it. The hardest part for me was just finding adequate goggles and the colour gels.<br><br>Also I recommend only worrying about putting in the 4 layers of the Congo Blue. 4 cut-out layers on top of each eyehole/goggle. Don&#39;t fret about the other red gels he talks about, they&#39;re not as important. Just get the Congo Blue gels, they&#39;re this really dark blue/purple plastic sheets which I found at Axe music. I don&#39;t know if that company exists in the states, but you can try any big music shop with guitars, drums, bass etc.. as well as stage equipment, PA systems, and a stage <b>lighting</b> section obviously.

The heliocentric theory, literally \u201cflying\u201d in the face of direct observation, experimental evidence and common sense, maintains that the ball-Earth is spinning around its axis at 1,000 miles per hour, revolving around the Sun at 67,000 miles per hour, while the entire solar system rotates around the Milky Way galaxy at 500,000 miles per hour, and the Milky Way speeds through the expanding Universe at over 670,000,000 miles per hour, yet no one in history has ever felt a thing! We can feel the slightest breeze on a summer\u2019s day, but never one iota of air displacement from these incredible speeds! Heliocentrists claim with a straight face that their ball-Earth spins at a constant velocity dragging the atmosphere in such a manner as to perfectly cancel all centrifugal, gravitational, and inertial forces so we do not feel the tiniest bit of motion, perturbation, wind or air resistance! Such back-peddling, damage-control reverse-engineered explanations certainly stretch the limits of credibility and the imagination, leaving much to be desired by discerning minds. If the Earth and atmosphere are constantly revolving Eastwards at 1,000 mph, how is it that clouds, wind, and weather patterns casually and unpredictably go every which way, often travelling in opposing directions simultaneously? Why can we feel the slightest Westward breeze but not the Earth\u2019s incredible supposed 1,000 mph Eastward spin!? And how is it that the magic velcro of gravity is strong enough to drag miles of Earth\u2019s atmosphere along, but weak enough to allow little bugs, birds, clouds and planes to travel freely unabated in any direction?</b> <br><br><b>We must take it on faith as mathematical proof doesn&#39;t exist.</b> <br><br><b>N.A.S.A. *</b><i>on Speed:</i>* <br><b>The Earth&#39;s orbital speed around the sun is 67,000 m.p.h.</b> <br><b>The sun&#39;s orbital speed around the galaxy is 450,000 m.p.h.</b> <br><b>The speed of the ground beneath your feet, as a result of the Earth&#39;s</b> <b>rotation is</b> <br><b>600 m.p.h. at the latitude of Sheffield (53 degrees);</b> <br><br><b>1,000 m.p.h. at the equator.</b> <br><b>The Earth travels 584 million miles per year (one trip around the sun); that&#39;s</b> <br><br><b>1,600,000 miles per day; 66,667 miles traveled each hour</b> <br><br><b>\u201cThe distance across St. George&#39;s Channel, between Holyhead and Kingstown Harbour, near Dublin, is at least 60 statute miles. It is not an uncommon thing for passengers to notice, when in, and for a considerable distance beyond the centre of the Channel, the Light on Holyhead Pier, and the Poolbeg Light in Dublin Bay.  The Lighthouse on Holyhead Pier shows a red light at an elevation of 44 feet above high water; and the Poolbeg Lighthouse exhibits two bright lights at an altitude of 68 feet; so that a vessel in the middle of the Channel would be 30 miles from each light; and allowing the observer to be on deck, and 24 feet above the water, the horizon on a globe would be 6 miles away. Deducting 6 miles from 30, the distance from the horizon to Holyhead, on the one hand, and to Dublin Bay on the other, would be 24 miles. The square of 24, multiplied by 8 inches, shows a declination of 384 feet. The altitude of the lights in Poolbeg Lighthouse is 68 feet; and of the red light on Holyhead Pier, 44 feet.

Lets say you drew a straight line on a peace of paper. Now we began to stretch that same line continuously untill the ends meet around the earth. We know the earth is a sphierical shaped and curves along it surface. So at what point will the straight line no longer be considered true straight, given the idea that a curved line is not a straight line. Similar to the way we consider a 0 degree angle is what it is a 90 degree angle,180 degree and so on. Are could it just come in to perspective, saying imagine a wire of malleable propertys representing a straight line then you bend it. It would seem to no longer to be straight, but if you turned it to just the wright angle to your point of view it would  have apperd to have gotten shorter in length but seemingly still straight, but only at that certain angle once vewed from any other perspectives the bend are curve would reveal it self. Perhaps such concepts are partially relalitive to ones self along with general acceptance. A means of measurement, depiction, and placement. Also can anything truly be considered straight, seeing how spacetime is expressed as curved. Well I think I&#39;ve reach a stopping point for now in this ramble thanks again v sauce for the food for thought and for those who read the comments.

Being myself a scientist (PhD Chemistry/Biotech), I am a bit upset by the fact that many scientists are very narrow-minded, which goes against science and knowledge of course; so I am always very happy to see other interesting, open-minded and cool scientists on Earth, that make us see things in different perspectives, making us feel more confident as we can understand better the environment we live in. About today&#39;s topic, I have an analog camera that takes amazing pictures, because it can &quot;see&quot; things we don&#39;t see, it is fantastic. It can make different colors depending on hidden sources of light, heat, and also radioactivity, ...and even &quot;ghosts&quot; inviting themselves in my pictures sometimes, or let&#39;s say &quot;funny&quot; artifacts. This camera is so sensitive to everything, that it is just magic. Most of the times, I understand the physical phenomena behind it. Only for the ghosts, I do not have any rational explanation all the times to explain the artifact behind the effect produced on the film (and not trying to). But anyway, since I watch your videos. I am not afraid anymore of creepy things like that, nor teddy bears with human teeth, nor lady-robots. Anyway, it is said that great scientists are crazy, now I know why as well. That is a question of PERCEPTION, my friends. The most important thing for a scientist is to stay as wise as knowledgeable.

Now what i mean by comfort is the whole fact that so many people are comfortable being miserable, so they don&#39;t move for fear of things getting worse. For example a person lost in the freezing cold \u00a0woods at night may stay in that spot and never move if they have a blanket and a pillow. I don&#39;t know how to word things right but stick with me here for just a sec.

Magnetic and true north. Magnetic north is basically where a compass always points to (well in the southern hemisphere it points South but the Compass and maps were mainly used by northern civilizations).<br>true north is the position the earth is relative to the sun and the axis that the Earth spins on. An old sailing technique is using a scale to compare the angle of the Horizon with the Noon sun (The highest point the sun is in the sky), this creates a certain amount of degrees. On the true equator the Sun is almost directly above you at 0 degrees. In say New York the sun is actually more on the southern part of the sky with a horizon angle of about 42 degrees (This is why latitude coordinates use angular degrees). Both of these are very different.<br>Interesting right? Magnetic north and true north poles are actually hundreds of miles apart.<br>Expand this comment \u00bb<br>Reply<br>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br><br>View all 3 replies<br><br><br><br><br>Ian Wallace<br>2 hours ago<br><br>\u00a0<br>+mazehazeglaze compasses align to both magnetic polls, you can&#39;t have one without the other, it is a product of circumstance that the bulk of our planets land mass lies in the northern hemisphere.\u00a0 If technological advancements in navigation and cartography had originated in Australia, almost certainly the world maps would be oriented with the southern magnetic pole at the top of the map.<br>on a side note, many maps from before the time when magnetic compasses were commonplace show the top of the map as East, which makes sense, as that is the direction from which the life-giving sun doth eternally rise.<br>Read more<br><br>Reply<br>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br>milkduds1001<br>2 hours ago<br><br>\u00a0<br>+mazehazeglaze Actually, it points to the South Pole. This is because the Earths poles are the strongest magnetic point on the planet. That&#39;s the reason aura lights only happen closer to the poles, because the magnetic field is strong enough on those places to interact with charged particles from the Sun.<br>It points south in the southern hemisphere because when you cross the equator heading south you get closer to the southern pole, the magnetic energy from the southern pole becomes stronger than the northern one and so it points south. Compasses point to the strongest magnetic influence and in the south that is the south pole. The reason we have north as north is because a majority of modern 1ST world countries originated in the northern hemisphere. Sumeria, Greece, Rome, China, England, the US etc, most of the greatest civilizations and societies that ever lived have been in the Northern hemisphere, which is why the map is the orientation it is today.<br>Read more<br><br>Reply<br>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<br><br><br><br><br><br>Chava Gonzalez<br>2 hours ago (edited)<br><br><br><br>\u00a0<br>If you crank up the wavelength of the color red to get blue, will cranking up radio wavelengths take you through the visible spectrum of light into ultraviolet?

However much the world may have improved in many respects in the lapse of upward of two thousand years since the remark was made by the virtuous and indignant Roman, I fear that a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective governments would develop similar instances of violated confidence.<br><br>Although the fiat of the people has gone forth proclaiming me the Chief Magistrate of this glorious Union, nothing upon their part remaining to be done, it may be thought that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which they may be supposed to have acted in relation to my principles and opinions; and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepared to condemn those I shall now deliver, or, approving them, to doubt the sincerity with which they are now uttered. But the lapse of a few months will confirm or dispel their fears. The outline of principles to govern and measures to be adopted by an Administration not yet begun will soon be exchanged for immutable history, and I shall stand either exonerated by my countrymen or classed with the mass of those who promised that they might deceive and flattered with the intention to betray. However strong may be my present purpose to realize the expectations of a magnanimous and confiding people, I too well understand the dangerous temptations to which I shall be exposed from the magnitude of the power which it has been the pleasure of the people to commit to my hands not to place my chief confidence upon the aid of that Almighty Power which has hitherto protected me and enabled me to bring to favorable issues other important but still greatly inferior trusts heretofore confided to me by my country.<br><br>The broad foundation upon which our Constitution rests being the people\u2014a breath of theirs having made, as a breath can unmake, change, or modify it\u2014it can be assigned to none of the great divisions of government but to that of democracy. If such is its theory, those who are called upon to administer it must recognize as its leading principle the duty of shaping their measures so as to produce the greatest good to the greatest number. But with these broad admissions, if we would compare the sovereignty acknowledged to exist in the mass of our people with the power claimed by other sovereignties, even by those which have been considered most purely democratic, we shall find a most essential difference. All others lay claim to power limited only by their own will. The majority of our citizens, on the contrary, possess a sovereignty with an amount of power precisely equal to that which has been granted to them by the parties to the national compact, and nothing beyond. We admit of no government by divine right, believing that so far as power is concerned the Beneficent Creator has made no distinction amongst men; that all are upon an equality, and that the only legitimate right to govern is an express grant of power from the governed. The Constitution of the United States is the instrument containing this grant of power to the several departments composing the Government. On an examination of that instrument it will be found to contain declarations of power granted and of power withheld. The latter is also susceptible of division into power which the majority had the right to grant, but which they do not think proper to intrust to their agents, and that which they could not have granted, not being possessed by themselves. In other words, there are certain rights possessed by each individual American citizen which in his compact with the others he has never surrendered. Some of them, indeed, he is unable to surrender, being, in the language of our system, unalienable. The boasted privilege of a Roman citizen was to him a shield only against a petty provincial ruler, whilst the proud democrat of Athens would console himself under a sentence of death for a supposed violation of the national faith\u2014which no one understood and which at times was the subject of the mockery of all\u2014or the banishment from his home, his family, and his country with or without an alleged cause, that it was the act not of a single tyrant or hated aristocracy, but of his assembled countrymen. Far different is the power of our sovereignty. It can interfere with no one\u2019s faith, prescribe forms of worship for no one\u2019s observance, inflict no punishment but after well-ascertained guilt, the result of investigation under rules prescribed by the Constitution itself. These precious privileges, and those scarcely less important of giving expression to his thoughts and opinions, either by writing or speaking, unrestrained but by the liability for injury to others, and that of a full participation in all the advantages which flow from the Government, the acknowledged property of all, the American citizen derives from no charter granted by his fellow-man. He claims them because he is himself a man, fashioned by the same Almighty hand as the rest of his species and entitled to a full share of the blessings with which He has endowed them. Notwithstanding the limited sovereignty possessed by the people of the United States and the restricted grant of power to the Government which they have adopted, enough has been given to accomplish all the objects for which it was created. It has been found powerful in war, and hitherto justice has been administered, and intimate union effected, domestic tranquillity preserved, and personal liberty secured to the citizen. As was to be expected, however, from the defect of language and the necessarily sententious manner in which the Constitution is written, disputes have arisen as to the amount of power which it has actually granted or was intended to grant.<br><br>This is more particularly the case in relation to that part of the instrument which treats of the legislative branch, and not only as regards the exercise of powers claimed under a general clause giving that body the authority to pass all laws necessary to carry into effect the specified powers, but in relation to the latter also. It is, however, consolatory to reflect that most of the instances of alleged departure from the letter or spirit of the Constitution have ultimately received the sanction of a majority of the people. And the fact that many of our statesmen most distinguished for talent and patriotism have been at one time or other of their political career on both sides of each of the most warmly disputed questions forces upon us the inference that the errors, if errors there were, are attributable to the intrinsic difficulty in many instances of ascertaining the intentions of the framers of the Constitution rather than the influence of any sinister or unpatriotic motive. But the great danger to our institutions does not appear to me to be in a usurpation by the Government of power not granted by the people, but by the accumulation in one of the departments of that which was assigned to others. Limited as are the powers which have been granted, still enough have been granted to constitute a despotism if concentrated in one of the departments. This danger is greatly heightened, as it has been always observable that men are less jealous of encroachments of one department upon another than upon their own reserved rights. When the Constitution of the United States first came from the hands of the Convention which formed it, many of the sternest republicans of the day were alarmed at the extent of the power which had been granted to the Federal Government, and more particularly of that portion which had been assigned to the executive branch. There were in it features which appeared not to be in harmony with their ideas of a simple representative democracy or republic, and knowing the tendency of power to increase itself, particularly when exercised by a single individual, predictions were made that at no very remote period the Government would terminate in virtual monarchy. It would not become me to say that the fears of these patriots have been already realized; but as I sincerely believe that the tendency of measures and of men\u2019s opinions for some years past has been in that direction, it is, I conceive, strictly proper that I should take this occasion to repeat the assurances I have heretofore given of my determination to arrest the progress of that tendency if it really exists and restore the Government to its pristine health and vigor, as far as this can be effected by any legitimate exercise of the power placed in my hands.<br><br>I proceed to state in as summary a manner as I can my opinion of the sources of the evils which have been so extensively complained of and the correctives which may be applied. Some of the former are unquestionably to be found in the defects of the Constitution; others, in my judgment, are attributable to a misconstruction of some of its provisions. Of the former is the eligibility of the same individual to a second term of the Presidency. The sagacious mind of Mr. Jefferson early saw and lamented this error, and attempts have been made, hitherto without success, to apply the amendatory power of the States to its correction. As, however, one mode of correction is in the power of every President, and consequently in mine, it would be useless, and perhaps invidious, to enumerate the evils of which, in the opinion of many of our fellow-citizens, this error of the sages who framed the Constitution may have been the source and the bitter fruits which we are still to gather from it if it continues to disfigure our system. It may be observed, however, as a general remark, that republics can commit no greater error than to adopt or continue any feature in their systems of government which may be calculated to create or increase the lover of power in the bosoms of those to whom necessity obliges them to commit the management of their affairs; and surely nothing is more likely to produce such a state of mind than the long continuance of an office of high trust. Nothing can be more corrupting, nothing more destructive of all those noble feelings which belong to the character of a devoted republican patriot. When this corrupting passion once takes possession of the human mind, like the love of gold it becomes insatiable. It is the never-dying worm in his bosom, grows with his growth and strengthens with the declining years of its victim. If this is true, it is the part of wisdom for a republic to limit the service of that officer at least to whom she has intrusted the management of her foreign relations, the execution of her laws, and the command of her armies and navies to a period so short as to prevent his forgetting that he is the accountable agent, not the principal; the servant, not the master. Until an amendment of the Constitution can be effected public opinion may secure the desired object. I give my aid to it by renewing the pledge heretofore given that under no circumstances will I consent to serve a second term.<br><br>But if there is danger to public liberty from the acknowledged defects of the Constitution in the want of limit to the continuance of the Executive power in the same hands, there is, I apprehend, not much less from a misconstruction of that instrument as it regards the powers actually given. I can not conceive that by a fair construction any or either of its provisions would be found to constitute the President a part of the legislative power. It can not be claimed from the power to recommend, since, although enjoined as a duty upon him, it is a privilege which he holds in common with every other citizen; and although there may be something more of confidence in the propriety of the measures recommended in the one case than in the other, in the obligations of ultimate decision there can be no difference. In the language of the Constitution, \u201call the legislative powers\u201d which it grants \u201care vested in the Congress of the United States.\u201d It would be a solecism in language to say that any portion of these is not included in the whole.<br><br>It may be said, indeed, that the Constitution has given to the Executive the power to annul the acts of the legislative body by refusing to them his assent. So a similar power has necessarily resulted from that instrument to the judiciary, and yet the judiciary forms no part of the Legislature. There is, it is true, this difference between these grants of power: The Executive can put his negative upon the acts of the Legislature for other cause than that of want of conformity to the Constitution, whilst the judiciary can only declare void those which violate that instrument. But the decision of the judiciary is final in such a case, whereas in every instance where the veto of the Executive is applied it may be overcome by a vote of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress. The negative upon the acts of the legislative by the executive authority, and that in the hands of one individual, would seem to be an incongruity in our system. Like some others of a similar character, however, it appears to be highly expedient, and if used only with the forbearance and in the spirit which was intended by its authors it may be productive of great good and be found one of the best safeguards to the Union. At the period of the formation of the Constitution the principle does not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the State governments. It existed but in two, and in one of these there was a plural executive. If we would search for the motives which operated upon the purely patriotic and enlightened assembly which framed the Constitution for the adoption of a provision so apparently repugnant to the leading democratic principle that the majority should govern, we must reject the idea that they anticipated from it any benefit to the ordinary course of legislation. They knew too well the high degree of intelligence which existed among the people and the enlightened character of the State legislatures not to have the fullest confidence that the two bodies elected by them would be worthy representatives of such constituents, and, of course, that they would require no aid in conceiving and maturing the measures which the circumstances of the country might require. And it is preposterous to suppose that a thought could for a moment have been entertained that the President, placed at the capital, in the center of the country, could better understand the wants and wishes of the people than their own immediate representatives, who spend a part of every year among them, living with them, often laboring with them, and bound to them by the triple tie of interest, duty, and affection. To assist or control Congress, then, in its ordinary legislation could not, I conceive, have been the motive for conferring the veto power on the President. This argument acquires additional force from the fact of its never having been thus used by the first six Presidents\u2014and two of them were members of the Convention, one presiding over its deliberations and the other bearing a larger share in consummating the labors of that august body than any other person. But if bills were never returned to Congress by either of the Presidents above referred to upon the ground of their being inexpedient or not as well adapted as they might be to the wants of the people, the veto was applied upon that of want of conformity to the Constitution or because errors had been committed from a too hasty enactment.<br><br>There is another ground for the adoption of the veto principle, which had probably more influence in recommending it to the Convention than any other. I refer to the security which it gives to the just and equitable action of the Legislature upon all parts of the Union. It could not but have occurred to the Convention that in a country so extensive, embracing so great a variety of soil and climate, and consequently of products, and which from the same causes must ever exhibit a great difference in the amount of the population of its various sections, calling for a great diversity in the employments of the people, that the legislation of the majority might not always justly regard the rights and interests of the minority, and that acts of this character might be passed under an express grant by the words of the Constitution, and therefore not within the competency of the judiciary to declare void; that however enlightened and patriotic they might suppose from past experience the members of Congress might be, and however largely partaking, in the general, of the liberal feelings of the people, it was impossible to expect that bodies so constituted should not sometimes be controlled by local interests and sectional feelings. It was proper, therefore, to provide some umpire from whose situation and mode of appointment more independence and freedom from such influences might be expected. Such a one was afforded by the executive department constituted by the Constitution. A person elected to that high office, having his constituents in every section, State, and subdivision of the Union, must consider himself bound by the most solemn sanctions to guard, protect, and defend the rights of all and of every portion, great or small, from the injustice and oppression of the rest. I consider the veto power, therefore, given by the Constitution to the Executive of the United States solely as a conservative power, to be used only first, to protect the Constitution from violation; secondly, the people from the effects of hasty legislation where their will has been probably disregarded or not well understood, and, thirdly, to prevent the effects of combinations violative of the rights of minorities. In reference to the second of these objects I may observe that I consider it the right and privilege of the people to decide disputed points of the Constitution arising from the general grant of power to Congress to carry into effect the powers expressly given; and I believe with Mr. Madison that \u201crepeated recognitions under varied circumstances in acts of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the Government, accompanied by indications in different modes of the concurrence of the general will of the nation,\u201d as affording to the President sufficient authority for his considering such disputed points as settled.<br><br>Upward of half a century has elapsed since the adoption of the present form of government. It would be an object more highly desirable than the gratification of the curiosity of speculative statesmen if its precise situation could be ascertained, a fair exhibit made of the operations of each of its departments, of the powers which they respectively claim and exercise, of the collisions which have occurred between them or between the whole Government and those of the States or either of them. We could then compare our actual condition after fifty years\u2019 trial of our system with what it was in the commencement of its operations and ascertain whether the predictions of the patriots who opposed its adoption or the confident hopes of its advocates have been best realized. The great dread of the former seems to have been that the reserved powers of the States would be absorbed by those of the Federal Government and a consolidated power established, leaving to the States the shadow only of that independent action for which they had so zealously contended and on the preservation of which they relied as the last hope of liberty. Without denying that the result to which they looked with so much apprehension is in the way of being realized, it is obvious that they did not clearly see the mode of its accomplishment. The General Government has seized upon none of the reserved rights of the States. As far as any open warfare may have gone, the State authorities have amply maintained their rights. To a casual observer our system presents no appearance of discord between the different members which compose it. Even the addition of many new ones has produced no jarring. They move in their respective orbits in perfect harmony with the central head and with each other. But there is still an undercurrent at work by which, if not seasonably checked, the worst apprehensions of our antifederal patriots will be realized, and not only will the State authorities be overshadowed by the great increase of power in the executive department of the General Government, but the character of that Government, if not its designation, be essentially and radically changed. This state of things has been in part effected by causes inherent in the Constitution and in part by the never-failing tendency of political power to increase itself. By making the President the sole distributer of all the patronage of the Government the framers of the Constitution do not appear to have anticipated at how short a period it would become a formidable instrument to control the free operations of the State governments. Of trifling importance at first, it had early in Mr. Jefferson\u2019s Administration become so powerful as to create great alarm in the mind of that patriot from the potent influence it might exert in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise. If such could have then been the effects of its influence, how much greater must be the danger at this time, quadrupled in amount as it certainly is and more completely under the control of the Executive will than their construction of their powers allowed or the forbearing characters of all the early Presidents permitted them to make. But it is not by the extent of its patronage alone that the executive department has become dangerous, but by the use which it appears may be made of the appointing power to bring under its control the whole revenues of the country. The Constitution has declared it to be the duty of the President to see that the laws are executed, and it makes him the Commander in Chief of the Armies and Navy of the United States. If the opinion of the most approved writers upon that species of mixed government which in modern Europe is termed monarchy in contradistinction to despotism is correct, there was wanting no other addition to the powers of our Chief Magistrate to stamp a monarchical character on our Government but the control of the public finances; and to me it appears strange indeed that anyone should doubt that the entire control which the President possesses over the officers who have the custody of the public money, by the power of removal with or without cause, does, for all mischievous purposes at least, virtually subject the treasure also to his disposal. The first Roman Emperor, in his attempt to seize the sacred treasure, silenced the opposition of the officer to whose charge it had been committed by a significant allusion to his sword. By a selection of political instruments for the care of the public money a reference to their commissions by a President would be quite as effectual an argument as that of Caesar to the Roman knight. I am not insensible of the great difficulty that exists in drawing a proper plan for the safe-keeping and disbursement of the public revenues, and I know the importance which has been attached by men of great abilities and patriotism to the divorce, as it is called, of the Treasury from the banking institutions. It is not the divorce which is complained of, but the unhallowed union of the Treasury with the executive department, which has created such extensive alarm. To this danger to our republican institutions and that created by the influence given to the Executive through the instrumentality of the Federal officers I propose to apply all the remedies which may be at my command. It was certainly a great error in the framers of the Constitution not to have made the officer at the head of the Treasury Department entirely independent of the Executive. He should at least have been removable only upon the demand of the popular branch of the Legislature. I have determined never to remove a Secretary of the Treasury without communicating all the circumstances attending such removal to both Houses of Congress.<br><br>The influence of the Executive in controlling the freedom of the elective franchise through the medium of the public officers can be effectually checked by renewing the prohibition published by Mr. Jefferson forbidding their interference in elections further than giving their own votes, and their own independence secured by an assurance of perfect immunity in exercising this sacred privilege of freemen under the dictates of their own unbiased judgments. Never with my consent shall an officer of the people, compensated for his services out of their pockets, become the pliant instrument of Executive will.<br><br>There is no part of the means placed in the hands of the Executive which might be used with greater effect for unhallowed purposes than the control of the public press. The maxim which our ancestors derived from the mother country that \u201cthe freedom of the press is the great bulwark of civil and religious liberty\u201d is one of the most precious legacies which they have left us. We have learned, too, from our own as well as the experience of other countries, that golden shackles, by whomsoever or by whatever pretense imposed, are as fatal to it as the iron bonds of despotism. The presses in the necessary employment of the Government should never be used \u201cto clear the guilty or to varnish crime.\u201d A decent and manly examination of the acts of the Government should be not only tolerated, but encouraged.<br><br>Upon another occasion I have given my opinion at some length upon the impropriety of Executive interference in the legislation of Congress\u2014that the article in the Constitution making it the duty of the President to communicate information and authorizing him to recommend measures was not intended to make him the source in legislation, and, in particular, that he should never be looked to for schemes of finance. It would be very strange, indeed, that the Constitution should have strictly forbidden one branch of the Legislature from interfering in the origination of such bills and that it should be considered proper that an altogether different department of the Government should be permitted to do so. Some of our best political maxims and opinions have been drawn from our parent isle. There are others, however, which can not be introduced in our system without singular incongruity and the production of much mischief, and this I conceive to be one. No matter in which of the houses of Parliament a bill may originate nor by whom introduced\u2014a minister or a member of the opposition\u2014by the fiction of law, or rather of constitutional principle, the sovereign is supposed to have prepared it agreeably to his will and then submitted it to Parliament for their advice and consent. Now the very reverse is the case here, not only with regard to the principle, but the forms prescribed by the Constitution. The principle certainly assigns to the only body constituted by the Constitution (the legislative body) the power to make laws, and the forms even direct that the enactment should be ascribed to them. The Senate, in relation to revenue bills, have the right to propose amendments, and so has the Executive by the power given him to return them to the House of Representatives with his objections. It is in his power also to propose amendments in the existing revenue laws, suggested by his observations upon their defective or injurious operation. But the delicate duty of devising schemes of revenue should be left where the Constitution has placed it\u2014with the immediate representatives of the people. For similar reasons the mode of keeping the public treasure should be prescribed by them, and the further removed it may be from the control of the Executive the more wholesome the arrangement and the more in accordance with republican principle.<br><br>Connected with this subject is the character of the currency. The idea of making it exclusively metallic, however well intended, appears to me to be fraught with more fatal consequences than any other scheme having no relation to the personal rights of the citizens that has ever been devised. If any single scheme could produce the effect of arresting at once that mutation of condition by which thousands of our most indigent fellow-citizens by their industry and enterprise are raised to the possession of wealth, that is the one. If there is one measure better calculated than another to produce that state of things so much deprecated by all true republicans, by which the rich are daily adding to their hoards and the poor sinking deeper into penury, it is an exclusive metallic currency. Or if there is a process by which the character of the country for generosity and nobleness of feeling may be destroyed by the great increase and neck toleration of usury, it is an exclusive metallic currency.<br><br>Amongst the other duties of a delicate character which the President is called upon to perform is the supervision of the government of the Territories of the United States. Those of them which are destined to become members of our great political family are compensated by their rapid progress from infancy to manhood for the partial and temporary deprivation of their political rights. It is in this District only where American citizens are to be found who under a settled policy are deprived of many important political privileges without any inspiring hope as to the future. Their only consolation under circumstances of such deprivation is that of the devoted exterior guards of a camp\u2014that their sufferings secure tranquillity and safety within. Are there any of their countrymen, who would subject them to greater sacrifices, to any other humiliations than those essentially necessary to the security of the object for which they were thus separated from their fellow-citizens? Are their rights alone not to be guaranteed by the application of those great principles upon which all our constitutions are founded? We are told by the greatest of British orators and statesmen that at the commencement of the War of the Revolution the most stupid men in England spoke of \u201ctheir American subjects.\u201d Are there, indeed, citizens of any of our States who have dreamed of their subjects in the District of Columbia? Such dreams can never be realized by any agency of mine. The people of the District of Columbia are not the subjects of the people of the States, but free American citizens. Being in the latter condition when the Constitution was formed, no words used in that instrument could have been intended to deprive them of that character. If there is anything in the great principle of unalienable rights so emphatically insisted upon in our Declaration of Independence, they could neither make nor the United States accept a surrender of their liberties and become the subjects\u2014in other words, the slaves of their former fellow-citizens. If this be true\u2014and it will scarcely be denied by anyone who has a correct idea of his own rights as an American citizen\u2014the grant to Congress of exclusive jurisdiction in the District of Columbia can be interpreted, so far as respects the aggregate people of the United States, as meaning nothing more than to allow to Congress the controlling power necessary to afford a free and safe exercise of the functions assigned to the General Government by the Constitution. In all other respects the legislation of Congress should be adapted to their peculiar position and wants and be conformable with their deliberate opinions of their own interests.<br><br>I have spoken of the necessity of keeping the respective departments of the Government, as well as all the other authorities of our country, within their appropriate orbits. This is a matter of difficulty in some cases, as the powers which they respectively claim are often not defined by any distinct lines. Mischievous, however, in their tendencies as collisions of this kind may be, those which arise between the respective communities which for certain purposes compose one nation are much more so, for no such nation can long exist without the careful culture of those feelings of confidence and affection which are the effective bonds to union between free and confederated states. Strong as is the tie of interest, it has been often found ineffectual. Men blinded by their passions have been known to adopt measures for their country in direct opposition to all the suggestions of policy. The alternative, then, is to destroy or keep down a bad passion by creating and fostering a good one, and this seems to be the corner stone upon which our American political architects have reared the fabric of our Government. The cement which was to bind it and perpetuate its existence was the affectionate attachment between all its members. To insure the continuance of this feeling, produced at first by a community of dangers, of sufferings, and of interests, the advantages of each were made accessible to all. No participation in any good possessed by any member of our extensive Confederacy, except in domestic government, was withheld from the citizen of any other member. By a process attended with no difficulty, no delay, no expense but that of removal, the citizen of one might become the citizen of any other, and successively of the whole. The lines, too, separating powers to be exercised by the citizens of one State from those of another seem to be so distinctly drawn as to leave no room for misunderstanding. The citizens of each State unite in their persons all the privileges which that character confers and all that they may claim as citizens of the United States, but in no case can the same persons at the same time act as the citizen of two separate States, and he is therefore positively precluded from any interference with the reserved powers of any State but that of which he is for the time being a citizen. He may, indeed, offer to the citizens of other States his advice as to their management, and the form in which it is tendered is left to his own discretion and sense of propriety. It may be observed, however, that organized associations of citizens requiring compliance with their wishes too much resemble the recommendations of Athens to her allies, supported by an armed and powerful fleet. It was, indeed, to the ambition of the leading States of Greece to control the domestic concerns of the others that the destruction of that celebrated Confederacy, and subsequently of all its members, is mainly to be attributed, and it is owing to the absence of that spirit that the Helvetic Confederacy has for so many years been preserved. Never has there been seen in the institutions of the separate members of any confederacy more elements of discord. In the principles and forms of government and religion, as well as in the circumstances of the several Cantons, so marked a discrepancy was observable as to promise anything but harmony in their intercourse or permanency in their alliance, and yet for ages neither has been interrupted. Content with the positive benefits which their union produced, with the independence and safety from foreign aggression which it secured, these sagacious people respected the institutions of each other, however repugnant to their own principles and prejudices.<br><br>Our Confederacy, fellow-citizens, can only be preserved by the same forbearance. Our citizens must be content with the exercise of the powers with which the Constitution clothes them. The attempt of those of one State to control the domestic institutions of another can only result in feelings of distrust and jealousy, the certain harbingers of disunion, violence, and civil war, and the ultimate destruction of our free institutions. Our Confederacy is perfectly illustrated by the terms and principles governing a common copartnership. There is a fund of power to be exercised under the direction of the joint councils of the allied members, but that which has been reserved by the individual members is intangible by the common Government or the individual members composing it. To attempt it finds no support in the principles of our Constitution.<br><br>It should be our constant and earnest endeavor mutually to cultivate a spirit of concord and harmony among the various parts of our Confederacy. Experience has abundantly taught us that the agitation by citizens of one part of the Union of a subject not confided to the General Government, but exclusively under the guardianship of the local authorities, is productive of no other consequences than bitterness, alienation, discord, and injury to the very cause which is intended to be advanced. Of all the great interests which appertain to our country, that of union\u2014cordial, confiding, fraternal union\u2014is by far the most important, since it is the only true and sure guaranty of all others.<br><br>In consequence of the embarrassed state of business and the currency, some of the States may meet with difficulty in their financial concerns. However deeply we may regret anything imprudent or excessive in the engagements into which States have entered for purposes of their own, it does not become us to disparage the States governments, nor to discourage them from making proper efforts for their own relief. On the contrary, it is our duty to encourage them to the extent of our constitutional authority to apply their best means and cheerfully to make all necessary sacrifices and submit to all necessary burdens to fulfill their engagements and maintain their credit, for the character and credit of the several States form a part of the character and credit of the whole country. The resources of the country are abundant, the enterprise and activity of our people proverbial, and we may well hope that wise legislation and prudent administration by the respective governments, each acting within its own sphere, will restore former prosperity.<br><br>Unpleasant and even dangerous as collisions may sometimes be between the constituted authorities of the citizens of our country in relation to the lines which separate their respective jurisdictions, the results can be of no vital injury to our institutions if that ardent patriotism, that devoted attachment to liberty, that spirit of moderation and forbearance for which our countrymen were once distinguished, continue to be cherished. If this continues to be the ruling passion of our souls, the weaker feeling of the mistaken enthusiast will be corrected, the Utopian dreams of the scheming politician dissipated, and the complicated intrigues of the demagogue rendered harmless. The spirit of liberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our institutions may receive. On the contrary, no care that can be used in the construction of our Government, no division of powers, no distribution of checks in its several departments, will prove effectual to keep us a free people if this spirit is suffered to decay; and decay it will without constant nurture. To the neglect of this duty the best historians agree in attributing the ruin of all the republics with whose existence and fall their writings have made us acquainted. The same causes will ever produce the same effects, and as long as the love of power is a dominant passion of the human bosom, and as long as the understandings of men can be warped and their affections changed by operations upon their passions and prejudices, so long will the liberties of a people depend on their own constant attention to its preservation. The danger to all well-established free governments arises from the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or from the influence of designing men diverting their attention from the quarter whence it approaches to a source from which it can never come. This is the old trick of those who would usurp the government of their country. In the name of democracy they speak, warning the people against the influence of wealth and the danger of aristocracy. History, ancient and modern, is full of such examples. Caesar became the master of the Roman people and the senate under the pretense of supporting the democratic claims of the former against the aristocracy of the latter; Cromwell, in the character of protector of the liberties of the people, became the dictator of England, and Bolivar possessed himself of unlimited power with the title of his country\u2019s liberator. There is, on the contrary, no instance on record of an extensive and well-established republic being changed into an aristocracy. The tendencies of all such governments in their decline is to monarchy, and the antagonist principle to liberty there is the spirit of faction\u2014a spirit which assumes the character and in times of great excitement imposes itself upon the people as the genuine spirit of freedom, and, like the false Christs whose coming was foretold by the Savior, seeks to, and were it possible would, impose upon the true and most faithful disciples of liberty. It is in periods like this that it behooves the people to be most watchful of those to whom they have intrusted power. And although there is at times much difficulty in distinguishing the false from the true spirit, a calm and dispassionate investigation will detect the counterfeit, as well by the character of its operations as the results that are produced. The true spirit of liberty, although devoted, persevering, bold, and uncompromising in principle, that secured is mild and tolerant and scrupulous as to the means it employs, whilst the spirit of party, assuming to be that of liberty, is harsh, vindictive, and intolerant, and totally reckless as to the character of the allies which it brings to the aid of its cause. When the genuine spirit of liberty animates the body of a people to a thorough examination of their affairs, it leads to the excision of every excrescence which may have fastened itself upon any of the departments of the government, and restores the system to its pristine health and beauty. But the reign of an intolerant spirit of party amongst a free people seldom fails to result in a dangerous accession to the executive power introduced and established amidst unusual professions of devotion to democracy.<br><br>The foregoing remarks relate almost exclusively to matters connected with our domestic concerns. It may be proper, however, that I should give some indications to my fellow-citizens of my proposed course of conduct in the management of our foreign relations. I assure them, therefore, that it is my intention to use every means in my power to preserve the friendly intercourse which now so happily subsists with every foreign nation, and that although, of course, not well informed as to the state of pending negotiations with any of them, I see in the personal characters of the sovereigns, as well as in the mutual interests of our own and of the governments with which our relations are most intimate, a pleasing guaranty that the harmony so important to the interests of their subjects as well as of our citizens will not be interrupted by the advancement of any claim or pretension upon their part to which our honor would not permit us to yield. Long the defender of my country\u2019s rights in the field, I trust that my fellow-citizens will not see in my earnest desire to preserve peace with foreign powers any indication that their rights will ever be sacrificed or the honor of the nation tarnished by any admission on the part of their Chief Magistrate unworthy of their former glory. In our intercourse with our aboriginal neighbors the same liberality and justice which marked the course prescribed to me by two of my illustrious predecessors when acting under their direction in the discharge of the duties of superintendent and commissioner shall be strictly observed. I can conceive of no more sublime spectacle, none more likely to propitiate an impartial and common Creator, than a rigid adherence to the principles of justice on the part of a powerful nation in its transactions with a weaker and uncivilized people whom circumstances have placed at its disposal.<br><br>Before concluding, fellow-citizens, I must say something to you on the subject of the parties at this time existing in our country. To me it appears perfectly clear that the interest of that country requires that the violence of the spirit by which those parties are at this time governed must be greatly mitigated, if not entirely extinguished, or consequences will ensue which are appalling to be thought of.<br><br>If parties in a republic are necessary to secure a degree of vigilance sufficient to keep the public functionaries within the bounds of law and duty, at that point their usefulness ends. Beyond that they become destructive of public virtue, the parent of a spirit antagonist to that of liberty, and eventually its inevitable conqueror, We have examples of republics where the love of country and of liberty at one time were the dominant passions of the whole mass of citizens, and yet, with the continuance of the name and forms of free government, not a vestige of these qualities remaining in the bosoms of any one of its citizens. It was the beautiful remark of a distinguished English writer that \u201cin the Roman senate Octavius had a party and Anthony a party, but the Commonwealth had none.\u201d Yet the senate continued to meet in the temple of liberty to talk of the sacredness and beauty of the Commonwealth and gaze at the statues of the elder Brutus and of the Curtii and Decii, and the people assembled in the forum, not, as in the days of Camillus and the Scipios, to cast their free votes for annual magistrates or pass upon the acts of the senate, but to receive from the hands of the leaders of the respective parties their share of the spoils and to shout for one or the other, as those collected in Gaul or Egypt and the lesser Asia would furnish the larger dividend. The spirit of liberty had fled, and, avoiding the abodes of civilized man, had sought protection in the wilds of Scythia or Scandinavia; and so under the operation of the same causes and influences it will fly from our Capitol and our forums. A calamity so awful, not only to our country, but to the world, must be deprecated by every patriot and every tendency to a state of things likely to produce it immediately checked. Such a tendency has existed\u2014does exist. Always the friend of my countrymen, never their flatterer, it becomes my duty to say to them from this high place to which their partiality has exalted me that there exists in the land a spirit hostile to their best interests\u2014hostile to liberty itself. It is a spirit contracted in its views, selfish in its objects. It looks to the aggrandizement of a few even to the destruction of the interests of the whole. The entire remedy is with the people. Something, however, may be effected by the means which they have placed in my hands. It is union that we want, not of a party for the sake of that party, but a union of the whole country for the sake of the whole country, for the defense of its interests and its honor against foreign aggression, for the defense of those principles for which our ancestors so gloriously contended. As far as it depends upon me it shall be accomplished. All the influence that I possess shall be exerted to prevent the formation at least of an Executive party in the halls of the legislative body. I wish for the support of no member of that body to any measure of mine that does not satisfy his judgment and his sense of duty to those from whom he holds his appointment, nor any confidence in advance from the people but that asked for by Mr. Jefferson, \u201cto give firmness and effect to the legal administration of their affairs.\u201d<br><br>I deem the present occasion sufficiently important and solemn to justify me in expressing to my fellow-citizens a profound reverence for the Christian religion and a thorough conviction that sound morals, religious liberty, and a just sense of religious responsibility are essentially connected with all true and lasting happiness; and to that good Being who has blessed us by the gifts of civil and religious freedom, who watched over and prospered the labors of our fathers and has hitherto preserved to us institutions far exceeding in excellence those of any other people, let us unite in fervently commending every interest of our beloved country in all future time.<br><br>Fellow-citizens, being fully invested with that high office to which the partiality of my countrymen has called me, I now take an affectionate leave of you. You will bear with you to your homes the remembrance of the pledge I have this day given to discharge all the high duties of my exalted station according to the best of my ability, and I shall enter upon their performance with entire confidence in the support of a just and generous people.", "comment_date": "2013-11-13T22:57:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Chiaramonte", "comment_text": "\u00a0<br>(\u0482._.) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0People of\u00a0the\u00a0YouTube\u00a0we must\u00a0stop the stupid bob thing!<br>\u00a0 &lt;,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Grab a weapon and copy and paste this!<br>\u00a0/&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\\======= \u00a0 \u00a0 ,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500 \u00a0 ,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500 \u00a0 ,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500 \u00a0 ,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500 \u00a0 ,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500\u00a0<br>\u00a0/&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\\ \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500 \u00a0 ,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500 \u00a0,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500 \u00a0 \u00a0,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500 \u00a0,\ufe3b\u2566\u2564\u2500", "comment_date": "2013-11-13T22:57:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GabrielTranceSanchez", "comment_text": "\u263b/ This is Bob.

I was nervous. It&#39;s strange, I&#39;m almost never nervous on stage, so why am I nervous now? I looked over at Brooke, who had her headphones in. I shook her shoulder just in time for the ding to sound off, letting us off the plane.<br><br>I am not looking forward to the bus drive with Miss Abby. She needs to stop bugging the bus driver and let him do his job. None of us were going to tell her that though.<br><br>The only thing that was keeping me from running away and not getting on the bus was the fact that literally EVERYONE in forks has cable. You can&#39;t watch Dance Moms on cable. Maybe I could actually live normally for once. (A/N: I have NO idea if this is true. Just try to believe it for the sake of the storyline)<br><br>It only took about an hour for the bus to stop in Forks for half of us to get out. We would have gone all the way to Seattle, but since Charlie was here, he asked my mom to move into the house a few blocks away from them so I could stay close to them. With me going there, Brooke was took, which obviously means Paige, and sense Paige was going, Chloe convinced her mom too take her here too. So the people who are going to live in Seattle are Maddie, Mackenzie, Nia, Asia, Kendall and of course, Miss Abby.<br><br>I got out to look at my new home. It was big, bigger than the other houses on this street, but not as big as my old Pittsburgh home. I looked to see the two large moving trucks that must have followed our bus. The moving men took the boxes labeled &quot;Renee&quot; and &quot;Bella&quot; and set them in the empty living room of our house. I looked out to wave at all the girls with their faces pressed up against the bus windows as the bus started to leave.<br><br>I looked back into the house. It was definantely nicer on the inside. I grabbed one of the many boxes labeled &quot;Bella Dance&quot; and took it up the the room we previously decided would be the room for all of my dance things. When I got up there, there was already shelves, two dressers, and a desk. Probably Charlie. I opened the first box, costumes. All of them were up on hangers in the closet fifteen minutes later.<br><br>13 boxes later, the dance room was unpacked. Now for my room. As I was walking downstairs to get more boxes. My phone buzzed in my pocket. I picked it up, it said: One New Message From: Brooke H.<br><br>Brooke: Can I come over when we are done packing? I have something awesome to tell you. :)<br><br>I texted back: Sure :) I&#39;ll tell you when.<br><br>I sighed, all the boxes were done. I texted Brooke to tell her that now was a good time to come over, and sat down on my bed and pulled out a book to wait.<br><br>Only a few minutes later, I heard a knock at the door. I rushed downstairs to open it. &quot;Guess what?&quot; she said right away.<br><br>&quot;What?&quot; I asked. &quot;Wait- come to my room.&quot; She followed me up to my room, we didn&#39;t need to shut the door because my mom and Phil were grocery shopping.<br><br>&quot;So,&quot; she said. &quot;When you got off the bus I was talking to Miss Abby, and she said that she made sure we were in ALL of the same classes!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Awesome!&quot; I said. &quot;Why though?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure, but I&#39;m thinking she doesn&#39;t want us to make more friends.&quot; I nodded, it isn&#39;t as bad as it sounds. Abby thinks that every friend that doesn&#39;t dance is a distraction from dance. Either way, it was cool.<br><br>&quot;And,&quot; she continued. &quot;People are already buzzing about the new girls from Pennsylvania.&quot; I sighed. Small town, that&#39;s what you get. &quot;Of course, they all have cable, so no Dance Moms.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s a relief,&quot; I said. It was.<br><br>&quot;Can you come over to my house and help me unpack dance stuff? I have a lot.&quot; she said. I laughed.<br><br>&quot;Sure, how far is it?&quot;<br>&quot;Only a few minute walk.&quot;\u00a0<br>&quot;Okay, let&#39;s go.&quot; We walked down the street, and I noticed that Brooke was right about the town buzzing. We only passed a few houses, and whenever we passed someone who was on a walk, they would stop in their tracks and stare from across the street. It was weird.<br><br>We got to her house and Chloe was there helping Paige. Both of them had boxes in their arms, piled up so high that they covered their faces.<br><br>I grabbed one from Chloe, and Brooke grabbed one from Paige as we walked upstairs. &quot;Hey Chlo, Paige.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hey Bells&quot; they said in unison. Brooke and Paige have a dance room too, and we helped unpack that room after their rooms.<br><br>&quot;Okay,&quot; I said &quot;I should get going now, it&#39;s dinner time.&quot; Brooke nodded, and started to walk me out.<br><br>&quot;Do you want me to pick you up tomorrow?&quot; I asked. I had a liscense, while she still only had a permit.<br><br>&quot;Yeah that&#39;d be good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;See ya then.&quot; I walked home, and I was right, dinner was ready.

This may be a very silly question. However, I&#39;m hoping it is understandable.<br><br>\u00a0 Some animals can see through a greater spectrum of light than others. That being the case- I wonder how specific animals can effectively hide from multiple predators. For example lets say an animal uses camouflage as a defense against a variety of predators. What if each predatory animal has a different perception of light? Wouldn&#39;t there be a possibility for one animal to see it better than the other, making the prey&#39;s defense ineffective? If one animal can see a color which the other can not see, or if it see colors more vibrantly than the other, could it be possible that the effects of camouflage would also differ between species?

He felt that he ought to have disdaimed that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him in Father Zossima&#39;s cell, and so to have forgotten himself. &quot;Teh monks were not to blame, in any case,&quot; he reflceted, on the steps. &quot;And if they&#39;re decent people here (and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman) why not be friendly and courteous withthem? I won&#39;t argue, I&#39;ll fall in with everything, I&#39;ll win them by politness, and show them that I&#39;ve nothing to do with that Aesop, thta buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been takken in over this affair, just as they have.&quot;<br><br>He determined to drop his litigation with the monastry, and relinguish his claims to the wood-cuting and fishery rihgts at once. He was the more ready to do this becuase the rights had becom much less valuable, and he had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in quedtion were.<br><br>These excellant intentions were strengthed when he enterd the Father Superior&#39;s diniing-room, though, stricttly speakin, it was not a dining-room, for the Father Superior had only two rooms alltogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima&#39;s. But tehre was was no great luxury about the furnishng of these rooms eithar. The furniture was of mohogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashionned style of 1820 the floor was not even stained, but evreything was shining with cleanlyness, and there were many chioce flowers in the windows; the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beatifuly decorated table. The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas -- both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neigborhood. There was no vodka. Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-suop made of sterlets, served with little fish paties; then boiled fish served in a spesial way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange. Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he already had a footing. He had a footting everywhere, and got informaiton about everything. He was of an uneasy and envious temper. He was well aware of his own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his self-conceit. He knew he would play a prominant part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached to him, was distressed to see that his friend Rakitin was dishonorble, and quite unconscios of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he would not steal moneey left on the table he was a man of the highest integrity. Neither Alyosha nor anyone else could have infleunced him in that.<br><br>Rakitin, of course, was a person of tooo little consecuense to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paissy, and one othr monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited. They were alraedy waiting when Miusov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his guests. He was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black hair streakd with grey, and a long, grave, ascetic face. He bowed to his guests in silence. But this time they approaced to receive his blessing. Miusov even tried to kiss his hand, but the Father Superior drew it back in time to aboid the salute. But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his hand as peesants do.<br><br>&quot;We must apologize most humbly, your reverance,&quot; began Miusov, simpering affably, and speakin in a dignified and respecful tone. &quot;Pardonus for having come alone without the genttleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitalty, and not wihtout reason. In the reverand Father Zossima&#39;s cell he was carried away by the unhappy dissention with his son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping... in fact, quite unseamly... as&quot; -- he glanced at the monks -- &quot;your reverance is, no doubt, already aware. And therefore, recognising that he had been to blame, he felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his apologees and regrets. In brief, he hopes and desires to make amends later. He asks your blessinq, and begs you to forget what has takn place.&quot;<br><br>As he utterred the last word of his terade, Miusov completely recovered his self-complecency, and all traces of his former iritation disappaered. He fuly and sincerelly loved humanity again.<br><br>The Father Superior listened to him with diginity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied:<br><br>&quot;I sincerly deplore his absence. Perhaps at our table he might have learnt to like us, and we him. Pray be seated, gentlemen.&quot;<br><br>He stood before the holly image, and began to say grace, aloud. All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his hands before him, with peculier fervor.<br><br>It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his last prank. It must be noted that he realy had meant to go home, and really had felt the imposibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happenned, after his disgraceful behavoir in the elder&#39;s cell. Not that he was so very much ashamed of himself -- quite the contrary perhaps. But still he felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner. Yet hiscreaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he had hardly got into it, when he sudddenly stoped short. He remembered his own words at the elder&#39;s: &quot;I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.&quot; He longed to revenge himself on everone for his own unseemliness. He suddenly recalled how he had once in the past been asked, &quot;Why do you hate so and so, so much?&quot; And he had answered them, with his shaemless impudence, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you. He has done me no harm. But I played him a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him.&quot;<br><br>Rememebering that now, he smiled quietly and malignently, hesitating for a moment. His eyes gleamed, and his lips positively quivered.<br><br>&quot;Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,&quot; he decided. His predominant sensation at that moment might be expresed in the folowing words, &quot;Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now. So let me shame them for all I am worht. I will show them I don&#39;t care what they think -- that&#39;s all!&quot;<br><br>He told the caochman to wait, while with rapid steps he returnd to the monastery and staight to the Father Superior&#39;s. He had no clear idea what he would do, but he knew that he could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him to the utmost limits of obsenity, but only to obsenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he couldbe legally punished. In the last resort, he could always restrain himself, and had marvelled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. He appeered in the Father Superior&#39;s dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table. Standing in the doorway, he scanned the company, and laughing his prolonged, impudent, malicius chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face. &quot;They thought I had gone, and here I am again,&quot; he cried to the wholle room.<br><br>For one moment everyone stared at him withot a word; and at once everyone felt that someting revolting, grotescue, positively scandalous, was about to happen. Miusov passed immeditaely from the most benevolen frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his heart revived instantly.<br><br>&quot;No! this I cannot endure!&quot; he cried. &quot;I absolutly cannot! and... I certainly cannot!&quot;<br><br>The blood rushed to his head. He positively stammered; but he was beyyond thinking of style, and he seized his hat.<br><br>&quot;What is it he cannot?&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, &quot;that he absolutely cannot and certanly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you recieve me as your guest?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You are welcome with all my heart,&quot; answerred the Superior. &quot;Gentlemen!&quot; he added, &quot;I venture to beg you most earnesly to lay aside your dissentions, and to be united in love and family harmoni- with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, no, it is impossible!&quot; cryed Miusov, beside himself.<br><br>&quot;Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won&#39;t stop. That is why I came. I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain. You stung him by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior, he does not admit he is my realtion. That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Here&#39;s von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Do you mean me?&quot; mutered Maximov, puzzled.<br><br>&quot;Of course I mean you,&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. &quot;Who else? The Father Superior cuold not be von Sohn.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was? It was a famos murder case. He was killed in a house of harlotry -- I believe that is what such places are called among you- he was killed and robed, and in spite of his venarable age, he was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the lugage van, and while they were nailling him up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano. So this is that very von Solin. He has risen from the dead, hasn&#39;t he, von Sohn?&quot;<br><br>&quot;What is happening? What&#39;s this?&quot; voices were heard in the groop of monks.<br><br>&quot;Let us go,&quot; cried Miusov, addresing Kalganov.<br><br>&quot;No, excuse me,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another stepinto the room. &quot;Allow me to finis. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfuly just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Miusov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincerite in his words, but I prefer in mine plus de sincerite que de noblesse, and -- damn the noblesse! That&#39;s right, isn&#39;t it, von Sohn? Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind. Yes, I am teh soul of honour, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else. I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his father; I care for his welfare, and it is my duty to care. While I&#39;ve been playing the fool, I have been listening and havig a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performence. You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has falen, so it must lie for ever. Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignent with you. Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneal down and confess aloud. Can it be right to confess aloud? It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in sercet: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old. But how can I explain to him before everyone that I did this and that... well, you understand what -- sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it -- so it is really a scandal! No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say.... att the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.&quot;<br><br>We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew whree to look for the weak spot. There had been at one time malicius rumors which had even reached the Archbishop (not only regarding our monastery, but in others where the instutition of elders existed) that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detrement of the auhtority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on -- absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere. But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch and was bearring him on the curent of his own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him with this old slander. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneelling and confesing aloud in the elder&#39;s cell, so that he could not have seen anything of the kind. He was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. But as soon as he had uttered his foolish tirade, he felt he had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his audiance, and above all to himself, that he had not been talking nonsense. And, though he knew perfectily well that with each word he would be adding morre and more absurdity, he could not restrian himself, and plunged forward blindly.<br><br>&quot;How disgraveful!&quot; cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch.<br><br>&quot;Pardon me!&quot; said the Father Superior. &quot;It was said of old, &#39;Many have begun to speak agains me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correcsion of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.&#39; And so we humbely thank you, honored geust!&quot; and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow.<br><br>&quot;Tut -- tut -- tut -- sanctimoniuosness and stock phrases! Old phrasses and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostratoins. We know all about them. A kisss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller&#39;s Robbers. I don&#39;t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the trut is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclam aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being vittuous in the world, do good to society, without shuting yourself up in a monastery at other people&#39;s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it -- you&#39;ll find taht a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?&quot; He went up to the table. &quot;Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax-gaterer! You bleed the people, you know, holy Fathers.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is too disgraceful!&quot; said Father Iosif.<br><br>Father Paissy kept obsinately silent. Miusov rushed from the room, and Kalgonov afetr him.<br><br>&quot;Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again. You may beg me on your knees, I shan&#39;t come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me. He he he! No, I&#39;ll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humillition I endured.&quot; He thumped the table with his fist in a paroxysm of simulated feelling. &quot;This monastery has played a great part in my life! It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place. Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalizm, the age of steamers and reilways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred ruobles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!&quot;<br><br>It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his liffe, and he never had shed a bitter tear owing to it. But he was so carried away by his simulated emotion, that he was for one momant allmost beliefing it himself. He was so touched he was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he felt that it was time to draw back.<br><br>The Father Superior bowed his head at his malicious lie, and again spoke impressively:<br><br>&quot;It is writen again, &#39;Bear circumspecly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him who hath dishonored thee.&#39; And so will we.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselfs Fathers, I will go. But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me. Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha. We will have dinner with some brendy and liqueur to it.... I&#39;ve cloudberry wyne. Hey, von Sohn, don&#39;t lose your chance.&quot; He went out, shuoting and gesticulating.<br><br>It was at that moment Rakitin saw him and pointed him out to Alyosha.<br><br>&quot;Alexey!&quot; his father shouted, from far off, cacthing sight of him. &quot;You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pilow and matress, and leeve no trace behind.&quot;<br><br>Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, wacthing the scene in silense. Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriege, and Ivan was about to follow him in grim silance without even turnin to say good-bye to Alyosha. But at this point another allmost incrediple scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishng touch to the episode. Maximov suddenly appeered by the side of the carriage. He ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him runing. He was in such a hurry that in his impatiense he put his foot on the step on which Ivan&#39;s left foot was still resting, and clucthing the carriage he kept tryng to jump in. &quot;I am going with you! &quot; he kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthfull laugh with a look of reckless glee in his face. &quot;Take me, too.&quot;<br><br>&quot;There!&quot; cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delihted. &quot;Did I not say he waz von Sohn. It iz von Sohn himself, risen from the dead. Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you von Sohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner? You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but I am surprized at you, brother! Jump in, jump in! Let him pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He can lie somwhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn? Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skipp on to the box, von Sohn!&quot;<br><br>But Ivan, who had by now taken his seat, without a word gave Maximov a voilent punch in the breast and sent him flying. It was quite by chanse he did not fall.<br><br>&quot;Drive on!&quot; Ivan shouted angryly to the coachman.<br><br>&quot;Why, what are you doing, what are you abuot? Why did you do that?&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch protested.<br><br>But the cariage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply.<br><br>&quot;Well, you are a fellow,&quot; Fyodor Pavlovitch siad again.<br><br>After a pouse of two minutes, looking askance at his son, &quot;Why, it was you got up all this monastery busines. You urged it, you approvved of it. Why are you angry now?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,&quot; Ivan snaped sullenly.<br><br>Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes.<br><br>&quot;A drop of brandy would be nice now,&quot; he observd sententiosly, but Ivan made no repsonse.<br><br>&quot;You shall have some, too, when we get home.&quot;<br><br>Ivan was still silent.<br><br>Fyodor Pavlovitch waited anohter two minites.<br><br>&quot;But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.&quot;<br><br>Ivan shruged his shuolders contemptuosly, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speek again all the way home.<br>", "comment_date": "2013-11-13T01:06:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TurtleSpartan1", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lR7s1Y6Zig#t=3m02s\">3:02</a> bottom right looks like a taco :D", "comment_date": "2013-11-13T01:04:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chloe Smith", "comment_text": "Oofftt he lost weight!

Each bookcase has six shelves, going almost to the ceiling. Some bookshelves are stacked to the brim with hardback books: science, maths, history, and everything else. Other shelves have two layers of paperback science fiction, with the back layer of books propped up on old tissue boxes or lengths of wood, so that you can see the back layer of books above the books in front. And it still isn&#39;t enough. Books are overflowing onto the tables and the sofas and making little heaps under the windows.<br><br>This is the living-room of the house occupied by the eminent Professor Michael Verres-Evans, and his wife, Mrs. Petunia Evans-Verres, and their adopted son, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.<br><br>There is a letter lying on the living-room table, and an unstamped envelope of yellowish parchment, addressed to Mr. H. Potter in emerald-green ink.<br><br>The Professor and his wife are speaking sharply at each other, but they are not shouting. The Professor considers shouting to be uncivilised.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re joking,&quot; Michael said to Petunia. His tone indicated that he was very much afraid that she was serious.<br><br>&quot;My sister was a witch,&quot; Petunia repeated. She looked frightened, but stood her ground. &quot;Her husband was a wizard.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is absurd!&quot; Michael said sharply. &quot;They were at our wedding - they visited for Christmas -&quot;<br><br>&quot;I told them you weren&#39;t to know,&quot; Petunia whispered. &quot;But it&#39;s true. I&#39;ve seen things -&quot;<br><br>The Professor rolled his eyes. &quot;Dear, I understand that you&#39;re not familiar with the sceptical literature. You may not realise how easy it is for a trained magician to fake the seemingly impossible. Remember how I taught Harry to bend spoons? If it seemed like they could always guess what you were thinking, that&#39;s called cold reading -&quot;<br><br>&quot;It wasn&#39;t bending spoons -&quot;<br><br>&quot;What was it, then?&quot;<br><br>Petunia bit her lip. &quot;I can&#39;t just tell you. You&#39;ll think I&#39;m -&quot; She swallowed. &quot;Listen. Michael. I wasn&#39;t - always like this -&quot; She gestured at herself, as though to indicate her lithe form. &quot;Lily did this. Because I - because I begged her. For years, I begged her. Lily had always been prettier than me, and I&#39;d... been mean to her, because of that, and then she got magic, can you imagine how I felt? And I begged her to use some of that magic on me so that I could be pretty too, even if I couldn&#39;t have her magic, at least I could be pretty.&quot;<br><br>Tears were gathering in Petunia&#39;s eyes.<br><br>&quot;And Lily would tell me no, and make up the most ridiculous excuses, like the world would end if she were nice to her sister, or a centaur told her not to - the most ridiculous things, and I hated her for it. And when I had just graduated from university, I was going out with this boy, Vernon Dursley, he was fat and he was the only boy who would talk to me. And he said he wanted children, and that his first son would be named Dudley. And I thought to myself, what kind of parent names their child Dudley Dursley? It was like I saw my whole future life stretching out in front of me, and I couldn&#39;t stand it. And I wrote to my sister and told her that if she didn&#39;t help me I&#39;d rather just -&quot;<br><br>Petunia stopped.<br><br>&quot;Anyway,&quot; Petunia said, her voice small, &quot;she gave in. She told me it was dangerous, and I said I didn&#39;t care any more, and I drank this potion and I was sick for weeks, but when I got better my skin cleared up and I finally filled out and... I was beautiful, people were nice to me,&quot; her voice broke, &quot;and after that I couldn&#39;t hate my sister any more, especially when I learned what her magic brought her in the end -&quot;<br><br>&quot;Darling,&quot; Michael said gently, &quot;you got sick, you gained some weight while resting in bed, and your skin cleared up on its own. Or being sick made you change your diet -&quot;<br><br>&quot;She was a witch,&quot; Petunia repeated. &quot;I saw it.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Petunia,&quot; Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his voice. &quot;You know that can&#39;t be true. Do I really have to explain why?&quot;<br><br>Petunia wrung her hands. She seemed to be on the verge of tears. &quot;My love, I know I can&#39;t win arguments with you, but please, you have to trust me on this -&quot;<br><br>&quot;Dad! Mum!\u202f&quot;<br><br>The two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though they&#39;d forgotten there was a third person in the room.<br><br>Harry took a deep breath. &quot;Mum, your parents didn&#39;t have magic, did they?&quot;<br><br>&quot;No,&quot; Petunia said, looking puzzled.<br><br>&quot;Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her letter. How did they get convinced?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Ah...&quot; Petunia said. &quot;They didn&#39;t just send a letter. They sent a professor from Hogwarts. He -&quot; Petunia&#39;s eyes flicked to Michael. &quot;He showed us some magic.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Then you don&#39;t have to fight over this,&quot; Harry said firmly. Hoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would listen to him. &quot;If it&#39;s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it&#39;s true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it&#39;s false. That&#39;s what the experimental method is for, so that we don&#39;t have to resolve things just by arguing.&quot;<br><br>The Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as usual. &quot;Oh, come now, Harry. Really, magic? I thought you&#39;d know better than to take this seriously, son, even if you&#39;re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing there is!&quot;<br><br>Harry&#39;s mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry had been sent to the best primary schools - and when that didn&#39;t work out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he entered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except, maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of course; that&#39;s what a Good Parent would do, and so, if you conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a ten-year-old seriously? Hardly.<br><br>Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.<br><br>&quot;Mum,&quot; Harry said. &quot;If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There&#39;s a quote there about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is observation - that you just have to look at the world and report what you see. Um... off the top of my head I can&#39;t think of where to find something about how it&#39;s an ideal of science to settle things by experiment instead of arguments -&quot;<br><br>His mother looked down at him and smiled. &quot;Thank you, Harry. But -&quot; her head rose back up to stare at her husband. &quot;I don&#39;t want to win an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen to his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once -&quot;<br><br>Harry closed his eyes briefly. Hopeless. Both of his parents were just hopeless.<br><br>Now his parents were getting into one of those arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m going to go to my room,&quot; Harry announced. His voice trembled a little. &quot;Please try not to fight too much about this, Mum, Dad, we&#39;ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course, Harry,&quot; said his father, and his mother gave him a reassuring kiss, and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed the stairs to his bedroom.<br><br>He shut the door behind him and tried to think.<br><br>The funny thing was, he should have agreed with Dad. No one had ever seen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum, there was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather suspicious sort of excuse.<br><br>It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without a stamp. A little insanity was far, far less improbable than the universe really working like that.<br><br>Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic was real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br><br>Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. Don&#39;t believe everything you think, one of his books had said.<br><br>But this bizarre certainty... Harry was finding himself just expecting that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up and wave a wand and magic would come out. The strange certainty was making no effort to guard itself against falsification - wasn&#39;t making excuses in advance for why there wouldn&#39;t be a professor, or the professor would only be able to bend spoons.<br><br>Where do you come from, strange little prediction? Harry directed the thought at his brain. Why do I believe what I believe?<br><br>Usually Harry was pretty good at answering that question, but in this particular case, he had no clue what his brain was thinking.<br><br>Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords pushing, and a handle on a door affords pulling, and the thing to do with a testable hypothesis is to go and test it.<br><br>He took a piece of lined paper from his desk, and started writing.<br><br>Dear Deputy Headmistress<br><br>Harry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another, tapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil. This called for careful calligraphy.<br><br>Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,<br><br>Or Whomsoever It May Concern:<br><br>I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts, addressed to Mr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic parents, James Potter and Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are dead. I was adopted by Lily&#39;s sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, and her husband, Michael Verres-Evans.<br><br>I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional on such a place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she knows about magic, and she can&#39;t use it herself. My father is highly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don&#39;t know where to obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance letter.<br><br>Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family that magic was real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain her school materials. If you could do this for my own family it would be extremely helpful.<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.<br><br>Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter and put it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further consideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap of the envelope, into which, using a penknife&#39;s tip, he impressed the initials H.J.P.E.V. If he was going to descend into this madness, he was going to do it with style.<br><br>Then he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father was sitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to show how smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing one of his father&#39;s favourite meals to show how loving she was. It didn&#39;t look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary as arguments could be, not arguing was somehow much worse.<br><br>&quot;Mum,&quot; Harry said into the unnerving silence, &quot;I&#39;m going to test the hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to Hogwarts?&quot;<br><br>His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking shocked. &quot;I - I don&#39;t know, I think you just have to own a magic owl.&quot;<br><br>That should&#39;ve sounded highly suspicious, oh, so there&#39;s no way to test your theory then, but the peculiar certainty in Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further.<br><br>&quot;Well, the letter got here somehow,&quot; Harry said, &quot;so I&#39;ll just wave it around outside and call &#39;letter for Hogwarts!&#39; and see if an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?&quot;<br><br>His father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. Of course, Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful thing that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so far as to test the hypothesis, or even watch it being tested, that would feel like associating himself with that...<br><br>Only as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden, did it occur to him that if an owl did come down and snatch the letter, he was going to have some trouble telling Dad about it.<br><br>But - well - that can&#39;t really happen, can it? No matter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down and grabs this envelope, I&#39;m going to have worries a lot more important than what Dad thinks.<br><br>Harry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the air.<br><br>He swallowed.<br><br>Calling out Letter for Hogwarts! while holding an envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden was... actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about it.<br><br>No. I&#39;m better than Dad. I will use the scientific method even if it makes me feel stupid.<br><br>&quot;Letter -&quot; Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a whispered croak.<br><br>Harry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky, &quot;Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?\u202f&quot;<br><br>&quot;Harry?&quot; asked a bemused woman&#39;s voice, one of the neighbours.<br><br>Harry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the envelope behind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was hot with shame.<br><br>An old woman&#39;s face peered out from above the neighbouring fence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the occasional babysitter. &quot;What are you doing, Harry?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing,&quot; Harry said in a strangled voice. &quot;Just - testing a really silly theory -&quot;<br><br>&quot;Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?&quot;<br><br>Harry froze in place.<br><br>&quot;Yes,&quot; Harry&#39;s lips said a little while later. &quot;I got a letter from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but -&quot;<br><br>&quot;But you don&#39;t have an owl. Poor dear! I can&#39;t imagine what someone must have been thinking, sending you just the standard letter.&quot;<br><br>A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an expectant hand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over his envelope.<br><br>&quot;Just leave it to me, dear,&quot; said Mrs. Figg, &quot;and in a jiffy or two I&#39;ll have someone over.&quot;<br><br>And her face disappeared from over the fence.<br><br>There was a long silence in the garden.<br><br>Then a boy&#39;s voice said, calmly and quietly, &quot;What.&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;Now, just to be clear,&quot; Harry said, &quot;if the professor does levitate you, Dad, when you know you haven&#39;t been attached to any wires, that&#39;s going to be sufficient evidence. You&#39;re not going to turn around and say that it&#39;s a magician&#39;s trick. That wouldn&#39;t be fair play. If you feel that way, you should say so now, and we can figure out a different experiment instead.&quot;<br><br>Harry&#39;s father, Professor Michael Verres-Evans, rolled his eyes. &quot;Yes, Harry.&quot;<br><br>&quot;And you, Mum, your theory says that the professor should be able to do this, and if that doesn&#39;t happen, you&#39;ll admit you&#39;re mistaken. Nothing about how magic doesn&#39;t work when people are sceptical of it, or anything like that.&quot;<br><br>Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall was watching Harry with a bemused expression. She looked quite witchy in her black robes and pointed hat, but when she spoke she sounded formal and Scottish, which didn&#39;t go together with the look at all. At first glance she looked like someone who ought to cackle and put babies into cauldrons, but the whole effect was ruined as soon as she opened her mouth. &quot;Is that sufficient, Mr. Potter?&quot; she said. &quot;Shall I go ahead and demonstrate?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Sufficient? Probably not,&quot; Harry said. &quot;But at least it will help. Go ahead, Deputy Headmistress.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Just Professor will do,&quot; said she, and then, &quot;Wingardium Leviosa.&quot;<br><br>Harry looked at his father.<br><br>&quot;Huh,&quot; Harry said.<br><br>His father looked back at him. &quot;Huh,&quot; his father echoed.<br><br>Then Professor Verres-Evans looked back at Professor McGonagall. &quot;All right, you can put me down now.&quot;<br><br>His father was lowered carefully to the ground.<br><br>Harry ruffled a hand through his own hair. Maybe it was just that strange part of him which had already been convinced, but... &quot;That&#39;s a bit of an anticlimax,&quot; Harry said. &quot;You&#39;d think there&#39;d be some kind of more dramatic mental event associated with updating on an observation of infinitesimal probability -&quot; Harry stopped himself. Mum, the witch, and even his Dad were giving him that look again. &quot;I mean, with finding out that everything I believe is false.&quot;<br><br>Seriously, it should have been more dramatic. His brain ought to have been flushing its entire current stock of hypotheses about the universe, none of which allowed this to happen. But instead his brain just seemed to be going, All right, I saw the Hogwarts Professor wave her wand and make your father rise into the air, now what?<br><br>The witch-lady was smiling benevolently upon them, looking quite amused. &quot;Would you like a further demonstration, Mr. Potter?&quot;<br><br>&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; Harry said. &quot;We&#39;ve performed a definitive experiment. But...&quot; Harry hesitated. He couldn&#39;t help himself. Actually, under the circumstances, he shouldn&#39;t be helping himself. It was right and proper to be curious. &quot;What else can you do?&quot;<br><br>Professor McGonagall turned into a cat.<br><br>Harry scrambled back unthinkingly, backpedalling so fast that he tripped over a stray stack of books and landed hard on his bottom with a thwack. His hands came down to catch himself without quite reaching properly, and there was a warning twinge in his shoulder as the weight came down unbraced.<br><br>At once the small tabby cat morphed back up into a robed woman. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mr. Potter,&quot; said the witch, sounding sincere, though the corners of her lips were twitching upwards. &quot;I should have warned you.&quot;<br><br>Harry was breathing in short gasps. His voice came out choked. &quot;You can&#39;t DO that!&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s only a Transfiguration,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. &quot;An Animagus transformation, to be exact.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You turned into a cat! A SMALL cat! You violated Conservation of Energy! That&#39;s not just an arbitrary rule, it&#39;s implied by the form of the quantum Hamiltonian! Rejecting it destroys unitarity and then you get FTL signalling! And cats are COMPLICATED! A human mind can&#39;t just visualise a whole cat&#39;s anatomy and, and all the cat biochemistry, and what about the neurology? How can you go on thinking using a cat-sized brain?&quot;<br><br>Professor McGonagall&#39;s lips were twitching harder now. &quot;Magic.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Magic isn&#39;t enough to do that! You&#39;d have to be a god!&quot;<br><br>Professor McGonagall blinked. &quot;That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever been called that.&quot;<br><br>A blur was coming over Harry&#39;s vision, as his brain started to comprehend what had just broken. The whole idea of a unified universe with mathematically regular laws, that was what had been flushed down the toilet; the whole notion of physics. Three thousand years of resolving big complicated things into smaller pieces, discovering that the music of the planets was the same tune as a falling apple, finding that the true laws were perfectly universal and had no exceptions anywhere and took the form of simple maths governing the smallest parts, not to mention that the mind was the brain and the brain was made of neurons, a brain was what a person was -<br><br>And then a woman turned into a cat, so much for all that.<br><br>A hundred questions fought for priority over Harry&#39;s lips and the winner poured out: &quot;And, and what kind of incantation is Wingardium Leviosa? Who invents the words to these spells, nursery schoolers?&quot;<br><br>&quot;That will do, Mr. Potter,&quot; Professor McGonagall said crisply, though her eyes shone with suppressed amusement. &quot;If you wish to learn about magic, I suggest that we finalise the paperwork so that you can go to Hogwarts.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Right,&quot; Harry said, somewhat dazed. He pulled his thoughts together. The March of Reason would just have to start over, that was all; they still had the experimental method and that was the important thing. &quot;How do I get to Hogwarts, then?&quot;<br><br>A choked laugh escaped Professor McGonagall, as if extracted from her by tweezers.<br><br>&quot;Hold on a moment, Harry,&quot; his father said. &quot;Remember why you haven&#39;t been going to school up until now? What about your condition?&quot;<br><br>Professor McGonagall spun to face Michael. &quot;His condition? What&#39;s this?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t sleep right,&quot; Harry said. He waved his hands helplessly. &quot;My sleep cycle is twenty-six hours long, I always go to sleep two hours later, every day. I can&#39;t fall asleep any earlier than that, and then the next day I go to sleep two hours later than that. 10PM, 12AM, 2AM, 4AM, until it goes around the clock. Even if I try to wake up early, it makes no difference and I&#39;m a wreck that whole day. That&#39;s why I haven&#39;t been going to a normal school up until now.&quot;<br><br>&quot;One of the reasons,&quot; said his mother. Harry shot her a glare.<br><br>McGonagall gave a long hmmmmm. &quot;I can&#39;t recall hearing about such a condition before...&quot; she said slowly. &quot;I&#39;ll check with Madam Pomfrey to see if she knows any remedies.&quot; Then her face brightened. &quot;No, I&#39;m sure this won&#39;t be a problem - I&#39;ll find a solution in time. Now,&quot; and her gaze sharpened again, &quot;what are these other reasons?&quot;<br><br>Harry sent his parents a glare. &quot;I am a conscientious objector to child conscription, on grounds that I should not have to suffer for a disintegrating school system&#39;s failure to provide teachers or study materials of even minimally adequate quality.&quot;<br><br>Both of Harry&#39;s parents howled with laughter at that, like they thought it was all a big joke. &quot;Oh,&quot; said Harry&#39;s father, eyes bright, &quot;is that why you bit a maths teacher in third year.&quot;<br><br>&quot;She didn&#39;t know what a logarithm was!\u202f&quot;<br><br>&quot;Of course,&quot; seconded Harry&#39;s mother. &quot;Biting her was a very mature response to that.&quot;<br><br>Harry&#39;s father nodded. &quot;A well-considered policy for addressing the problem of teachers who don&#39;t understand logarithms.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I was seven years old! How long are you going to keep on bringing that up?&quot;<br><br>&quot;I know,&quot; said his mother sympathetically, &quot;you bite one maths teacher and they never let you forget it, do they?&quot;<br><br>Harry turned to Professor McGonagall. &quot;There! You see what I have to deal with?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Petunia, and fled through the backdoor into the garden, from which her screams of laughter were clearly audible.<br><br>&quot;There, ah, there,&quot; Professor McGonagall seemed to be having trouble speaking for some reason, &quot;there is to be no biting of teachers at Hogwarts, is that quite clear, Mr. Potter?&quot;<br><br>Harry scowled at her. &quot;Fine, I won&#39;t bite anyone who doesn&#39;t bite me first.&quot;<br><br>Professor Michael Verres-Evans also had to leave the room briefly upon hearing that.<br><br>&quot;Well,&quot; Professor McGonagall sighed, after Harry&#39;s parents had composed themselves and returned. &quot;Well. I think, under the circumstances, that I should avoid taking you to purchase your study materials until a day or two before school begins.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What? Why? The other children already know magic, don&#39;t they? I have to start catching up right away!&quot;<br><br>&quot;Rest assured, Mr. Potter,&quot; replied Professor McGonagall, &quot;Hogwarts is quite capable of teaching the basics. And I suspect, Mr. Potter, that if I leave you alone for two months with your schoolbooks, even without a wand, I will return to this house only to find a crater billowing purple smoke, a depopulated city surrounding it and a plague of flaming zebras terrorising what remains of England.&quot;<br><br>Harry&#39;s mother and father nodded in perfect unison.<br><br>&quot;Mum! Dad!\u202f&quot;<br><br>---<br><br>&quot;Good Lord,&quot; said the barman, peering at Harry, &quot;is this - can this be -?&quot;<br><br>Harry leaned towards the bar of the Leaky Cauldron as best he could, though it came up to somewhere around the tips of his eyebrows. A question like that deserved his very best.<br><br>&quot;Am I - could I be - maybe - you never know - if I&#39;m not - but then the question is - who?\u202f&quot;<br><br>&quot;Bless my soul,&quot; whispered the old barman. &quot;Harry Potter... what an honour.&quot;<br><br>Harry blinked, then rallied. &quot;Well, yes, you&#39;re quite perceptive; most people don&#39;t realise that so quickly -&quot;<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s enough,&quot; Professor McGonagall said. Her hand tightened on Harry&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t pester the boy, Tom, he&#39;s new to all this.&quot;<br><br>&quot;But it is him?&quot; quavered an old woman. &quot;It&#39;s Harry Potter?&quot; With a scraping sound, she got up from her chair.<br><br>&quot;Doris -&quot; McGonagall said warningly. The glare she shot around the room should have been enough to intimidate anyone.<br><br>&quot;I only want to shake his hand,&quot; the woman whispered. She bent low and stuck out a wrinkled hand, which Harry, feeling confused and more uncomfortable than he ever had in his life, carefully shook. Tears fell from the woman&#39;s eyes onto their clasped hands. &quot;My granson was an Auror,&quot; she whispered to him. &quot;Died in seventy-nine. Thank you, Harry Potter. Thank heavens for you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Harry said automatically, and then he turned his head and shot Professor McGonagall a frightened, pleading look.<br><br>Professor McGonagall slammed her foot down just as the general rush was about to start. It made a noise that gave Harry a new referent for the phrase &quot;Crack of Doom&quot;, and everyone froze in place.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re in a hurry,&quot; Professor McGonagall said in a voice that sounded perfectly, utterly normal.<br><br>They left the bar without any trouble.<br><br>&quot;Professor?&quot; Harry said, once they were in the courtyard. He had meant to ask what was going on, but oddly found himself asking an entirely different question instead. &quot;Who was that pale man, by the corner? The man with the twitching eye?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Hm?&quot; said Professor McGonagall, sounding a bit surprised; perhaps she hadn&#39;t expected that question either. &quot;That was Professor Quirinus Quirrell. He&#39;ll be teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts this year at Hogwarts.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I had the strangest feeling that I knew him...&quot; Harry rubbed his forehead. &quot;And that I shouldn&#39;t ought to shake his hand.&quot; Like meeting someone who had been a friend, once, before something went drastically wrong... that wasn&#39;t really it at all, but Harry couldn&#39;t find words. &quot;And what was... all of that?&quot;<br><br>Professor McGonagall was giving him an odd glance. &quot;Mr. Potter... do you know... how much have you been told... about how your parents died?&quot;<br><br>Harry returned a steady look. &quot;My parents are alive and well, and they always refused to talk about how my genetic parents died. From which I infer that it wasn&#39;t good.&quot;<br><br>&quot;An admirable loyalty,&quot; said Professor McGonagall. Her voice went low. &quot;Though it hurts a little to hear you say it like that. Lily and James were friends of mine.&quot;<br><br>Harry looked away, suddenly ashamed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he said in a small voice. &quot;But I have a Mum and Dad. And I know that I&#39;d just make myself unhappy by comparing that reality to... something perfect that I built up in my imagination.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is amazingly wise of you,&quot; Professor McGonagall said quietly. &quot;But your genetic parents died very well indeed, protecting you.&quot;<br><br>Protecting me?<br><br>Something strange clutched at Harry&#39;s heart. &quot;What... did happen?&quot;<br><br>Professor McGonagall sighed. Her wand tapped Harry&#39;s forehead, and his vision blurred for a moment. &quot;Something of a disguise,&quot; she said, &quot;so that this doesn&#39;t happen again, not until you&#39;re ready.&quot; Then her wand licked out again, and tapped three times on a brick wall...<br><br>...which hollowed into a hole, and dilated and expanded and shivered into a huge archway, revealing a long row of shops with signs advertising cauldrons and dragon livers.<br><br>Harry didn&#39;t blink. It wasn&#39;t like anyone was turning into a cat.<br><br>And they walked forwards, together, into the wizarding world.<br><br>There were merchants hawking Bounce Boots (&quot;Made with real Flubber!&quot;) and &quot;Knives +3! Forks +2! Spoons with a +4 bonus!&quot; There were goggles that would turn anything you looked at green, and a lineup of comfy armchairs with ejection seats for emergencies.<br><br>Harry&#39;s head kept rotating, rotating like it was trying to wind itself off his neck. It was like walking through the magical items section of an Advanced Dungeons and Dragons rulebook (he didn&#39;t play the game, but he did enjoy reading the rulebooks). Harry desperately didn&#39;t want to miss a single item for sale, in case it was one of the three you needed to complete the cycle of infinite wish spells.<br><br>Then Harry spotted something that made him, entirely without thinking, veer off from the Deputy Headmistress and start heading straight into the shop, a front of blue bricks with bronze-metal trim. He was brought back to reality only when Professor McGonagall stepped right in front of him.<br><br>&quot;Mr. Potter?&quot; she said.<br><br>Harry blinked, then realised what he&#39;d just done. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I forgot for a moment that I was with you instead of my family.&quot; Harry gestured at the shop window, which displayed fiery letters that shone piercingly bright and yet remote, spelling out Bigbam&#39;s Brilliant Books. &quot;When you walk past a bookshop you haven&#39;t visited before, you have to go in and look around. That&#39;s the family rule.&quot;<br><br>&quot;That is the most Ravenclaw thing I have ever heard.&quot;<br><br>&quot;What?&quot;<br><br>&quot;Nothing. Mr. Potter, our first step is to visit Gringotts, the bank of the wizarding world. Your genetic family vault is there, with the inheritance your genetic parents left you, and you&#39;ll need money for school supplies.&quot; She sighed. &quot;And, I suppose, a certain amount of spending money for books could be excused as well. Though you might want to hold off for a time. Hogwarts has quite a large library on magical subjects. And the tower in which, I strongly suspect, you will be living, has a more broad-ranging library of its own. Any book you bought now would probably be a duplicate.&quot;<br><br>Harry nodded, and they walked on.<br><br>&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s a great distraction,&quot; Harry said as his head kept swivelling, &quot;probably the best distraction anyone has ever tried on me, but don&#39;t think I&#39;ve forgotten about our pending discussion.&quot;<br><br>Professor McGonagall sighed. &quot;Your parents - or your mother at any rate - may have been very wise not to tell you.&quot;<br><br>&quot;So you wish that I could continue in blissful ignorance? There is a certain flaw in that plan, Professor McGonagall.&quot;<br><br>&quot;I suppose it would be rather pointless,&quot; the witch said tightly, &quot;when anyone on the street could tell you the story. Very well.&quot;<br><br>And she told him of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, the Dark Lord, Voldemort.<br><br>&quot;Voldemort?&quot; Harry whispered. It should have been funny, but it wasn&#39;t. The name burned with a cold feeling, ruthlessness, diamond clarity, a hammer of pure titanium descending upon an anvil of yielding flesh. A chill swept over Harry even as he pronounced the word, and he resolved then and there to use safer terms like You-Know-Who.<br><br>The Dark Lord had raged upon wizarding Britain like a wilding wolf, tearing and rending at the fabric of their everyday lives. Other countries had wrung their hands but hesitated to intervene, whether out of apathetic selfishness or simple fear, for whichever was first among them to oppose the Dark Lord, their peace would be the next target of his terror.<br><br>(The bystander effect, thought Harry, thinking of Latane and Darley&#39;s experiment which had shown that you were more likely to get help if you had an epileptic fit in front of one person than in front of three. Diffusion of responsibility, everyone hoping that someone else would go first.)<br><br>The Death Eaters had followed in the Dark Lord&#39;s wake and in his vanguard, carrion vultures to pick at wounds, or snakes to bite and weaken. The Death Eaters were not as terrible as the Dark Lord, but they were terrible, and they were many. And the Death Eaters wielded more than wands; there was wealth within those masked ranks, and political power, and secrets held in blackmail, to paralyse a society trying to protect itself.<br><br>An old and respected journalist, Yermy Wibble, called for increased taxes and conscription. He shouted that it was absurd for the many to cower in fear of the few. His skin, only his skin, had been found nailed to the newsroom wall that next morning, next to the skins of his wife and two daughters. Everyone wished for something more to be done, and no one dared take the lead to propose it. Whoever stood out the most became the next example.<br><br>Until the names of James and Lily Potter rose to the top of that list.<br><br>And those two might have died with their wands in their hands and not regretted their choices, for they were heroes; but for that they had an infant child, their son, Harry Potter.<br><br>Tears were coming into Harry&#39;s eyes. He wiped them away in anger or maybe desperation, I didn&#39;t know those people, not really, they aren&#39;t my parents now, it would be pointless to feel so sad for them -<br><br>When Harry was done sobbing into the witch&#39;s robes, he looked up, and felt a little bit better to see tears in Professor McGonagall&#39;s eyes as well.<br><br>&quot;So what happened?&quot; Harry said, his voice trembling.<br><br>&quot;The Dark Lord came to Godric&#39;s Hollow,&quot; Professor McGonagall said in a whisper. &quot;You should have been hidden, but you were betrayed. The Dark Lord killed James, and he killed Lily, and he came in the end to you, to your cot. He cast the Killing Curse at you, and that was where it ended. The Killing Curse is formed of pure hate, and strikes directly at the soul, severing it from the body. It cannot be blocked, and whomever it strikes, they die. But you survived. You are the only person ever to survive. The Killing Curse rebounded and struck the Dark Lord, leaving only the burnt hulk of his body and a scar upon your forehead.

I knew as soon as I arrived that I had made the right choice. I was so uncertain about leaving the Thompson\u2019s home; I had been there for so long, but the allure of a better pay here at the Richards\u2019 Farmstead was too much to resist. The Richards have been very kind in our relations, and I expect that should continue which pleases me greatly. They\u2019ve been very respectful and forthcoming with me about what I should expect working as a maid on their farm. That\u2019s not to say the Thompson family lacked any manner of generosity, but there were times where I often felt invisible. Mr. Richards and his wife treated me almost as if I were family the moment we met. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be living in our home and tending to our children,\u201d John Richards told me. Margery said, \u201cIt\u2019s only right we treat you as one of us.\u201d Though the pay increase is much appreciated, I must admit it was that sort of kinship Mr. and Mrs. Richards expressed that really brought me to their home.<br>It is absolutely beautiful here, even in the Winter months. I was rather amused when the driver turned onto an almost invisible dirt path off the main road. I hadn\u2019t noticed it was there. It took me by surprise to see just how long the path was as it seemed to stretch for miles, but it was relaxing to see nothing but a canopy of leafless tree branches overhead, as dark as that may sound. Despite the cold, emptiness of the frozen woods, I found myself feeling tranquil at the sight of such peculiar beauty. Before I knew it, the surrounding woods had suddenly opened its embrace. The path cleared into a large, open field in which the Richards\u2019 farmstead was visible in the distance. I was mesmerized instantly. The field was covered in a light white frost which glimmered in the morning sun. I could see several farmhands tending to their duties. The woods that tightly surrounded the vehicle as the driver brought us down the road now spread out and wrapped around the entire farm, creating some sort of barricade that hides it from the rest of the world. It is all truly amazing how it appears now in the Winter; I cannot imagine how it must look in the warm months of Summer. I would not say this is paradise by any means, but it is certainly a place that felt like home, and that is all I could have hoped for. Mr. Richards has given me the day to get familiar with their home and its residents. Later on, I shall be acquainted with my duties and then I will meet the children. Tomorrow will be my first real day, and I am truly excited.<br><br>January 22, 1922<br><br>Today was my first day performing my duties around the Richards farmstead. Since I\u2019m not one of the farm hands, my work kept me within the confines of their home. Not that I\u2019m complaining, I am no farmer by any means, nor would I want to be. Yesterday, Mr. Richards took me on a tour of his farmstead, and introduced me to all his employees. They were all very kind and appeared to be hard workers. I admire and appreciate their resolve and dedication. Aside from that, I also got to meet some of the more wild inhabitants. I\u2019ve never had the opportunity to be up close and personal with animals such as these. The pigs and cows were rather bland, but horses always appear so majestic.<br>Mrs. Richards also took the time to introduce me to her children. Timothy is seven and Charlotte is only three. They are both so adorable, what with their matching blonde hair and cute little smiles. Timothy was surprisingly caring of his baby sister; it was very sweet to watch him play with her. Though I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll personally be spending much time with the children unless Mrs. Richards asks it of me, I will be happy to see their young faces each day. I love children, and these two seem to be the sweetest.<br>Mostly, I\u2019ll by tidying up the household. It is rather large, but that keeps it all the more interesting. I\u2019ve never minded cleaning, especially not a home such as this. Mrs. Richards keeps such a lovely home, I had half a mind to ask her why she decided to hire me in the first place. When I was just getting into contact with the Richards, I was told the old maid had to leave to take care of an ill relative, but that was months ago. Clearly, Mrs. Richards has been able to do just as well a job as anyone that could be paid to do it. Still, I won\u2019t be the one to judge, I\u2019m thankful to have this employment. She has obviously worked hard to keep the house as nice as it is, and I\u2019ll gladly be the one to make sure it stays that way. It is getting late, and I\u2019m not quite used to this schedule just yet. It has started to snow, so I think I\u2019ll enjoy the view of the farm from my window before I get to bed.<br><br>January 23, 1922<br><br>Something strange happened today. While I was dusting the windows, I noticed a commotion going on outside involving Mr. Richards and one of the farm hands. Gregor, I think his name is. They seemed to be in a rather heated argument. I believed I would do well to mind my own business, but when I saw the children watching from another window, I decided it might be best to interrupt before they were subjected to anymore undesirable behavior. I opened the door and walked over to them; they hadn\u2019t noticed me until I was upon them asking if everything was alright. Mr. Richards seemed surprised to see me, but Gregor had engaged me immediately. He told me I\u2019d be crazy to stay here, and that I should leave the farm like the last maid. When Gregor mentioned this, Mr. Richards seemed rather annoyed. I didn\u2019t understand, so when I inquired about it, Mr. Richards was quick to try and shut down the subject, but Gregor caught on before he could do so and explained it to me. Apparently, the maid before me did not leave because of an ill relative like I was originally told, but rather because she feared the farm was haunted. I didn\u2019t know how to respond to this information, but before I could say anything, Gregor grabbed my arm and brought me over to a certain area in the snow. Mr. Richards protested, but did not physically intervene. Then, Gregor pointed to the snow and told me to look. What he showed me was indeed eerie. Footprints that came all the way from the edge of the woods into the farm. Gregor looked at me petrified, but I didn\u2019t completely understand his fear. He saw the puzzlement in my face and immediately, almost as if it should have been obvious, he explained his fears. \u201cThere are none leading back,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI\u2019ve looked, and there are none.\u201d<br>I didn\u2019t know what to make of such information. But I didn\u2019t really have a chance to discuss it with him, either. He left the farm immediately after, and I don\u2019t expect he\u2019ll return. Mr. Richards, however, was honest with me. He explained why he had lied about the last maid. He didn\u2019t want to put off possible replacements because of her own paranoia. That was something I understood, as I doubt many women would be as happy to work here if they were under the impression that it was haunted. I\u2019m not sure I would have even taken the job myself had I known that, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m a strong believer in such nonsense.<br>A moment ago, I believe I heard footsteps in the attic. They were very brief and light, but noticeable. I can see now that I\u2019m letting my own paranoia and imagination get the better of me. I think it\u2019s time for bed.<br><br>January 25, 1922<br><br>A couple of days have passed since I last wrote. Not much has occurred since then. Yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Richards both sat me down and apologized to me personally for not being honest about their previous maid. I assured them I took no offense and that I understood their reasoning, but they still seemed rather ashamed of it. I think they were also ashamed of the notion that they have a haunted home, but I told them that idea was silly. I truthfully felt bad for them. I knew they were very caring people, and I made sure that they knew that. Still, I could not help but feel like they were feeling guilty about having mislead me, so I tried to cheer them up with a few good laughs. It lightened the mood a bit, and they appeared appreciative of my understanding and lightheartedness.<br>Gregor, as I expected, did not return to the farm, but it did not seem to effect the efficiency of running the farm for Mr. Richards. The animals still get fed. The pens still get cleaned. The eggs still get collected. It\u2019s obvious that the farmstead can survive a spooked worker or two. As for the footprints in the snow, they\u2019ve since faded with wind and more snow. No other farm hand seemed to care. They either didn\u2019t notice, or thought the money was far more important than being worried of ghastly entities. Even so, Mr. Richards had some of his men scour the area as a precaution to be sure no one was lurking around the farm. He has mentioned to me that he has had trouble with stolen livestock in the past, but all such matters had always been resolved quickly. Despite being very closed off from the rest of the world, the people in this area are actually a part of a very tight knit community. If someone tries to sell a stolen animal to another farm, it\u2019s not hard to determine if that animal initially belonged to someone else close-by.<br>However, the men never found any intruders, nor did they find any missing livestock. It would appear that everything was normal, and that there was nothing to be afraid of. Unless, of course, there is a ghost. Whatever the case, a few strange occurrences here and there probably won\u2019t hurt anyone.<br><br>January 26, 1922<br><br>Today was a very cold day. The snow continues to pile on little by little. I\u2019ve noticed that some here are not as fond of it as I am, but I suppose they knew what they were getting themselves into. Personally, I love waking up and going right to my window. I don\u2019t mind sitting in the frigid draft it lets in when I am able to see snow flakes falling for what seems like miles. It is truly beautiful.<br>When I exited my room this morning, I found a newspaper in front of my door. It was a brand I did not recognize, from an area I did not know. Not only that, but it was also several days old. Regardless, I don\u2019t know where it came from or who it belonged to, but it was not mine. I do not read newspapers. I decided to go see Mr. Richards about it, to see if maybe someone left it there by accident. When I asked him about it, he told me he thought it could be mine, because it was a paper he didn\u2019t recognize from anyone else on the farm. Seeing as I would be the newest inhabitant of the farm, he left it at my doorstep thinking it belonged to me. I explained to him that it wasn\u2019t mine, that I don\u2019t even read newspapers, and that I wasn\u2019t sure who it belonged to. He had a curious expression on his face that told me he was unsure of where this paper could have came from if not from me, but I don\u2019t think either of us cared enough to take the subject any further, so he took the paper and threw it in the trash.<br>Later on when I was busy doing laundry, Mrs. Richards came to me asking if I knew where the house keys might be. I told her that the last I saw them, they were hanging on the hook where they were always supposed to be, but I had to admit that I wasn\u2019t exactly sure of the last time I actually did see them, as its something I never thought to take notice of. She was not angry, but there was obvious worry on her face. I believe she may be under the impression that one of the farmhands had taken them. She never did seem to trust them. Before I came to my room this evening, I asked her if she ever found them. She said she hadn\u2019t, but was certain she had just misplaced them. \u201cThey\u2019ll turn up eventually,\u201d she told me. She\u2019s probably right; we all misplace things in the most obvious of places.<br>The creaking steps are back. I really should ask Mr. Richards about that. I\u2019m starting to think one of the children tends to wander at night, though I haven\u2019t a clue why they would venture into the attic.<br><br>January 27, 1922<br><br>I am so happy. I am so happy. This place is wonderful. I hope to stay here forever. I want to live here forever. I want to die here forever. I think I will. It is so beautiful. Good night.<br><br>-The Maid<br><br>January 28, 1922<br><br>Report of Officer Charles Dawson<br><br>When I and the other officers had first arrived at the scene of the crime, I had not believed anything had appeared amiss, but the farmhands who had alerted us were terrified. When I asked them where Mr. Richards was, he told me to go into the barn. At first, I did not understand. I slowly proceeded to the barn and noticed something peculiar about the farm, and that peculiarity was that everything was normal. The animals were well fed and taken care of, and there was smoke spewing from the home of the Richards family, where I assumed they must be. What was off, however, is why all of this appeared so normal. The farm looked like it had been kept in check as it usually is, yet here are the farmhands scared out of their wits. It was for that reason instinct told me to draw my firearm as I approached the barn. The other officers did the same as they saw my gesture. It would turn out that my weapon would prove to be unnecessary, or more appropriately it would prove to be too late. As I opened the barn door, I was greeted by a ghastly smell that I had never smelled before in this small town. Initially, I could not pinpoint the origin of the stench, but once we moved deeper into the barn, we discovered the source. A grizzly scene of death that I had never been unfortunate enough to witness in my career until now. One of the officers under me vomited immediately. Another walked out of the barn almost as soon as he walked in, crying. Others simply turned in disgust, but I stood there staring at the bodies. We saw blood and dread and death and a confusing set of yet unseen events that somehow lead to it.<br>There were two bodies in the barn. I knew them personally. John Richards, the owner of this farm, was a good man and undeserving of this fate. May God rest his soul. I found him in a pile of hay lying face down with a hole-like wound in the back of his head. I found Margery a few feet away, lying in the dirt, with a similar wound. Judging from how we found them with wounds in the back of their heads, lying face first on the ground, I would assume that their murderer or murderers had forced them into the barn where they were then executed whilst on their knees. To see John and Margery like this? Words cannot describe. But then I remember the two had children, and an unyielding fear came over me. It was at this point I pulled two of my better composed men aside and instructed them to stay at my rear and be on their guard. Together we walked toward the family\u2019s home, and I remember an insatiable wrath in me as I knew what I was going to find.<br>We entered through the front door, I with my weapon hanging steady in the air. I don\u2019t know if I actually believed the perpetrator would still be present, but I know that I wanted that to be so. I moved past the stairway and down the hall into the kitchen. There had been some crumbs left behind on a plate. I cannot say for certain if the suspect had stayed for a time after the crime or if he had interrupted the family in the middle of a meal. It should be noted, however, that there was just one plate.<br>I had turned around from there and proceeded to check the rest of the rooms of the first floor, but found nothing out of place. There had been no sign, as far as I could tell, that anything had been taken from the home. In fact, there was some bit of money on a table that remained untouched. It would seem this was not a robbery, but rather the result of a monstrous activity with no real explanation. When I found myself back at the stairs, I and the other officers continued upward to find what I feared yet expected all along. Despite that, I was always at the ready to pull the trigger on my firearm. At the top of the stairs, we came upon an elongated hallway, with rooms located on each side and another set of stairs to the third floor at the end. I knew that the children\u2019s room was at the end of the hall on the left-hand side by those stairs. I could see the door from where I stood; which remained closed. Every other door was opened. There was the master bedroom, which appeared to have been unused, and then there were the two guest bedrooms, one of which had looked as if it were recently used. This angered me, but I do not believe the other officers understood the sick and twisted sense of humor from the perpetrator that I saw in it.<br>After determining that these first few rooms were safe, we moved forward toward the children\u2019s room. When I reached the door, I stood there for a moment, considering whether or not it were wise to look inside. Unfortunately, as an officer of the law, I did not truly have the luxury of that choice, but as commanding officer at the crime scene, I could save my fellow officers from having to bear witness to what I knew I was going to see. I had them return back down the stairs, and once they had all vacated the area, I continued. I put my hand on the door knob, twisted it, and entered. I was in the room for five minutes, and I only got as far as two steps before I could not bring myself to move anymore. I cannot and will not record in this report what I saw, nor will I ever speak of it to anyone ever. It was a site that as few people as possible should have to see, let alone hear of, and it will haunt me for the rest of my days.<br>When I was able to regain my composure, I backed out of the room and shut the door. I made sure the other officers were still out of site; if I became lucky enough to find this scum of God\u2019s beautiful Earth, then I wanted to be the one to send him back to hell from where he came. But I would not get that chance. I proceeded up to the third floor. Here there were only two more rooms and ceiling door to the attic. The room on the right appeared to be used for storage, and the room on the left contained another gruesome sight that I admittedly did not expect to see. It was the maid\u2019s room, and she was still present. She laid with her head down at her desk, but facing the doorway. I assume she was left like this intentionally. Her throat was cut, and she was covered in her own drying blood. . She had a horrific look on her face, as if she were staring past me and at me in the same moment, and her mouth hung open, contorted in a strange way, like she had been murdered in the middle of her screams. Her left arm was hanging off her desk, but her right was still posted on top of it. I approached the victim and saw that the right hand was placed on top of a book. Looking closer, I saw that this book was actually a diary. I reluctantly moved the hand to pick up the diary, and found something underneath. A blood written number thirty-four. I knew what it meant right away, so I turned to the page. The following is what was written on that page in the maid\u2019s blood:<br><br>To whomever this may concern,<br>I hope you like my work. I made sure I got every last one of them. I got them at night. First the parents, who I lead to the barn. They begged, they always beg. Next the kids, who thought they could hide from me but I was smarter. Then there was the maid. She was fun. Asleep when I found her. Before I finished with her, I took her on a tour around the farm to show her my work. Then I brought her back here and made her write her last entry. I thought that would be funny. Then she got boring, so I shut her up forever. She was loud anyway. Could barely get her to stop talking even after I cut her. Ha! They never saw me coming. I was here for a long time before anyone noticed, and when they noticed it was too late. I came in from the woods and stayed under the wooden floor of the barn. They searched the whole farm and never checked there. I think that\u2019s funny. I stayed here for a time after I did my work. I like farms, reminds me of home and family. I love animals too, so I took care of them. I slept in one of the rooms below. Not bad, but I\u2019ve had better. Not to mention that fucking noise. At first, I thought I had another play toy hiding up in the attic, but after searching it, I found nobody. There wasn\u2019t a damn thing except a set of keys. So I left. It scared me, to be honest with you. I\u2019m a God fearing man, and I know well enough that the sound of footsteps made by nobody is downright unholy. Damn near burnt the place down after that, but I realize that would take away the glory of my work. So here it is. Enjoy it. Don\u2019t look for me, I\u2019m long gone. And a word of advice, friend, don\u2019t go into that attic. There\u2019s someone up there even I couldn\u2019t get to.", "comment_date": "2013-11-12T06:56:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Potatodog8892", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lR7s1Y6Zig#t=0m00s\">0:00</a> Nothing<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lR7s1Y6Zig#t=2m35s\">2:35</a> Chocolate Sundae<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lR7s1Y6Zig#t=3m41s\">3:41</a> Donuts<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lR7s1Y6Zig#t=4m52s\">4:52</a> Strawberry Milkshake<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lR7s1Y6Zig#t=5m35s\">5:35</a> Melon...
