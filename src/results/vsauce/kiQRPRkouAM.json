However the English of the not-so-distant past 1900s were unbelievable a-holes. What they did to Ireland during that time - intentionally restricting food supply&#39;s from outside during a potato famine - when the impoverished Irish people&#39;s   staple food was potatoes - while also exporting the other crops and meat to be consumed in Britain, not allowing any of this higher grade food stuff to the local Irish - was tantamount to genocide. There are &quot;mass burial graves&quot; in Ireland, well the south west for sure, where the locals simply wheel-barrowed those who died of starvation and tipped them in. Akin to the mass graves used by the allies for the dead when they liberated Germany in WWII. In some villages in Ireland 80pc died of starvation. The English have a lot of history to be seriously ashamed of. Again modern English are fine people but your ancestors should be remembered with nothing but shame and contempt! At least Blair acknowledged and apologised to Ireland in 1999 for his ancestors behaviour.

It&#39;s called the old friend hypothesis, essentially it proposes that our immune system requires the presence of parasitic worms to develop properly and since we live today in a world where we have access to healthcare, sanitary water and food this causes our immune system to go haywire as it is not fulfilling its functions. This theory is backed up by Immunoglobulin E (a type of antibody) which is often seen as being useless and negative because while it&#39;s function are not fully understood, it is highly associated with allergy and autoimmunity development, however it&#39;s concentration also increases during parasitic worm infections, suggesting that its role is in preventing these infections, but since it&#39;s not doing this in our sanitary world, it primes our immune cells to attack our own. There have actually been studies performed previously where chemicals secreted by parasitic worms have been used on patients and decreased symptoms of their autoimmune diseases, there are even companies providing parasitic worm therapy as alternative medicine.
