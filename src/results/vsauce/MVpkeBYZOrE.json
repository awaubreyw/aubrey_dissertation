For example, I just bought a food for my dog today that is a mixture of &quot;beef and vegetables&quot; (there was one that was &quot;chicken and vegetables&quot; as well). As long as you&#39;re getting the energy (calories) and nutrients you need, you can eat the same thing every day and you&#39;ll be completely fine.
