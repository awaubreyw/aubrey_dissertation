How much money is Love worth? He never really answered the question. He gave estimates of how much love would gross a year with long term benifits (130k) and the monetary equivalent of the first &quot;i love you) (267k) but if you live 15% longer and usually the average life span is measured by people who are in love considering its a very common feeling in humans, 267k+130k/yr-15/20yrs(beggining of life considering love isnt limerant or passionate towards parents and friends and you havent found the one just yet) love would be worth what 7,157,000-7,707,000 for american males (if avg life span is 73) and 7,547,000-8,117,000 for american females (if avg life span is 76). enough to live a lavish life for a few years or a few generations if youre smart enough to invest and make savings accounts and use that to start up a good credit score so you barely have to pay shit on shit with maybe 1% interest anyway.
