Also if you looking for something else interesting to read wanted to read the correction of Child Protective Services a little out of this lead but still talk about being trapped in a system of box this can actually tell you how people feel when they&#39;re not being heard maybe why people go nuts at times you don&#39;t know nothing until you are in this position sadly I&#39;ve been trapped in a box like this not very bright literally and physically but never the less scary as hell because you do feel like you could start to lose your mind... Talk about Mind Over Matter you have no internet you have no Stevie you have no companion... What to do you don&#39;t have a roommate you don&#39;t have anybody with you to do anything to separate the time then you begin to lose it... There was an episode on Law &amp; Order SUV... One of the character is putting a hole and they thought it was 4 weeks and when they came out they said it was was really only 3 days he had been in there... I know that feeling and it&#39;s creepy as hell... It&#39;s like almost dying in your sleep you never sleep the same again at least I know the dead after I ate almost died in my sleep not my fault someone had overdosed me on medication and next thing I know I almost died thank God somebody noticed that I wasn&#39;t breathing one of my children and quickly got their father he brought life back into me and my life went on was it the same no way did I wanted to be the same you betcha but when you experience trauma like this why is it people expect you to get over stuff so quickly because life is so short you can&#39;t waste time on such a traumatic event in your life I think that&#39;s the answer very dramatic question. What if they had that happen to them and everybody is different I get mad when I see girls bitching about that Nails not coming down right or they are not being done right those two me a petty and useless in life especially if they&#39;re pretty to begin with I just want to punch him in the face and cause something to be more visible on them but when I see someone almost die or someone that has fought for war and lost lands then I say to myself Capper what battles you picking yourself... I&#39;m not saying this helps me totally but I always don&#39;t go around and go home is not right my clothes are too tight my fingernails look when you know damn well you look in this world called get over yourself... And I do I&#39;m important but let&#39;s face it so isn&#39;t for billion other people well maybe a little little a little less than that since half the world is full of bad people and a lot of the others have to lie to get the by are they bad or they just getting by...

The reason we took the class was to study the way you can represent complex oblique shapes in a top-front-right side orthographic projection drawing.  It starts simple and gains complexity as the semester goes on.  I started having more vivid and detailed dreams during this class.  Very cool stuff.  A lot of this is a discipline that is being lost because of 3d CAD.  Good stuff, but it is like skipping to a calculator without learning your long division.  Do you know if the answer is really correct without the fundamentals?  This is the kind of textbook I seek out at used bookstores.  My textbook was called Descriptive Geometry.

Vacuum is really just the abscence of mass, just like if you filled a bathtub full of water, then had a bucket and you scooped up 10 gallons of water insanely fast from the middle.. since the simple law of nature is that &quot;nature abhores a vacuum&quot; will make it refill that hole very fast.<br>Most of this is done by gravity..  <br>Now imagine the water is frozen, in the same bathtub and you cut out a hole the size of your bucket... then if you could &quot;flash melt&quot; the ice, instantaneously melt the water, then the water would quickly refill that hole, because gravity is pulling the liquid down, now since the density of the &quot;air&quot; in the hole of this water, is lower then the water, the water will rapidly push the air out and fill it displacing it. Same thing really happens when the egg is pushed into the bottle, where the density of the air in the bottle is lower then the outside, it creates a difference, where the egg has less &quot;pressure&quot; inside the bottle pushing it out, then the pressure outside the bottle trying to push it in, since it is an unequal force, the strongest  of those two forces applies the most manipulation to the egg.<br><br>Another example would be if you take a garden hose and blow in one end, air will rush through the hose and come out the other end... The muscles in your lounges are compressing the air into a  denser state, which increases its atmospheric pressure, to be greater then that of the pressure on the other end, causing the &quot;higher atmospheric pressurized air&quot; in your lounges to want to equalize that pressure, by escaping to a &quot;lower atmospheric pressure&quot;. <br>If you are still reading, i&#39;ll try wrap this up.. <br><br>So basicly what i am trying to say, is that you can call pressure, and sucktion the same thing, since both is really just utilizing the difference between two densities of the same compound of mass. <br><br>Hope my mansplaining wasn&#39;t too terrible and that someone understands what i&#39;ve just explained. :) <br>PS: i am not educated in this, so forgive me if i have terminology or concepts wrong.

And when we do cry out &quot;ouch&quot;, is that an automatic, innate response? Or is it socially and culturally informed? Would someone in east Asia have the same verbalized &quot;ouch&quot; response as someone in the UK would? And if not, then where/when/why did that word, &quot;ouch&quot; come about?  Maybe you could talk about how/why we prescribe words to some specific actions but not others, and what all of this implies about our English language and perhaps the subjective function of words and communication in and of themselves. <br><br>That&#39;d be cool.

Admittedly, at the writing of this comment, it has been a month since a free video was released. Does that mean he&#39;s abandoned us? ABSOLUTELY NOT. Michael, of ALL people, understands that knowledge should not be restricted. That being said, it makes sense for him to begin INCORPORATING (not entire switching to) YouTube Red. This &quot;YTR is the end of free videos&quot; thing is nonsense. I am pretty sure that in order to make videos for YTR you have to actually spend some money on it. And OF COURSE it makes sense for him to start making money from Red. Even when you add in the views from this video, YouTube takes a significant chunk of any money earned as part of the privilege of making money from it. On top of that, and the production costs of these more recent videos (and what I&#39;ve seen of them), there is NO WAY that VSauce could continue on the money its making now. And, note that Mind Field is around 30 minutes per episode. Think of it this way: YTR is like a TV channel (Discovery, for example), in that you have to PAY in order to be able to use it. However,  the content is generally high quality, and is expected to be watched for longer periods of time. YTR is not the end of free videos. YTR is the end of television.<br><br>Whew, that was one heck of a rant, and I doubtless missed several points.

Then someone might say: &quot;Those negative pressures are possible only in liquids&quot;. That would not be true either. Negative pressures are possible for all three: liquids, solids and gases. Someone might say: &quot;Okay, molecular interactions result in negative pressure in solids and liquids, I can agree to that, but in gases - no way! Even if a molecule of the gas hits the wall and bounces back with less momentum, the change in momentum would still result in positive pressure on the wall!&quot;. Well I do not want to spoil everything for you, so I&#39;ll just give a hint - walls should be really close to each other to make it possible.<br><br>P.S.

At one point in time, you served as beacons of intellectual inquiry and entertainment brought about by nothing other than the pure joy of gaining knowledge previously in the dark to us. Most importantly, you were accessible to anyone with a computer and Wi-Fi access. At anytime, one could delve into a heaping treasure trove of knowledge and tangential facts, which by the end gave one a new perspective and rekindling of neurological stimulation. However, your recent decision to pour a majority effort into a show which requires the viewer to pay a fee to access is saddening. It used to light up my day to see that there was a new Vsauce video available to satisfy the insatiable desire for knowledge. Now I am disappointed when I see an upload because I know it&#39;s contents are barred from me. My point, I think many of your viewers would agree that your transition to YouTube Red was a mistake.

Before all this extra stuff that Michael&#39;s doing now (Brain Candy, Mind Field, etc.), Vsauce was about an idea. He would think of an idea or several ideas and base the video around that, exploring the mathematics and the philosophy, and this would keep me hooked the whole way through. It was great, I loved it, Vsauce was easily my favorite channel on Youtube. But I feel like it&#39;s losing some of my favorite qualities, and I can&#39;t help but feel disappointed. I absolutely respect the fact that Michael is in charge of Vsauce and decides where it goes, but I&#39;m starting to miss what it used to be.

Anyway, when I saw you write &quot;poop&quot; on the paper I literally screamed. I have been doing this for years as well and I no idea why. The word itself just amuses me, it&#39;s just so satisfying to both say and write. Whenever I just have to write a &quot;random&quot; word it&#39;s always poop. I used to just occasionally write it on things just because. I don&#39;t know it&#39;s because it&#39;s the same forwards and backwards or that it&#39;s four letter or that it&#39;s paired, like two Ps and two Os, or what the hell. I guess what I&#39;m saying is I always find it odd when I notice weird similarities with myself and those who I know are much smarter than me. Great video.

The whole idea of sucking was not making any logic considering what happens to air in space, like is the space sucking the air out from a container nope, the air is just going out because of itself. That makes me reconsider how strong actually 1psi of air is, imagine if the atmosphere would be at 7psi.<br><br>Like an example how you see the atmosphere is pushing back, if you suck from a hose liquid but don&#39;t let it start flowing and you open the mouth of the hose to atmosphere again, it goes back because of the atmospheric pressure, I always thought it was because of the gravity and the connection of the water like if you have the hose coming up from a liquid source and then go back down making an upside down U, but it was just mostly the air pressure doing the work, without the atmosphere it would&#39;ve just split in half the moment you let go of the hose mouth, also the reason why it stays flowing is again because of the air pressure it&#39;s pushing from the other end.<br><br>So I&#39;m wondering one thing about what sucking is actually, like one is just creating a flow tunnel for the pressure to pass through like a vacuum or for liquids going through stuff while the atmosphere is in contact with the place where it starts flowing, and there&#39;s expanding the room or compressing the atmosphere in one location where atmosphere can flow into. The latter being how superman&#39;s cold breath would work when he &quot;sucks&quot; the air inside, but there&#39;s that problem how can he suck that air so fast if the only thing his lungs are just making more room and mouth opening up if sucking really doesn&#39;t exist. I mean if you suck your skin when you put your mouth over it, what is happening there then, is the air pressure pushing the skin inside because you&#39;re compressing and/or enlarging your lunge capacity, if so superman wouldn&#39;t be able to suck so much air inside, he would limited to the atmospheres air pressure in terms of sucking speed.", "comment_date": "2017-02-04T22:09:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "amrito", "comment_text": "I want that metal thing so I can chew it all day", "comment_date": "2017-02-04T22:09:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zegnar", "comment_text": "Hey Vsauce, Michael here.
