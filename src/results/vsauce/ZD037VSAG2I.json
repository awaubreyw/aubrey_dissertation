If people chant, they need to carefully focus on staying in tune while simultaneously keeping up the volume, and if a moderate amount of background noise is present or the message isn&#39;t coordinated the words become garbled. Clapping on the other hand just becomes louder the more people do it and the more enthusiasm they do it with, no matter how uncoordinated the group is. Similarly, if 10,000 people like a video, it is clearly being shown more approval than a smaller number, even if none of the individual likers coordinate in any way. More likes is just a louder clap, and to extend the analogy further comments can be viewed like the excited hoots and fanmade signs (and occasional boos), distinct from the clapping but still adding to the applause. Of course, comments are even better because they can actually share ideas on the subject, and because of the separating power of computers the individual voices can be heard separately and understood rather than being muddled or lost in the noise.", "comment_date": "2016-04-12T21:53:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xbox360Player350", "comment_text": "Proto-iWatch at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD037VSAG2I&amp;t=8m29s\">8:29</a>", "comment_date": "2016-04-12T19:55:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nixitur", "comment_text": "My first guess was that it was related to the origins of the practice of knocking on wood or just generally making noise to ward off evil spirits. In many Western cultures, when you speak about fortune, you knock on wood, hoping that the noise wards off the demons aiming to curse or jinx you. The practice of fireworks at New Year&#39;s Eve comes from the same general idea, hoping that you start the new year with good luck.<br>Where this connects back to showing appreciation is that when somebody achieves a difficult task, that speaks of rather good fortune. And since good fortune can&#39;t last, there must be bad fortune right around the corner. If you want to prevent that, you&#39;ll just have to make some noise. It is both an expression of your appreciation for their task or performance and a wish of good luck in future endeavors.<br>Interestingly, in many circumstances, clapping is replaced by <i>literally</i> knocking on wood. In university (in Germany, at least), when the lecture, presentation or seminar is over, you don&#39;t clap. No, you repeatedly knock on your table. It has the same point as applause after a performance: Showing appreciation to the speaker while blending into a crowd. And to me, that seems remarkably similar to the practice of knocking on wood to ward off bad fortune.<br><br>Of course, this is all just guesswork. The idea of applause to show appreciation goes back a long, long way. I have no clue whether the idea of &quot;noise -&gt; good fortune&quot; has similarly old and reputable sources.

Even after my education as an audio recording and mixing engineer, I&#39;m still finding creative ideas and tips like this that continue to surprise, and motivate me.<br><br>This being said, I strongly disagree with your statements saying that the harmonics of a clap are what make it &#39;unusable&#39; as a melodic instrument (an instrument with a tonal center). For example, a square wave is the result of one frequency, being multiplied my odd numbers, and then being stacked on top of each other. This is called additive synthases, and in my experience, is the most commonly practiced forms of synthases.<br><br>What makes most claps unusable is the fact that most lack a fundamental frequency, or a prominent harmonic frequency(a specific point in the sound where the harmonics are louder, therefor show up as a peak in the chart). Even in the chart it shows that A1+, A1, and A-1 ALL have a tonal center between 0 kHz and 1 kHz. In fact, these kinds of claps are commonly used in almost every genre of music. As you can see in the other examples who don&#39;t have a fundamental frequency still possess these frequencies, they are just at the same amplitude as the rest.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Chris S.", "comment_date": "2015-03-18T09:57:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bosslifedtgp", "comment_text": "Clapping- repeatedly high fiving yourself for others accomplishments ", "comment_date": "2015-03-18T04:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Randolph", "comment_text": "like if you always pee on the side of the toilet to make less noise =)\ufeff", "comment_date": "2015-03-16T23:08:16Z", "likes_count": 287}, {"comment_by": "Failmaster", "comment_text": "you are a floating head", "comment_date": "2015-03-15T18:11:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesse Bustamante", "comment_text": "I play clarinet :3 I&#39;ve played for 4 years now :3", "comment_date": "2015-03-15T03:05:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kailey", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD037VSAG2I&amp;t=7m19s\">7:19</a> Beck!
