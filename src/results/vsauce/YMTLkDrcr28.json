Ever stolen (the value is irrelevant)? Jesus said, \u201cWhoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\u201d In God\u2019s courtroom, our sins are very serious crimes. They\u2019re so evil that the just punishment is death and eternity in a terrible place called Hell.<br><br>The Bible says that God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. He is rich in mercy and provided a Savior: \u201cGod so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\u201d Jesus Christ died on the cross, paying the death penalty for sinners. He then rose from the dead three days later, defeating death. Hundreds saw Him after His resurrection; it\u2019s no fairy tale. Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies about the promised Savior, written in the Holy Scriptures hundreds of years before His birth.<br><br>Religious rites, sacred traditions, or attending church can\u2019t save you.

God bless, share the gospel and put God first. i hope you have a nice week. Jesus isn&#39;t just someone who is divine, full of grace, and someone who can free you of all sin and death. He can also free you of depression, tears, sadness, and of a life that isn&#39;t great or fulfilling. I have found that in Christ, a happy, fulfilling, holy, and a better life. Many others have as well,  and I hope you do too. Jesus loves you so much that He died for you on the cross, taking your sin and death that once was hard to take back. Jesus forgives you of your sins and helps you to repent, and leads you into salvation which is given by the cross to accept the reward of Heaven, Jesus&#39;s Kingdom. We cannot earn it nor work for it, if you believe in the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, you will be saved. To be saved means to be saved from God himself, God&#39;s wrath lies on those who do not believe and rebel, joining the world in its evil deeds and practices. Jesus rose from the dead, showing the people that if He could conquer death, you can too. Heaven is where you conquer death. True salvation requires sacrifice, but in the end it is worth it. A life is never the same when Jesus impacts it. We are punishable by death by sin, but if you would say to the Lord, &quot;forgive me, help me to repent and sin no more and live a life for you&quot; we would do better, be better, and repent and be saved by Jesus Himself. Jesus is King, and &quot;I can do all things with Christ who strengthens me.&quot; -Phil @. God bless you. Jesus can win the battles you cannot win. God give us angles to protect us \ud83d\ude4f Jesus, please help up to love you and put you above all things in our lives. may your love Jesus protect us always, we need you :) God bless you if you read that, you didn\u2019t have to but you chose to. God, bless us all please. Glory be to God the Father.
