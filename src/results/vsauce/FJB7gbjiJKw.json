Or, that\u2019s just how the first spiral galaxies were formed, because apparently spiral galaxies come from elliptical galaxies when large star in the whole galaxy explodes into a supernova which can turn into a black hole, and that black hole starts sucking up all the stars in the elliptical galaxy which makes the stars spiral around it, creating s spiral galaxy.

Well in this case the brightest known thing is so to say the R136a1 now, this nuclear fueled beast is 256 times more massive than our sun, it\u2019s the biggest and brightest known sun in the universe. Now remember that lower absolute magnitudes are brighter, R136a1 isn\u2019t 4.8 like our sun but instead it\u2019s negative 12.6 which means it\u2019s 8.7 million times brighter than our sun, but R136a1 isn\u2019t the brightest thing out there. When giant stars die it explodes violently and causes what is known as a super-nova or hyper-nova. Now, supernovas can eject terrifying flashes of radiation known as gamma ray bursts, arguably the brightest electromagnetic events in the universe. A typical gamma ray burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as our sun would release altogether in its entire 10 billion year lifetime.

It\u2019s A Pupil Because When You Look Into It You See A Pupa, A Small Doll Version Of You. But What Is The Brightest Thing In The UniVerse. Apparent Magnitude, Commonly Used When StarGazing Refers To How Bright An Object Appears To Us, Say When Looking Up From Earth. It Depends On Earths Centric Factors, Like How Close The Object Is To Our Planet. Magnitudes Are Logarithmic And Arranged Like Golf, Where A Smaller Number Means A Greater Brightness. But Today I\u2019m Looking For Absolute Magnitude, A Measure Of How Bright EveryThing All Over The UniVerse Near And Far Would Be If We Looked At Them At The Same . Absolute Magnitude Will Guide Us To The Most Blinding Light In The UniVerse IrreSpective To It Looking Faint On Earth. If You Placed A LightBulb 8 Centimetres, About 3 Inches, Away Your Eye, It Would Appear Brighter Than The Sun In The Sky. But That\u2019s Not Fair, If You Place A LightBulb Next To The Sun, The Sun Would Be A Septillion Times Brighter Than The LightBulb. But If You Lined EveryThing Out There Giving Every Star And Cosmological Phenomenon A Fair Chance, The Sun\u2019s Absolute Magnitude Would Be 4.8. Not Bad. But Check Out R136a1. This Nuclear Fuelled Beast Isn\u2019t The Biggest Star In The Terms Of Volume But It\u2019s 256 Times Massive than The Sun It\u2019s The Most Massive Star And The Brightest. Remember The Lower Absolute Magnitudes The Brighter, R136a1 Isn\u2019t 4.8, Like Our Sun, it\u2019s -12.6, Which Means It\u2019s 8.7 Million Times Brighter Than Our Sun.", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T13:04:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rui Dias", "comment_text": "A white hole", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T01:35:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stan Watcham", "comment_text": "Wow, sorta represents the balance of good and evil in a way.

I find myself somehow lifted up, taken on a journey and not only hearing the information, but wondering. This usually only happens with either music that is just right for the moment, or the occasional movie. But you managed with an informative video on quasars, haha.. weird!! Great!!

If it happens to be highly anisotropic however, there is a risk that it might cause significant harm, in particular because it is generally assumed that the rotational axis of both stars are orientated in the same way as the binary system, with an estimated (but uncertain) 12 degrees inclination relative to Earth. Anisotropic supernovae concentrate their radiative emissions in jet-cones along their rotational axis, so this face-on alignment makes WR 104 potentially dangerous. According to the data about WR 104, both supernovae are expected to be anisotropic.Regarding a GRB from WR 104 specifically, only sketchy estimates have been published so far. To predict the potential consequences for life on Earth, a proper determination of the rotational axis inclination relative to Earth is considered the most vital issue in this regard. If a beam of high energy radiation from a nearby GRB hits Earth, model calculations shows that it can have destructive consequences for the ecosystems. The range of destruction depends on the magnitude and distance of the burst and on how much of the radiation beam hits. It is currently &quot;highly unlikely&quot; that a GRB from WR 104 will pose a danger to life on Earth.According to astronomer Peter Tuthill, in order to damage life on Earth, the Wolf-Rayet star would have to undergo an extraordinary string of events:<br><br>The Wolf-Rayet star would have to generate a GRB. Because GRBs are associated with galaxies with a low metallicity and haven&#39;t yet been observed in our Milky Way Galaxy, astronomers believe it unlikely that WR 104 will generate a GRB. Tuthill tentatively estimates the probability for any kind of GRB is around the level of one percent, but cautions more research is needed to be confident.<br>The rotational axis of the Wolf-Rayet star, would have to be pointed in the direction of our planet. The star&#39;s axis is estimated to be close to the axis of the binary orbit of WR 104. Observations of the spiral plume are consistent with an orbital pole angle of anywhere from 0 to 16 degrees relative to the Earth, but a spectrographic observation suggest a significantly larger and therefore less dangerous angle. Estimates of the &quot;opening angle&quot; of a GRB&#39;s arc currently range from 2 to 20 degrees. (Note: The &quot;opening angle&quot; is the total angular span of a GRB radiation beam, not the angular span from the axis to one side. Earth would therefore only be in the path of a GRB if the actual angle of the star&#39;s axis relative to Earth is less than half the opening angle.)<br>The GRB would have to reach far enough in order to damage life on Earth. The more narrow a GRB radiation beam is, the farther it will reach, but the less likely it is to hit Earth.", "comment_date": "2016-10-19T16:12:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eugene", "comment_text": "this man took 43 seconds to tell us about the yin yang symbol just to lead up to thos question, &quot;but whats the brightest object in the entire universe&quot; \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2016-10-19T04:52:52Z", "likes_count": 36}, {"comment_by": "Carter Allen", "comment_text": "what is the tune at the very end", "comment_date": "2016-10-18T10:45:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "c9 scotty", "comment_text": "wtf that ending", "comment_date": "2016-10-18T03:11:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "asbfkbahvbchs", "comment_text": "boy that escalated Quickly!!!", "comment_date": "2016-10-18T02:23:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Francisca Ulloa", "comment_text": "Love It.", "comment_date": "2016-10-17T15:46:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hamza 1", "comment_text": "wow", "comment_date": "2016-10-17T14:27:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "HM05 Me Baby", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t it be looking <b>out</b> from earth instead of up from earth", "comment_date": "2016-10-17T04:00:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scuba Steve", "comment_text": "Vsauce videos are the only things to give me chills from sheer knowledge and scale", "comment_date": "2016-10-16T21:33:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Borechan challenge", "comment_text": "Look at dark matter for 20minutes and look at a quazar for 5minutes look at a mirror boom you&#39;r blind!", "comment_date": "2016-10-16T13:06:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "javi jotas", "comment_text": "80% of the light we see in space was made by 20% of the stars xDDDDDD", "comment_date": "2016-10-14T19:48:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Han Han", "comment_text": "it&#39;s sad when people are scared of the sky", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T09:53:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RedLazzer", "comment_text": "Damnit, you made me even more scared of Black Holes", "comment_date": "2016-10-12T20:07:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan Dart", "comment_text": "I suppose it would be better to call dark matter &quot;invisible&quot; if that hypothesis is true.<br>That&#39;s closer to non-interacting than darkness...", "comment_date": "2016-10-12T10:25:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fluffle Bear", "comment_text": "I am having an existential crisis! o.o", "comment_date": "2016-10-12T06:23:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "Vsause!!!!

Instead it works only with geometric objects without such properties and limitations on which can be applied arbitrary mathematical operations. But all physical objects have such properties and restrictions.

The countless universes, each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-02-08T17:17:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zebedee Arshad", "comment_text": "As we see the universe as it was in the past I was wondering if you would do a video on what the preset condition of our outer universe is?

Most of this is &quot;hand-me-down&quot; knowledge from him, so I may have a few things mixed up, but\u00a0this is factual information to the best of my knowledge.<br><br>Okay, here&#39;s the good stuff: Solar panels work best in direct sunlight, and as you know, the sun rises in a slightly different place on the horizon every day, then follows a slightly different path across the sky before setting. this is dependent on the time of year. (the earth&#39;s tilt relative to it&#39;s position around the sun) It is because of this that researchers have attempted to understand and create a system of solar panels which actively &quot;seek out&quot; the suns light, and make the panels faces angled in such a way that the light is as direct as possible. The solution was much simpler than previously thought, as well as having been waved around under our noses for thousands of years.\u00a0<br><br>The Taijitus dividing line, between the dark and light sections represents the sun&#39;s position every day of the year, the white section actually represents light- Day, while that black represents night. The equinoxes are shown at the apexes of each curve, and the Solstices are at the center and top/bottom of the Taijitu.\u00a0<br>Now, this is the part which I am not entirely sure on: The &quot;Spots&quot; in either section are there just as markers to the radii of each curve. I know that that much of it is true, (mathematically, it works out) but I do not know if there is an additional reason for the spots in either section.<br><br>I was hoping that you could do a follow up video on this, because you mentioned in your video that there is no know connection between the roman&#39;s Taijitu and the Chinese&#39;. So this would count as that connection If I&#39;m correct. They would not need to have traded or interacted, but just had astronomers dedicated to watching the sun&#39;s pattern across the sky for an entire year before they realized they were back where they started.<br><br>I hope you find this interesting!

I find it truly fascinating that the emergence of plasma cosmology has been able to make spot on predictions about new discoveries where the standard model seems to fail horribly. I have taken both theories with a grain of salt but cannot help but feel that the Electric Universe model is fast becoming to new champion of astronomy. My first introduction to it was through the documentary &quot;The Electric Comet&quot; by Wallace Thornhill and it revealed something to me that screamed truth through simplicity. <br><br>I am not trying to be a converter of any kind, but I do ask that you take a look at it at least to see how it may speak to you. <br><br>At the least you must wonder why organizations like NASA are continually baffled by new discoveries because they do not fit the standard model (ie &quot;impossibilities&quot; they state) yet somehow are in existence and observable. I believe the Deep Impact mission sent to Tempel 1 was a crutial turning point for the theory, considering that every prediction made by Wal Thornhill was correct and none of NASA&#39;s predictions came true. Scientifically when predictions are contradicted so severely, a look at the theory should and MUST be made, correct?<br><br>Anyways, I appreciate the work you&#39;ve done and hopefully could get your opinion on the subject once you&#39;ve checked it out.

Pretty simple, if an object doubles it&#39;s distance away from you, the brightness is a quarter, if it gets 3 time further away it is 1/9th and so on. You can also calculate the distance a star is away by taking the measurements of how far it move across the night sky in 6 months; if it moves 1/3600th of a degree it is 1 parsec away. A parsec is a measure of distance, i think 1 light year. That&#39;s all i can remember from my astronomy GCSE 2 years ago!<br><b>Edit</b><br>Regarding dark matter, dark matter is a type of anti-gravity. It&#39;s existence has only be hypothesised due to the way our galaxys spiral arms spin. As the you track the galaxy further out the rotation speed SHOULD slow down, but instead its velocity/rotation rate is similar to the rotational rate of the centre of the galaxy. This is strong evidence that dark matter is acting as an repellant/anti-gravity against the arms of the galaxy and spinning them faster. :) <b>TheMoreYouKnow</b>", "comment_date": "2014-02-03T22:15:37Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Chunkelybankelit", "comment_text": "A man travels the world over in search of what he needs and returns home to find it\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-02-03T22:15:32Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "EnvyThaGamez", "comment_text": "I saw that ying and yang this without it being pointed out...... nice", "comment_date": "2014-02-03T22:15:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jaskt", "comment_text": "I honestly love Vsauce videos so much.

now i know you did a &quot;You live in the past video&quot; true we can&#39;t see into the future! but can we stop time? or slow it down? you see why can&#39;t you hit a housefly so easily? ha? because a housefly can process things seven times faster than us humans so it sees things in slow motion like the matrix, dogs are not interested in TV cause all they see is slow frame rate pictures flashing, so as in accidents our brain speeds up the processing of things so we see the car accident slowly small creatures tend to have faster visual processing, so if you&#39;re small enough or have a fast brain visual processing can you stop the time or slow it down? interesting ... what we call seconds and milliseconds nanoseconds attosecond... etc are not the smallest measurements but what is the smallest measurement? is there any measurement unit that if our brain can process it can stop the time? what is a &quot;TIME&quot; i mean anything faster than a millisecond our eyes can&#39;t detect, we know that the earth is moving in the speed of a bullet but how accurate is that? this is all based on a search i&#39;ve done i think that after i searched that a house fly can process things seven times more than humans, what if that wasn&#39;t the case? what if there&#39;s a relation between how large the object is and the speed of it compared to small things maybe as the object gets larger and we&#39;re smaller it gets slower? why did the 9/11 towers fell so slowly? well they don&#39;t have a &quot;slower visual brain processing&quot; sure and neither as we have slow &quot;visual processing&quot; so what&#39;s the case? is it as what i&#39;m thinking that there&#39;s a relation between the time it takes for the object to do something like orbit around the sun? and the other object&#39;s magnitude? i mean earth if it can see us in it i think it would see us moving at the speed of light or maybe more than that because we see it moving so slowly while it&#39;s moving faster than a bullet, the object has to be very small though please make a video about it or just reply to my comment it took me some time to write this lol this question confuses me please reply i&#39;m always watching your videos thanks my name is Ahmad i&#39;m from iraq by the way.", "comment_date": "2014-02-03T21:34:03Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Atler the Dark", "comment_text": "I got here 5 minutes after posting and the comments section is already full!", "comment_date": "2014-02-03T21:33:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aguel", "comment_text": "Awesome!", "comment_date": "2014-02-03T21:33:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CrazyVideoUploader", "comment_text": "Omg he posted this 3 mins ago, i might be the first! - said no one ever", "comment_date": "2014-02-03T21:33:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fizzy and Friends", "comment_text": "Thank you phone Notification :D", "comment_date": "2014-02-03T21:33:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dante Seychel", "comment_text": "Lol, using the Chinese Ying Yang to segway into the main idea", "comment_date": "2014-02-03T21:33:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "quadlex19", "comment_text": "early birrrdd.
