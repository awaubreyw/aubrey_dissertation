A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Because when people are awkward, they&#39;re trying to ignore the elephant in the room; their awkward actions - saying &quot;you too&quot; when the cinema clerk says &quot;enjoy your film&quot;, going for a fist-bump when the other person is going for a high five. Acknowledging the moment, the blooper, the elephant helps release the stress, you and the other person(s) can end up laugh, which really breaks the ice. However, don&#39;t overdo it and start calling yourself awkward, as that&#39;ll make you feel even more inferior, which is the whole reason people are awkward; &quot;what people think of me? this person isn&#39;t awkward, <i>I</i> am. Oh gosh I&#39;m so darn awkward.&quot;<br><br>No, you&#39;re not. <br>People don&#39;t normally think much of your features if that&#39;s what you&#39;re sensitive and worried about. They see you, whatever shape or size that may be, and move on. What you may think if you&#39;re sensitive about weight, height or appearance may be &quot;Oh gosh everyone thinks ... and it&#39;s probably so awkward&quot; ends up really being; &quot;Oh they&#39;re ... okay :D&quot; and this only lasts for a split second. By nature, we&#39;re eager to learn, to be informed, educated and entertained (as the BBC&#39;s motto goes), and so we focus more on the actual words that come out of the person&#39;s mouth and not them. If you think you&#39;re someone who has a certain body type or appearance, but is extremely happy and confident about it, it makes you really stand out and people appreciate you. Genuinely. They may think &quot;hmm, this person may look like ... but they&#39;re so happy and bubbly and I love every single bit of them :D&quot;. They make an observation and move on. Everyone is different.

Would you be good enough to get into heaven?<br> <br>Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person: <br> <br>1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? <br>2. Have you ever stolen? <br>3. Have you ever used God&#39;s name in vain?<br>4. Jesus said that &quot;whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart&quot; (Matthew 5:28). Have you ever looked with lust? <br>5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? <br>6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?<br> <br>The Bible says that &quot;all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone&quot; (Revelation 21:8) and &quot;Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people \u2014 none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God&quot; (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn&#39;t have to go to Hell? <br> <br>2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God&#39;s law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus\u2019 death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. <br> <br>What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don&#39;t trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, \u201cNo one is good \u2014 except God alone\u201d (Mark 10:18). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus. <br> <br>When are you going to do that?<br> <br>Here is a short Christian movie on this subject and depression: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc</a>", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T12:39:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "alwaysyouramanda", "comment_text": "as language is powerful in shaping thoughts and behaviors, im sad to see there aren&#39;t more words for finer.. little things in life.", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T07:16:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alwaysyouramanda", "comment_text": "There&#39;s a word for it!

As someone who had \u201cprotagonist disease\u201d growing up, I think it\u2019s a part of survival instinct. If a child grows up without a support system, it causes them to feel like they themselves are there only means of survival and so they embody a narcissistic perspective. Now that I have a support system, that has gone away because I\u2019m no longer in survival mode.

Awkwardness is a creation of mind where a persons any type of behaviour or the surrounding behaviour may feel awkward. But many people create awdwardness.

Many play like jokers and shout or quarrel and so on. Still they manage in confidence. Awkwardness comes even by torn clothes. But you should always think from your point of view which can increase the confidence. Think of why your clothes gets torn whats the maximum you did for its repair or for a new clothes, why have you not taken newer pair of shoes justs that. If you are awkward seeing the others behaviour rude or funny its better you can communicate and help that person to show the way ahead of what situation they are in. That brings a positive impact in the society as well as increase the goodness account of your backbone. Its a gap between what you think or the society think and what should be.

I used to work there and one day I was working a funeral in full suit and tie... but I was also a stoner. So on my lunch breaks I would go home and toke. Well my buddy texted me one day and said he had a new dab rig. I had never dabbed before so I was game. I went home and he met me there and we got high af. I went back to work and had to use the restroom. I was taking a leak and my phone buzzes. It was my friend. So I\u2019m reading the text which was a bit lengthy. So as I\u2019m reading, I\u2019m also peeing. I texted him back and it was also a bit lengthy. About a paragraph and a half. Anyway so I walk to the mirror after I sent the text to \u201csee how I looked\u201d. Put a few drops of clear eyes and and walked out. By that time the foyer was full of the family of the deceased. I had no idea why they were all looking at me like they had seen a ghost. Being stoned af didn\u2019t help either because I was all in my head like \u201cfuck do I look that high!?\u201d Anyway I couldn\u2019t get out of there quick enough. So I went outside around back which was employee parking. It was a bit windy that day and that\u2019s when I felt the breeze... that nice cool early fall breeze... on the tip of my dick, which was hanging out where I forgot to zip it up while I was taking a leak. <br><br>I had walked out into a room full of about 25-30 mourning family members. I felt sick to my stomach. On top of being high (which had severely subsided due to this major buzzkill) not only that but I was the one responsible for rolling the casket carrying the deceased to the front of the church and standing there with my hands folded as the family walked in and sat in the pews... immediate family members came in first and sat in the front rows... the death stares (pun fully intended) were brutal.<br><br>True fucking story. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23fml\">#FML</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-21T14:48:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chessguy", "comment_text": "If I&#39;m bored, I go out of my way to embarrass myself.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T22:49:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dainty delusionalynn", "comment_text": "<b>Most awkward thing</b><br><br><br>When some stranger passes you by  calls you &quot;fatass&quot; infront of your good-looking friends..", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T17:31:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shawarmageddonit", "comment_text": "Things: Exist<br><br>Youtube users in 2020: Only understand a point when it&#39;s phrased like this.", "comment_date": "2020-10-20T14:55:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allyson", "comment_text": "EEE is why I can&#39;t watch the office.

The sense of belonging is something I really wanted to feel for the longest time but never really found a group to belong to. I either come off very antisocial or very annoying when trying to make friends. I still have trouble balancing it since I default to being antisocial just to avoid the embarrassment. When I see some opposing views to what I just said or did that I didnt really expect, I become paranoid and trapped in my own negativity. I can already feel they wont try to understand or even acknowledge my effort of trying to explain myself. I feel like a waste of time to talk to. I never really met anyone irl who made effort to listen to what I have to say so Im quite prone to raising my voice out of spite and anger when really provoked. But usually, I stammer and stutter and couldnt even speak. I feel like I was falling apart. I understand some social settings and etiquettes to avoid embarrassment but at the same time, I struggle to balance it esp when I worry about sacrificing my own identity just to fit in. I mean, in the first place, I feel like Im not really that interesting of a person. The dread feeling when no one really likes my company since people avoid me usually and I avoided back as a response. The impression of being antisocial/hard to talk to/have my own world/uninterested in anyone doesnt really invite people to come so I cant blame people on that. I tried to be awkwardly approachable when I got out of highschool and tried to be friendly and outgoing. But in the end, despite earnig some friends along the way, I didnt feel satisfied and felt even lonelier. Hopefully no one really read this rambling.

But even if I know this, I&#39;m still literally the most awkward and introverted person in existence. And by the way, him saying &quot;And who is the main character in the universe&quot; isn&quot;t off topic at all. It&#39;s very related. If you are able to well correlate things together and know how things work, you would instantly know the connection. If you want to become smart, you have to continue thinking and logically analyze everything. Even the smallest things, you should logically analyse. If you constantly do that everyday, you will be able to connect more and more things together. And you will understand how the world works and how so many things work. Everyone should become a psychologist. It will really help in life especially in making the right decisions.<br><br><br>I just want to say one more thing. There are things called subliminal messages. They are basically messages which go below the threshold of your conscious perception. In other words, you won&#39;t consciously notice it, but your brain will and sort of act based on it. Let me give an example. First, get a pen and paper. Now write down a bunch of 2&#39;s in a triangular type form like shown below.<br>    2<br>   22<br>  222<br> 2222<br>22222<br><br><br>Next, write down the numbers 14, 18 and 24.<br><br><br>Now think of a completely random vegetable and write it down as soon as possible. <br><br><br><br><br>Now let me guess what it was. Was is a carrot? It is psychologically more likely for you to have thought of a carrot (Or possibly even a squash). Why? It&#39;s simple. The triangular shape of the 2&#39;s are of similar shape to a carrot and the numbers 14, 18 and 24 are some common purity levels of <b>karat</b> gold. And your brain was able to see the connection without you consciously noticing (If you didn&#39;t get carrot or squash, you are more likely to have more control over your mind than some others who did get those vegetables).<br><br><br>So what is my point? The smallest of things that you observe or hear or feel or whatever can affect your decisions and what you think. Subliminal messages actually even affect you on making long term decisions as well. But that is no surprise. Why? Because pretty much everything totally can change your entire life. Sounds pretty stupid right? But it really isn&#39;t. Simply deciding to have noodles for dinner rather than making a nice homemade meal can change your entire life. Let me explain. If someone decided to eat noodles instead, while they&#39;re cooking noodles, they will naturally think of completely different things and be reminded of different things than when they have chosen to eat a homemade special dinner. And soon, those thoughts will develop into more thoughts. And these thoughts can remind you of something else. And you having been reminded of something else will make you have more thoughts.<br><br><br>And so it will basically start a domino effect and it will make you think of completely different things. And you will act and make certain decisions based on those thoughts. And then you will eventually go to sleep. In the next day, you would probably expect the domino effect to have stopped right? But no. You having thought of a bunch of different things last night will at least remind you of something and it will bring in more thoughts. And then you will act of those thoughts. These actions will cause different outcomes to happen. And then you will develop thoughts depending and based around the outcomes. So it the domino continues.<br><br><br>So it&#39;s basically a never ending set of dominos. So just know that any tiny action you do can literally change your entire life. If you think that what I said isn&#39;t realistic, you simply just don&#39;t understand. Maybe I will give an example. I found out about subliminal messages around 5 months ago. I found it because I watched a video of a couple of people making fun of some dumb comments or tweets or something. Somewhere in their video, there was something about subliminal messages and I got interested in it. So I researched and did the same test that I gave you. And so I learned something and developed a bunch of thoughts. If I never saw that video, I won&#39;t even have watched this video. And I probably wouldn&#39;t even have broken my finger last week.<br><br><br>Anyways, my point is that every decision is very important. And if you know how different things affect each other and how things work, you probably will make better decisions. If you read this and thought about it, it might probably change your life.", "comment_date": "2019-08-31T06:55:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CheezeNachos", "comment_text": "I know Michael won&#39;t see this, but thank you about telling me about the &quot;protaganist disease&quot; it really helps me to be to stop thinking about what others think about me, I wanna &quot;take it with me&quot; so I would always look at life from this perspective.", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T20:40:03Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Adam Beatty", "comment_text": "I think you&#39;d like fortune cookie philosophy at <a href=\"http://minds.com/\">minds.com</a>.", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T13:52:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Beatty", "comment_text": "Not giving a fuck is a superpower.", "comment_date": "2019-08-29T13:39:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Theodore Pruitt", "comment_text": "LOOK AT ME REMEMBER ME!!!!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2019-08-28T22:19:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johan J\u00f6nsson", "comment_text": "I love the Vsauce music! :D", "comment_date": "2019-08-28T11:25:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MIMAS-1", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o268qbb_0BM&amp;t=1m20s\">1:20</a> \u201eWhat ist awkardnis\u201c <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o268qbb_0BM&amp;t=1m23s\">1:23</a> \u201e Who is the main chareckter of the univers\u201c", "comment_date": "2019-08-27T09:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cadence", "comment_text": "This video is calling to me", "comment_date": "2019-08-27T01:40:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eva n", "comment_text": "We all know your the true main character of the universe Micheal.", "comment_date": "2019-08-26T23:56:52Z", "likes_count": 42}, {"comment_by": "Rodney Whiddon", "comment_text": "I wonder how many squats @Vsauce has done to pop up from the bottom of the screen for us.

It is the melody of lagging behind played by an invisible flute in your throat.  It is scaling an unmolested mountain only to make out the flag of another company flapping in the wind.  It is mastering the shotgun position as sublimation for coveting the driver&#39;s wheel.   Awkwardness is believing in patterns.  Children have no awkwardness because they have not been taught that one event follows the other.  One action should be complemented by another one or only a select amount of reactions.   The word proper wears the hangman&#39;s mask.  We are taught what to expect instead of expecting to be taught by novelty.   <br><br>&quot;Proper&quot; is the homogenization of experience so that we do not go &quot;too far&quot;, whatever that means.  This hangman thumbs down our decision and a POTENTIAL PERSON actually dies.  I want to make rock figurines for a living!  Nope, pull the leaver, the floor drops off and the noose shows it&#39;s worth.  That person just died.  There are a bunch of potential persons lining up nervously for approval to exist, but that guy died and won&#39;t come back!   <br><br>Proper spins a web called culture which is an experience farm.  You are allowed your daily intake of intrigue, excitement, love, curiosity, power, insight, but good God have all the disappointment you want.

It does not say sit here for 7 hours and let us talk to you, so you can learn to work for 8, only to slink home to climb inside your television oven for 5.  There is something confining about fear, loathing, and depression.  They come with their own walls.  You don&#39;t even need to assemble them.  When you feel any of these emotions, or are touched by a related mentality, it were as if a giant bowl from the sky falls on you, and you are free to move as much as you like in the bowl.  How much sadness must children be injected with to keep them seated?   Is this idea foreign to you?  If so, please explain why patients need no help lying down on a couch before there therapist and even need to be shewed away when the hour is up.  <br><br>A body in motion stays in motion?  How about a body in motion is happy.  Movement is happiness.  Not just physical movement however, mental movement. Thinking upon sports all day is stagnation.

Is it normal for me not to feel awkward when others easily do. Could that mean that I am very comfortable and condfident while others are in discomfort and insecure? and did their discomfort and insecurity came from my comfortable and confident vibe? I never understood why people keep feeling awkward because I can understand why people feel that way but not why they keep feeling that. Why should we laugh at someone who axcidentally farts while exersiing or why is it awkward when one gives a handshake and the other a fist bumb. To me it&#39;s al pretty normal because we are species of nature, animals don&#39;t feel awkward when they fart in front of each other, but we do. And I think it&#39;s because or society says it should be awkward or not normal. Ofcourse a human being should have proper manners in front of people hat&#39;s the way we live but accidents happen sometimes and they shouldnt be awkward. A person should not be punished by others because of a small accident. There is a different between normal human feelings and emotions and the ones that are created by our society.

First you said that when someone takes too long in line in front of you, you reduce their entire existence to that one negative feeling of them. As an extra in your life, nothing about their life matters accept how they affect and interact with you. Therefore if they act &quot;awkward&quot;, all you know or care about them is that they are awkward and you forever hold a negative opinion of them. So a first impression is definitely a lasting impression. <br><br>Then you go on to say that people actually don&#39;t worry or care about how strangers behave. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that awkward interaction, they have already stopped thinking about it.&quot; So a first impression isn&#39;t a lasting impression anymore?<br><br>So which is it? Is a first impression a lasting impression or isn&#39;t it?<br><br>Also,  if there is no reason to care what people think about us, why has evolution given us such strong feelings to worry about this? <br><br>I firmly believe social interactions are extremely important. We need each other for survival just as much now as we did 10,000 years ago. In fact as a species we are probably far less capable of surviving on our own then ever. We need money to survive, and to get money we need to work well in groups. And to do that we must make good impressions and minimize awkward interactions.

I play this MMO called EVE Online. It has one thing that makes it to be that game. The one thing that makes EVE. You can always shoot anything in the world. There is no &quot;Safe zones&quot;. You can shoot anyone in the starting areas of the map. Now the game has a police that will kill you on some of the areas before you can kill anyone else, but this is not the case everywhere. There are so called NullSec Zones which are basically pirate areas. There is no police. There is something called LowSec that has no police either but it is monitored, so you lose status with the police and get shot easier in a place where there is police, if you go crazy there. In NullSec, there is none of that. If it happened in NullSec, it didn&#39;t happen. Now we get to the part that relates to the video. &quot;They are more worried about you thinking THEY are awkward, than thinking that YOU are awkward&quot;.<br>One advice that is given for all people who head to NullSec first time, (as it is rather scary place at first glance) is as follows:<br>&quot;If you see someone in NullSec, remember that they are shitting in their pants at least as much as you are&quot;.

And everyone I&#39;ve ever met knows I like foxes because in some way or another it gets brought up (whether by myself or not, but most often just how I dress).<br><br>Despite that I somehow am able to walk into a room and come out with as many friends as I want (and generally they&#39;re perfectly good friends as the type of people I&#39;d rather not associate myself with don&#39;t talk to me).  Often more than I want, as I usually want 0 friends in any new situation (as I have enough friends already and all my friends are good friends).  So generally I sit down, avoid eye contact and avoid talking to anyone, and then people eventually just decide to talk to me.  So I talk about various things and generally talk as if I&#39;ve known them forever.  I have a hard time starting conversation myself however, so I don&#39;t often do so.<br><br>The only problem with making so many friends is I don&#39;t want to upset anyone or make people feel ignored or as if I dislike them.  So if I haven&#39;t spoken to them for a long time I feel as if they&#39;re unhappy with me.  I&#39;m not sure as to if that&#39;s the case or not however (generally it doesn&#39;t seem to be the case), but my general standing on it is if they want to talk they should engage conversation with me as I love to talk, but I&#39;m no good at initiating conversation and often haven&#39;t much to say unless asked about various subjects of interest (such as AI, quantum physics, computers, etc (even then though I often won&#39;t have much to say unless asked more specific questions)).<br><br>Back in elementary school (a million years ago :v) whenever I made a new friend the first thing I&#39;d ask them is what their favourite animal was.

As the train enters the tunnel, you manage to close both sides of the tunnel by the doors. The train begins to slow down therefore expanding. What would happen?&quot; My question is would the tunnel doors be smashed open? And if so where would the energy come from? Anyone with any possible and rational answers please reply to my comment.

I like most of it, but at a certain moment we start to disagree :) The shame story ala Elias made good, but I think it&#39;s too easy to throw this on a evolutionairy perspective. I&#39;d say the cuts on the cartboard cutout with justice and public approvement should have been waaaaay bigger. We live in a hugely repressive, socially controlled enviroment. We have evolved quick maybe, i wouldnt know, but i&#39;d like to suggest instead of blaming our neurotoxins, to speak unto society itself. Like, for example the social aspects of school systems. Via education there is a possibility to introduce people to each other when young, make them have strong positive feeling in social bonding, and built trust. In this modern enviroment, i can see why it is hard to build trust. But i still have it. How much is it possible to turn a negative bias into a positive one (thus, making the negative ones more profound, and maybe we&#39;ll actually learn something from them? (like not repressing yourself again))<br><br>Another thing. If in your twenties, you worry about what others think of you, you are a protagonist, but the others still form your frame of reference. So it would be incorrect to think at 60 others never thought of you. They were also thinking of you, thinking about themselves. It seems to me these people became bitter about their own bias, and only closed theirselves off of a true connection to other humans.<br><br>This means im not to happy with the conclusion and the &#39;sonder&#39; part. It&#39;s a sad word, with a negative connotation. All this while the realisation of others, though here maybe via awkwardness, can be such an happy affair. We have a certain uniqueness, but we all have a certain uniqueness. We should celebrate variety help each other out a little bit.

It seems that when your allergies act up or when you have a head cold that your body produces double the amount of mucus than normal. Speaking of, whenever you have one of those problems, why does the body produce more mucus than normal? Finally, what specifically causes the body to do this? Is it because the body is expelling things such as animal dander, pollen, etc and uses more mucus to push it out or...?<br><br>Just thought that I&#39;d submit that on our behalf and hope that we get an answer!

This video innately struck me more than any of your previous ones, not least due to the fact that it applies more to everyday personal situations. I love the dictionary of obscure sorrows, but till this video (and apart from their tumblr and channel), I had yet to see widespread use. None of my friends, relatives or the people I meet have ever heard of these, so it is great that main stream media is picking up on them. The author maintains that although the words do not exist in any oxford or Macquarie dictionaries, it doesn&#39;t make them any less real.

Just by looking in the mirror and getting a tougher look down along with a few other appearance changes I noticed people started leaving me alone and even showing some fear towards me. Yes I stared standing up for myself, but I was having to do so everywhere I went it seemed. This also unfortunately caused people whom normally felt comfortable around me to be put off.<br><br>Years later when I got glasses I noticed some people would keep looking at me in public vs turning away when I saw them looking at me. After I got lazik I noticed people started looking away again. Yes the glasses made me look more nerdy and therefore less intimidating. Pretty sad that some people are driven by fear and will only show someone respect if they fear them, but it&#39;s how the world works especially in tougher areas. If you think about it people that do fear repercussions by being disrespectful, are probably only feeling that way because someone put them in their place at one point.<br><br>So point being no one ever looked into my head.

Maybe I was born with it, and this is just one of many things in my life (like e.g. my hyper strong empathy in general) where I always thought EVERYONE thinks like that. A few years ago I learned that it&#39;s kind of rare to think and feel like that, and that there is also a name for persons &quot;like me&quot; (of course, everyone is different). It&#39;s called HIGH SENSITIVE (see Elaine Aron). So thank you VSauce for this great video, and for everyone, who feels like me - search for &quot;high sensivity&quot; - it might change your life for good (literally).", "comment_date": "2015-03-21T18:40:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Tian", "comment_text": "Why does it say published in May 20 2015 in the description<br>N", "comment_date": "2015-03-21T18:38:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Chobanov", "comment_text": "This comment is a part of the story about Michael.", "comment_date": "2015-03-21T18:38:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Siamand Omar", "comment_text": "I believe that the increasing interconnectedness of our society is making us more aware of the fact that we aren&#39;t the center of the universe.

So as i wait one person gets behind me then about 30 secs later another and hes still putting hes bananas away. At that point i really wanted to say something, maybe &quot;hey I&#39;m in a hurry your bananas are going to be there later&quot; I thought in my mind that would be rude. But finally i get attended by him, at the end of the day i just realized hes just a guy that doesnt want to be there and is a robot doing what he was hired to do. I say that because he didn&#39;t say hello, or even greet in any minor way and just got my items, scanned them and said 5.70.

I am an insecure person, and my social skills are horrible, so from my perspective I&#39;m always awkward when being with other people.

I&#39;m not someone who really desires beyond average social interaction. I won&#39;t go to parties due to an innate desire to socialize with people there. In fact, I may just not go because I really don&#39;t feel like it. Of course I do need social interaction. Every human being needs at least a minimum amount of it. We&#39;d go crazy otherwise.<br><br><br>I just don&#39;t take any pleasure in going above the minimum, going out of my way to search for more than the average amount of social interaction. In fact, too much of it tires me.<br><br><br>Then again, I&#39;m also awkward, and that can be a factor. I&#39;ve often thought about it, though. Every time I do something awkward in a conversation: make a slip, a verbal error, maybe a strange movement with my body that ends up looking stupid, it haunts me. And it&#39;s not like I never think about it may be too unimportant for others to even remember for longer than a minute.<br><br><br>I often rationalize it away with the logic of &quot;They are more than likely too occupied with their own lives, with their interests, their priorities, to care about my little mishap. Even if they&#39;re a person who is obsessively focused on moments where people slip up and deliberately does try to remember, it won&#39;t take much longer than a few minutes before someone else&#39;s slip-up replaces mine.&quot;<br><br><br>This is 90% the time the way I try to wave it away, but there&#39;s always this uncertainty in my mind. It&#39;s kind of like my fear of heights. I mean, of course the Eiffel Tower has stood there for such a long time and is not likely to collapse for a long, long time. But a tiny &quot;But what if it is. What if this happens to just be the exact moment it does collapse and I&#39;m on it.&quot; is enough to make me freak out. That tiny, tiny sliver of uncertainty is enough to bring me down, and the same goes for social slips.<br><br><br>It&#39;s funny, though. This video has touched on so many things I&#39;ve thought about. One could call it coincidence, but that would probably just be part of the protagonist disease, which I&#39;ll fully admit to.<br><br><br>After all, it has happened a lot that situations like those that you discussed in this very video felt unique, created by chance. The abstract feelings and realizations, the exact type of slip-ups. If I wasn&#39;t consciously thinking about it, I might think that it&#39;s all coincidental and surprising that you would mention them in this video.<br><br><br>Like the realization that you are thinking of human beings like they are background characters, whereas you are a fully realized person. The misguided idea that the other person (or multiple people) in the awkward exchange would be remembering that exchange for a long time, and that would make it embarrassing.\u00a0<br><br><br>But no, they&#39;re defined phenomenons now, even to the point that discussing their existence is imperative to the entire subject of awkwardness. As I mentioned: just testament to this protagonist disease.<br><br><br>Arrogant as it sounds, I always thought of some of these things as inherent flaws unique to me, or situations that were created by conditions that might not or would not be recreated. Abstract feelings and realizations I came to on my own, and that others would not ever come to.<br><br><br>In a way, it&#39;s arrogant and self-centered, in another, it&#39;s self-depreciating.\u00a0<br><br><br>I have often corrected myself. I&#39;ve made the mistake of treating people like background characters, but then I would consciously try to correct myself. In fact, after that one time I realized my error, I started doing it all the time. Not to the point that I do it automatically.<br><br><br>If I don&#39;t consciously keep realizing my error, I&#39;m likely to return to that line of thinking, seeing everyone as a background character. In fact, that&#39;s the nature. That&#39;s the norm. The correction is self-imposed, and takes conscious decision, time and time again.<br><br><br>Quite intriguing and sobering.", "comment_date": "2015-03-21T09:45:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack is pure evil", "comment_text": "I am just an awkward person in general ", "comment_date": "2015-03-21T09:41:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kustoadeeyun", "comment_text": "And as always...

People gossip about each other all the time; for some people it&#39;s their main form of social interaction. Also, I&#39;m kind of a judgemental person in some ways, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m unusual in that respect. I will notice and make mental notes about the deficiencies I perceive in others, and I expect others will do the same about me. I&#39;m not a <b>nasty</b> person, I&#39;m not cruel or insulting, I don&#39;t think someone&#39;s deficiencies should override their positive attributes (believe me, as a largely deficient person myself I&#39;m actually pretty forgiving) but like I say, I am judgemental to some small extent, and I suspect most of us would say the same if we&#39;re being honest.<br><br>I think the other thing that makes us feel more awkward and concerned about perceptions of others is the very fact that on some level we recognise the extremely limited perspectives that other people have of us. This is probably partially why people that know each other well are less likely to feel awkward around each other; if we embarrass ourselves in front of a loved one, we are reassured by the fact that that person has a full and sophisticated understanding of us, and knows that despite that stupid thing we just did we&#39;re actually not a complete moron (hopefully).

I open my mouth, try to say the first sentence, and then someone cuts me off because despite what i thought i had never actually said a word. When i do get everybodies attention to say something i cannot stop using words like &quot;i think, probably, maybe&quot; because i do not have the guts to truly believe what im saying, even when they are facts. The longer i speak, the longer i feel like someone will point out that im lying or something, even though i am not lying; for instance i was born in halloween, however whenever i say this to a person, i legitimately doubt they will believe me and instead think i am lying to sound cool.<br><br>\u00a0Never speaking up about anything causes me to have very low self esteem, even though im aware of this, i fear it still affects my daily life in a way that worries me about my future.<br><br>\u00a0I never knew why i had a stomach ache whenever i had to sit through a scene a character was lying to another. I seem to have all the sympthoms described, except for the protagonist disorder, i instead feel like everyone around me have legitimate reasons to make mistakes while i don&#39;t.<br><br>\u00a0Sorry to whine so much...
