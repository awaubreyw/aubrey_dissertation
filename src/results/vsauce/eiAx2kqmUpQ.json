This includes differences in arrival time and loudness at your ears, as well as frequency-dependent filtering from your outer ears (pinnae) and head/torso which are slightly different from the front and back. If you listen to binaural content using someone else\u2019s HRTF, you would not be as good at telling front sources from back sources.<br><br>Head movements help differentiate between front and back sources. If a source is at 45 degrees to your front-right or 45 degrees to your rear-right, it will generate roughly the same time and loudness differences at both ears, so it\u2019s hard to tell the difference based on these cues. But if you move your head 5 degrees to the left, your right ear gets closer to a front source but farther from a rear source. Your auditory system can parse this difference, and in fact if your head is not allowed to move, you will be much worse at telling front from back sources.<br><br>The visual system trains the auditory system, so if you see the source you are much more likely to think it\u2019s coming from in front of you, even if it\u2019s actually behind you. If we play a recording of a bird behind you and you see a bird in front of you, you\u2019ll likely have a front-back reversal. For this reason it\u2019s more common to mis-localize frontal sources in the rear (because anything you can\u2019t see is assumed to be behind you) rather than the converse.<br><br>We\u2019re not perfect at front-back discrimination, even using all these cues. People have reversals all the time even under ideal acoustic conditions.", "comment_date": "2021-04-21T04:46:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thales games", "comment_text": "Ok youtube, thx for recommending this to me after 8 years.", "comment_date": "2021-04-21T01:45:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaspar Casaburi", "comment_text": "So, anosmia is not so rare now i guess", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T19:43:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sanyo goo", "comment_text": "I&#39;m never questioned about vsauce video&#39;s answer because actually its already there.", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T16:41:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan \u010cern\u00fd", "comment_text": "For coke and for air", "comment_date": "2021-04-20T13:55:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "No1Guy", "comment_text": "One for each lung....problem solved.", "comment_date": "2021-04-19T03:28:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Stavros Onassis", "comment_text": "And the thumbs down are ass...

The smell of the dust was heavy with the scent of cedar trees. It was terrifing. My parents were running around shutting windows, worried that we would suffocate. One day, 3 or 4 years later, I came home from school. Unbeknownst to me, a cedar tree in our yard was being chopped down in segments. We had about 30 stairs from the driveway to our front door. About 2/3 of the way up, I panicked and crouched down in absolute terror for no discernable reason. My sister saw me and helped me into the house. It took me a bit to connect the dots, but I eventually realized that the smell of the cedar dust had triggered a panic attack, due to my memory of the earthquake. It was at that point that I realized just how innately and intensely smell is tied to memory.", "comment_date": "2019-01-14T10:33:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Cranston", "comment_text": "Olfactory actually come from the Latin word olfacio, to smell", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T22:37:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lexo0o0", "comment_text": "Dont click read more<br><br><br><br><br>Great, now you&#39;ll have to breath manually", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T18:27:01Z", "likes_count": 21}, {"comment_by": "SNERT", "comment_text": "So we can smell in 3D smh", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T17:33:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chizypuff", "comment_text": "Michel, vause here<br>thing<br>or no?", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T08:10:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julia Jergentz", "comment_text": "Both of my nostrils are pierced, so sometimes when I\u2019m removing, or like swapping out the jewelry, I\u2019ll smell that gross cheesy smell that piercings sometimes have.

Well it would look odd to us know, seeing as nearly everybody on the planet has 2. But if we, as humankind, always had one, and animals that have nostrils would have one as well. Then no one would every know. It would look normal. I wonder if it would be one small one in the middle or a big one. Also, I feel like having that second nostril that doesn&#39;t breathe as well traps the smell in so we can tell good or bad or smell better. I mean after all, when we smell smoke and we can&#39;t see the fire or we don&#39;t know where it comes from, or human instincts cause a fear instinct. Or when we smell something bad we want to get away from, not just because it smells bad, but our brain knows that bad smells often mean bad things for the human body. We hold our breath. If we only had one nostril then if we smelled something bad, we would not breathe through our nose. We would breathe through our mouth. Imagine if we didn&#39;t have a mouth and only had one nostril. We would hold our breath with a bad smell and now we can&#39;t breathe.

I had gone past this generator before when it was running, as they test it weekly.

Most vehicles are not diesels or at least burn diesel a LOT more cleanly than back in the late nineties.

Same goes for hearing, of course dogs have better ears but its also about the way they process the data, people who have dogs will notice that dogs can differentiate sounds of a fairly distant car much better than humans can, they instantly know if it is a family member or a stranger and thats just one example, even footsteps inaudible to humans they automatically differentiate, my dogs would just continue sleeping if a neighbor they knew came walking into our yard but they immediately wakeup and bark if a stranger came walking, they can actually process sounds very accurately while asleep.

Also there are hairs inside the nose that filter out particles to protect the lungs if it was one huge hole it would be harder to filter out. A third reason could be stability. If it were one big hole the bottom part of the nose where there&#39;s no bone would be unstable. The fourth reason could be it looked a lot better, evolution is all about passing on DNA and I don&#39;t think humans with one huge nostril would find a mate.

It wasn&#39;t until one day me and my dad set a trap to\u00a0catch a\u00a0 raccoon did they finnaly believe me. To my fortune, We had accidently caught a skunk. My dad had wanted to KILL the skunk with a 22. riflle, But\u00a0 me being against killing for no reason Begged him not too. So, he allowed me to keep thte skunk alive and release him from this trap if I were to put a tarp over him, and release the mechanism to let him out. I agreed, And took\u00a0 the tarp over to the cage to let him out. As I was spreading out the tarp to let him out, He sprayed my arm with skunk juice (which was light green/yellowish) And my dad gagged up his lungs practicly. I, however had no\u00a0 reaction to this, because of my no-sense of smell.
