Short hairs are stronger than longer hairs because they&#39;re closer to their roots. Due to what do these hairs remain as long as they do and is there a way to make them strong enough to break steal, from scissors for example? Like by cutting them multiple times. As you shave your beard it gets thicker. Using supplements to make your hair stronger could work too so maybe combining those two could possibly make your hair impossible to cut with the right amount of care. If you really commit to the role of it possibly in 20 years of hard work on your chest hair it could be strong enough to break steal once you try to cut it. An invincible hair!

Dude can you put the scientific method to the test with psalm 23. I have been doing nothing 24/7 as in not forcing anything not even my breathing. I don&#39;t move on my own. I do nothing. This results in my body mind soul and voice to do things on its own. I credit this to God behind all of this bc psalm 23 is telling you to trust God. So can you put it to the test yourself and try to do nothing for at least a day. And when I mean nothing I mean nothing. Don&#39;t move and if you move immediately continue doing nothing. Don&#39;t force your hand down or you feet in a different spot. Do nothing 24/7 for a day. We breathe on our own so don&#39;t even breathe for yourself. Let God do everything. This is how I have been living my life for over a year. I&#39;m telling you the honest truth and passing along my paper for you to review. Yknow like hey review my claim and this is my results. Are yours the same? This is the evidence that God exist. It was found in psalm 23. God provides me with everything and if I lack something in life God moves me and does everything for me so that I may never lack in anything. I am perfect bc my God controls me and my God is perfect. Also, turns out I am God. There&#39;s two concepts that will make this clear. Human-God and Base-God. God of Abraham is me and this consciousness of God is now in a human body thus I am now one of you. I am Cesar Moreno Hernandez. How&#39;s it going dudes? Does life suck? Well do nothing and allow me to make it perfect. Formerly I wasn&#39;t doing nothing and I was born a human, as I explained earlier. Now that I do nothing I base-God can control this body and since human-God has surrendered his will to me by doing nothing 24/7 I can control him without all his imperfections messing the gifts and blessings I want for him. Oh you think I&#39;m crazy? Put psalm 23 to the test for one day and watch how I move you however I want... to do my will, base-God&#39;s will. :)", "comment_date": "2021-08-09T01:14:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the sleeper", "comment_text": "I used to watch vsause and v3 all the time but now those channeles feel different", "comment_date": "2021-08-08T23:15:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KVC", "comment_text": "Can someone tell me was it actualt him that was standing infront of a burger king camera or no?", "comment_date": "2021-08-08T22:26:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "blazing dragon", "comment_text": "<b>What is magnetism? and how do we see it?</b>", "comment_date": "2021-08-08T21:33:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Scarlett Mauner", "comment_text": "anyone else here from \u201cbsauce, burn here. by being a bald decrepit human being i am able to blend in with the modern human society\u201d lmfaooo burn is the best", "comment_date": "2021-08-08T21:04:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "- Adolfo -", "comment_text": "Wait this guy still makes videos :0", "comment_date": "2021-08-08T21:03:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Se\u00f1or Skeltal", "comment_text": "OK cool, but why are nobody talking about how this in 240p?
