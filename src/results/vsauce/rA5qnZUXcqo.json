Now that is cool, but if you want to make a more complex brain you totally could make one human have two flags, lets say one of them red and one blue. This way one human can look for more signals and either fly a red or a blue flag, then some neurons behind him look for red and some for blue flags. This way we can make a much more complex brain from way less people, because a man isnt just a dumb thing that either does or does not do something, a man can be a much more complicated and better neuron. It would be very interesting to see this experimend be redone with theese adjustments and maybe even more people. If an experiment like this is done, it can prove that human neurons are able to evolve to be much more complex without increasing their number.

There was no 8 in the image, so none should have fired in the final row ! I think the reason it fired an eight is that it didn&#39;t see wether each pixel was part of a vertical line or a horizontal line. Michael drew horizontal line on most pixel, then the V2 layer saw vertical lines in it.<br>I believe with much more neurons it could be made possible to get it right. Each of the 16 pixel is divided into 9 smaller pixels, so you get 144 people on the first layer. With the same drawing he drew before, there would be gaps between the 4 horizontal lines, so no vertical line could be seen out of it. Then next step is for the brain to understand what is it, since it knows it isn&#39;t a number. So you&#39;d need even more layers, able to process more shapes.", "comment_date": "2019-10-17T21:08:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HagenYHD", "comment_text": "yes, you can count, you even counted numers for 3 hours", "comment_date": "2019-10-17T19:14:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "skajammer", "comment_text": "those darn &quot;sportos&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-10-17T18:45:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Altrue", "comment_text": "Such a captivating episode!

If it doesn&#39;t work, the children are exactly as they were, but they aren&#39;t doped up on tons of medication that has real side effects in order to attempt repairing the issue.

I think there is something to be recognized from this experiment. Our brains reduce the reality to something that we already knew. In the final step when Michael draws some random shape.. the brain fires as 8.. which means looking at bird&#39;s eye view of this.. our brain&#39;s capabilities to deduct this unknown reality is limited to it&#39;s finite mental prowess. What if this reality is much different and  our brains categorizes into what it only knows.. aren&#39;t we missing out on the actuality of this reality?", "comment_date": "2018-12-26T06:49:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t know about the choice of music when Micheal and that guy we&#39;re talking chief.", "comment_date": "2018-12-26T05:36:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reda Alnoueimi", "comment_text": "Love these episodes \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2018-12-26T01:04:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan Cerny", "comment_text": "Lucky for Michael he didn&#39;t grow up in Manhattan.", "comment_date": "2018-12-25T17:15:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Austin Harrison", "comment_text": "well, gimmie those jelly beans.", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T23:54:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Pardigon", "comment_text": "&quot;Get procreating please&quot; <b>sister walks in looking extra thicc</b> ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T22:22:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Owen Hansen", "comment_text": "Dope", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T19:12:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roman Cain", "comment_text": "No 254 code...
