The ISS and Skylab both used and use solar arrays as shades, and parasol shields. <br>Going out doors in sunny weather should be done with proper precautions, put on a hat, slap on some screen and don&#39;t forget the sunglasses. Your shades have some numbers on them which tells you the level of protection they offer. UV light is harmful as the wavelength, in nano meters, decreases, and frequency,   Hertz, increases. <br>The higher you go the less atmopshere protects you. As you climb out of low earth orbit the radiation from the solar wind trapped in the magnetosphere increases in strength for about 1000 miles above the surface of the planet before begining to diminish. <br>Scientists attempted to dispel this belt of radiation by blasting the stratosphere with 2053 nuclear bombs in the first two years of the 1960s.  <br>The idea was to neutralise the B or magetic field intensity through the nuclear Electro Magnetic Pulse. <br>This was based on a poor understanding of the physics and was more experimental than anything. It did not work and actually backfired, creating more radiation and a new low orbit belt which destroyed all the satalites then in orbit, after 5 years exposure.  <br>So man has never been able to travel beyond the karman line, beyond the atmosphere.  <br>It sad to see you still spreading the fake news about Apollo missions. <br>Those missions were really initiated in the Mettlewwerk installation of the third Riech.

(with the intonation at the &quot;A&quot; letter at the end). Why is that so?<br>Well, the word Thea comes from the Greek word \u0398\u03b5\u03b1 (Th=\u0398, e=\u03b5, a=\u03b1 \u0398 \u03b5 \u03ac) which means Goddess!

The intonation of the word Thea in this video is totally wrong.<br><br>that happens every time you pronounce a Greek word in English.
