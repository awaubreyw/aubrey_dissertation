Michael! A few years ago, I wrote a novel about the last few living humans, slowly dying on Mars.

The point wasn&#39;t that someone was listening, but that this was the closest they could get to forever--a grave marker in a churchyard nobody will ever visit.

Unfortunately, that does not speak well of humanity, at least yet. We are still writing our own story and we cannot change the past, but we can show our capacity for reform and change the narrative. <br><br>I also want to acknowledge that though the experiment run with Steve Vance from JPL and the experts in various fields was interesting and is probably about the best means of experiment we could realistically run at this time, I am not convinced that people or other beings encountering a message that is randomized would not attempt to read some meaning into it OR that a message that humans send to space would not be misinterpreted or have meanings added to it if another group of beings were to run across it. <br><br>I don\u2019t know that this is not dangerous but given that we have already sent out messages for a reasonable amount of time and given the scale of the universe and how relatively short of a distance those messages have gone as compared to the size of the observable universe, unless we horribly misunderstand the limitations of transportation speed through space (this is not impossible), it would still take any other being living near another star in inordinately long amount of time to travel here given that they are able to reach the greatest known speed possible to travel through space. <br><br>This episode raised a ton of questions about what it means to be human and alive on this planet, in our tiny corner of the universe.

It&#39;s like Jason said, &quot;even symmetry would have been a big thing for me.&quot; Human brains are optimized for pattern recognition. Put another way, they&#39;re optimized to seek patterns. It is called Pareidolia.\u00a0 It is when we humans impose a meaning in random information. Such as seeing the  shape of an animal in a cloud. Although the cloud&#39;s shape is completely random, the fact that the cloud&#39;s shape roughly matches the shape of an animal the database in our brain has seen before, is why meaning is assigned (ie. it resembles something we know). I think the experiment needs to be redone to draw any kind of real world conclusions. In the second experiment, random symmetries should be included in the message. Or even geometric block shapes randomly distributed in the message.

Ignoring the obvious I&#39;ll point out your walkie talkies don&#39;t even work further than three blocks apart. Your local television station stops making it to your TV within a few hundred miles broadcasted on the air waves. Some radio frequencies can bounce off the ionosphere and you can catch a signal just beyond the horizon. But your ham radio isn&#39;t sending Star trek re-runs to epsilon Perseii 8 and the aliens that live there. It&#39;s takes the largest few radio telescopes/transmitters available on Earth to successfully continue communicating with the Voyagers.your football field size array might not cut it. And they aren&#39;t even 1 light year away. They&#39;re still light hours away. A space faring civilization 65 million LY away would see dinosaurs if they look at earth right now. Even if they could pick up the i love Lucy reruns they wouldn&#39;t receive them for another 65 million years. 1 million LY away look at earth right now you might find some common chimp ancestor or some other hominids. 150 LY away and they&#39;d have no idea we developed electricity or airplanes or cars or radios. That&#39;s no excuse to be flashing your high beams at them right now though. Might have gone unnoticed before but not when you shine a laser beam in their eyeballs.

And if they have the power to come here and destroy us (or do it from their home via a giant Stellaser or a Nicol-Dyson laser) they wouldn&#39;t need us to send out messages to find us (so, we really don&#39;t have to refrain from doing it - it&#39;s already too late). They&#39;d already know that we exist and wouldn&#39;t be planet bound, specifically because they would be so much more powerful than we are today, and would primarily live in space (a thing we don&#39;t do yet). Also: We can not mask the waste heat of our technological activity. They can&#39;t do that either (that&#39;s a thermodynamics thing and has basically to do with the fact, that you only can reuse or repurpose a given amount of waste heat so much and then have to emit it away from you, or the system you exist in would overheat and destroy itself) and this problem gets worse the more technology you have; which means: The bigger you are, the better you are being seen from afar. If they exist, we should see them. Easily too. So, looking for them should reveal them very quickly and we&#39;d have a very hard time, and honestly would have to be very ignorant and dense not to see them. We have looked, but as it seems: There is no other technology producing (spacefaring) civilization currently existing in our galaxy besides of us. At least none that we can see right now. And if civilizations emerge frequently, at least one should be within our detection range... but, no, there is nobody there. The galaxy, as it seems right now, is ours for the taking - nobody there to contest our claim on this same galaxy (being alone is a good thing in this scenario then). The same seems to be true for the rest of our supercluster (47 thousand galaxies are inside this cluster), every single one of them lacks the infrared signature of waste heat a spacefaring civilization would inevitably emit. Nobody there either. This is suspicious. My guess is: Since the universe is incredibly young, we are simply among the very first technological civilizations that ever emerged in the universe. Others exist, but they are rare and far between - too far away to see them, and we&#39;re too early on at the cosmic stage, that others simply haven&#39;t had enough time to have already emerged in great numbers within our detection range (the story will be very different in, say, 10 trillion years; I&#39;d expect the cosmos - which got very dark by then, which would make it easier to see those others - to be brimming with spacefaring civilizations, some of them possibly even descendants from Earth).

Even if they were forced to leave their own planet, it would just be highly unlikely statistically for them to choose our planet for colonisation out of the billions and billions of planets available. No, i think it&#39;s not that unlikely that they could have a genuine interest in establishing some form of communication with us. We are an interesting species after all: We send satellites into stabile orbits, that circulate the earth at unfathomable speeds and provide us with amazing technologies, like GPS or the internet, that are available to almost all members of our species as well. We are able to manipulate machines and even viruses on a nanometer level. We cure diseases and create vaccines.

In those past events nobody was able to observe those technologically inferior people, so nobody among the more advanced people was able to know about them, discuss about what to do, and express opinions about that. The explorers who discovered those less advanced civilizations were mostly looking for more land to conquer, and they simply went on their route trying to find something valuable.<br>Now our entire species is unable to behave like that any more, just because we already know every landmass on our planet. We also know, at least within a certain resolution, the extension of the entire observable universe, and we&#39;re able to make at least some predictions of what could be out there in detail, compared to what we can directly observe. A species more advanced than ours would probably have a much more precise and detailed observation capability than ours, so they would have plenty of instruments and time to observe us from a distance, and then decide what to do with us. For such an advanced species Earth wouldn&#39;t be so valuable, as their technology would mostly certainly be capable of allow them to use resources from everywhere else. Our planet has much less resources, water included, than most of the other dead bodies in our solar system. A living planet like ours is valuable only to a species which is still unable to live outside of life suistaining planet. A spacefaring civilization wouldn&#39;t need that.<br>We&#39;re used to think of aliens sometimes as a conqueror species looking for more planets to colonize, but our point of view is comparable to a hunter-gatherer prehistoric human which can&#39;t live without natural growing plants and fruits, as he doesn&#39;t know about agriculture yet. For us is normal, and we don&#39;t need to migrate periodically to find more resources to live. An advanced spacefaring civilization wouldn&#39;t need a life sustaining planet to survive.<br>So, the only thing remaining to say is: why should a civilization like that reply to us? That depends on how they reason. What&#39;s their motivation to explore space? Do they have a free society, or are they some kind of &quot;their-species supremacists&quot;? Would they have any kind of moral ethic to make them think before interfering with our evolution?<br>We don&#39;t know. But I think it&#39;s very probable that a supremacist species wouldn&#39;t even think about us, and they wouldn&#39;t be interested in our planet just because it&#39;s too less valuable for them. So it could be very unlikely that any danger could come to us if they knew about our presence. In the worst case, maybe we would just see them pass, do their job ignoring us, leaving us with a very sad opinion of advanced lifeforms, maybe regretting the time when we were asking ourselves &quot;are we alone?&quot;. We&#39;ll see. Soon, let&#39;s hope. In the meantime, we should focus doing our best to improve our society the best we can, taking for granted that we&#39;re on our own.", "comment_date": "2020-02-26T19:39:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paka Lolo", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not Enstien.

The physicist at the end of this video states that photons stay around forever, but I remember a Feynman diagram where if two photons collide they would create a gamma ray or more. I would suppose that there would have to be enough energy on behalf of one or both photons would have to have enough energy to be able to create such gamma rays. Yes gamma rays are photons in and of themselves but energy is really the key here to understanding how photons can take on new meanings if they are to collide. So let&#39;s just say there is a gravitational disturbance that sends off high frequency photons that collide with our radio wave photons. While the probability of one piece of our message getting hit by other photons is small over short distances, the longer the radio waves travel, the higher the probability of collision -- thus distorting our message. What if radio waves aren&#39;t the answer? I hypothesize that in order to send a message across the Galaxy, we would need to use neutrinos rather than photons. The reason being is that neutrinos rarely interact with anything. You might think that photons are small enough to not interact with other things, but the simple fact that our eyes and our transceivers can detect them is proof that photons can be captured and they can also be blocked because of things like mountains or even mere walls. Nevertheless--no matter the means of transcription--the longer the distance, the harder it is to decipher the message from noise.", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T05:37:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Futureboy Wavo", "comment_text": "I think if an advanced civilization were to notice us, they would not want to eradicate us.", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T04:46:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Futureboy Wavo", "comment_text": "why did y\u2019all have to make it nothing?", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T04:42:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Futureboy Wavo", "comment_text": "WEVE DIDCOVERED RADIO WAVES IN A PATTERN IN SPACE!!", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T04:26:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iiShotzFiredx", "comment_text": "Thank you VSauce!

You want us to control the receiver&#39;s understanding of the sender. You CANNOT use communication for communication&#39;s sake. You can&#39;t expect the receiver to answer. No advanced alien civilization would DARE to get in touch with us, if we don&#39;t control the context of our initial messages. As you don&#39;t engage a random wolf in the forest, an alien civilization has to decipher the intention behind the messaging. If we don&#39;t set down some rules, even the lack of context will be telling for another civilization. A message without self-awareness is a telling sign about the sender&#39;s current level. A message which just wants to establish contact, tells volumes about the sender&#39;s (then) current situation in their world.<br><br><br>If you wish to travel to Ghana, prior to your departure, would you establish everything you know about that country, based on one discussion you had with one random Ghanese person on Facebook? <br><br>Imagine yourself in the place of another advanced civilization. You know you will have to do your own research. You understand only yourself. You want to be careful. Even if the incoming message states paceful intentions, you cannot know who wrote it.  Is the message a representative thing? Does it paint a picture of the society which sent it? Sure, you know some basic informations, but anybody on the sender&#39;s side can send these mathematical and visual guides. But who knows if the writer can be trusted? What if the messager made some errors? How would we know that they made some errors, when they tried to depict themselves? Does it represent its whole civilization, or just the messenger?<br>What errors, you ask? As we, humans are looking for human faces on mountains, on clouds, on our toasts, an alien might be looking for other kind of very specific things. If it is missing from our message, it can be percieved as an error.<br><br><br><br>Ask yourself, how should humanity approach a discovered alien civilisation! With care. We cannot establish contact, we have to observe first. Observation is key. An alien if it is observing us, might come to the conclusion, that they cannot conclude basic facts about us. Just imagine what has happened in 100 years on Earth. Who decides what represents our civilization? The few scientists, who couldn&#39;t initiate such scientific endeavours on their own? The politicans who give the green-lights for such missions? The dictators? The people who don&#39;t even care and they need wholesome Youtube celebrities to explain basic scientific facts to them? And what about those wars? Why are they killing each other? Do they welcome it? Do they know what does it mean to be human? <br><br>Some selected few want to get in touch with the whole universe, but they have no authority to define their own species. So they are just sending basic messages about their physiology and some selected fragments of something which could be deciphered as culture. But culture is not a static thing. Even if an alien can percieve culture, it doesn&#39;t give information about humanity. Don&#39;t get me wrong. Lot of informations we are sending out are interesting for other civilizations. <br><br><br><br>But we haven&#39;t yet sent a single important one. Humanity must find the questions first. Then they have to answer them. Then they have to put the answers on some constant things, radio waves, or monoliths in our Solar System (yet we have to assert our dominance here). And then, we have to send invitational messages for everybody to read those &quot;license plates&quot;, monoliths. Don&#39;t come to us first.

Which is &quot;carved in stone&quot;.<br>Humanity has to commit itself to a narrative. A depiction, which is us. During thousands of years we have never looked into the mirror. We have to start adjusting ourselves, so others can understand as well. Because if we don&#39;t understand ourselves, if we dont&#39;t show a clear profile, an alien civilisation won&#39;t get in touch with us. With this listening and messaging we are just hoping that out there is another &quot;human race&quot;, which doesn&#39;t define itself, but welcomes every fragment of information. We are still looking at clouds, and searching for familiar faces. We are not listening currently.

Those photons, though immortal, they do get converted into heat, by hitting a rock, or dust, or a planet or something, then scatter all over. Sure, try to decode a signal with half of it gone due to cosmic dust.<br>Lastly, I think we should find faster ways of communication, and transportation first, then try to communicate.<br>The way it is now, Steven Hawkins fear will never happen. When the hostile aliens see our message, and choose to attack for some reason, they will be late for a million years, or something due to light lag, and travel times. Who knows what might have happened by then? A ww3? A rogue asteroid? Or the human species colonizing the stars already. <br>So that is not my fear. My fear is that we will never meet aliens, because it&#39;s impossible to reach them due to how big the void between stars is, and how far apart they are to each other, not even mentioning the void between galaxies, that&#39;s just insane! Maybe we can talk to them, maybe.

Two other books on psychic abilitys hit the shelf and were selling fine.    The BIG difference between his book and theirs was his touched on psychic abilities AND U.F.O.s.    he goes on the explain how through tests by either the military or the C.I.A. (i forget which) but it was proven that EVERY HUMAN BEING has the capibility of psychic abilitys.  You can be natuerally talented in the art or you can be TRAINED in the art.   That is a fact.  Jim Marrs.  Psychic studys and U.F.O.s i wouldnt waste my time now to waste your time later.   Please trust me it is deffenatly worth paying attention to if this video here interests you.

we were not even able to create life artificially here on THIS planet not even under the most sophisticated circumstances in a lab....<br><br>so why on earth would life develope some where else in space ?<br><br>you see the coming to be of our  life here on earth requires for example proteins/enzymes...<br><br>now lets look at that.<br><br>some science facts:<br>-Nature, as Urey Miller found, can produce about 23 amino acids all in D and L form<br>so 1 in 2* 23 = 1 in 46 time chance to pick the right one each time nature  has to pick an amino acid.  <br>-Living beings ONLY use the L forms of 20-22 so on average 21 amino acids<br>-in a poly peptide chain there are 2 ends to which the next amino acid can attach due to which chances reduces the chance of picking the right position to 1 on 46*2 = 1 in 92<br>-a function protein must have ALL amino acids on the right spot/position otherwise its disfunctional.<br>- a typical reaction time of coupling 2 amino acids is about 10^-9 second to 10^-3 second but lets assume its 10^-9 sec<br>- the smallest human protein/enzyme s 44 amino acids<br>-in nature there are 10.000&#39;s of different functional proteins/enzymes up to about 100.000 of them.<br>- in nature the amounts of aminoacids range from several 10&#39;s to several 10.000&#39;s of amino acids.<br>-abiogenesis assumes that random chances has been the way that nature constructed proteines.<br>-randomness has no intelligence to it it doesnt know what it is doing it is purposeless and  has no mind to it... it just happens....(lack of inteligence)<br><br>OK now some calculations:<br>Lets see how much time it would require for proteines/enzymes to form in this way<br><br>a 10 amino acids functional protein/enzyme/polypeptide<br><br>There are 21^10 options and each amino acid choice has a 1 in 92 chance of being the correct one on the correct side of the poly peptide chain.<br>So there are 21^10 * 92 options and each option requires 10^-9 sec so in order for nature to find 1 correct functional poly peptide nature requires a minimum time of:<br><br>21^10 * 92 * 10^-9 sec = 17,76 days.<br><br>This is the minimum time required to all test them out ad pick one of them we are looking for. Why minimum time ? well simple... natures randomness doesnt know what its doing: it acts random... so big chance is that natures randomness produces the same poly peptide more than once....<br><br>OK a 20 amino acids poly peptide/protein<br><br>21^20 options 1 in 92 hance to pick the correct amino acid<br>so 21^20 * 92 * 10^-9 sec = 2,56 *10^19 second = 8.11 * 10^11 years...<br><br>about now would be a good time to remind you that the secular estimated age of the universe is some 14 billion yrs (I dont agree with these assumprions but OK lets assume).<br><br>Now earth is secularly estimated to be about 4,5 billion yrs and life is supposedly emerging some 4 billion yrs ago.... <br><br>now the assumed formation of a functional poly peptide of only 20 amino acids already requires a time that is some 200 times longer than theories allow and we only just began..... 20 amino acids is not even a fnctional proteine its no more than a simple polypeptide<br><br>But OK we move on....<br><br>44 amino acids...our smallest polypeptide/protein in our own bodies. This would require a time of:<br>21^44 * 92 * 10^-9 seconds = 1,38 * 10^51 seconds = 4,4*10^43 years.....<br><br>OK lets assume that nature has found a catalyst to speed things up.... the biggest enzymatic/catalytic speeding up is about 17 orders of magnitude so a factor of 10^17 <br><br>even than the secular estimated age of the universe fails short:<br>you see even than still a time is required of <br><br>4,4*10^43/10^17 = 4,4*10^26 years<br><br>And in reality this seeding up of a chemical reaction is from several billions of years back to several micro seconds (10^-3 sec) not even close to 10^-9 sec.<br><br>OK but we know that most proteins hae more than 100 amino acids so we are not done yet<br><br>a 100 amino acid protein<br>would require: <br>21^100 * 92 * 10^-9 sec = 1,5 * 10^125 sec = 4,86 *10^117 years<br><br>a 500 amino acid:<br>21^500 * 92 * 10^-9 sec = my compter cannot even calulate that in a normal way so I must use logarithms but it turns out to be some 10^646,57 years.<br><br>OK lets crank up the reaction speed even further and lets assume that th reaction time ONLY requires a planck time to couple 2 amino acids.<br><br>the planck-time as you now is about 5,4*10^-44 seconds<br>Well even a 100 amino acid proteine/polypeptide would require still 2,62 *10^83 years.<br><br>as you know most proteines are much bigger.....<br><br>so how on earth (and in the rest of the universe) one can start to even think about aliens ?????<br><br>for lief to develope here on earth it isnt even scientifically proven t have taken place by natural random processes.<br><br>which leads to the conclusion that Life MUST have been put here by a super intelligent being who we know as God/Jesus christ....<br><br>there is no othr alternative...<br><br>which also makes sense looking at the conditions we are on earth that make it even possible to live here.....water, a sun at the right distance, plants food, our place in the galaxy and so on and so on...<br><br>this ONLY makes sense from the point of view that God created this in a unique way for us to be even able to live.....<br><br>yes Michael we are indeed alone in the universe as materialistic living beings, yes there are also other creatures we know as angels (including the fallen ones).

Our limited range of beat and depth of working memory.  It implies a significant constraint on humans and human communication capabilities.  Something so basic to us that it is easily taken for granted, yet would be crucial to any alien understanding our communication patterns.   Individual message elements span a fraction of a heartbeat to a handful of heartbeats.  Individual unaided humans cannot process continuous complex messages much longer than a YouTube video.  No human would actually wait for you to clap out one million.  Any human attempting to clap out a million would give up at a similar low number.  Some aliens may have attention span for a billion or more claps.  Some other alien species may experience  lapses of attention (blink, yawn, sleep, death, generations, evolution) between clapping out 2 and 3.  The ever presence of a human heartbeat, or any clock is not mandatory for communication, but it is used in all common human communication except static images. Yet when he sent a static image, he imposed the need for a clock to see it.  With this message format, we are signaling our basic rate and attention span. What else are we signalling?  We speak binary? We are or are not sensitive to individual cycle count?  We are sensitive to differences in audio frequency within a narrow range?  How are we sending anything about our audio(pressure) sensitivity if the message is entirely electromagnetic?  We vibrate an electromagnetic carrier frequency modulated by audio frequencies representing a 2 bit code with absent word clock that must be split into an exactly sized grid to form a visual representation.  So for an alien to understand this message, they must understand at least the concept of 2 fundamentally different human senses(sight and sound), a code which not even all humans understand, all in a medium which our own bodies are completely insensitive to.  How about a more baseband experiment.  Could we recognize the plain English audio message &quot;Hello&quot; spoken at a reasonable volume if it took 1 hour from &#39;H&#39; to &#39;o&#39;?  1 minute?  How about if it took .01 second?  I&#39;m reminded of biblical passages saying essentially &#39;one day is like a thousand years&#39;.  If taken literally, that is among the longest standing templates we have for alien life.  It makes sense to craft messages that take that into account or look for such messages.

Not only that, but it&#39;s mainly western colonialism that&#39;s been responsible for this phenomenon, and that&#39;s a cultural thing. The reason has nothing to do with the technological advancement. Two: this phenomenon when it has happened throughout history, has happened here on Earth, where resources have always been limited. When you&#39;re a superadvanced civilization that can cross the vastness of the cosmos, there isn&#39;t any resource on Earth that you can&#39;t easily get anywhere else, so there&#39;s no reason to be hostile toward its inhabitants.

Communication if impossible.<br>-But it&#39;s still worth making the effort because even if communication is impossible it would be &#39;good&#39; to know we are not alone so we need to hope &#39;everyone&#39; is at least happy to say &quot;hello&quot;.<br>It&#39;s impossible to know how society would react to proof that there&#39;s other intelligent life. What if that knowledge precipitates an existential dread that results in the breakdown of our civilisation or indeed that our attempt at communication destroys the recipient of our message?<br>-That&#39;s incredibly unlikely and besides we, and maybe others out there, are &#39;accidentally&#39; transmitting already so what does a bit more communication matter?<br>Unlikely as such a scenario might be this is a Pandora&#39;s box issue. Once out of the box the knowledge can&#39;t be put back in. Is sending a message worth the risk of destroying another civilisation?  Yes, we are already listening but is &#39;living&#39; in space is like walking through an unknown jungle; you may come across something interesting or something dangerous that&#39;s how life is. But actively looking for a Lion could be considered risky and willingly putting your head in it&#39;s mouth would be considered foolhardy by most. Attempting to put another&#39;s head in a Lion&#39;s mouth might be considered attempted murder - morally dubious and what if a society &#39;out there&#39; takes that view?<br>So far that&#39;s the potential risks of the best case scenario: One where the civilisations involved must learn to deal with the knowledge that &#39;we are not alone&#39; for good or for ill. But what if &#39;we&#39; contact &#39;someone&#39; who is far more advanced than us? Given how old the universe is if there are people &#39;out there&#39; there&#39;s a decent chance &#39;they&#39; are. That risks them coming to visit.<br>-We could learn so much from contact from a more advanced civilisation<br>True, but that isn&#39;t going to happen. Even if &#39;they&#39; arrived with entirely benevolent intent (not necessarily true) our own history has shown that more primitive groups never survive contact with more highly developed societies no-matter the intent of that developed society. Worse, if &#39;they&#39; are as advanced to us as &#39;we&#39; are to other creatures on this planet malicious or benevolent intent won&#39;t come in to it. We will die simply because we are beneath any such considerations.<br>-Now you&#39;re just anthropomorphizing!<br>Maybe but the basic principles of physics, and therefore biology apply just as well elsewhere in the universe as they do here. No matter how &#39;alien&#39; any aliens may be they will have gotten to their position on their planet the same way we did: Natural selection, or to put it another way by climbing over the corpses of billions of their forebears and current rivals for resources. In short it is entirely reasonable to assume that however different &#39;they&#39; may be &#39;they&#39; will have the same fundamental motivations a behaviors as us.<br>-Be we are intelligent, we don&#39;t obey our instincts?<br>Really? If H. Sapiens spent the last 7M years adapting to the role of hunter-gatherer and top predator, and the last 200K years getting really good at to the point where we are the dominant large life form on this planet how far do you think our fundamental wiring will have changed in the last 10K (more like 200) years? Yep, not at all. We live in an industrial world of our own making and the irony is we are supremely poorly adapted to that world - I would submit that nearly all the world&#39;s problems are the result of us behaving as our wiring dictates in a world where said wiring is no longer suitable. We have the awareness to be able to see what we are doing and maybe even what behavioral changes would be best for current circumstances but we have no ability to anything about it. Long tangent&#39;s aside &#39;intelligent aliens&#39; will have exactly the same issues and those issues won&#39;t be good for us should we meet.<br>-Ok, ok. But it would still be comforting to know we aren&#39;t alone.<br>Really? I won&#39;t go in to the whole thing but there is the concept of &#39;great filters&#39;. The upshot is that if we find life out there that spells bad news for our prospects down here, and those prospects get dramatically worse the more advanced that life is - appallingly bad if we were to find a beacon from a dead alien civilisation. We may not be able to do anything about whatever great filters there may be but sometimes ignorance is bliss.<br><br><br>Um, a very, very, long way to say looking for aliens is bad enough, actively trying to contact them is mind-mindbogglingly irresponsible. Oh, and on a personal level when we are all dying (likely by accident) at the hands of our visitors it won&#39;t be a comfort to know somebody invited them without even considering the wishes of everyone else.", "comment_date": "2019-10-24T19:02:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Repo", "comment_text": "There\u2019s limited speed information in any form or anything can travel, also universe is huge and young af.<br>There\u2019s no paradoxes of any kind", "comment_date": "2019-10-24T18:42:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eftychia Gkana", "comment_text": "Yo spacespeak is awesome", "comment_date": "2019-10-24T18:37:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "unni", "comment_text": "c", "comment_date": "2019-10-24T18:19:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Purple Om", "comment_text": "Clearly we are not alone BUT what these very bright top scientists aren&#39;t understanding is any advanced life wouldn&#39;t keep their mortal bodies.

He has incredibly specific and unlikely example, which is that maybe the aliens have already seen us and are just waiting to hear that we want to talk. If they have picked up radio signals, then they have picked up everything. Every electromagnetic form of radiation we are emitting is simply too weak to reach very far from Earth, so despite the fact that we have been emitting signals for as long as we have had radio, only aliens who are very very close will ever pick up those signals. If they are that close then they&#39;ve picked up everything and should have seen all our probes and thus figured out that we do want to talk. It sounds like bullshit to me, and I think it&#39;s a horrible justification for continuing to signal to possible ETs.<br><br><br>&quot;What if they&#39;re at the same place as us? We could exchange the recipe for fusion...&quot; I think again a bad argument. The Fermi Paradox suggests we should see a lot of life because there has been so much time for it to develop, thus is a high chance that any ET we do run into may in fact have significantly better tech than us. We aren&#39;t going extinct right now, I think humans can figure out our problems well enough on our own(hopefully) so we do not need to run the massive risk of being destroyed by a more advanced civilisation. I am incredibly curious about what&#39;s out there, but in my opinion we should only make contact with ETs if <b>we find them</b> and have the chance to look into them before making that decision.

I often think that he has been making the best use of the technological age to inform, educate, and inspire millions of people around the world to find passion in an intricate understanding of every part of the human experience. I also think that if the billions of views that have gone to what I believe to be just silly or meaningless videos had gone to Michael&#39;s videos this world would be a better place. I am for the most part a cold, bitter, and analytical individual who finds disdain in some aspects of the human experience. But, those things are ultimately a part of who &quot;WE&quot; are. Some of us find joy where most find nothing at all. We are all made up of the exact same stuff and yet We can perceive, think, talk, and act so fundamentally different from each other that we form divides between us where there were none to begin with. I believe that this ability is our greatest strength and our greatest weakness all at once. While I agree to an extent that it could be dangerous to give another civilization out there some where a detailed understanding of our weaknesses as a civilization, I believe we should. The search for truth is a defining attribute of who we are, and we should be open and truthful to all those around us.<br><br>But I am ranting and have strayed away from my original point, Michael, I believe in a single image you have sent the greatest thing ever sent to space. A true depiction of &quot;US&quot;, not the fake, seemingly unnatural images on the voyager golden discs, but a genuine human experience that I believe is our greatest value. why would another civilization cross the vast void of space, giving up in some cases entire life times, just to come talk to some awkward almost creepy nerds about math. It is only the human experience as a whole and in all it&#39;s complexity, that would ever make such a voyage worth undertaking. I only wish you could have sent the story behind the image along side it because damn it, it made me cry. I am no alien but this made we want to venture into the unknown just so I could give you a hug.

How long would it take a message from them to arrive here? We&#39;re roughly 25,000 light years from the center of the galaxy, so it&#39;d take 50,000 years for us to receive their message. If they were to send the message today we&#39;d not receive it until the year 52019 or so. That&#39;s the problem with the search for extrasolar life. And from stars outside of our galaxy? A message from Andromeda would take over 2.5 million years to reach us. Most likely the whole reason we&#39;ve not found anyone is because they&#39;re just too damn far away for current tech to find. It&#39;s almost like how Europe and Asia were doing their thing for a few thousand years before they found people living in North America. Or even knew North America existed.

Sure, you can detect light from a distant sun all the way from another galaxy, but a meaningful signal isn&#39;t <b>just</b> EM radiation -- it&#39;s an intelligible <b>pattern</b> encoded into that radiation. If quantum randomness decays the signal at unpredictable points along the data stream, the signal would gradually lose its meaningful pattern while filling in the gaps with background noise. After a certain astronomically large distance, you may still receive a signal, but &quot;decoding&quot; it would surely become a fool&#39;s errand at some point.\r So I don&#39;t think we really need to worry about what distant alien civilizations think of I Love Lucy or the Andy Griffith Show, unless of course they are already a star faring species that just happens by pure chance to be cruising fairly close to our system when they intercept it.<br><br>\r<br>If you really wanted to send a message out proactively, what you do is put a fairly large spacecraft out far enough that it can eclipse the Sun from the viewpoint of some distant observer, then do so in a regular, patterned fashion. It would be a narrow cast rather than broadcast signal, so you&#39;d have to choose your destination targets carefully. The trajectory mathematics would require fairly high levels of astronomical precision to actually work, and unlike a radio signal, the frequency would have to be very slow, not only to maximize signal lifetime but also because it takes time to maneuver a spacecraft into and out of shadowing position. Aaaand... the observer would definitely know where the signal was coming from.

One of the probable reasons for the Fermi Paradox is that they are just very far away.  Let&#39;s assume they&#39;re relatively close, like... 100 LY.  Say we receive trace signals in 2020, and right away we send out a message.  It would take 100 years for it to reach them, then another 100 years for their answer to reach us.

The later is more like beaming a laser out onto a target.  Even if TV and radio transmissions were quite powerful, they will quickly fade into the background noise of the cosmos as they spread out.  A tightly focused signal has a much better chance of remaining intact and travelling much further.  So... I would say, it&#39;s still a valid concern, whether or not to alter other civilizations to our presence.  To say &quot;Oh it&#39;s fine, they probably already know we&#39;re here.&quot; seems like a poor argument.<br><br>In fact, that&#39;s a very likely explanation for the Fermi Paradox.  Other civilizations may produce lots of &quot;radio noise&quot;, but as their technology has gotten better and better, the amount of signals that are lost to noise stays small (even as the complexity of their civilizations increase).  And, perhaps, they are just far away enough that this radio noise fades into the background before it reaches us.  We may have to wait until we can build massive radio-dishes on the surface of the moon before we can truly say &quot;We can determine with great certainty that the area of space within 10,000 lightyears around us has or does not have intelligent alien life.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-01-04T00:12:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Natey McBatey", "comment_text": "Man I teared up when he talked about his Grandma.

The reason for them to keep their distance is because we haven&#39;t obtained oneness. We are still divided as a species, violently so; so why would they want anything to do with us. I think it&#39;s hilarious that people think that a civilization, that&#39;s not human, that has the tech to traverse space, would be hostile. Most of our violent tendancies come from our lack of primitive resources which we should obstain from anyways, for example: oil, natural gas, radiation, waste production etc.. If anything aliens are afraid to make contact because they know we&#39;d want to exchange knowledge but we&#39;d abuse that knowledge because we haven&#39;t even learned how to live in harmony as our own species. If anything we should send out a call for help that reads, &quot;we&#39;re fucking planet up and can&#39;t stop wanting to kill eachother, PLEASE HELP!!&quot;. Like drug addicts we can&#39;t do what&#39;s good for ourselves because we crave that which kills us, CHAOS, and who can be rational in the midst of chaos? You want to contact an alien then look inside your wallet. This thing we call currency has kept us primitive far too long and is a plague to man. A human&#39;s worth can only defined by  the amount of effort they put into contributing to the imbetterment of man. I can almost guarentee if we no longer had nuclear weapons and or weapons that we&#39;d use to attack aliens before they could even explain their arrival, we might see or hear from some aliens.
