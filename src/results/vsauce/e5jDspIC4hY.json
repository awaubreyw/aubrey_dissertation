However, large, complex, active brains have a flaw -- boredom.<br><br>Such a complex brain must be powerful enough to do short bursts of intensive computation, but what is it to do when it isn&#39;t performing such a task? It&#39;s adapted to handle a high level of activity, just as an addict is adapted to handle a high level of their preferred drug. When intake stops, they get uncomfortable.<br><br>A brain powerful enough to do complex tasks gets used to them, &amp; boredom becomes inevitable. The more complex the brain, the greater its capacity for boredom. Boredom, being unpleasant, is something to be avoided, but how?<br><br>Evolutionarily speaking, the most obvious choice would probably be to shut down higher brain functions when they&#39;re not needed, sort of like sleeping while you&#39;re still awake. This could, however, have serious consequences, such as making social interaction more difficult (because it would be limited to the times where all parties had total brain function) or making it difficult to react to sudden threats (as it might take a hot second for your brain to come fully online enough to properly respond).<br><br>You could argue that this does actually happen in humans (&amp; presumably other animals) to some extent. During an adrenaline rush, for instance, alertness &amp; reaction time increase, which you might think of as an increase in brainpower. Of course, we think of it as a positive increase, rather than thinking of our ground state as a reduced version of our full potential, but that&#39;s just a matter of perspective.<br><br>It still stands, however, that the vast majority of our brainpower remains at our disposal even when it&#39;s not used, causing boredom. The solution then is to find ways to occupy our minds.<br><br>With what is basically irrelevant, so long as it&#39;s doing something &amp; we&#39;re interested in it, though some popular strategies include making things, telling or listening to stories, &amp; playing games.<br><br>This would very neatly explain why animals can be observed playing, with more intelligent animals playing more &amp; in more complex ways, &amp; humans being the pinnacle of both (so far as we know, anyway). This gives a clear explanation for how play could&#39;ve smoothly evolved from nonexistence to, say, chess.

Nevertheless, not knowing what your colleagues feel is very &quot;handicapant^1&quot;, because it is a recognized fact that in order to attein success on the market, emotional intelligence is a better tool than being intellectual.

While itimpresses with its complexity, graphics and physic engines it has a pretty boring story, also its complexity requires the player to accomplish an 18 years long totourial. After you have learned the basic controls the totorioul is rly not worth playing anymore. The soundtracks are not included within the game. You must buy them, but you can choose any you want. Its a free to play game but also pay to win, although there is no goal. The replayability is just bad. You can play the game just once and you have no safe-spots, or save-points. For the balancing: as mentioned before, the pay to win system really makes differences between the player. Whether you have no Reallife currency or you just dont want to spend it for a game doesnt matter. Youll have a hard time not spending money.<br>At last, the game is worth playing.

And I will get involved in real life games, like real life and stuff.<br>I am tired of playing games, and it hurts when I get back to it. I feel like every minute I spend playing video games is a minute lost and gone forever. But I dont know why I still play it. I feel terrible, and sad, and guilty, and unhappy, and unhappy playing video games.<br>I will replace this gaming addiction with BETTER LIFE addictions. I will do things like gym, make friends, hang out with the friends that I make, climb a mountain to find out if sages exist, volunteer my body for social experiments, build something epic,and yes.<br>I will quit the games and be free forevermore.<br>And this is my challenge for all of you out there who are like me and want to be like me, quit your video games and get involved in life&#39;s games where the rewards come less likely and its always risky, and you will forever feel uncomfortable and unstable.

What is common to them all? a Don\u2019t say: &#39;They must have something in common, or they would not be called <b>games</b>&#39; a but look and see whether there is anything common to all. a For if you look at them, you won\u2019t see something that is common to all, but similarities, affinities, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don\u2019t think, but look! a Look, for example, at board-games, with their various affinities. Now pass to card-games; here you find many correspondences with the first group, but many common |32| features drop out, and others appear. When we pass next to ball-games, much that is common is retained, but much is lost. a Are they all \u2018entertaining\u2019? Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and losing, or competition between players? Think of patience. In ball-games, there is winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck, and at the difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of singing and dancing games; here we have the element of entertainment, but how many other characteristic features have disappeared!

Well, perhaps because it has a a direct a affinity with several things that have hitherto been called &#39;number&#39;; and this can be said to give it an indirect affinity with other things that we also call &#39;numbers&#39;. And we extend our concept of number, as in spinning a thread we twist fibre on fibre.

Because we need problems to preserve our sanity after satisfying our basic needs like eating, drinking, socializing and feeling secure from predators etc... After satisfying your body you need to satisfy your mind and your mind, if you&#39;re not controlling it, creates you problems and asks you to solve them.The absence of problems drives a human being insane so he/she tries to &quot;create&quot; problems. No wonder neurosis is much more common among the rich than the poor and that&#39;s because of the lack of problems. We love and create problems in every thing we do other than trying to satisfy our basic needs. Watching films, for example, in every film there is conflict or a problem and that&#39;s why we love them. Playing games: when there is no problem to really threaten our being\u00a0 we play games to threaten our virtual being in a game for example. There is a proverb that says: if you want to solve a problem give it to a busy man. And if you can&#39;t solve your problem then you don&#39;t have enough problems. Problems have no significance in themselves we add significance to them and playing games is a very good example of our need to have problems.

Really interesting! Therefore, I think that there is something fundamental about the concept of games and sports; the fiction. In fact, what is the most important thing in a game? What does really count at the end? Of course, moves, tricks, shots, passes, are very spectacular and mandatory for a good entertainment, but nothing is more crucial than points, goals, victories, and ultimately records, history! However, everything that was accomplished in any sport you can imagine was and will always be virtual, it\u2019s maths, it\u2019s numbers, nothing else but inscriptions on paper! (more computers now) When it\u2019s 2-0 for Manchester or 40-15 for Tsonga, scores are pure fiction, everyone \u00a0knows that these numbers will disappear at the end of the game on the scoreboard. You might tell me, yeah right, but these \u201cvirtual\u201d points are worth billions! When you win 30 games in a season or you win tournaments, you become millionaire! When being the best in your sport, you become a legend, a venerated human for its accomplishments.
