A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on this earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there are only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water.<br>-<br>WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don&#39;t try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years.<br>-<br>DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early &#39;90s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don&#39;t know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. + TRUTH about COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc</a> <br>-<br>Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw8idyw_N6Q&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly?<br>-<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once.<br>-<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current.<br>-<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor.<br>-<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING. This website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000s as a Vision of a 10-speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ <a href=\"http://free-energy.yolasite.com/\">http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity.<br>-<br>This is a diagram <a href=\"https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php\">https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php</a> that looks a lot like the wiring of this former \u201cscience experiment\u201d YouTube video if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology<br>-<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages.

<b>*Vsuace music plays*</b> First we will be looking at the Earths spin and the altitude of it which moves once every 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.0953 seconds. This is called a sidereal period, and it&#39;s circumference is roughly 40,075 kilometres. Thus the surface of the Earths equator moves at a 460 metres per second or roughly 1,000 miles per hour. Now we need to look at the speed of the Earths gravitational force which in speed is about c (Another word for 299,792,458). Now we need to see the velocity of a falling object. As an object falls, it&#39;s speed increases  because it is being pulled by gravity (which =C) The acceleration of gravity near the Earth is g= 9.81 m/s^2  To find out somethings speed (or velocity.) After a certain amount of time, you just multiply the acceleration of gravity by the amount of time since it was let go off.<br>But with the Earths rotational axis pushing inwards by that logic I&#39;m assuming the 460 metres per second by the Earths equator we can say that it does too. So with the surface equator at 460 metres per second and the equator pushing inwards, your finger would have to reach a number above 460 metres. But G= m/s^2 is not a valid cardinal number therefore your fingers would have to be constantly spinning.

It was in the 3rd week in Dec. That whole week, the days were in the low 80&#39;s setting records. The day I saw this was a record high of 85, but there was a cold front pushing down wirt arctic air, that brought a record low, for that date. of 13. the cold air was moving in at a clipper rate with sustained winds around 40 mph and gust up to 70 mph. About 25 miles. <br><br>South of Montgomery, there is a tall tower (1933 feet high) that is the TV tower for WSFA in Montgomery. It is lit up with huge flashing strobes that are bright enough to look like lightning. I was heading home from Birmingham that night around 3 am. about an half an hour after the front started pushing through Montgomery. I was 15 or so miles north of the city, when I had started seeing a flashing speck that looked like it was just floating over the city. After a few minutes I realized that I was seeing that tower.

Out hiking you often need to stop moving yourself in order to check if that dot outlined on the far mountain ridge is alive and mobile or just a piece of rock. A dog approaching you on the trail will stop for the same reason, but closer on account of its relatively poor sight. A particularly dramatic motion effect occurs when you&#39;re passing an airport and an incoming or outgoing plane that must be doing a lot of kph appears to be hanging stationary in the air. Must be because observer and plane motions cancel against a common reference point. That would explain UFOs which apparently hover and then suddenly dart off - they&#39;re just that already moving plane subsequently changing course relative to the observer.<br><br>Pigeons are reported to see the exact reverse of the illusion whereby objects appear smaller when enclosed by larger areas, (a version of which is known as the Ebbinghaus). My theory: pigeons experience perspective in reverse to us, far off objects need to look bigger than nearby ones.

The illusion of control can be related to God so much. You&#39;re search for science is so accurate, I think you were meant to understand the true meaning behind the control people have of their lives. Stop controlling things. See how much of a difference it makes in your life. None... And if you&#39;re changing things, then you&#39;re really only allowing other things to control you besides yourself. To my beliefs.. To what I saw.. The illusion of control is seen through the Holy Spirit, or better known, the glimpse of god. Being saved isn&#39;t always about believing in Jesus or preaching the word. It&#39;s much more real than that. So real, no one can really understand it unless it happened to someone personally. That being said, giving yourself to god, is yet seeing the sight of others who don&#39;t. It is extremely hard to try and describe, and I don&#39;t scientists have any decency to even speak such things, but the illusion of control is simply thinking you&#39;re controlling the world or yourself, but you&#39;re not. I believe.. I really do believe, that this can relate to the science of the Holy Spirit. Let&#39;s say Jesus did exist, and he was the son of god. How come we can&#39;t see that he is? How come we can&#39;t see god? How come we can&#39;t see the Holy Spirit, if it is around is every day? The same reason that causes the illusion of control.

With very, in depth detail, as well. Same thing happened to one other guy there that was about to refuse emergency ECT, and i told him how its changed me into a much more optimistic person, and i changed his mind. After his 4th treatment, he asked me &quot;Is it bad that I&#39;m knowing what will happen next? Can the ECT be doing something bad to me, or maybe psychological?&quot; That&#39;s when i mentioned i was starting to have that same thing starting to happen. A few months later, those precognitive events gradually faded away, but still happens on rare occasions. So here is a suggestion: &quot;Why does ECT work?&quot; or maybe &quot;What happens to somebody during ECT?&quot; This is something that really peaks my curiosity, and it would be awesome if you could maybe make a video on something like this.

Were all dying. Because were trying to look out for our selves and our kids so much, that were not watching what were doing to others. We need to work together to succeed in everything, and to all be ourselfs. but first we need food, its unlimited, and we need to use it to our advantage. next we have to find a way to get rid of our trash so the base doesnt collapse. then we need to work out our differences in this world, with understanding for each and everyones, situation in life. Wether its, hate, poor, stress, fear. We need to help each other out of it and have peace of mind. Not only us but the animal kingdom as well. Using psychedelics and meditation we can speak to the animal species with our spiritual voice. then they can speak to the animals below them, then them to them then them. etc. Then we will all work together to have food. and face each others differences. no matter how different. We can perfect the system and rebuild the base if needed. Then once when every one becomes self concious, using psychedelics we can surpass every bad feeling, and transform, together, into something unique. And help each other have fun with it. So we no longer have worries.<br><br>Post repost fuckin like!!! We need to make a plan, and forgive each other. Need to face each others demons together. and see the shadow that is ourselfs, and learn from it!!!!! We can save us!! Thank you everyone, you all mean a lot to me. we all influence each other, and we are all one anothers parents. We all need to talk. (ALL) Like responsible beings, to bring about this plan. AS I take my mind to new heights I&#39;m mesmerized by the lights . The Reds Greens and Whites. The blues are too bright, Ive had to use all the might to understand the fight. But i held on tight and now I&#39;m wise in my sight. Now the Christmas spirit I can hear it, I cant fear it anymore. It told me to toss all the anger to the floor cuz with hatred in your heart you won&#39;t see it anymore. If you look closely you will finally see. see it fight for the rights of all humanity while it tries to save it from the grave and calamity. Like yosammidy Sam totin his gun when he can. We have all got a place here and were just standing hand in hand but our hands are unclean and although it may seem that were we are living green our minds are in place stuck somewhere in between misery and money.
