Please please read this ASAP<br><br>I read your book on lying recently and though it was brilliant. I have thought for a very long time that truth absolutely matters. And like you said that the only replacement for bad science, is good science.<br><br>To get to the point and give a bit of context, the night before last (now the 25th of February) I was away with 6 friends, we took some LSD, then they mistook my dark humour for real danger (I&#39;ve long been a fan of comedians like Ricky Gervais, Bill Burr, Jimmy Carr, Jim Jefferies and the late Robin Williams and Christopher Hitchens) <br>They then tried coercing me into committing suicide, and if I didn&#39;t do it, they would kill me.<br><br>They were trying to build up the courage to do it themselves as time went on.<br>As they were scared for their own safety and thought this was their only option.<br>I tried my best to assure them I was absolutely harmless (which I know I am) but failed in the end to do so.<br><br>This lasted for well over 12 hours where I was terrified to move and try get out for help. I ended up getting family to call for help urging for police, but only an ambulance came, they refused to take me and insisted I went with the friends who wanted me dead. untill I ran myself for help.<br><br><br>I was absolutely terrified and still think there is a huge threat. No one really seems to believe me so far (but now 2 of my best friends do) and I&#39;m hoping so much that you may be able to hear me out and help me as to where to go from here. I&#39;m now with family and terrified to go home or get back to work and normal life.<br><br>I&#39;m scared that talking to police/lawyers/journalists will put me in more danger as I&#39;m guessing they are unlikely to believe me at first, and I don&#39;t know the intricacies of the law surrounding their responsibilities. <br>So I&#39;m hoping you will believe me, and I can prove it somehow. I also don&#39;t want them charged with anything or any bad to ever come to them in any form because I don&#39;t believe in free will, and think they are good people in a horribly misunderstood situation.<br><br>Another thing of importance is that I&#39;ve had depression on and off for around 20 years. And after this experience where i thought I was certainly going to die, there is no way I&#39;d ever think of suicide as an option again. and l still think the threat is active. So if I dissappear, or appear to commit suicide, I assure you this is not the case.<br><br>This is no kind of joke, please, please help me.<br>You can reach me on +64 210624383<br><br>Pleading regards, Joel", "comment_date": "2022-03-03T06:23:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bidar Army005", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QPcclYWOr4&amp;t=2m27s\">2:27</a> i don&#39;t speak imperial system", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T05:17:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sorry Mom I'm Floppy", "comment_text": "I FUCKING HATE PEOPLE!!!!<br><br><br><br><br><br>\ud83e\udd17", "comment_date": "2022-02-28T03:00:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0418\u0433\u043e\u0440\u044c \u0422\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0435\u0432", "comment_text": "\u041f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0430 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442 \u0442\u0435\u043f\u043b\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u043d\u044c \u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0440\u0430\u0434\u0443\u0433\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043d\u043e\u0437 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0433\u043e\u0434\u043d\u044f", "comment_date": "2022-02-27T09:26:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PLu To", "comment_text": "Well it seems like YouTube know very well what I&#39;m going through by recommending this to me.", "comment_date": "2022-02-26T03:11:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aCollectionOfCellsThatMakeMemes", "comment_text": "Oh shoot how\u2019d he know?", "comment_date": "2022-02-25T10:01:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sub if you're against Communism", "comment_text": "So long", "comment_date": "2022-02-24T23:23:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Guy", "comment_text": "Are we vsauce?", "comment_date": "2022-02-17T06:45:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kamal Halder", "comment_text": "every human being is a representator of humanity.", "comment_date": "2022-02-16T13:10:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Duncan De Vera", "comment_text": "Way to recommend this during Valentine&#39;s Day.", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T13:43:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Who Am I", "comment_text": "You know what Thank YOU for putting this video", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T06:17:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "vfantastv", "comment_text": "of course this was recommended to me on valentine&#39;s day.", "comment_date": "2022-02-14T22:06:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Little Buddy", "comment_text": "Why on Valentine&#39;s...", "comment_date": "2022-02-14T20:10:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shadowless422", "comment_text": "Why is this video recommended to me today (14th February)???", "comment_date": "2022-02-14T16:37:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "icantthinkofachannelname", "comment_text": "Got recommended on valentines day", "comment_date": "2022-02-14T15:51:30Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Bandith Thach", "comment_text": "aww, recommended to me on Valentine\u2019s Day?
