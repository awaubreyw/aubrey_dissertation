Nemitz registered some land containing 492 quintillion dollars worth of platinum. The land was right here... well, over here - an asteroid named 433 Eros. Not a single sovereign nation on earth recognizes human claims to extraterrestrial real estate, but he did it anyway. And then, less than a year later, NASA landed a probe on the asteroid. They called it the first asteroid we had ever landed a probe on. Nemitz called it &quot;parking space number 29&quot; and promptly sent NASA a 20 dollar parking ticket. But so far, NASA and the US Attorney General have dismissed the fine, saying that his claim to own the asteroid is without legal merit. But why? <br><br>Plenty of organizations exists that will gladly take your money in return for land on the Moon, Venus, Mars. And if you had enough money to go to the Moon, nothing is legally stopping you from moving there, building a house with a significant other, having some kids and turning your Moon house into a Moon home. It wouldn&#39;t be trespassing or squatting or stealing. The 1979 Moon Treaty says that no one can own any part of outer space ever, but only 11 states have signed it. However, 129 nations have signed and/or ratified the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which says that outer space is not subject to national appropriation. It says nothing about a private individual or a company owning part of outer space. But without the recognition and support of at least one sovereign nation, what does ownership really mean? <br><br>I mean, I can claim anything I want. I can claim to own Prospect Park in Brooklyn, but just saying that I do or even moving there and living in Prospect Park wouldn&#39;t entitle me to the rights that usually go along with ownership, unless someone with a bunch of power agreed that I owned it and could enforce that ownership and keep others from claiming to also own it. In the past, explorers had few qualms about claiming to own land, even if other humans were already there, because they had power on their side - mainly plenty of guns, Germs and Steel. To paraphrase con artist Canada Bill Jones, &quot;you know what beats four aces? A gun.&quot; Or as @lawblob pointed out, McDonald&#39;s actually does serve breakfast after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks8WH3xUo_E&amp;t=10m30s\">10:30</a>, if you have a gun. If you claimed some land on the Moon as your own and moved in, would you also have to hire your own lunar police and Cislunar military to defend it and to keep others from challenging your claim? Pretty much. <br><br>That&#39;s kind of the problem. Currently it is risky for individuals or corporations to claim and use extraterrestrial territory because the Outer Space Treaty says that outer space is the common heritage of mankind. It belongs to all of us and only to all of us. Many interpretations of the Outer Space Treaty predict that powerful things like nations would be reluctant to come to your defense should someone else want to move in or cause trouble or dispute your extraterrestrial claim. Maybe you could get the sovereign nation to weigh in on your behalf by declaring universal jurisdiction but that would need to be for an incredibly terrible heinous crime, a crime against all of humanity, not just a dispute over a few space rocks. <br><br>Catherine Doldirina from the Institute of Air &amp; Space Law at McGill University suggests that considering outer space, the common heritage of mankind, has slowed space exploration. You see, the Outer Space Treaty was based on the Antarctic Treaty, which says that the entire continent shall never become the scene or object of international discord. Discord is not a good thing, but without an incentive to profit from it, not much has happened there, as opposed to the Arctic, where a resource boom is currently underway. If people felt safer appropriating and taking advantage of space, of celestial bodies, if technological development was more incentivized, would we already have orbiting tourist attractions and lunar hotels? Maybe. But here is what you can currently own in outer space: stuff you put there and, to a certain extent, orbits. <br><br>The Outer Space Treaty says that the stuff we left on the move, anything put into space, remains property of the original owner forever. Orbits around earth are temporarily granted by the International Telecommunication Union, a UN agency; but they don&#39;t work like typical real estate on Earth. When a group of Equatorial nations attempted to claim orbits above their land boundaries, without planning on putting satellites there, their claim was largely ignored. So you not only need to ask the UN for an orbit and get permission, you also need to use it and fill it. It&#39;s a little disappointing that we don&#39;t know how lunar real estate works or if it will, but it&#39;s exciting to know that we, within our lifetimes, might have a chance to be part of the solution. A unique generation not visiting space for the first time, but homesteading it for the first time. Here&#39;s another unresolved space law quandary. If an alien landed in your backyard, intelligent life from beyond Earth, and you shot it with a gun, dressed it and then cooked up, you and your family, some alien meat fajitas, would that be hunting or murder? <br><br>We literally don&#39;t know. On earth, we have human rights, but there are no alien rights. Maybe it would fall under the category of cultural vandalism, an act that&#39;s not necessarily a legal, but is a giant bummer to the rest of humanity. This has happened before - not with aliens - but with paintings. In 2003, the Chapman brothers purchased one of the few remaining sets of Goya&#39;s Fantastic Disasters of War. Instead of displaying the works for the public, they defaced them by drawing clown and puppy heads on the people. They called the work &quot;insult to injury.&quot; In protest, a man threw red paint on Jake Chapman when he appeared at Modern Art Oxford, but at the end of the day, what the Chapman brothers did wasn&#39;t illegal. They owned the paintings. Vandalizing the Moon or killing a peaceful alien aren&#39;t illegal acts, but just like defacing historical paintings, they seem wrong on some deeper level, especially since because in most museums you usually can&#39;t even touch the paintings. <br><br>But who was the first person to touch the Moon with their bare hands? I mean, the guys who walked around on the Moon wore space suits, they had material in between their skin and the Moon. Well, to be sure, you already have the Moon in your hands. Well, little Moons. Lunula. The crescent-shaped area at the base of your fingernail, where tissue is thicker and the red vascular structures underneath are more hidden, making it white. And to be even more sure, at the quantum level touch is problematic. As I&#39;ve covered before, atomically speaking, matter never really contacts other matter in the conventional sense. You can&#39;t truly touch anything. MinutePhysics called it interaction over a short distance. <br><br>With that in mind, NASA says the Terry Slezak was the first person to touch the Moon with his bare hands. He was a technician in quarantine, who accidentally got lunar soil smeared all over his hand while removing film magazines from the astronauts&#39; cameras. But when Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the lunar module after their moonwalk and removed their helmets, they came into contact with lunar dust they tracked in on their suits. They even reported its odor, saying it smelled of spent gunpowder or ashes, possibly because it oxidized on contact with the air in the cabin. Point is, the first few breaths of Moon dusty air that Armstrong and Aldrin took in were our first fleshly contact with the Moon. Or were they? <br><br>Walking around on earth every day I am surrounded by material that recently was in outer space. Hundreds of metric tons of extraterrestrial rock falls to Earth every year. Some from the Moon, but most from asteroids, ejected by a high-speed impact and eventually caught by Earth&#39;s gravity. Some pieces are big enough to see, but most are pulverized by our atmosphere during entry into tiny particles that disperse in the air, becoming a tiny fraction of the very dust and dirt we clean up and breathe in every day. There&#39;s microscopic space dust, pieces of asteroids and even the Moon all around us. In fact, there might be microscopic pieces of the Moon under your bed right now or even under your fingernails. <br><br>Which means the first human to have fleshly contact with lunar material was the first Homo Sapien hundreds of thousands of years ago to walk on dirt. We are still studying exactly how much cosmic dust is in the air that we breathe every day, but it&#39;s safe to say that every once in a while you inhale some material that was recently in outer space, some of which thousands of years ago was on the Moon. Was the Moon. And just like other particulates in our atmosphere, large enough pieces get trapped in the mucus that protects our lungs, meaning that picking your nose is gross, but every once in a while, a booger could literally be out of this world.

Yes, have you ever been inside a small toilet with a winter jacket and a backpack? Homeless people know well, you can&#39;t get out unless you stand on top of the toilet (hopefully with the lid closed) and open the door inward and carefully slip out. But in the LEM Neil and Buzz had to exit backing up, assuming they could fit through the small opening and assuming they were able to open the door with their inflated suits and backpacks on and fully operational air and water cooling system which requires a breeze for cooling, the moon has no breeze, so a water cooling system wouldn&#39;t work there, and with their oversized boots, they had to step on a ladder but how were they able to bend their knees to take a step down almost vertical ladder, with a huge camera stuck in front of them, assuming the camera was attached before they opened the door that opened inward, and the camera didn&#39;t get caught to the ladder? and how did they get back inside?  How did they land without scoring the surface of the powder like dust and there is no crater from the blast of the 10,000 lbs/in thrust which would have caused a dust storm blowing away all dust that is powder like, how did the boot leave a perfect impression if there should be no moisture?

Back in 1995 I warned David about the high possibility of a reptilius infestation while writing his book on the &quot;reptilians.&quot; I told him the tail of the dragon in Pisces (then) was right in his 12th house regulating dark subconscious forces making him acknowledge those entities and unable him to differentiate reality from imagination.<br>\u00a0<br>After months spent alone on the Isle of Wright writing, my prediction came to pass and he saw those awful reptilius entities. Note I also predicted he would lose a costly legal battle and warned him of a sudden death (heart attack if he did not slow down!) <br>\u00a0<br>He then erroneously associated the reptilius with all very powerful people like the Queen of England, Obama etc. The fact is; we are ALL under the jurisdictions of the reptilius particularly in the right conditions, in the dark, alone without protection, or if legal or illegal drugs and alcohol is abused or if depression and negativity and fear is nurtured for long period of time. <br>\u00a0<br>The dreadful fear David experienced seeing those low astral entities made him very vulnerable and the reptilius invaded him pulling his feet down towards the ground (hell.)<br>\u00a0<br>All I am trying to do is to warn all the people being fed negativity, lack of hopes for the future, fearing the government or offering tangible solutions... I felt so strong to warn you about poisoning negativity induced by cosmic unconscious &quot;talking Heads&quot; thus, like David does, I decided posting regular videos on my you tube channel to warn you and avoid a reptilius infestation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfrAy1fy26w\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfrAy1fy26w</a> <br>\u00a0<br>While I was his close trusted friend and &quot;psychic&quot; back in 1995 and for years to come, he dealt with another non cosmic conscious &quot;Neptunian&quot; who confirmed David&#39;s horrific visions and added her nonsense.

Michael here. Gregory W. Nemitz registered some land containing 492 quintillion dollars worth of platinum. The land was right here... well, over here - an asteroid named 433 Eros. Not a single sovereign nation on earth recognizes human claims to extraterrestrial real estate, but he did it anyway. And then, less than a year later, NASA landed a probe on the asteroid. They called it the first asteroid we had ever landed a probe on. Nemitz called it &quot;parking space number 29&quot; and promptly sent NASA a 20 dollar parking ticket. But so far, NASA and the US Attorney General have dismissed the fine, saying that his claim to own the asteroid is without legal merit. But why? Plenty of organizations exists that will gladly take your money in return for land on the Moon, Venus, Mars. And if you had enough money to go to the Moon, nothing is legally stopping you from moving there, building a house with a significant other, having some kids and turning your Moon house into a Moon home. It wouldn&#39;t be trespassing or squatting or stealing. The 1979 Moon Treaty says that no one can own any part of outer space ever, but only 11 states have signed it. However, 129 nations have signed and/or ratified the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which says that outer space is not subject to national appropriation. It says nothing about a private individual or a company owning part of outer space. But without the recognition and support of at least one sovereign nation, what does ownership really mean? I mean, I can claim anything I want. I can claim to own Prospect Park in Brooklyn, but just saying that I do or even moving there and living in Prospect Park wouldn&#39;t entitle me to the rights that usually go along with ownership, unless someone with a bunch of power agreed that I owned it and could enforce that ownership and keep others from claiming to also own it. In the past, explorers had few qualms about claiming to own land, even if other humans were already there, because they had power on their side - mainly plenty of guns, Germs and Steel. To paraphrase con artist Canada Bill Jones, &quot;you know what beats four aces? A gun.&quot; Or as @lawblob pointed out, McDonald&#39;s actually does serve breakfast after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks8WH3xUo_E&amp;t=10m30s\">10:30</a>, if you have a gun. If you claimed some land on the Moon as your own and moved in, would you also have to hire your own lunar police and Cislunar military to defend it and to keep others from challenging your claim? Pretty much. That&#39;s kind of the problem. Currently it is risky for individuals or corporations to claim and use extraterrestrial territory because the Outer Space Treaty says that outer space is the common heritage of mankind. It belongs to all of us and only to all of us. Many interpretations of the Outer Space Treaty predict that powerful things like nations would be reluctant to come to your defense should someone else want to move in or cause trouble or dispute your extraterrestrial claim. Maybe you could get the sovereign nation to weigh in on your behalf by declaring universal jurisdiction but that would need to be for an incredibly terrible heinous crime, a crime against all of humanity, not just a dispute over a few space rocks. Catherine Doldirina from the Institute of Air &amp; Space Law at McGill University suggests that considering outer space, the common heritage of mankind, has slowed space exploration. You see, the Outer Space Treaty was based on the Antarctic Treaty, which says that the entire continent shall never become the scene or object of international discord. Discord is not a good thing, but without an incentive to profit from it, not much has happened there, as opposed to the Arctic, where a resource boom is currently underway. If people felt safer appropriating and taking advantage of space, of celestial bodies, if technological development was more incentivized, would we already have orbiting tourist attractions and lunar hotels? Maybe. But here is what you can currently own in outer space: stuff you put there and, to a certain extent, orbits. The Outer Space Treaty says that the stuff we left on the move, anything put into space, remains property of the original owner forever. Orbits around earth are temporarily granted by the International Telecommunication Union, a UN agency; but they don&#39;t work like typical real estate on Earth. When a group of Equatorial nations attempted to claim orbits above their land boundaries, without planning on putting satellites there, their claim was largely ignored. So you not only need to ask the UN for an orbit and get permission, you also need to use it and fill it. It&#39;s a little disappointing that we don&#39;t know how lunar real estate works or if it will, but it&#39;s exciting to know that we, within our lifetimes, might have a chance to be part of the solution. A unique generation not visiting space for the first time, but homesteading it for the first time. Here&#39;s another unresolved space law quandary. If an alien landed in your backyard, intelligent life from beyond Earth, and you shot it with a gun, dressed it and then cooked up, you and your family, some alien meat fajitas, would that be hunting or murder? We literally don&#39;t know. On earth, we have human rights, but there are no alien rights. Maybe it would fall under the category of cultural vandalism, an act that&#39;s not necessarily a legal, but is a giant bummer to the rest of humanity. This has happened before - not with aliens - but with paintings. In 2003, the Chapman brothers purchased one of the few remaining sets of Goya&#39;s Fantastic Disasters of War. Instead of displaying the works for the public, they defaced them by drawing clown and puppy heads on the people. They called the work &quot;insult to injury.&quot; In protest, a man threw red paint on Jake Chapman when he appeared at Modern Art Oxford, but at the end of the day, what the Chapman brothers did wasn&#39;t illegal. They owned the paintings. Vandalizing the Moon or killing a peaceful alien aren&#39;t illegal acts, but just like defacing historical paintings, they seem wrong on some deeper level, especially since because in most museums you usually can&#39;t even touch the paintings. But who was the first person to touch the Moon with their bare hands? I mean, the guys who walked around on the Moon wore space suits, they had material in between their skin and the Moon. Well, to be sure, you already have the Moon in your hands. Well, little Moons. Lunula. The crescent-shaped area at the base of your fingernail, where tissue is thicker and the red vascular structures underneath are more hidden, making it white. And to be even more sure, at the quantum level touch is problematic. As I&#39;ve covered before, atomically speaking, matter never really contacts other matter in the conventional sense. You can&#39;t truly touch anything. MinutePhysics called it interaction over a short distance. With that in mind, NASA says the Terry Slezak was the first person to touch the Moon with his bare hands. He was a technician in quarantine, who accidentally got lunar soil smeared all over his hand while removing film magazines from the astronauts&#39; cameras. But when Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the lunar module after their moonwalk and removed their helmets, they came into contact with lunar dust they tracked in on their suits. They even reported its odor, saying it smelled of spent gunpowder or ashes, possibly because it oxidized on contact with the air in the cabin. Point is, the first few breaths of Moon dusty air that Armstrong and Aldrin took in were our first fleshly contact with the Moon. Or were they? Walking around on earth every day I am surrounded by material that recently was in outer space. Hundreds of metric tons of extraterrestrial rock falls to Earth every year. Some from the Moon, but most from asteroids, ejected by a high-speed impact and eventually caught by Earth&#39;s gravity. Some pieces are big enough to see, but most are pulverized by our atmosphere during entry into tiny particles that disperse in the air, becoming a tiny fraction of the very dust and dirt we clean up and breathe in every day. There&#39;s microscopic space dust, pieces of asteroids and even the Moon all around us. In fact, there might be microscopic pieces of the Moon under your bed right now or even under your fingernails. Which means the first human to have fleshly contact with lunar material was the first Homo Sapien hundreds of thousands of years ago to walk on dirt. We are still studying exactly how much cosmic dust is in the air that we breathe every day, but it&#39;s safe to say that every once in a while you inhale some material that was recently in outer space, some of which thousands of years ago was on the Moon. Was the Moon. And just like other particulates in our atmosphere, large enough pieces get trapped in the mucus that protects our lungs, meaning that picking your nose is gross, but every once in a while, a booger could literally be out of this world. And as always, thanks for watching.", "comment_date": "2018-12-22T02:05:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I\u2019mTheDude", "comment_text": "Was that the tweet that got McDonald\u2019s to serve breakfast all day ?", "comment_date": "2018-12-21T14:29:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Owl Eyed Man", "comment_text": "well...actually <br>CROWLEY! practically owns the moon <br>Uwu", "comment_date": "2018-12-21T13:12:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eairvin", "comment_text": "Koro-Sensei: <b>triggered</b>", "comment_date": "2018-12-20T11:43:55Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Brayden Payne", "comment_text": "The earth owns the moon", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T21:49:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jacob __", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks8WH3xUo_E&amp;t=2m58s\">2:58</a> not anymore haha!", "comment_date": "2018-12-18T23:14:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Masd", "comment_text": "Aliens.", "comment_date": "2018-12-18T23:06:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "damca96", "comment_text": "OMG, every episode I get brain fucked.", "comment_date": "2018-12-18T20:24:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yeah....", "comment_text": "If the first human to touch the Moon was the first human, does that mean that all humans have inherited the moon?", "comment_date": "2018-12-18T01:23:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cheeseburger", "comment_text": "ok", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T11:00:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maximiliano Almonacid", "comment_text": "technically the moon belonged to Chile<br><a href=\"https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenaro_Gajardo_Vera\">https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenaro_Gajardo_Vera</a>", "comment_date": "2018-12-16T02:00:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "severe", "comment_text": "HOW COULD U SAY DISCORD IS OT A GOOD THING I ALWAYS USE IT TO COMMUNICATE WITH MY FRIENDS <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DISCORDWILLFOREVERLIVE\">#DISCORDWILLFOREVERLIVE</a> lol", "comment_date": "2018-12-15T17:44:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DaGeometryBoi", "comment_text": "Fun fact: When touch the dirt on earth your like touching the dirt on moon because earth maded the moon", "comment_date": "2018-12-15T03:23:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam R", "comment_text": "?- How did you not mention the guy who sells land on the moon and has made millions in an 11 minute video?", "comment_date": "2018-12-14T23:34:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Becca B", "comment_text": "No one owns any land, no government or world leaders or humans it was giving to everyone to share not for plundering people pockets if I want to build a house on any peace of land you should be able to do so without any problems tho it&#39;s a god given right to live as free as possible without tax or money or ownership of this and that land  or do what we want it&#39;s sad that were limited due to government ownership.... if I want to build a house in this or that street i should be able to if I built my own rocket and went to the moon to live for a few week nothing should be able to stop you. but if yo even tried you get hulted straight  away because we have no freedom to do so. we&#39;re born on this earth but yet treated like dust", "comment_date": "2018-12-14T01:39:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HentaiBro 69", "comment_text": "me nigga", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T14:35:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChronicGamingHD", "comment_text": "lmao background music makes me think of old rs sound from al kharid hahha", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T06:17:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "runechuckie", "comment_text": "The United States could be one example of how the future will play out (minis any unknown moon creatures &amp; native Americans) when North America was first colonized everyone owned everything similar to this.

Diamond\u2019s explanations are extremely compelling, even to someone with more than a passing education in history, geography and historiography. Of course, they are all a \u201cjust so\u201d story, rather than an accurate representation of how things turned out. Geography, of course, is important in the historical development of different nations and civilizations. Is geography (along with associated factors of agricultural technology, domesticated animals and his pained explanation about why Europeans were better with guns than the Chinese who invented them) the only factor in why Western Civilization grew to dominate others? Of course it isn\u2019t.<br> Europe had no unique access to these things: Asian civilizations had arguably superior such advantages. Victor Davis Hanson makes a similar \u201cone factor\u201d argument in his book Carnage and Culture. Hanson\u2019s argument is that Westerners are simply better at war than other civilizations, because most Westerners were influenced by the Ancient Greeks, who developed methods of combat and developing innovations superior to that of other nations. Is Hanson\u2019s theory 100% the One True Answer? No, the rise of Japan and the invincibility of Mongol raiders rather puts his theory to fault, but it\u2019s at least as important as geography. There are all kinds of \u201cone factor\u201d arguments possible, all of which could make for as convincing a book as this one.<br> Victorian historians thought it was the vigor of \u201cNordic\u201d civilizations which made Western world domination inevitable: also convincing if that was the only book you had read on that particular day, and were also ultimately deeply silly (basically, this means the West dominates because it is dominant). Other Victorian historians made out human history to be the product of great battles, all of which had a huge element of random chance. Spengler also famously thought of civilizations as \u201ccultural organisms\u201d which eventually get old, become frail and die, just like any other organism whose telomeres have gotten shorter. I would imagine, like in, say, finance, the actual explanation for history is kind of complicated. I bet the Greek way of war has something to do with it, along with geography, culture, the Catholic Church, language and a whole lot of random chance. It\u2019s nice to think we know exactly why something happened, but a lot of what happens in the world, especially the world of human beings, is just plain random noise. Putting one factor explanations on history as Diamond does is not particularly helpful. <br> There is also the matter of historical perspective. Diamond writes as if everything leading up to the present time of European world cultural domination was some kind of historical inevitability, and that, of course, thus it will always be. This is the sheerest nonsense. At various times in human history, \u201cWestern Civilization\u201d consisted of illiterate barbarians living in mud huts. In very recent times in human history (like, say, the 1940s), it kind of looked like that\u2019s where the West was heading again. Other civilizations culturally and physically eclipsed or dominated the West through history: the Japanese, the Chinese, the Islamic civilizations, Egyptian, Assyrian, Mongolian, Persian or Russian (if you count them as different, which they are for the purpose of categorization, even though they\u2019re mainly caucasoid\u2013with some mongoloid) civilizations made Western civilization irrelevant through vast swathes of human history. Such civilizations may again eclipse Western civilization. Just to take one example, the Zoroastrian Persian civilization lasted longer than Rome, covered more territory, and was in many ways more advanced. They even generally beat the Romans in warfare in the Middle East. Why should I privilege the Romans over the Persians, just because some nations who were rather vaguely influenced by Rome now dominate the nations who were influenced by the Persians? I privilege them because they are my cultural ancestors, though in 1000 years, the poetry of Rumi may be more important than that of Martial.<br> Finally, there are the matters of Diamond\u2019s historical veracity and bigotry. To address the second thing first, he seems to take a sort of perverse glee in making racial pronouncements to the detriment of \u201cWestern\u201d people. According to Diamond, Western people are dirty and have developed special immune systems\u2013something I find hard to believe and doubt is backed up by anything resembling statistical fact. Why wouldn\u2019t east Asians have developed superior immune systems? They lived in cities longer than the ancestors of most Westerners. Also, according to Diamond, he can tell that the average New Guinean is \u201con the average more intelligent, more alert, more expressive, and more interested in things and people than the average European or American.\u201d (page 20, along with a tortured explanation of why Diamond\u2019s vacation perceptions are supposed to be superior to a century of psychometric research) This is the sort of casual bigotry that used to inform Nordicist history about the dominance of the West, except somehow it becomes politically correct when pointed at Western people in modern times.", "comment_date": "2018-06-21T21:08:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AngryDoggoYT", "comment_text": "I had a idea for a space force like you said but too bad trump beat me to it\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2018-06-20T12:59:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V Stylo", "comment_text": "Hiw many of u try the dialogue &quot;hey Vsauce micheal here", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T14:33:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ecliptic Archer", "comment_text": "It goes from who own the moon to out of the world boogers", "comment_date": "2018-06-19T06:20:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Graham", "comment_text": "Make new videos", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T03:29:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sami Suoud", "comment_text": "God", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T00:41:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cunt", "comment_text": "so i cant own Pluto", "comment_date": "2018-06-16T06:15:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dewalt vanderWesthuizen", "comment_text": "I own the moon it&#39;s mine.", "comment_date": "2018-06-15T11:03:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simisterr", "comment_text": "The Earth and its resources were supposed to be for all of us as well just like the other celestial bodies.", "comment_date": "2018-06-15T02:54:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "krakatoa on Steroids", "comment_text": "I own the moon.

By defacing the painting, the Chapman Brothers have gone against the telos of the art, which is why what the brothers did feels wrong. A utilitarian, who always looks to maximize happiness, would say that defacing the art creates more unhappiness than happiness, so defacing it is wrong. A libertarian could look at both sides of the argument. They could argue that the brothers now own the painting and have free will to do what they want with it, or they could also argue that the art is the fruit of the artist&#39;s labor, which the artist must always possess (self-ownership and some other stuff), so by going against what the artist intended, the Chapman brothers did the wrong thing.<br><br>Congratulations on reading that whole comment!<br>Here&#39;s a cookie \ud83c\udf6a", "comment_date": "2018-06-11T02:26:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sir Boring Name", "comment_text": "Nemitz is a legend for giving a parking ticket to NASA", "comment_date": "2018-06-10T11:29:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kakyoin donut321", "comment_text": "Real estate", "comment_date": "2018-06-10T11:26:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ECLIPSIAN", "comment_text": "The man on the right is definitely an alien. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks8WH3xUo_E&amp;t=7m15s\">7:15</a>", "comment_date": "2018-06-09T21:47:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robsta511", "comment_text": "March 3rd 2000 is the exact day I was born", "comment_date": "2018-06-06T22:47:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Corn Boy", "comment_text": "JESUS OWNS THE MOON", "comment_date": "2018-06-05T18:00:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Najib Bukele", "comment_text": "the Chinese wants to go to the moon.. since it belongs to the <a href=\"http://usa.do/\">USA.do</a> they have to apply for a visa to go up there?", "comment_date": "2018-06-04T01:21:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Jones", "comment_text": "&#39;whispers&#39;<br>It&#39;s free real estate", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T15:16:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zacc Le Taco", "comment_text": "Hey Vsauce, Michael here<br><br>OR IS IT", "comment_date": "2018-06-03T01:59:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Willi Republic", "comment_text": "Nobody, according to laws recognized by most nations.", "comment_date": "2018-06-02T12:27:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Brea", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks8WH3xUo_E&amp;t=10m35s\">10:35</a> - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks8WH3xUo_E&amp;t=10m38s\">10:38</a> Is that the lick?", "comment_date": "2018-06-01T01:08:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "toasted bread", "comment_text": "Mr. Gru owns the moon.", "comment_date": "2018-05-31T03:32:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hunter's Moon", "comment_text": "No one owns the moon but I bet Americans think they own it.", "comment_date": "2018-05-30T15:34:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Relentless", "comment_text": "I own the moon, I was friends with the guy who owned &quot;Theia&quot; and when it hit earth he said I could trade him a Ben 10 watch and my Juice for ownership of the moon...

Michael here. Gregory W. Nemitz registered some land containing 492 quintillion dollars worth of platinum. The land was right here... well, over here - an asteroid named 433 Eros. Not a single sovereign nation on earth recognizes human claims to extraterrestrial real estate, but he did it anyway. And then, less than a year later, NASA landed a probe on the asteroid. They called it the first asteroid we had ever landed a probe on. Nemitz called it &quot;parking space number 29&quot; and promptly sent NASA a 20 dollar parking ticket. But so far, NASA and the US Attorney General have dismissed the fine, saying that his claim to own the asteroid is without legal merit. But why? <br>Plenty of organizations exists that will gladly take your money in return for land on the Moon, Venus, Mars. And if you had enough money to go to the Moon, nothing is legally stopping you from moving there, building a house with a significant other, having some kids and turning your Moon house into a Moon home. It wouldn&#39;t be trespassing or squatting or stealing. The 1979 Moon Treaty says that no one can own any part of outer space ever, but only 11 states have signed it. However, 129 nations have signed and/or ratified the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which says that outer space is not subject to national appropriation. It says nothing about a private individual or a company owning part of outer space. But without the recognition and support of at least one sovereign nation, what does ownership really mean? <br>I mean, I can claim anything I want. I can claim to own Prospect Park in Brooklyn, but just saying that I do or even moving there and living in Prospect Park wouldn&#39;t entitle me to the rights that usually go along with ownership, unless someone with a bunch of power agreed that I owned it and could enforce that ownership and keep others from claiming to also own it. In the past, explorers had few qualms about claiming to own land, even if other humans were already there, because they had power on their side - mainly plenty of guns, Germs and Steel. To paraphrase con artist Canada Bill Jones, &quot;you know what beats four aces? A gun.&quot; Or as @lawblob pointed out, McDonald&#39;s actually does serve breakfast after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks8WH3xUo_E&amp;t=10m30s\">10:30</a>, if you have a gun. If you claimed some land on the Moon as your own and moved in, would you also have to hire your own lunar police and Cislunar military to defend it and to keep others from challenging your claim? Pretty much. <br>That&#39;s kind of the problem. Currently it is risky for individuals or corporations to claim and use extraterrestrial territory because the Outer Space Treaty says that outer space is the common heritage of mankind. It belongs to all of us and only to all of us. Many interpretations of the Outer Space Treaty predict that powerful things like nations would be reluctant to come to your defense should someone else want to move in or cause trouble or dispute your extraterrestrial claim. Maybe you could get the sovereign nation to weigh in on your behalf by declaring universal jurisdiction but that would need to be for an incredibly terrible heinous crime, a crime against all of humanity, not just a dispute over a few space rocks. <br>Catherine Doldirina from the Institute of Air &amp; Space Law at McGill University suggests that considering outer space, the common heritage of mankind, has slowed space exploration. You see, the Outer Space Treaty was based on the Antarctic Treaty, which says that the entire continent shall never become the scene or object of international discord. Discord is not a good thing, but without an incentive to profit from it, not much has happened there, as opposed to the Arctic, where a resource boom is currently underway. If people felt safer appropriating and taking advantage of space, of celestial bodies, if technological development was more incentivized, would we already have orbiting tourist attractions and lunar hotels? Maybe. But here is what you can currently own in outer space: stuff you put there and, to a certain extent, orbits. <br>The Outer Space Treaty says that the stuff we left on the move, anything put into space, remains property of the original owner forever. Orbits around earth are temporarily granted by the International Telecommunication Union, a UN agency; but they don&#39;t work like typical real estate on Earth. When a group of Equatorial nations attempted to claim orbits above their land boundaries, without planning on putting satellites there, their claim was largely ignored. So you not only need to ask the UN for an orbit and get permission, you also need to use it and fill it. It&#39;s a little disappointing that we don&#39;t know how lunar real estate works or if it will, but it&#39;s exciting to know that we, within our lifetimes, might have a chance to be part of the solution. A unique generation not visiting space for the first time, but homesteading it for the first time. Here&#39;s another unresolved space law quandary. If an alien landed in your backyard, intelligent life from beyond Earth, and you shot it with a gun, dressed it and then cooked up, you and your family, some alien meat fajitas, would that be hunting or murder? <br>We literally don&#39;t know. On earth, we have human rights, but there are no alien rights. Maybe it would fall under the category of cultural vandalism, an act that&#39;s not necessarily a legal, but is a giant bummer to the rest of humanity. This has happened before - not with aliens - but with paintings. In 2003, the Chapman brothers purchased one of the few remaining sets of Goya&#39;s Fantastic Disasters of War. Instead of displaying the works for the public, they defaced them by drawing clown and puppy heads on the people. They called the work &quot;insult to injury.&quot; In protest, a man threw red paint on Jake Chapman when he appeared at Modern Art Oxford, but at the end of the day, what the Chapman brothers did wasn&#39;t illegal. They owned the paintings. Vandalizing the Moon or killing a peaceful alien aren&#39;t illegal acts, but just like defacing historical paintings, they seem wrong on some deeper level, especially since because in most museums you usually can&#39;t even touch the paintings. <br>But who was the first person to touch the Moon with their bare hands? I mean, the guys who walked around on the Moon wore space suits, they had material in between their skin and the Moon. Well, to be sure, you already have the Moon in your hands. Well, little Moons. Lunula. The crescent-shaped area at the base of your fingernail, where tissue is thicker and the red vascular structures underneath are more hidden, making it white. And to be even more sure, at the quantum level touch is problematic. As I&#39;ve covered before, atomically speaking, matter never really contacts other matter in the conventional sense. You can&#39;t truly touch anything. MinutePhysics called it interaction over a short distance. <br>With that in mind, NASA says the Terry Slezak was the first person to touch the Moon with his bare hands. He was a technician in quarantine, who accidentally got lunar soil smeared all over his hand while removing film magazines from the astronauts&#39; cameras. But when Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the lunar module after their moonwalk and removed their helmets, they came into contact with lunar dust they tracked in on their suits. They even reported its odor, saying it smelled of spent gunpowder or ashes, possibly because it oxidized on contact with the air in the cabin. Point is, the first few breaths of Moon dusty air that Armstrong and Aldrin took in were our first fleshly contact with the Moon. Or were they? <br>Walking around on earth every day I am surrounded by material that recently was in outer space. Hundreds of metric tons of extraterrestrial rock falls to Earth every year. Some from the Moon, but most from asteroids, ejected by a high-speed impact and eventually caught by Earth&#39;s gravity. Some pieces are big enough to see, but most are pulverized by our atmosphere during entry into tiny particles that disperse in the air, becoming a tiny fraction of the very dust and dirt we clean up and breathe in every day. There&#39;s microscopic space dust, pieces of asteroids and even the Moon all around us. In fact, there might be microscopic pieces of the Moon under your bed right now or even under your fingernails. <br>Which means the first human to have fleshly contact with lunar material was the first Homo Sapien hundreds of thousands of years ago to walk on dirt. We are still studying exactly how much cosmic dust is in the air that we breathe every day, but it&#39;s safe to say that every once in a while you inhale some material that was recently in outer space, some of which thousands of years ago was on the Moon. Was the Moon. And just like other particulates in our atmosphere, large enough pieces get trapped in the mucus that protects our lungs, meaning that picking your nose is gross, but every once in a while, a booger could literally be out of this world.

I found myself also coming to another conclusion that who says you have to be human to own something? So the owner of our moon could perhaps be some random cell in the oldest living organism. Once again I find myself thinking about how we as humans claim something because what if between any form of proof or witness and a  human walking around an alien passes over our galaxy and simply calls it his own because he would say that he is more powerful that a human. But this is a lot how we are when saying that we are superior over plants, animals, or even aliens themselves. In conclusion I think the word ownership can&#39;t be technically used until we know for sure that the human is the most superior being of all.

Saying that nobody can own something doesn&#39;t really prevent people from fighting over it. If I go to the moon and build a house there, you can say that I don&#39;t legally own it, and someone else came to the moon and wanted to live there, stating that they have just as much right because I don&#39;t legally own it, well they can&#39;t legally kick me out either. So what&#39;s the solution? How does asserting that neither of us own it prevent or resolve this conflict? It doesn&#39;t, all it does is make it so that there is no higher authority to pass judgement and leaves it to us to settle it with our fists (or whatever).<br><br>Sounds silly, but it&#39;s not really far fetched. Imagine if a nation builds an outpost on the moon for experiments and stuff, similar to a space station. And some other nation decides that they want access to it because the first nation doesn&#39;t own it. Now what? Does the first nation have to allow full access to every other nation? Who says?<br><br>Further, if anything we put into space remains the property of whoever put it there, then what about structures put on the moon? There&#39;s not really any raw materials on the moon to build them from, which means that any structure put there is technically an object placed there, so even if you can&#39;t own the land on the moon, you would still own the structure you put on it. So what happens when you own a building, but everyone has equal rights to the land under the building? Are they allowed to move your building? Or dig out under it? While they&#39;re digging out under it, can you be there shoveling it back in?

The Moon is now beginning to turn Red where I am in London, UK <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks8WH3xUo_E&amp;t=02m42s\">02:42</a> GMT, and I am taking this a sign to deliver it now.<br><br>The Blood-Red Moon is symbolic. It represents the Moon (the Unconscious) becoming Fire-Red (Active) and the beginning of Change (13). The following chanelling was received in a state of mystical union with the higher intelligence during a 3 day spiritual-shamanic experience. It could be said I \u201cclimbed a mountain\u201d to receive a teaching from God. Important knowledge of the mystical truths to activate higher power and change oneself has been made available for all to use. In particular, the meanings of the numbers have been revealed.<br><br>Freedom<br><br>The battle is with nature. The DNA code is what programmes us. This is fixed but epigenetics has shown this does not stop us changing how it is expressed. By physically adding or removing molecules from the DNA code it is possible to change its expression and gain complete control over one&#39;s programming. This is the goal of all evolution of life - for the DNA code to become self-aware and realise it can change itself.<br><br>How do we change? First we understand the implications. We have complete freedom to determine our personality and unconscious behaviour patterns, what gives us pleasure, what causes us pain, sexuality etc etc. We have the potential for complete mastery over our biology - for example to no longer attach pleasure to harmful behaviours. The only thing stopping us is people telling us we can&#39;t, and it&#39;s about time they got told to shut up. In fairness, they are only worried we will abuse this freedom (though also they secretly regret not succeeding themselves, and are too ashamed to admit their shame).<br><br>But that&#39;s okay now, because THE RULES are now known. Hobbes says, and I think he may be referencing another: &quot;every man that hath attained to the use of reason, is supposed to know, he ought not to do to another, what he would not have done to himself.&quot; In other words we must not programme ourselves to take pleasure from actions that cause pain to others, either directly or indirectly. Here the bee archetype comes in handy, to understand we must always be mindful of the group, and how our actions affect each other member. For example, don&#39;t say or think bad things about people, unless you intend to help them to change. Ultimately, we want everyone to be happy. Really, THE RULES are common sense, self-evident, intuitively obvious, which is why Kant has made the motto of enlightenment: Sapere aude! - Have the courage to use your own understanding (and not that of another).<br><br>Now that the rules are known, how do we change? The short answer is, unfortunately, work, and this is why so many people are turned off already. First, there is the work required to learn the rules, and all the subtleties involved. This is done by reading the relevant material, but more importantly, THINKING ABOUT THE RULES (introspection). The other work that needs doing in this struggle to change one&#39;s biology is self-discipline work to have the strength to tame the body and mind, and have the willpower to tell them what to do. Meditate, etc. The Harvard studies say these practices make your brain better, because they do.<br><br>Fortunately, if you want to be smart there is a trick to make things easier. Remember I was saying we can reprogram what gives us pleasure and what causes us pain? What if we reprogram ourselves to attach pleasure to useful behaviours, such as work, for example to make thinking about the rules as pleasurable as sex... then we&#39;ll want to work all the time, and we&#39;ll reach the stars in no time! Again I should stress the importance of strength training to do this initial reprogramming work.<br><br>Alice Bailey describing Meditation in &quot;From Intellect to Intuition&quot;<br><br>&quot;Be concentrated in all that you do all day every day. Concentration will be rapidly developed if we cultivate the habit of accuracy in all the affairs of life. Accurate speech should necessitate accurate attention to that which is said, read or heard, and this would necessarily involve concentration and so develop it. True meditation is after all an attitude of mind and will grow out of an attitude of concentration.<br><br>The objective, therefore, of all our endeavor is to train the mind so as to make it our servant and not our master, and to cultivate the power of concentration preparatory to true meditation work. The earnest student, therefore, will carry this close attention into the affairs of everyday life and will thereby learn to regulate his mind as an apparatus for his thought.<br>Let me emphasize here the necessity of a constantly concentrated attitude to life. The secret of success can be expressed in the simple words: Pay attention. In talking to people, in reading a book, in writing a letter, let us steadily focus our thought on what we are doing and so gradually develop the capacity to concentrate.<br><br>Power<br><br>If freedom means we have the ability to change the DNA code, power is what we use to change it, in ourselves, and in others. Use of power physically adds and removes molecules from the DNA code, which translates into who we are and what we are like. If used wisely, power can be used to upgrade the DNA code, most importantly in oneself, and then in others. Often we see power being used unwisely.<br><br>How do we change? First we understand THE RULES which I repeat because they are important. To be able to change the code means you must change it in the right way and for this you must know what you want the code to become. Jung states the Goal to be the development of personality, defined as &quot;the complete realization of our whole being&quot;. Power must be used in a direction. &quot;Therefore Meister Eckhart says, &quot;God is not good, or else he could be better&quot;&quot;, to which I say which Way is up? Prophet Mohammed about The Bee in the Qu&#39;ran at 16:9 says &quot;And Allah&#39;s is the direction of the Way&quot; and Lao Tzu says &quot;can you embrace the Ummah (arabic for &quot;the Hive&quot;) with your soul, and never depart from the Way? And so we see that &quot;God&quot;, &quot;Allah&quot;, and &quot;the Way&quot; are synonyms and identical to THE RULES. In Plato&#39;s dialogue Glaucon states to Socrates that the common Good is &quot;enjoyment or pleasure, so long as pleasure brings no harm and its only result is the enjoyment it brings&quot;, making Socrates realise our intuition does know the answer all along!<br><br>Now that the rules are known, how do we use power? By using language symbols (words) like &quot;sharp intellect&quot; and &quot;smooth intuition&quot; and visual symbols (pictures) like (1) and (2), we can learn which symbols refer to which ideas and understand their meaning. By learning the meanings of symbols we can understand the ideas to which they refer. Once we understand the meaning of a symbol we can use it to consciously manipulate the subconscious mind, which in turn informs the conscious mind of what to do. In order to break free from being manipulated by symbols and instead start using symbols to manipulate, we must learn to understand the meanings of the ideas to which the symbols refer. Each symbol has a meaning that refers to the idea we must learn to understand. Knowledge of symbols is power.<br><br>Fortunately, there are certain symbols that have extra powerful meanings which if you learn will make all this very easy. In particular, it can be seen that symbols often come in pairs. There is one important pair of symbols whose meaning is very important to understand and this is between the Feminine and Masculine, Yin and Yang, Water and Fire. Once we understand what the meaning of these symbols are they combine forces and the smooth crystal meets the sharp flint and sparks a light that can be used to see in the dark; metaphorically speaking; the right-brain and left-brain fuse and work together in harmony.

The first point to be examined is: are they really two words or do they only appear as two words? Are they separate from each other with distinct cut-off points separating them or are they just one word without distinct cut-off points?\u00a0 Do they have an independent existence or do they not? Do they possess a natural meaning or is the meaning derived? Close observation would reveal that cut-off points are absent in life, in this manifestation called world. \u00a0Where is the separation between the \u2018Soul\u2019 and the \u2018Body\u2019? Where is the cut-off point between the \u2018Mind\u2019 and the \u2018Body\u2019? Where is the cut-off point between the different parts of the body?\u00a0 All separation is therefore purely imaginary rather than real. Everything and everyone is connected to one another. Even the word \u2018connected\u2019 is misleading, for it is impossible to determine any realistic connecting points! Life is a singular, miraculous manifestation.<br>\u00a0<br>One could choose from the library, dictionary, or from spiritual vocabulary as many meanings as you wish for the words \u2018light\u2019 and \u2018darkness\u2019 and have your ego entangled in literary mesh. But what good would that do to man? Would man be free of agony? Would man be in Bliss? Would man stop arguing, criticizing and accusing his species? Would man be bathed in love or would man be jealous of another who has one more meaning to these two words than he? Man has mastered all such meanings and more would be added as time goes by. This happens just to let man know that he would remain the same: sad, filled with doubts and trust being nowhere within sight.<br>Hence all meanings (commercial, spiritual or secular) attributed to these two words \u2018Light\u2019 and \u2018Darkness\u2019 is relative rather than absolute. More importantly, who is to decide which one of these meanings is real? The various meanings just add spice to the manifestation. The meanings are there just to tickle the ego\u2019s fancy, generate discussions, form theories, build philosophies and construct dogmas that keep man in bondage rather than freedom. Freedom is freedom from words and their meaning for, as yet, no word or meaning has ever liberated man from the shackles of misery or sadness. How could they, for their very presence is the cause of discontent? Discontent, for words project incomplete meaning but the mind believes it to be complete!<br>\u00a0<br>Therefore, in this exposition, a deeper understanding of these two words \u2018Light\u2019 and \u2018Darkness\u2019 would be shared rather than contributing more meaningless meanings to them. It is important to realize that all meanings to these two words are necessary only to understand that they are not necessary to relieve man from the grip of duality. So, what could light be? Has man ever seen light that he could either talk or write \u2018about\u2019 it? Could light be seen? What man is able to see is just reflected light and not pure light! If the mind has a thought of pure light, only then would it be in a position to expound it. If the mind has a thought of pure light, would it be pure, for pure light, realistically, would be the absence of total darkness?\u00a0 Total darkness is not only the absence of light, but also the absence of the presence of absence of light. So if the mind talks about pure light it only means that it has recognized and acknowledged, non-verbally, the presence of darkness! And if darkness has been admitted, would the description of light be independent of darkness? Certainly not would be the obvious conclusion. \u00a0Hence, it is not possible for the mind to talk about pure light or write about it. More importantly, since the mind is absent in the \u2018present\u2019, it could never ever experience pure light, for pure light is in the \u2018NOW\u2019 and not in the past!<br>\u00a0<br>Next, if light is all there is in life, how could darkness exist at all? If darkness is absence of light, how could it be possible for anyone to see it, for man would need light to see? If light is required to see darkness, where could the cut-off point be between light and darkness? Has man been able to determine where exactly the two are separate from each other? If they are not separate, then it would only mean that light and darkness are one and not two.<br>\u00a0<br>Darkness is nothing but intense light that the eyes cannot catch. Man\u2019s visual faculty is limited as are the rest of his mental concepts of senses. The mind is able to appreciate only the absence of different wave-lengths of light and is unable to recognize wave- lengths of light beyond a certain spectrum. The inability to appreciate light is experienced by man as darkness. Light that man experiences is therefore darkness that the eyes can catch and darkness is intense light that the eyes cannot catch. This is paradoxical - and so is life! If darkness were real then even animals would not be able to see. But it is well known that certain species of the animal kingdom roam around in utter darkness in total freedom. It is important to realize that life begins in darkness rather than light! The seed sprouts from the darkness within the seed under the ground. The sperm fertilizes the ova in the darkness of the reproductive system. Eggs hatch within the darkness of the eggshell. Life begins in darkness, for darkness is light!<br>\u00a0<br>Hence man must understand that there is nothing called darkness as an absolute entity or anything called light as an absolute entity that the mind could experience. Life is jointly light and darkness with all their meanings stuck to it. Freedom from these labels is pure light: light that cannot be seen, thought of, or written \u2018about\u2019; darkness that cannot be seen, thought of, or written \u2018about\u2019!", "comment_date": "2015-07-22T18:11:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheDroidBay", "comment_text": "2015 Humans?

Again, I may have misunderstood but the bit I have to argue against is the notion that touching moon dust or cast off material that found its way to earth counts as touching the moon. If that were the case, than finding gold in a stream would automatically give the finder sole ownership rights over the undiscovered veins that it came from. The act of breathing would give one ownership over the plants that made the oxygen in every breath. No, you need to be able to physically and in person touch, harvest, and/or build upon a piece of space land to be able to lay claim to it, and even then there will have to be limits to how much space land you can claim based on a single contact point. What I mean is, following those guidelines, the US has already done enough to be able to lay claim to the moon, but even with our moon landings, touching down on a finite area should not grant sovereignty over the entirety of the moon. It&#39;s just too big.

Finally the idea of the Outer Space Treaty was that every satellite or spaceship that were put in the space was from whoever put it first, as well as whatever moon or planet were conquered was property of whoever get there first, and there are just 4 countries with the tecnology to do that: USA, UK, Russia (Depositary countries of the Outer Space Treaty) and recently India.", "comment_date": "2015-07-10T20:08:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pm Nuker", "comment_text": "You have made this video ...

This would mean that both treaties could someday be considered binding. The whole thing is (pardon the pun) rather nebulous, but it&#39;s interesting!<br><br>Also, regarding a state&#39;s use of universal jurisdiction to legally support a personal claim to lunar title, you&#39;re overcomplicating things! There are other types of prescriptive jurisdiction that would be more feasible/relevant. For example, if someone were to claim title on the moon, they could appeal to their home state(s), giving the state jurisdiction due to nationality. Universal jurisdiction is when a state gets involved in an issue they have no connection to. The concept is super controversial, and like you said, it&#39;s usually only accepted in case of serious violations of international humanitarian law, like genocide or war crimes.\u00a0<br><br>Regardless, if a state did try to colonize the moon, it&#39;s likely the issue would become international somehow. Precedents don&#39;t have the same role in international law as they do in common law systems, but if a state let its citizen set up shop on the moon, it&#39;s probable another state would bring it forward to the International Court of Justice or a similar dispute settlement body. I&#39;d imagine the case would probably involve one state claiming the Outer Space Treaty as binding customary international law and the moon-colonizing state to be in breach of it.<br><br><br>Also, re: the moon as the &quot;common heritage of mankind&quot; - it is weird, mostly because each example has its own context. The high seas qualify so that no country will try to monopolize the entire ocean. The Antarctic Treaty System is super complicated, but rather static due to lack of resources. On the other hand, recent claims to the Arctic for oil mean that the issue is heating up rather quickly, no pun intended.\u00a0<br><br><br>The thing about international law is that it&#39;s really anarchic, and there are few hard rules besides existing treaties. If someone did try to colonize the moon, or shot and ate an alien that landed in their backyard, the issue would probably be adjudicated after the fact to develop a rule. The fact we don&#39;t know what would happen is actually kind of normal for international law.

However Earth government dispute it and challenged the idea. This led to an all out war and long political feud between Earth govt and space born people who felt that they no longer have connection to Earth.<br><br>Long story short, after almost 100 years of back and forth (either war or political feud) the spacenoids won and gained their independence. This bring up an interesting question: The video above talked about how space is human heritage and can be used by everyone, including the meteorites, moons and planets. But it&#39;s because in our current state we still in early technology phase that still limit us in our space exploration ability and require collaborative work with several countries. But say, several hundreds year later our technology reached a level where convenience space travel and colonization is a common thing like daily commercial flights. Will the idea change?\u00a0<br><br>I mean we can look back at history as well. Before North America (above Mexico and below Canada) become US of A it&#39;s still under British rule. Let say that the British represent Earth and America is the space. As America become well populated the population felt that they are quite burdened and constrained by the law and tax from Britain rulers and demanded independence. I can see the scenario repeat itself when space colonists are numerous enough they can have their own resource and firepower to declare independence from Earth government.\u00a0<br><br>So what do you think?
