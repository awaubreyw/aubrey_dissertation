Despite understanding we are the cause of a mass extinction emergency, except for the noble efforts of a few people and organizations, no meaningful and coordinated global action is being taken to reverse the process. A few years ago, the United Nations Environmental Program published the results of a multi-year study that concluded Mankind is responsible for causing the extinction of between 150 and 200 species every 24 hours- yes, 150 to 200. Change will not happen until such point in time as we realize that our own extinction is imminent, but by then it will be too late. Take Donald Trump.

It&#39;s just an expression of the fundamental laws of the universe, perhaps set by some higher dimensional force or being, or maybe just a random occurrence. All life is just a mass of particles seeking to increase their entropy levels. Think about it. It seems only natural that if the universe tends towards dissipating all energy into pure equilibrium, that little machines like us would evolve on planets orbiting stars that increase the rate of entropy. We will become complex to a point where we convert all energy into pure heat. We have an innate desire to reproduce to make more of these machines. Most of us wish to protect life, to increase entropy further. We also seek more food to convert the chemical energy to kinetic and heat energy. The universe is suicidal. It wishes to finish as quick as possible. <br><br>We, as part of it, do everything we do in order to carry out its desire. It is not an animate desire but one formed as a product of the arbitrary laws it plays by. If we are indeed alone in the cosmos, I believe we should all live the best possible lives we can. We should expand. We should leave a mark. Make sure we don&#39;t die out in vain. Turn the universe into one giant canvas. Yield to an inexorable fate. Be beautiful. Live long. Help others live long. Don&#39;t discriminate within your own species; we are more alike than different. Support all other living beings.

As we study and document and place these observations into defining strata that summarize each representatives qualities, we begin to see not only similarities and differences, but relative importances. We have to at some point ask the question: if we clear the land to the point that we can grow food to sustain us, at some point the land that we clear is altered and the previous inhabitants of that land must suffer, starve, relocate or die. At some point we clear out predators that might harm us or our offspring and with no predators, prey populations inflate to the point that their land can no longer support them and we must assume the role of the predator that we cleared out. Or, we can watch that species overpopulate and eventually starve. But we had set it in motion and it was for the sake of our loved ones. We can&#39;t honestly have our cake and eat it too. Something, somewhere will always have to suffer and die regardless of what we do or don&#39;t do. That&#39;s an unfortunate fact. To deny it is to ignore everything we&#39;ve learned about nature. The only true morality will turn out to be that we must do what we must to survive and provide for our children. In our hearts we all know this is what the ultimate moral code is based on. But only man has the capacity and the curse of seeing both and feeling the haunting acknowledgement of both realities. The only other thing possible is to eliminate ourselves from the equation, but in reality, we all know that that is not going to happen.", "comment_date": "2016-11-06T03:47:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luna", "comment_text": "RIP in piece", "comment_date": "2016-11-06T03:47:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheGamekid01", "comment_text": "god I hope he never dies", "comment_date": "2016-11-06T03:46:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DragonBornGirl", "comment_text": "how could anyone dislike this ??
