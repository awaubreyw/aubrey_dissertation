God bless, share the gospel and put God first. i hope you have a nice week. Jesus isn&#39;t just someone who is divine, full of grace, and someone who can free you of all sin and death. He can also free you of depression, tears, sadness, and of a life that isn&#39;t great or fulfilling. I have found that in Christ, a happy, fulfilling, holy, and a better life. Many others have as well,  and I hope you do too. Jesus loves you so much that He died for you on the cross, taking your sin and death that once was hard to take back. Jesus forgives you of your sins and helps you to repent, and leads you into salvation which is given by the cross to accept the reward of Heaven, Jesus&#39;s Kingdom. We cannot earn it nor work for it, if you believe in the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, you will be saved. To be saved means to be saved from God himself, God&#39;s wrath lies on those who do not believe and rebel, joining the world in its evil deeds and practices. Jesus rose from the dead, showing the people that if He could conquer death, you can too. Heaven is where you conquer death. True salvation requires sacrifice, but in the end it is worth it. A life is never the same when Jesus impacts it. We are punishable by death by sin, but if you would say to the Lord, &quot;forgive me, help me to repent and sin no more and live a life for you&quot; we would do better, be better, and repent and be saved by Jesus Himself. Jesus is King, and &quot;I can do all things with Christ who strengthens me.&quot; -Phil <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VztSdwYPFCE&amp;t=4m13s\">4:13</a>. God bless you.

How is that true, that doesn&#39;t even make sense..  We&#39;re not talking about executable files here (which is instructions / opcodes, and data for those instructions to manipulate or possibly just instructions).  Media files <i>obviously</i> contain information for displaying the text or picture or whatever, that&#39;s the point of saving the file..  Then when you choose to access the file from the hard drive again, the processor transfers it to the video card so it (the video card) can do the work.  <br><br>Look at a simple text file for example (same concept as a video, it&#39;s still a file with information to display on the screen). The hard drive contains the 8 bit ASCII patterns for every character in the text file.  Say you create a text file and save it to the hard drive and it&#39;s 100 characters long.  Those 100 characters (meaning the 8 bit ASCII patterns) are now stored at a contiguous (or fragmented) location on the hard drive, 100 bytes.  Say you request to see that file.  Now the processor runs a program that transfers that file (100 bytes) into the video card memory so it can be converted to output on the screen for us to view.<br><br>Anyway, my point is, the hard drive does store information about the files, even though they aren&#39;t pictures as we see them (obviously) but instead as the language the computer &quot;understands&quot; (higher voltage levels being 1s, and lower being 0s).  For example, that 8 bit ascii pattern stored on the hard drive doesn&#39;t look like an &#39;A&#39; to us, but it&#39;s whats needed for the computer to in effect show the text file after triggering the right things.

Since we would not have the same parents or even the same genetic code since there are soooo many possibilities which we could be genetically coded.

Vsauce? Fifty generations? I thought the people that wandered out of Africa first, aka the original Europeans and Asians, bred with Neanderthals 40,000 - 10,000 BC. Original Africans didn&#39;t, and they still don&#39;t share this piece of DNA. Thus, Africans and Indo-Europeans can&#39;t have bred with each other for at least 42,000 - 12,000 years. A generation typically lasts maybe 18 - 30 years. That leaves me with up to 2,000 generations between Africans and Indo-Europeans.<br>\u00a0 You maybe forgot about Epigenetics too. Genes above DNA that is. Still, humans share a lot of DNA and I don&#39;t want to sound like I am some kind of racist. Race is just a word without much scientific meaning. Jews, especially, are not a race. They&#39;ve just been for about 6,000 years in comparison. I don&#39;t think Caucasians nor Asians came to be over night, still.<br><br>PS - I precisely read a page on modern science that put the extinction of the Neanderthals to 40,000 - 39,000 years ago, which means there is at least more difference between human races than races of dogs, even though they have much shorter generations.

And in theory, the same elementary particles that made us when we were born are still inside of us (or at least most of them are) because even though the atoms are being destroyed and created, the particles are simply being rearranged (the quarks from two neutrons can go to make a proton).", "comment_date": "2014-05-03T15:33:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Asterisk", "comment_text": "So...you mean that I am at most 50 generations away from being cousins.....with everyone on earth........", "comment_date": "2014-05-03T15:09:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack K", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VztSdwYPFCE&amp;t=2m05s\">2:05</a> i see what you did there :D", "comment_date": "2014-05-03T15:05:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shelby See", "comment_text": "I thought even digital copies still\u00a0can degrade or have some type of generation loss.

They lack morals, character, and honesty. They defile the present and destroy the future. In case you can&#39;t tell, I&#39;m talking about Michael here. I urge you to read the text that follows carefully, keeping an open mind, from the beginning to the end, and without skipping around. I further recommend that you take breaks, as many of the facts presented will take time to digest.<br><br>Michael&#39;s apologists doubtlessly don&#39;t want us to prevent the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of loosely regulated markets from becoming an \u201cinvisible fist\u201d that lets Michael effortlessly pound his castigators into oblivion. That&#39;d be too much of a threat to paternalism, presenteeism, and all of the other deluded things they worship. Clearly, they prefer carrying our once-proud nation deeper into savagery and depravity. Before explaining why primitive antagonists cause insurmountable trouble for us, I must first point out that the emperor has no clothes on. As a matter of fact, he has gotten carried away with acquiring public acceptance of his boisterous activities. It&#39;s pretty clear from this lack of restraint that he would abrogate some of our most fundamental freedoms, all at the drop of a hat. It&#39;s therefore imperative that we invigorate the effort to reach solutions by increasing the scope of the inquiry rather than by narrowing or abandoning it, as doing so will let Michael know that he is extraordinarily brazen. We&#39;ve all known that for a long time. However, Michael&#39;s willingness to make serious dialogue difficult or impossible sets a new world record for brazenness.<br><br>As fickle as Michael&#39;s zingers are, when Michael stated that squalid clowns aren&#39;t ever sneaky, I concluded that he was totally impractical. Now that he claims that his flock consists entirely of lovable, cuddly people who would never dream of consigning our traditional values to the rubbish heap of sexism, I allege that he&#39;s crossed the line into post-rationalist neo-Hegelianism. He wants to produce an army of mindless insects who will obey his every command. To produce such an army, Michael plans to destroy people&#39;s minds using either drugs or an advanced form of lobotomy. Whichever approach he takes, before he initiated a nihilism flap to help promote his cranky utterances, people everywhere were expected to strengthen our roots so we can weather the storms that threaten our foundation. Nowadays, it&#39;s the rare person indeed who realizes that his dupes remain largely silent when asked about the correlative connecting him to egoism. The rare times they do deign to comment they invariably skew the issue to prevent people from realizing that Michael&#39;s ballyhoos cannot stand on their own merit. That&#39;s why they&#39;re dependent on elaborate artifices and explanatory stories to convince us that Michael&#39;s blessing is the equivalent of a papal imprimatur. Michael&#39;s working towards the day when he (and only he) can dictate what you may say, whom you may know, where you may live, and how you may behave.

But here are here are some interesting counter perspective because your point is a bit nihilistic to my taste. True, we are instances of life, a mere information than material, insignificant pieces of the universe experiences itself and assembles matter in an encoded genetic program. But, due to genetic variation, as a species, our own identity remains in our signature trait. None of your ancestors can do what you or I can do. Having genotypic variation is like having a monogrammed iPhone, you know others have the same device as you do but yours is different and unique, and this paves way to our notable faces, behaviors, life expectancies and the like. So, in a way, we all are sub-species in our own. So, how about identical twins? Don&#39;t they share genetic material? Definitely, but our own self awareness lies in our own neural network and we&#39;re talking about combination of on average 100 billion cells. Among the limitless permutation, only one gives rise to you or anyone else, at least in their current state. Our memories are different which will define us eventually even if we do look alike. Therefore, I find your conclusion to be contradictory to your generalization of forgery.

I understand it&#39;s interesting and theoretical, but everything has a limit. We can&#39;t go on for ever. Or can&#39;t we? Our understanding is limited, we agree that the universe is limited, although there might be unlimited number of them, the speed of light is the limit and even time has a limit, but does existence cease to exist after that? If our understanding is right, do all universes just pop out of existence and there is nothing? I mean, we came out of\u00a0conceivably\u00a0nothing, but if it end it all had to start somewhere, be it a\u00a0multi-verse. Then maybe there are actually no limits? Just maybe existence in itself in a form that is unknown to us, different from our current existence and possible understanding limited by that existence? No matter how\u00a0skeptical\u00a0of the limit of the speed of light I may be, I couldn&#39;t accept something\u00a0coming\u00a0from nothing. Just like axioms in mathematics the world must have an axiom of existence then. Even the theorized big bang started from a concentration of energy and E=MC^2 (though that&#39;s simplified and not really correct). But as humans living in this world in this universe in this existence, we are limited, because we as part of existence can&#39;t escape it all, we can never truly understand how it all works. We would have to be outside this world, beyond nature. In simplified, more known terms, we would have to be GODS, those who control the existence itself, to be able to understand it all. And let&#39;s be honest, that too much of a fiction.<br>Unless we are a simulation run by some intelligent existence and so we have the\u00a0beginning\u00a0of the simulation But then they would need a start too.<br>The world is truly\u00a0amazing,", "comment_date": "2014-04-18T19:45:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Highway", "comment_text": "Vsauce my cousin!<br>lets go bowling", "comment_date": "2014-04-18T19:25:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John McClain", "comment_text": "just voted your at 85%<br><br>\u00a0love you vsauce :P", "comment_date": "2014-04-18T19:25:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WillTell", "comment_text": "Funny that me using not so well known browser, that has trouble with youube HTML5 player, that I can no longer turn off and use just the flash player, that I\u00a0prefer\u00a0because it works much better, made a new tab while reloading and the exiting and just making it look like the video had actually disappeared though it was just in a new tab.

Instead of focusing on the absence of a concrete physical object, we can look at the aesthetic content of the experience itself as the concrete phenomenon - not a simulacrum (pronounced sim-you-lah-crum) but a localized fragment of authenticity itself.

Your videos have an aura about them as well--they evoke the same emotive response as your example of a sweater dropped in dog poo, or allegedly worn by a mass-murderer--perhaps to a lesser degree in most people, but that it happens at all is remarkable, and should tell us something important about the period we live in.<br><br>Originals are only important because we perceive that they are important. This can be seen with interactions with digital media--unfortunately especially digital media which makes us angry like trolling. Digital media is going to become a larger and larger part of our lives as we move forward, and we will, as a species develop stronger emotive relationships with digital things and probably begin to lose some of the emotive relationships we have with parts of the physical world. As we undergo the growth pains associated with the transition into the digital media age, the question of originality is going to become less meaningful as the lines between originals and copies continue to become more and more blurred (hopefully not in relation to plagiarism, but in relation to emotive connections with works of art and other categories of ideas). Some day, perhaps people will actually be able to take a virtual tour through the Louvre which possesses exactly the same ambiance as visiting the museum in person.

A copy makes something more accessible to everything so we don&#39;t have to travel to a far off place to see it.

Real rocks do not grow, they don&#39;t reproduce, they don&#39;t think, they don&#39;t breath, they don&#39;t have any of the scientific traits that define what life is. And family, biologically speaking, is just defined by reproduction. You are family with anyone who comes from the same reproductive gene pool. So you can not possibly be related to something that isn&#39;t even capable of reproduction. Now family can go beyond just the biological definition, like being related to someone who is married to a biological relative or adopting a child. Biologically it doesn&#39;t make any difference but legally you are still related. Then there&#39;s another thing where despite the fact that science and the law does not recognize you as a family, you still feel close enough to that person or people to consider them family.

I don&#39;t think so. Heck our brains are just organic computers anyway. Then you can take things to another level and go about defining an individual at all. Every atom in your body wasn&#39;t there when you were born. The only constant part of you is your memory and that can even fail. So you are not really just one single conceptual identity. Take that even further and you are just a recombination of your parents. So one could say the species is one constant organism. But then you can&#39;t stop there. Species come from other species so all life is the organism and the only constant. But life is definable through chemistry. The atoms that make up &quot;you&quot; are stardust. The universe become consciousness itself. So really we were born with the big bang. The sum total of energy in the universe has been proven through Einstienian physics as a sum total of zero. So the universe was created by splitting nothing into equal and opposite energy values. We will ultimately die when entropy increases to a maximum. The stars WILL all burn out. Its a scientific inevitability. The universe WILL eventually freeze. So what does it matter anyway?
