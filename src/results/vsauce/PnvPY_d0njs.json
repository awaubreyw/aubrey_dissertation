Now, have you ever taken the Lord&#39;s Name in vain? Have you ever hated someone?If you\u2019ve ever done any of those things, you would be either a liar, a thief, an adulterer,(for looking with lust. See Matthew 5:28), a blasphemer(for taking Gods Name in vain), a murderer (for hating someone. See 1 John 3:15) or maybe even all of them. And that was only 5 of the Ten Commandments. Therefore God\u2019s Standard Is Very High. The Bible Even Says That If We\u2019ve Just Broken One Law We\u2019re Guilty Of Breaking Them All. (James 2:10) So we have all sinned against God and  therefore deserve death.(Romans 3:23 &amp; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnvPY_d0njs&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a>)That\u2019s why A Savior Was Sent; Jesus Christ, to die for the sins of The World And Then He Rose On The 3rd Day . Through His Sacrifice He Paid The Fine for our sins, and made Atonement for the sins Of The World. Now we can be made new by accepting The Gift of Salvation. In order to accept This Gift,  we must first Repent. This is a change of mind about sin  (from an embrace of sin to rejection of sin) and a Turning to God. <br>Once you Repent, you can then turn to FAITH/TRUST in the Savior.

We are so busy with our life that we are blind to it&#39;s meaning. Humanity has big problem that is like elephant stomping on everybody that nobody talks about - death. And because there is death life seems meaningless. 10 out of 10 die. Death is our greatest mystery, because most people don&#39;t know what is after and some don&#39;t even care. We are like vapor that shows for a while and then disappears. But there is hope beyond grave. If you are wise enough, you already released that there has to be Almighty Creator. Just look at the blue sky, trees, birds, cute pupies and kittens, complexity of human eye... There is everywhere order in nature, from atom to universe. And even though God has poured out his kindness upon us by giving ears to listen to good music, tongue to enjoy delicious food he created, eyes to see and yet, we still rebel against Him. We all lie, steal, use God&#39;s name as cuss word (blasphemy, very serious), dishonore our parents, we hate each other, Jesus said that if you look lustfully at somebody, you have committed adultery in your heart... We are all guilty before holy God. God is furiously angry at these things, so much that he has given you death sentence - Romans 6:23 &quot;The wages of sin is death...&quot;. That&#39;s why we all die. There is punishment for sin, don&#39;t get fooled. Every sin you have committed, God remembers and he is going to bring it into light at judgment day, and he will make sure that justice is done. But here is the hope I promised you at the beginning. God so loved the world that he send his only begotten Son so that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. Jesus is the Son of God that took your bullet instead of you! He took your sin on himself. Do you want to know how much God is angry at sin? Look at the cross of Jesus Christ. Naked men that is so beaten it is hard to recognize that he is human. He was spat upon and laughed at. And yet, even though he knew you gonna rebel against Him, he still died so you could be forgiven. But it was impossible for death to hold Him because he have never sinned. That&#39;s why Jesus had to rose from death. By his resurrection he proclaimed the victory over sin and death. Over 500 people saw him bodily rosed from death and they where willing to die for what they have seen. But now, God commands every men everywhere to repent. Bible says that without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins, and because Jesus shed his blood you can be forgiven of no matter what sin but you must turn from your sins to God and beg for forgiveness! And you will be saved. Now those who are in Christ can say:  &quot;O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?&quot; (1Cor 15:55). Now get right with God! God is offering you everlasting life! Don&#39;t put it away for later because tomorrow does not must come! Read your bible every day, it&#39;s the word of God! And God will give you new heart and new life and you will be like born again. John 3:3 - Jesus answered and said to him, &#39;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.&#39;", "comment_date": "2022-05-22T18:24:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheJimys7", "comment_text": "\u03a0 more like why?", "comment_date": "2022-05-22T16:26:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Agile Cosine", "comment_text": "Great!", "comment_date": "2022-05-22T15:20:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason G", "comment_text": "What constitutes being an American?, Canadians and Mexicans live on the same continent, America .

Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping you from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T14:24:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Fornera", "comment_text": "You&#39;d love a certain guy named Dante", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T14:14:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "openwide theshutter", "comment_text": "Autists man; they are something else huh", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T14:07:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Holy Cap Water", "comment_text": "without the letter E the red book have a E starting and the initial instructions have a E in the writer name", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T13:37:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kyle Rice", "comment_text": "@Stand-up Maths", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T13:04:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Immortal Sun-kun", "comment_text": "The rightmost book has an \u201cE\u201d right on the cover!", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T12:56:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TorresCopywriting", "comment_text": "Bad poetry", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T12:51:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prem Mhetre", "comment_text": "In the book of Genesis there&#39;s no mention of &quot;Genesis&quot;  <br>Confused wow", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T12:49:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0160imon \u0161aman sk", "comment_text": "Intresting book", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T12:38:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "crisstull tuims", "comment_text": "Learning the beginning of the book is a great way to learn pi", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T12:14:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Branmuffin", "comment_text": "So constrained writing is like if math and English had a baby. \ud83d\ude30 IS NOTHING SACRED", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T12:00:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mitney morrison", "comment_text": "As he holds a book with the world Jos&quot;e&quot;ph in it.\ud83d\ude0f\ud83d\ude44", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:55:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bhavesh Thengadi", "comment_text": "The book of &#39;genesis&#39; has no e on it.<br>Are you sure\ud83d\ude02 what about that title", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:54:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snare Drum", "comment_text": "Not sure how you&#39;d do Adam and eve without the letter &#39;e&#39;", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:45:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prakhar Sharma", "comment_text": "Go and read ramayana \ud83d\ude0e", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:42:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaurav Nagalia", "comment_text": "The word Genesis has two \u201ce\u201d", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:39:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sunday Mourning\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\u200d\u20e0", "comment_text": "Talent shows itself in all sorts of ways!", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:31:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anya Drashan", "comment_text": "Yo even the cover does this with the title and the subheading underneath.", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:23:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrea Musacchio", "comment_text": "Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn is a great example", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:19:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cath Palug", "comment_text": "Now I know what to give my friend for \u03c0 day", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:06:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gladiator Gaming", "comment_text": "That&#39;s funny constrained writing has e in it \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T11:01:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesus Is0urSAVi0r!", "comment_text": "What A waste of time.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions .<br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours.

They hate those who do not participate in any conflicts and have not done anything wrong. You hate those who are already suffering every day because of this conflict.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions .<br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word, the holy bible. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019 .", "comment_date": "2022-03-10T04:35:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SDM Jake", "comment_text": "You are an amazing reader", "comment_date": "2022-03-10T04:25:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul AllPro", "comment_text": "Didnt know this was a thing", "comment_date": "2022-03-10T04:19:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B*U*E", "comment_text": "Oh", "comment_date": "2022-03-10T04:09:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "water foker", "comment_text": "If it weren&#39;t for the internet, this nerd would&#39;ve been lynched", "comment_date": "2022-03-10T03:51:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A T", "comment_text": "But *why*?
