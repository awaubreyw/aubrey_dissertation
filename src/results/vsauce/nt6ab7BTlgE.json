Wake up WORLD!! Armageddon is upon Us. WATCH to the WEST for it will hit the Pacific Ocean and it will rock up and down the Pacific FIRE RING and it will send lava to the Skies when it does. It will rain fire over 2/3rd&#39;s of this planet! If you live anywhere near the Pacific, you need to move now!

A sufficiently intelligent species would probably make sure they had total control over our awareness of them, and then keep their presence hidden most or all of the time. The aliens are probably already here. They&#39;re either programming us slowly into a passive acceptance of them and have a big reveal planned; or, they&#39;re completing their agenda under our noses and plan on leaving without us ever knowing they were here.

Travelling to even the nearest star would take years. And who says that it is actually possible to create propulsion systems that can reach a considerable fraction of light speed? And even if they can reach 20 percent light speed, proxima centauri would need 22.5 years to get there. 22.5 years of living in an enclosed capsule with the need to bring either all the food oder to create techniques to make plants grow. And this is the nearest star. Everything else would get into the &quot;hundreds of years&quot; and it would need individuals to breed and to teach their children how to fly the space craft. Who would want to live his entire life on a tin capsule in space? And it would need generations of them. 1000 years of space travel like 30 generations or so? So probably it&#39;s not a paradox at all but just a simple consequence of the vast distances of the universe that it is not common to be visitied. Maybe in another part it already happened because by chance two planets with intelligent life were not so far away from each other?

Many years ago I used to trade small pieces of bread for acorns with my local squirrel scurry.  I would sit on the porch and throw out a couple pieces. After many weeks the squirrels would come closer and closer.  They would wait for me to throw the bread. When I didn&#39;t have any bread for a couple days, one of them got the idea to bring an acorn about five feet away and left it, ran away. Then brought another one and left it also.

In south America, for example, there is a group of humans preserved in relative isolation. Anthropologists studying them have found that although they have simple bartering systems, they don&#39;t take it as far as the rest of the world. To try and teach them how one item can be worth two of another item the Anthropologist tried to &quot;buy&quot; the chief&#39;s hammok to which he replyed, &quot;Where would I sleep?&quot;. To them, valuation of goods is related to usefulness. All the raw materials of the Earth are useless if you have no where to live.<br><br>Other groups of humans at least had differing concepts of valuation. Native American tribes didn&#39;t lack a concept of ownership as commonly believed, but instead there was an idea about &quot;hunting rights&quot;. In many tribes you can trade for the right to hunt and fish on land, but that wasn&#39;t considered a transfer of ownership. It was closer to a concept of rent.<br><br>The fact that humans have demonstrated various ways of approaching the valuation of goods implies that it&#39;s not a universal truth. Even between similar ideals of valuation there is no way of knowing if anyone would agree to the same value. Oxygen is, for example, a very deadly gas. If an alien race can&#39;t tolerate an oxygen rich atmosphere they would value the Earth along the same lines as a human might value sea of sulfuric acid. Even if the materials are of value, if they have to go through additional measures to extract it that will also decrease the potential value.", "comment_date": "2014-10-01T04:18:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chaoticsinosoidalorderunitproducts", "comment_text": "It bothers me that you&#39;d say The History Channel and others as having quoted the price of the Earth, as less than some voting blocs GDP.

To me it makes sense that we havent been visited. Here are my reasons why.1 We are new comers, if alien life has observed us ( i give a 1/10 chance they have) they would likely realize that we arent yet to there level of advancement an would likely simply study us and make sure we don&#39;t destroy ourselves. Why would they want to make themselves apparent and risk us destroying our selves in fear of the unknown like we always do. 2 there is a ratio of 1.6 planets to each star, there are 3x 10e11 stars in the milky way. that means there are about half a tril planets in our galaxy. With a loose base equation which suggests life per planet has a 1/2000-1/5000 chance of emerging based on the time it took for life to appear on earth &gt;5xe10 9. the odds of a species stumbling across our planet is low. 3 People often say aliens would try to kill us or harm us for earths resources or whatever. I say why? Earth would be shit to mine, you would have to release an expenditure of energy to overcome gravity everytime you got a new payload. Asteroids don&#39;t have high gravity but have enough that you can move heavy masses with great ease. We must also ask why would a species want to destroy another that can offer them nothing but help in the future. We must ask ourselves what we would do if we stumbled on a less advanced species...We would probably leave it alone and maybe study it from a distance for a bit but generally leave it alone, we might even lend it aid if an asteroid or other event threatened its survival. Aliens would have far more to gain from studying us from a distance and protecting our future. You may not agree with me but it does seem REALLY reasonable to me that aliens would not make themselves apparent or maybe just would not have stumbled across us...", "comment_date": "2014-09-21T22:47:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baconlovar", "comment_text": "Farting will never be the same", "comment_date": "2014-09-21T21:24:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Flores", "comment_text": "why do we all have 2 eyes counting the animals??", "comment_date": "2014-09-21T21:04:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob Gutteridge", "comment_text": "What if WE are the aliens that want to buy all the other planets?

But the whole minecraft world 1,265,963,898 Years! If it was earth it only takes 200 quadrillion years! Question is how much its worth! Due to infinite resource minecraft cant run out! One minecraft blocks weight is determined by mass multiply by value! One world can store 40 mb! About 240 million megabytes! Memory worth about $4.8 trillion dollars! The Internet $14.3 trillion dollars! Minecraft \u00a0games $20 that about $700,000,000 dollars! So I final question how much is minecraft world is worth due to diamonds, gold, etc worth! Well lets see! Despite mass Earth is only $5 quadrillion! If minecraft was like a planet! It would be worth over a whopping $50,235,478,806,907,378 DOLLARS!

Great video as always but I see some quintessential and unequivocal contradictions in the statements that you&#39;re trying to assert here. A true worth of a typical item, say gold, is it&#39;s material value for whatever use it might have. And you clearly tried to distinguish that an item without a price-tag that can be bartered with superior intelligence because material goods are the only valuables we can offer. But in other sense, we all claim our own self-proclaimed worth because as species adept with millennia of tool-making, till the present day that is, we set our values through the quality we add to the basic materials such as enabling gold to be a supercondutor or making a stable radioactive element. You have to take into account that technology has grown thus far because of the combined inputs of like-minded individuals and coherent efforts summed up over a course of the entire human history however inferior it might seems and the fact that we do not own earth, even more, we might not be the fruits from the loins of the planet at all, rather are festering petulance vindicated for being nuance which I can accept. But aren&#39;t all civilized beings criticized like that in their own planets in general elsewhere in the universe? As divided communities of a single species, self-actualization and the urge to instigate and explore requires certain repercussions, which if left unchecked might have catastrophic planetary effects. Disagreements would have devastating actions when attempting to inspire beliefs, imbue way of life and settle differences, which could be the reason why we were not discovered by other intelligent life form.

I mean if you think about it, if you&#39;re an alien who can travel faster then the speed of light or at least figure out a way around that like warp drives etc then finding some backwater planet full of people who aren&#39;t as intellectually superior as you are would kind of be pointless. Sure it&#39;d be fascinating to see a new species but if we&#39;re talking about creatures who&#39;ve done it over and over again then finding the 100 thousandth planet full of a sentient species that is mostly still arguing over bronze age mythology instead of working on warp engines would kind of get old. The only thing you&#39;d care about is resources (and if you can travel the universe you have soooooo many planets to choose from instead of just earth for resources) and other sentient species with your level of intellect because they could combine with your culture and all the other space faring cultures etc making your mega-multispecies superculture even more stronger. At our current point in time we&#39;re just not there yet. Sure we&#39;re getting there but in the mean time just like in Star Trek you gotta leave them primitives to sorting out themselves instead of interfering. Or maybe intergalatic travel is not possible so that&#39;s the reason why we haven&#39;t met aliens. Sigh :(. Guess we&#39;ll never find out anytime soon. A shame though. It&#39;d be awesome speeding across the galaxy in a warp drive space ship. It just makes you wonder the sheer number of possible species that could be out there just like us.

We are absolutely unique. There is no one else out there just like us. We aren&#39;t finger print unique, we are absolute in our uniqueness. \u00a0The reason that has come up before for me was in debates about life existing somewhere out there in the universe and how one tries to define life. \u00a0Europa may have life (I think it should), but not anything that looks like us. \u00a0There is a disconnect because people tend to connote one with the other and then they get confused. Like it was stated in this video, we did not shape our planet, but our planet shaped us. Who I am right now, doing what I am doing right now, is a consequence of the ballad danced by the atoms and molecules since the big bang that led to the environmental pressures to make me who I am doing what I am doing. As I once mentioned in a conversation, if there was a galaxy out there that was exactly like ours, with the stars and planets and debris scattered throughout just as it is in ours, with the same development time and age as ours, then the odds of there being a me in that galaxy typing the words I am saying right now goes up very quick, because we are nothing more than the product of those reactions. In essence, it is like baking a cake. If I do everything the same for two different cakes, the odds of the cakes coming out exactly the same goes up. \u00a0Just simply chemistry. \u00a0Our uniqueness is amazing, and allows us to say that there is no one like us anywhere else in the universe...most likely. There definitely is intelligent life and definitely life out there, but it will not look anything like anything found on our Earth. \u00a0Because of that...we may be nothing more than a zoo to some intelligent life out there. \u00a0Just like the giraffe does not know it is in a zoo, we may not know we are in one too. We do have greater intelligence than a giraffe, but the reality is not that we are smart, but that we are smarter than a giraffe and if intelligent life is out there (and it definitely should be) then they are probably smarter than us to have space travel that we are yet to discover. \u00a0We can obviously cage the giraffe, chain it and bind it and make it know and feel that it is nothing better than a captive of ours, but whats the fun in that, we want to see them being themselves and for all we know we have the same role for any species smarter than us. \u00a0As such I find it fascinating how we are so grand in how tiny we are and how tiny we are in all of our grandeur. \u00a0We are both meaningful and meaningless and to me that makes us all uniquely great. We are nothing more than &quot;a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam&quot; yet we are an especially unique mote of dust.", "comment_date": "2014-08-31T07:47:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wenseslao", "comment_text": "O yea,, let&#39;s see how good you survive into space.", "comment_date": "2014-08-31T07:32:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Merchaun", "comment_text": "Or you could put an apple logo on Earth and make it worth double the current edtimated amount.", "comment_date": "2014-08-31T07:08:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kayla De Nae", "comment_text": "What if we were the descendants of aliens that were exiled from a more technologically advanced planet and left here to fend for ourselves ages ago?", "comment_date": "2014-08-31T06:53:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Raymond Stantz Ph.

Clearly this is just silly, and runs us into problems similar to what we had with classifying planets when it came to Pluto.<br><br>Perhaps a better definition would come with the requirement that the orbiting body has enough mass that it has become spherical due to its own gravity, and thus has also stopped tumbling and rotates only around a single axis, and that at remains in a fairly stable orbit, rather than an erratic one that flings it away after a few years. Hell, maybe even with the same caveat as planets, requiring them to have &quot;cleaned out&quot; their own orbit and become its dominant source of mass - though this may have the unfortunate downside of relegating Saturn&#39;s ring moons.<br>This would allow us to keep our precious Moon, without having to go stupid and start naming everything else that has the audacity to orbit a planet.<br>Still Saturn does give us a precedent, since we do recognize the difference between some of its &quot;moons&quot; and some of its &quot;moonlets&quot;, just like we recognize a difference between &quot;planets&quot;, &quot;dwarf planets&quot; and &quot;planetesimals&quot; (though, granted, sometimes we&#39;re still a bit vague on the last 2).<br>It&#39;ll piss off the people who love Phobos and Deimos, but, ya know.... sod &#39;em.<br><br>Something does need to be done though, and perhaps recognizing that not all natural satellites are &quot;moons&quot; wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing.", "comment_date": "2014-08-31T03:54:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colin Cavarzan", "comment_text": "Did he just call us semen", "comment_date": "2014-08-31T03:51:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sora ARX", "comment_text": "&quot;We are Earth&#39;s first fart&quot; - Micheal 2014", "comment_date": "2014-08-31T03:42:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "trapskilla", "comment_text": "The earth does not belong to us.

We don&#39;t know how long this period of humanity will last. For all we know, it&#39;ll stop as soon as the oil runs out. So probably less than a century from now. And even if we&#39;re optimistic and say that we&#39;ll invent a new technology for space travel that doesn&#39;t require oil, and we keep doing it for centuries... we still wouldn&#39;t be able to travel that far, relative to the size of the universe.

Forget that massive limitation of how small our reach in the universe actually is, even given all the time in the universe... because the biggest limitation is actually just that: timing.

What tells you that divine entities didn&#39;t create science as we know it?<br><br>Monotheists:<br>Who says there is only one god? If there can&#39;t be more than one, and to your understanding, all other mythologies ( like the Nordic, the Greek, the Roman) are wrong, what tells you that your religion isn&#39;t also wrong?<br><br>Now, allow me to present my view.<br><br>We are in an Universe created by a divine entity, and in this Universe, anything that happens is due to the divine entity&#39;s wish. Science as we know it and science as we still not know it happens because the divine entity wants such. Evolution happens because the divine entity wants it like that. Isn&#39;t evolution so logical and apparent? That&#39;s because it&#39;s divine. Something on such a perfect scale might occur because it&#39;s created by a more understanding entity.<br>Why are there atheists, then? Free will. The divine entity wants all living things in its Universe to be free to choose whatever they do. Whatever they believe will be true to them. Therefore, all your beliefs will come true after you die, so I think of Heaven in one way, I&#39;ll go to that heaven. If I don&#39;t think of a heaven, fair enough, I won&#39;t go to any.\u00a0<br>Why haven&#39;t we proved this entity yet? Because it doesn&#39;t want to be proven.<br>Wars? Fruit of the right of choice, free will of the living things.<br>Sins? Free will causes it.<br>Multiplicity of religions? There comes the second part. For me, all gods and anti-gods that were ever believed upon exist. Zeus, Quetzalcoatl, Amon Ra, God, Allah, Spaghetti monster, whoever. They exist along with the divine entity, and are part of it. We can only believe in a divine entity if it exists, along with the highest divine entity, the creator (and that&#39;s why they can&#39;t also be proven). Why are there things in the Bible that are incorrect? Because the Bible is written by men, and men can be corrupt and bias their work torwards their interests.\u00a0<br>I&#39;m a devout Christian, as I praise the chatolic God as my guide on how to life. Most of the principles I use are not from the Old Testament, though, as these works are seemingly more symbolic and biased. I prefer the New Testament, as it presents socially logical instructions and restrictions. Therefore, this God must be a good God.<br><br>Protip:\u00a0<br>- Don&#39;t be naive<br>- If you&#39;re an atheist, why are you defending your point?

Whales and dolphins for example definitely seem to be communicating. Just because we don&#39;t understand it doesn&#39;t mean they lack it. As for a sense of ownership, give food or a toy to a dog and in most cases it will react if you take it away. Also how do you know animals have no enforcement? It&#39;s entirely possible ants are punished for stealing food. Carnivores that live in social structures, for example wolves, have roles. The leader eats the best parts of the animal. If a lower ranked wolf would try to eat that part punishment follows. They certainly seem to have a sense of ownership and rules, there has to be communication for that to work and when an animal &#39;breaks the rules&#39; they enforce them with punishment.", "comment_date": "2014-08-29T11:22:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bryan Lee", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt6ab7BTlgE&amp;t=4m15s\">4:15</a> BY MASS :D", "comment_date": "2014-08-29T11:21:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Calad", "comment_text": "If we&#39;re calculating Earth&#39;s worth shouldn&#39;t we include our liquid water?

And humans do own earth, only because of force, the only reason humans own it is because they can build, thus the force, the only reason why all the stuff exists is because we build with our thumbs then we get excited so get a lot of pride and then we think we own every little thing and person and delive people, note humans made up dehuanize because we think were the good guys because we can build and know peace, look at it and get it though your heads were not the good guys, were the bad guys, the killers, if aliens came to us right now and were here for a year they should ask &quot;why do you guys think you own everything?&quot; notice how we are scared of the aliens wanting to come and kill us, someone wanting us dead, or werewolves, scared of nature, if aliens came and wanted to buy humans would come up and say we deserve to sell it because we can build, we made up humanoid animals, we did, combinations of animals and humans, you can tell witch myths are for sure fake and witch ones could be possible just if there is a mention of human in it, we kill bugs because their in our house, then we say&quot;don&#39;t kill&quot; to our kids and tell them to kill bugs, cops,army,assassins,hitmen,we discriminate against ourselves even, anything we can we will discriminate, we are hipacrits. I&#39;m not some crazy guy, I&#39;m a normal guy who lived for eighteen years and this is what I saw, look around and try to see this, humans will not die of natural causes or aliens, or anything else, we will die by our own hand by, pulution, wepons, discrimination, we still think the earth is the center of the universe, thus aliens need earth like planets, aliens need water, we are the only life in the universe, know this and its true, nothing is true, everything is permitted, or shorter, more then meets the eye, meaning=everyone and and everything is a lie, actions have consiquenses, everything is a lie, every action has an opposite and equal reaction. You may laugh but that doesn&#39;t really matter, but what does is will we listen to that saying or die by our own hand and slowly disolve into chaos, or better known as Warhammer 40k. That is the only one we should be worried about, and we are all going to hell, the only people that aren&#39;t are the plant eaters, even some of them are going to hell, also this is what I&#39;m seeing while were alive, if something doesn&#39;t happen we are all dead, this is to everyone. Just try to be good people, do the opposite of what we do, that&#39;s what needs to happen, guys also, the government stuff is true, the government spying, stop using cameras, their not doing it to find terrorists, I don&#39;t know why their doing it, also other government stuff is true too, if something is happening and someone says opposite it could be real, the &quot;weather baloons&quot; there are not that many miss identified baloons, realy, some are something, we just don&#39;t know what. And if the &quot;men with guns&quot; want to come to my door. Sure if they want to die then die, I&#39;m going to say this stuff, note I can think up how to get into places. Just remember to say nothing is true and everything is permitted about everything, if you think everything is a lie then you can&#39;t be fooled by anything, also this is not America, this is money, not freedom, gay people, middle eastern people, and even still some &quot;races&quot; know that, black people, and Jewish people, those people are part of the human race. Also I say humanity as meaning violent not peaceful. But think of nothing is true and everything is permitted for everything and nothing is a lie.

If we did, then there would be an infinite number of decisions we would have to make. \u00a0But if we could, making the right decision wouldnt always be easy. \u00a0For example, do you kill your neighbor because she is the great great great great grandmother of someone who will eventually become the most prolific mass bomber in history? \u00a0Im sure there are more, even more difficult scenarios that I couldnt possibly think of, but maybe there is a difference between right and wrong; and good and bad. \u00a0<br><br>In any case, there would be big and clear actions you could, like the example before. But how big would an action need to be to have a noticeable or impactful effect? Could it really be things so small as the flap of a butterfly wing? Or would something like your death not really change much?\u00a0<br><br>Then I started thinking. \u00a0Money. \u00a0Actions are bound affect money in some way. \u00a0One small decision could potentially give rise to a new multi billion dollar company or destroy a current one. \u00a0Next I just followed a trail of questions I asked myself. \u00a0How much money do our decisions accumulate? \u00a0For example, someone did an action that gave rise to the internet. \u00a0How much is that worth? How much impact would small thing have? How much over your life? How much do all your decisions add up to? \u00a0What is your worth? \u00a0How much are the entire population of a country worth? \u00a0What would that be if we included all resources, infrastructure, environment, etc? \u00a0How much would it be if we considered the entire world? \u00a0<br><br>So that&#39;s how I came to that final question. \u00a0The way I see it is worth is determined by value humans have put on things. \u00a0We could come up with a number, but to an alien life form the earth could be worthless to them because it may not see value. \u00a0For example, would diamonds be of any value to any species besides us? \u00a0I can really think of a reason anyone would need to know the worth of the earth for any practical reason, ie buying or selling the earth. \u00a0<br><br>OK that was my brain just randomly thinking of stuff. \u00a0If you read this, sorry I didnt proofread and I know there are some holes in my thought process but I thought it was interesting. \u00a0Now I can finally watch the video.", "comment_date": "2014-08-29T04:42:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pyrguiin Y", "comment_text": "I&#39;m going to go to school and tell my teacher we are all earth farts.

And if a creator made it that way would it not make sense that maybe the creator cares about its creations like a parent cares about their children?

Especially not thousands of years ago when humans though the Earth was flat and you would just fall off the edge into a endless pit of monsters and the sky was just a veil through which stars were Heaven&#39;s light shining through holes in the veil. In the Bible, and most other religious books, god is a sentient, bipedal, male humanoid who somehow could exist before existence existed (I wonder how long he was just sitting in absolute nothingness before he decided to create earth) and has the magical power of omnipotence. Now how could ANY human possibly know that he did that? He told one person in secrecy? Why not everyone so that there couldn&#39;t be any doubt? Why wouldn&#39;t he show himself before all his children everyday and be like &quot;Yeah am I&#39;m still real today? I Thought so.&quot; since he&#39;s omnipotent that would be no problem for him. He also contradicts himself constantly despite being able to redefine any concept in existence to make it so he couldn&#39;t contradict himself (this guy has serious mental problems despite being able to fix that or y&#39;know not have them in the first place). Also why is god a man? BECAUSE MEN RULED OVER WOMEN FOR CENTURIES AND USED THIS FACT TO KEEP THEM IN THEIR &quot;PLACE&quot;...sorry for the caps but I cannot fathom why any women can believe this shit and be okay with living as a servant of man, a byproduct of Adams rib (why a rib wtf?) made to serve their male masters because a magic man in the sky said so and you would be beaten, raped, and/or killed by men if you questioned otherwise. Seriously people why? Why can&#39;t we not take up these imaginary overseers and use them against each other? Why can&#39;t we now accept that Religion was a system of tyrannical politics to control the masses and comb the minds of scared, ignorant humans into believing what their masters believe and enforcing it upon the generations so that the free labor and goods (and eventually money) would keep flowing to the churches? We can travel the entire world, look deeply into the cosmos, and invent things that no one has ever conceived before, I thought we were only the sheep in the herd that god was the sheppard to?

Wouldn&#39;t the selling of earth, or, slightly more &quot;reasonable&quot; scenario of estimating it&#39;s price for say insurance purposes, paradoxically have an impact on it&#39;s price?<br>The value of things is determined mainly by the demand. Popcorn at the cinema would cost way more than in Walmart. Same goes for water in concerts. Having no other alternative, selling earth wouldn&#39;t be an option for any possible price unless the sellers would be able to actually live without it.", "comment_date": "2014-08-28T12:39:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Iorveth", "comment_text": "If moon = natural satellite, is earth then the sun&#39;s moon?
