But one must wonder if we are exactly in the middle of these two extremes, because WE are the observer in question?  In other words, would ANY observer be exactly in the middle of the biggest and smallest things THEY were capable of observing?  So for example an observer the size of a bacteria could observe things smaller than a planck length, but not as large as what we call the observable universe.  So it&#39;s all relative.  I mean we could never know because we are the size we are, but seems logical that the limits upwards and downwards of observation may very well differ with the size of the observer so as they always are right in the middle of what they can observe.  Think about an ant.  Your backyard would be like the size of an entire country practically, and your neighborhood the world.  So put human intelligence into an ant sized creature and how large could they observe?

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023. Major earthquakes occur in a row in all parts of the world. <br> An asteroid collides on the earth on xx moon xx day in 2023, and the earth becomes muddy sea <br> The world (heaven) of the Maitreya is built on xx moon xx day in 2024<br><br> Final note<br> The human being denies violence and war, but is it not violence and killing each other I kill a cow pig, and to eat meat? I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God. Mason finally leads the world to the World War 3. it is started with nuclear attack to Japan as a pilot light.

If we wanted to compare the price difference, we would need to scale the first purchase up to the second. Suppose we had a pack of pencils that costed $10, and a pack of pencils from a similar brand costing only $5. This difference is more significant than the difference between between a $2000 PC and a $1995 PC. Let\u2019s say a school decided to buy 200 packs of pencils. The difference in price between the brands would be $2000 vs. $1000; $1000 would be saved. For the PC, the school would only have saved $5.

Michael here. Let&#39;s take a moment to recognize the heroes who count. Canadian Mike Smith holds the world record for the largest number counted to in one breath - 125. But the world record for the largest number ever counted to belongs to Jeremy Harper from Birmingham, Alabama. In order to set the record, Harper never left his apartment. He got regular sleep, but from the moment he woke up in the morning until the moment he went to bed at night, Harper did nothing but count. He streamed the entire process over the Internet and raised money for charity while doing it, but after three months of counting all day, every day, he finally reached the world record - 1 million. Now, a million might not sound like a lot, but think of this way. One thousand seconds is about 17 minutes, but a million seconds is more than 11 days. And a billion seconds, well, that&#39;s more than 31 years. There&#39;s no full video online of Harper counting all the way to a million, but you can watch John Harchick count all the way to 100,000, if you have 74 hours to spare. John also has some other channels. One involves more than 300 videos of himself eating carrots. Another, more than 3,000 videos of himself drinking water. Many of John&#39;s videos literally have no views.\r<br>\r<br>They are as lonely as a video on YouTube can get. A great way to find such videos is a website made by Jon van der Kruisen. This website auto-plays videos on YouTube that no one has yet watched. John and Jeremy, as well as Mike, the one breath counter counted like this. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on. But that&#39;s not the only way to count. And it doesn&#39;t seem to be the one we&#39;re born with.\r<br>\r<br>Additive counting is the one we&#39;re all familiar with, where each next step is just one added to the last. But what if we multiply it by a number instead? Well, that kind of counting is logarithmic, from &quot;arithmos&quot; meaning number and &quot;logos&quot; meaning ratio, proportion. On this scale, similar distances are similar proportions. One is a third of three and three is a third of nine. Four is a third of 12 and so on. Our brains perceive the world around us on a logarithmic scale. It&#39;s believed that almost all of our senses are multiplicative, not additive.\r<br>\r<br>For example, how loud we perceive a sound to be. Two boomboxes playing at the same volume don&#39;t sound twice as loud as one. In order to make a sound that is perceived as being about twice as loud as one boombox, you actually need ten times as many, so 10. And to double that loudness, you would need a hundred. And to double that loudness, you would need a thousand. Having an intuitive sense of logarithmic scales built into your brain is probably an advantage when it comes to natural selection and survival, because often proportion matters more than absolute value. For example, &quot;is there one lion hiding over there in the shadows or two?&quot; is a very different question than &quot;are there ninety six lions about to attack us or ninety seven?&quot; Sure, in both cases I&#39;m just talking about one extra lion, but adding one lion to one lion, doubles the threat. Adding one lion to 96, well, that&#39;s basically nothing.\r<br>\r<br>Logarithmic thinking and feeling may explain why life seems to speed-up as we get older. It seems like I was a child for ever. And in college, in my early 20&#39;s, just whizzed by. And logarithmically, that makes sense, because each new year that I live is the smaller fraction of all the other years I&#39;ve already lived. When you turn 2 years old, the last year of your life is half your life. But when you turn 81, that last year that you&#39;ve lived, well, that&#39;s just a tiny part of the other 80 that you know. Logarithmic thinking isn&#39;t always helpful, especially in scenarios where proportion doesn&#39;t logically matter but we, nonetheless, act like it does. One of my favorite examples is the psychophysics of price paradox. This is something almost all of us do.\r<br>\r<br>Researchers found consistently that people are willing to put a lot of effort into saving 5 dollars of a 10 dollar purchase, but they won&#39;t put much effort into saving 5 five dollars of a 2,000 dollar purchase. It&#39;s 5 dollars saved either way, but our natural obsession with proportion leads us astray. Take a look at these pictures. Can you tell how many objects are in each of them? You probably can. It&#39;s like really easy. You can tell if there are zero, one, two, three or four objects in a photo without even needing to count. How are you doing that? Is it some sort of sixth sense? No.\r<br>\r<br>Psychologists call it &quot;subitizing.&quot; We can, intuitively, at a glance, determine whether there are about four or fewer objects in a photo. This has been part of human culture for a very long time and it may be the reason so many tally systems from all over the world all through history wind up having to do something different when counting the number five. When estimating or comparing amounts above 4, the brain uses what&#39;s known as an approximate number system. It&#39;s a psychological ability we have. It&#39;s about 15 percent accurate. It two amounts are at least 15 percent different, we can tell. So, for example, 100 objects and 115 or a thousand and 1,150 or 1,200.\r<br>\r<br>If you wanna test the accuracy of your approximate number system Panamath has a pretty good test. We often take linear additive counting for granted, but it&#39;s not granted to us. We aren&#39;t born with it. We are, however, born with the ability to subitize and use an approximate number system. Children younger than the age of three can tell, without counting, that this line of 4 coins contains fewer coins than this line of 6, even if you spread the 4 coins out into a line that is physically bigger, longer than this line of 6. However, mysteriously, around the age of 3.5, children lose this ability and begin saying that this line of 6 coins contains fewer coins than this long line of just 4 coins, possibly because around this age the physical world of objects, physical sizes, is more salient in their minds. But then, when they begin to learn linear counting, they reverse back and begin again correctly saying that this line of 6 contains more coins than this line of 4, around the age of 4.\r<br>\r<br>The smallest physical thing science could ever hope to observe is the Planck length. In order to look at anything smaller, you&#39;d need to have so much energy concentrated in such a small area a black hole would form and you would lose whatever you were looking at. Okay, with that in mind, here&#39;s a question. What number is halfway in-between 1 and 9. 5 seems like the obvious answer. There are four numbers on either side of 5, it&#39;s halfway between, right? Well, if you ask this question of a young child or a member of a culture that doesn&#39;t teach a linear additive number line, their answer will be 3. You see, they are exhibiting the human mind&#39;s natural logarithmic tendency, because 3 in that sense makes sense. Three is three times larger than 1, and 9 is three times larger than 3. Three is in the middle, proportionately.\r<br>\r<br>            But what if we took that logarithmic number line and change the one to be the smallest thing we can observe, the Planck length, and the nine to be the largest thing we can observe, the observable universe. What would go in the middle? Well, as it turns out, we would. The number of Planck lengths you could stretch across a brain cell is equal to the number of your brain cells it would take to stretch all the way across the observable universe. sold So, welcome to the middle.", "comment_date": "2021-02-13T12:25:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steevy", "comment_text": "&quot;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pxb5lSPLy9c&amp;t=5m40s\">5:40</a>&quot;<br>Yea i&#39;ve been getting paid with \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde1\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udddb.\ud835\uddd6 \ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde0<br>i&#39;m making over $2122 a week with them!<br><br><br>\u0a39\u0a30 \u0a1c\u0a70\u0a24\u0a30 \u0a24\u0a47 \u0a09\u0a2a\u0a32\u0a2c\u0a27 \u0a39\u0a48", "comment_date": "2021-02-12T09:59:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Monke", "comment_text": ".", "comment_date": "2021-02-11T21:16:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pinky Spike", "comment_text": "35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69 (nice),70,71,72,73,74,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100<br>Well there it is...

So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people&#39;s throats. It&#39;s your choice whether you want to accept it. So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) You, I and most( most because babies don&#39;t sin, and maybe specifically mentally I&#39;ll people) purely human beings have violated God&#39;s moral law. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God\u2019s eyes. Don\u2019t try asking for forgiveness, what if you tried that in court: &quot;Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again&quot;?You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned. The reason why blood must be spilled for remission of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals was enough for remission of some sins, not all. It wasn&#39;t infinite, unlike Jesus&#39;s. Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. The Old Testament sacrifice of animals, the spilled blood of those animals could cleanse people from some sins but not ALL, unlike Jesus&#39;s.  He was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus&#39;s spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved!        Romans 3:10<br><br>King James Version<br><br>10\u00a0As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:<br><br>Romans 3:23<br><br>King James Version<br><br>23\u00a0For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;<br><br>Romans 5:12<br><br>King James Version<br><br>12\u00a0Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:<br><br>Romans 6:23<br><br>King James Version<br><br>23\u00a0For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br><br>Romans 5:8-9<br><br>King James Version<br><br>8\u00a0But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.<br><br>9\u00a0Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.<br><br>Romans 10:9-10<br><br>King James Version<br><br>9\u00a0That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br><br>10\u00a0For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.<br><br>Ephesians 2:8-9<br><br>King James Version<br><br>8\u00a0For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br><br>9\u00a0Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br><br>John 3:16<br><br>King James Version<br><br>16\u00a0For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br><br>Leviticus 17:11<br><br>King James Version<br><br>11\u00a0For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.<br><br>Ephesians 1:7<br><br>King James Version<br><br>7\u00a0In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;<br><br>Colossians 1:20<br><br>King James Version<br><br>20\u00a0And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.<br><br>1 Corinthians 15<br><br>King James Version<br><br>15\u00a0Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;<br><br>2\u00a0By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.<br><br>3\u00a0For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br><br>4\u00a0And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g\">https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g</a>               j", "comment_date": "2021-01-21T11:19:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Dada", "comment_text": ", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74", "comment_date": "2021-01-21T10:51:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Catcoconut_ Cute", "comment_text": "Hey!

God bless, share the gospel and put God first. i hope you have a nice week. Jesus isn&#39;t just someone who is divine, full of grace, and someone who can free you of all sin and death. He can also free you of depression, tears, sadness, and of a life that isn&#39;t great or fulfilling. I have found that in Christ, a happy, fulfilling, holy, and a better life. Many others have as well,  and I hope you do too. Jesus loves you so much that He died for you on the cross, taking your sin and death that once was hard to take back. Jesus forgives you of your sins and helps you to repent, and leads you into salvation which is given by the cross to accept the reward of Heaven, Jesus&#39;s Kingdom. We cannot earn it nor work for it, if you believe in the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, you will be saved. To be saved means to be saved from God himself, God&#39;s wrath lies on those who do not believe and rebel, joining the world in its evil deeds and practices. Jesus rose from the dead, showing the people that if He could conquer death, you can too. Heaven is where you conquer death. True salvation requires sacrifice, but in the end it is worth it. A life is never the same when Jesus impacts it. We are punishable by death by sin, but if you would say to the Lord, &quot;forgive me, help me to repent and sin no more and live a life for you&quot; we would do better, be better, and repent and be saved by Jesus Himself. Jesus is King, and &quot;I can do all things with Christ who strengthens me.&quot; -Phil @. God bless you. Jesus can win the battles you cannot win. God give us angles to protect us \ud83d\ude4f Jesus, please help up to love you and put you above all things in our lives. may your love Jesus protect us always, we need you :) God bless you if you read that, you didn\u2019t have to but you chose to. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d God, bless us all please.

Michael here. Let&#39;s take a moment to recognize the heroes who count. Canadian Mike Smith holds the world record for the largest number counted to in one breath - 125. But the world record for the largest number ever counted to belongs to Jeremy Harper from Birmingham, Alabama. In order to set the record, Harper never left his apartment. He got regular sleep, but from the moment he woke up in the morning until the moment he went to bed at night, Harper did nothing but count. He streamed the entire process over the Internet and raised money for charity while doing it, but after three months of counting all day, every day, he finally reached the world record - 1 million. Now, a million might not sound like a lot, but think of this way. One thousand seconds is about 17 minutes, but a million seconds is more than 11 days. And a billion seconds, well, that&#39;s more than 31 years. There&#39;s no full video online of Harper counting all the way to a million, but you can watch John Harchick count all the way to 100,000, if you have 74 hours to spare. John also has some other channels. One involves more than 300 videos of himself eating carrots. Another, more than 3,000 videos of himself drinking water. Many of John&#39;s videos literally have no views. They are as lonely as a video on YouTube can get. A great way to find such videos is a website made by Jon van der Kruisen. This website auto-plays videos on YouTube that no one has yet watched. John and Jeremy, as well as Mike, the one breath counter counted like this. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on. But that&#39;s not the only way to count. And it doesn&#39;t seem to be the one we&#39;re born with. Additive counting is the one we&#39;re all familiar with, where each next step is just one added to the last. But what if we multiply it by a number instead? Well, that kind of counting is logarithmic, from &quot;arithmos&quot; meaning number and &quot;logos&quot; meaning ratio, proportion. On this scale, similar distances are similar proportions. One is a third of three and three is a third of nine. Four is a third of 12 and so on. Our brains perceive the world around us on a logarithmic scale. It&#39;s believed that almost all of our senses are multiplicative, not additive. For example, how loud we perceive a sound to be. Two boomboxes playing at the same volume don&#39;t sound twice as loud as one. In order to make a sound that is perceived as being about twice as loud as one boombox, you actually need ten times as many, so 10. And to double that loudness, you would need a hundred. And to double that loudness, you would need a thousand. Having an intuitive sense of logarithmic scales built into your brain is probably an advantage when it comes to natural selection and survival, because often proportion matters more than absolute value. For example, &quot;is there one lion hiding over there in the shadows or two?&quot; is a very different question than &quot;are there ninety six lions about to attack us or ninety seven?&quot; Sure, in both cases I&#39;m just talking about one extra lion, but adding one lion to one lion, doubles the threat. Adding one lion to 96, well, that&#39;s basically nothing. Logarithmic thinking and feeling may explain why life seems to speed-up as we get older. It seems like I was a child for ever. And in college, in my early 20&#39;s, just whizzed by. And logarithmically, that makes sense, because each new year that I live is the smaller fraction of all the other years I&#39;ve already lived. When you turn 2 years old, the last year of your life is half your life. But when you turn 81, that last year that you&#39;ve lived, well, that&#39;s just a tiny part of the other 80 that you know. Logarithmic thinking isn&#39;t always helpful, especially in scenarios where proportion doesn&#39;t logically matter but we, nonetheless, act like it does. One of my favorite examples is the psychophysics of price paradox. This is something almost all of us do. Researchers found consistently that people are willing to put a lot of effort into saving 5 dollars of a 10 dollar purchase, but they won&#39;t put much effort into saving 5 five dollars of a 2,000 dollar purchase. It&#39;s 5 dollars saved either way, but our natural obsession with proportion leads us astray. Take a look at these pictures. Can you tell how many objects are in each of them? You probably can. It&#39;s like really easy. You can tell if there are zero, one, two, three or four objects in a photo without even needing to count. How are you doing that? Is it some sort of sixth sense? No. Psychologists call it &quot;subitizing.&quot; We can, intuitively, at a glance, determine whether there are about four or fewer objects in a photo. This has been part of human culture for a very long time and it may be the reason so many tally systems from all over the world all through history wind up having to do something different when counting the number five. When estimating or comparing amounts above 4, the brain uses what&#39;s known as an approximate number system. It&#39;s a psychological ability we have. It&#39;s about 15 percent accurate. It two amounts are at least 15 percent different, we can tell. So, for example, 100 objects and 115 or a thousand and 1,150 or 1,200. If you wanna test the accuracy of your approximate number system Panamath has a pretty good test. We often take linear additive counting for granted, but it&#39;s not granted to us. We aren&#39;t born with it. We are, however, born with the ability to subitize and use an approximate number system. Children younger than the age of three can tell, without counting, that this line of 4 coins contains fewer coins than this line of 6, even if you spread the 4 coins out into a line that is physically bigger, longer than this line of 6. However, mysteriously, around the age of 3.5, children lose this ability and begin saying that this line of 6 coins contains fewer coins than this long line of just 4 coins, possibly because around this age the physical world of objects, physical sizes, is more salient in their minds. But then, when they begin to learn linear counting, they reverse back and begin again correctly saying that this line of 6 contains more coins than this line of 4, around the age of 4. The smallest physical thing science could ever hope to observe is the Planck length. In order to look at anything smaller, you&#39;d need to have so much energy concentrated in such a small area a black hole would form and you would lose whatever you were looking at. Okay, with that in mind, here&#39;s a question. What number is halfway in-between 1 and 9. 5 seems like the obvious answer. There are four numbers on either side of 5, it&#39;s halfway between, right? Well, if you ask this question of a young child or a member of a culture that doesn&#39;t teach a linear additive number line, their answer will be 3. You see, they are exhibiting the human mind&#39;s natural logarithmic tendency, because 3 in that sense makes sense. Three is three times larger than 1, and 9 is three times larger than 3. Three is in the middle, proportionately. But what if we took that logarithmic number line and change the one to be the smallest thing we can observe, the Planck length, and the nine to be the largest thing we can observe, the observable universe. What would go in the middle? Well, as it turns out, we would. The number of Planck lengths you could stretch across a brain cell is equal to the number of your brain cells it would take to stretch all the way across the observable universe. sold So, welcome to the middle.

This process aerates the butter, which promises soft chocolate chip cookies. Brown sugar yields soft chocolate chip cookies and white sugar helps the cookies spread. For chewier and more flavorful cookies, use more brown sugar than white sugar.<br>Dark Brown Sugar: Light brown sugar and dark brown sugar are interchangeable in most recipes. Though either works in this chocolate chip cookie recipe, I love using dark brown sugar for extra flavor because it holds a little more molasses.<br>Add Egg &amp; Vanilla Extract: Eggs provide structure and richness, while vanilla adds flavor.<br>Use Cornstarch in Dry Ingredients: Cornstarch, a thickening ingredient, is the secret weapon in this cookie recipe. 2 teaspoons give the cookies extra lift and leave them extra soft. You can\u2019t taste it! You also need all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.<br>Add Dry Ingredients to Wet Ingredients: Combine all the ingredients, then add the chocolate chips.<br>Chill the Cookie Dough: For extra thick chocolate chip cookies, chill the cookie dough for at least 1 hour. Chilling cookie dough will make or break the recipe! The colder the cookie dough, the less the cookies will over-spread. If you\u2019re interested, here are 10 tips to prevent cookies from over-spreading.<br>Extra Chocolate Chips: This is optional, but as soon as the cookies come out of the oven, press a few chocolate chips on top. They\u2019ll melt right down into the cookie, making them extra pretty. And melted chocolate is never a bad thing!<br>Room temperature butter is cool to touch and about 65\u00b0F (18\u00b0C), which may be cooler than your kitchen. To test it, poke it with your finger. Your finger should make an indent without sinking into the butter. The butter should not be shiny or greasy. You can\u2019t cream cold butter and you can\u2019t cream partially melted butter either.

Many cultures don\u2019t/didn\u2019t use base 10, most of them often favoring base 12.<br><br>Base 12 just <b>feels</b> logarithmic to me. It cleanly breaks up into smaller proportions far more easily than base 10. The only numbers that cleanly divide into 10 are 1, 2, and 5. But there\u2019s three more in base 12; 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.<br><br>In base 12, a half is 6, a third is 4, a quarter is 3, and a sixth is 2. The hardest change is that a fifth is 2.4, which is still pretty clean compared to some other ratios. But a fifth is cleaner in base 10, being 2 and all. But a third is 3.33333... a quarter is 2.5, a sixth is 1.666666...<br><br>Counting to 12 is easier on a single hand; each finger is broken up into 3 subsections, the base middle and tip. Four fingers, three segments, easily count to 12 on each hand.<br><br>It\u2019s why we have words/numbers like a dozen and a gross, why the day is broken up Into two 12 hour segments, why 12 inches inches in a foot, you get the idea.<br><br>But then base 10 came along with its cents and was forcibly enforced on people. A few things from 12 held over, like clocks, and how eleven and twelve are essentially their own words, and not numbers like \u201coneteen\u201d or \u201ctwoteen\u201d<br><br>One base feels like the factual measurement of an object and the other feels like the perception of an object. Like looking at something head on vs an angle.

It feels like I could live to 200, and by the end I&#39;d still wish I had more time. The only way I can imagine life not going fast is to restart, go back to when a year was your whole life. If you woke up one day with amnesia, and don&#39;t remember any of your past life, one day must seem like your whole life again. Life&#39;s not going by too fast, but at the same time, it&#39;s now incredibly short. If you died that same day, you&#39;d have really only lived one day, even though you&#39;re much older.

I have 100 percent proof Manson is the antichrist and that God also sent Superman here 11 years later and I promise this is not a joke. This is the one time that the crazy person saying the crazy things is actually telling the truth. In revelation 1:4 there are 7 letters to 7 churches. Philadelphia is one of them, the original capital and start of the United States. This year Philly won their first super bowl in 2018. Philadelphia to Canton Ohio is exactly 333 miles as the crow flies, this where Marilyn Manson the antichrist was born in 1969. This is also where the football Hall of Fame is. Canton Ohio to Chicago is exactly 333 miles as the crow flies. Chicago is where Anton Lavey published the satanic Bible in the same year Marilyn Manson was born 1969. That adds up to 666, this is the true root of the mark of the beast. It is finally solved so we are close to the end. The reason I figured out to break the mark of the beast in half is because that number has never left me alone. I even noticed 333 was even engraved on the ignition key of the last Motorcycle after I bought it. Manson and Anton Lavey became friends and they first met each other at Anton&#39;s Laveys house which happened to be in San Francisco. God sent a villain but God also sent Superman 11 years later. Robert Stroud the birdman of Alcatraz is one of God&#39;s special Angels. After he died he was buried cross country in Metropolis Illinois, the only city that is named after superman\u2019s hometown. Jerry Siegel who created Superman in 1933 died 33 years later on the birdman\u2019s birthday, January 28 1996. Metropolis Illinois to Fort Wayne Indiana is exactly 333 where I wrote the book American Wonderland, a book that once and for all proves God and Jesus exists. This is my soul purpose on Earth is to prove God and Jesus are 100 percent real before the end and Jesus comes back. If you add up all 3,\u00a0333 mile lines it equals 999. Their is only one picture in existence that shows both Anton Lavey and Marilyn Manson together and above them you can clearly see the number 999. \u00a0There was an incident the day after Carmelo Anthony of the Orangemen beat the Kansas Jayhawks in 2003 to win their first NCAA title. This day I almost drowned where the St. Mary&#39;s meets the St. Joseph River to form the Miami River in Fort Wayne Indiana. This is the day I walked the yellow brick road in real life and ended up meeting OZ at St. Joseph hospital. I\u2019m still not kidding. Ever since then I have had one biblical happening after another. I haven&#39;t aged since 2003 as well.\u00a0 If #23 Wayne Anthony would have not been injured for the Kansas Jayhawks, Kansas most likely would have won that Championship Game.\u00a0 Wayne Anthony later won a title in the NBA with the Miami heat. Fort Wayne was founded by Anthony Wayne. Johhny Depp was one of God&#39;s special Angels until he became best friends with Marilyn Manson, they even have matching tattoos. If you ever watch the old 1962 movie &quot;the birdman of Alcatraz&quot; the first bird Robert saves is a Sparrow he names Jack. In pirates of the Caribbean, john plays Captain Jack Sparrow. The reason I know so many things is because of all the things God has put me through, which led me to 15 years of research.\u00a0 God revelation story starts at Philly where they filmed Rocky to Alcatraz the rock, which both stands for Peter the Rock, Jesus&#39;s best friend. I was born January 27, 1980 and the birdman of Alcatraz was born on January 28, 1890. The Golden gate bridge started construction on Marilyn Manson birthday January 5th 1933. This is where the end will start, he&#39;s either going jump off or get baptized in the water underneath the bridge, his choice. Either way the wicked witch is getting wet. To Get to Alcatraz you have to take a ferry at Pier # 33. Notice how many times the number 33 keeps popping up. It\u2019s a code God keeps putting in front of us to remind us of Jesus. On January 5th 1982 there was a landslide in San Francisco that killed 33 people in which they also had to shut down the Golden Gate Bridge.\u00a0 That landslide occurred exactly 49 years to the day after the start of construction on Golden Gate Bridge and is also the same day Marilyn Manson turned 13. There is a reason Marilyn Manson turned 49 this year, and there is a reason he was born in Canton Ohio, the football hall of fame and there is a reason Philadelphia won this year.\u00a0 This is the year that the end begins. I don\u2019t know how many coincidences I have to point out until people realize it\u2019s impossible to have that many coincidences.\u00a0 That this is all connected to Gods much bigger plan.\u00a0 Everything that happened now, and in the past was planned out by God billions of years ago so that the one day the things God did would be connected so people no longer have to guess if God is real, they will know. I didn&#39;t just randomly pick Manson, a voice guided me to Marilyn Manson autobiography &quot;the long hard road out of hell back in 2001\u201d.

not that convincing/related. It actually has a good strategical foundation. Unless you belong to Rothschild family, you won&#39;t be conducting 2000$ purchases that often at all. May be once per year, may be even rarely. While you&#39;ll be conducting 10$ purchases, like, every day, often several times per day. So, it becomes a very important policy to enforce extra caution to 10$ purchases, as cumulative benefit from saving several dollars from each of it will be times and times more than from a single annual 2000$ purchase. And when you once in a while will decide to spend 2000.. whatever, you can afford to lose 5$ here, it&#39;s not that much, it&#39;s just loss of 5$/year - especially when to save them you need to put some additional effort.<br><br>Try to conduct the same research among offsprings of  really rich families, and you may find they demonstrate equal (and meager) consideration both for saves from 10$ and 2000$ purchases.", "comment_date": "2017-10-29T21:26:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bry", "comment_text": "This was filmed in Bucharest, Romania? :D", "comment_date":

Canadian Mike <br>Smith holds the world record for the largest number counted to in one <br>breath - 125. But the world record for the largest number ever counted <br>to belongs to Jeremy Harper from Birmingham, Alabama. In order to set <br>the record, Harper never left his apartment. He got regular sleep, but <br>from the moment he woke up in the morning until the moment he went to <br>bed at night, Harper did nothing but count. He streamed the entire <br>process over the Internet and raised money for charity while doing it, <br>but after three months of counting all day, every day, he finally <br>reached the world record - 1 million. Now, a million might not sound <br>like a lot, but think of this way. One thousand seconds is about 17 <br>minutes, but a million seconds is more than 11 days. And a billion <br>seconds, well, that&#39;s more than 31 years. There&#39;s no full video online <br>of Harper counting all the way to a million, but you can watch John <br>Harchick count all the way to 100,000, if you have 74 hours to spare. <br>John also has some other channels. One involves more than 300 videos of <br>himself eating carrots. Another, more than 3,000 videos of himself <br>drinking water. Many of John&#39;s videos literally have no views. <br>They are as lonely as a video on YouTube can get. A great way to find <br>such videos is a website made by Jon van der Kruisen. This website <br>auto-plays videos on YouTube that no one has yet watched. John and <br>Jeremy, as well as Mike, the one breath counter counted like this. 1, 2,<br> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on. But that&#39;s not the only way to count. And it <br>doesn&#39;t seem to be the one we&#39;re born with. <br>Additive counting is the one we&#39;re all familiar with, where each next <br>step is just one added to the last. But what if we multiply it by a <br>number instead? Well, that kind of counting is logarithmic, from <br>&quot;arithmos&quot; meaning number and &quot;logos&quot; meaning ratio, proportion. On this<br> scale, similar distances are similar proportions. One is a third of <br>three and three is a third of nine. Four is a third of 12 and so on. Our<br> brains perceive the world around us on a logarithmic scale. It&#39;s <br>believed that almost all of our senses are multiplicative, not additive.<br> <br>For example, how loud we perceive a sound to be. Two boomboxes playing <br>at the same volume don&#39;t sound twice as loud as one. In order to make a <br>sound that is perceived as being about twice as loud as one boombox, you<br> actually need ten times as many, so 10. And to double that loudness, <br>you would need a hundred. And to double that loudness, you would need a <br>thousand. Having an intuitive sense of logarithmic scales built into <br>your brain is probably an advantage when it comes to natural selection <br>and survival, because often proportion matters more than absolute value.<br> For example, &quot;is there one lion hiding over there in the shadows or <br>two?&quot; is a very different question than &quot;are there ninety six lions <br>about to attack us or ninety seven?&quot; Sure, in both cases I&#39;m just <br>talking about one extra lion, but adding one lion to one lion, doubles <br>the threat. Adding one lion to 96, well, that&#39;s basically nothing. <br>Logarithmic thinking and feeling may explain why life seems to speed-up <br>as we get older. It seems like I was a child for ever. And in college, <br>in my early 20&#39;s, just whizzed by. And logarithmically, that makes <br>sense, because each new year that I live is the smaller fraction of all <br>the other years I&#39;ve already lived. When you turn 2 years old, the last <br>year of your life is half your life. But when you turn 81, that last <br>year that you&#39;ve lived, well, that&#39;s just a tiny part of the other 80 <br>that you know. Logarithmic thinking isn&#39;t always helpful, especially in <br>scenarios where proportion doesn&#39;t logically matter but we, nonetheless,<br> act like it does. One of my favorite examples is the psychophysics of <br>price paradox. This is something almost all of us do. <br>Researchers found consistently that people are willing to put a lot of <br>effort into saving 5 dollars of a 10 dollar purchase, but they won&#39;t put<br> much effort into saving 5 five dollars of a 2,000 dollar purchase. It&#39;s<br> 5 dollars saved either way, but our natural obsession with proportion <br>leads us astray. Take a look at these pictures. Can you tell how many <br>objects are in each of them? You probably can. It&#39;s like really easy. <br>You can tell if there are zero, one, two, three or four objects in a <br>photo without even needing to count. How are you doing that? Is it some <br>sort of sixth sense? No. <br>Psychologists call it &quot;subitizing.&quot; We can, intuitively, at a glance, <br>determine whether there are about four or fewer objects in a photo. This<br> has been part of human culture for a very long time and it may be the <br>reason so many tally systems from all over the world all through history<br> wind up having to do something different when counting the number five.<br> When estimating or comparing amounts above 4, the brain uses what&#39;s <br>known as an approximate number system. It&#39;s a psychological ability we <br>have. It&#39;s about 15 percent accurate. It two amounts are at least 15 <br>percent different, we can tell. So, for example, 100 objects and 115 or a<br> thousand and 1,150 or 1,200. <br>If you wanna test the accuracy of your approximate number system <br>Panamath has a pretty good test. We often take linear additive counting <br>for granted, but it&#39;s not granted to us. We aren&#39;t born with it. We are,<br> however, born with the ability to subitize and use an approximate <br>number system. Children younger than the age of three can tell, without <br>counting, that this line of 4 coins contains fewer coins than this line <br>of 6, even if you spread the 4 coins out into a line that is physically <br>bigger, longer than this line of 6. However, mysteriously, around the <br>age of 3.5, children lose this ability and begin saying that this line <br>of 6 coins contains fewer coins than this long line of just 4 coins, <br>possibly because around this age the physical world of objects, physical<br> sizes, is more salient in their minds. But then, when they begin to <br>learn linear counting, they reverse back and begin again correctly <br>saying that this line of 6 contains more coins than this line of 4, <br>around the age of 4. <br>The smallest physical thing science could ever hope to observe is the <br>Planck length. In order to look at anything smaller, you&#39;d need to have <br>so much energy concentrated in such a small area a black hole would form<br> and you would lose whatever you were looking at. Okay, with that in <br>mind, here&#39;s a question. What number is halfway in-between 1 and 9. 5 <br>seems like the obvious answer. There are four numbers on either side of <br>5, it&#39;s halfway between, right? Well, if you ask this question of a <br>young child or a member of a culture that doesn&#39;t teach a linear <br>additive number line, their answer will be 3. You see, they are <br>exhibiting the human mind&#39;s natural logarithmic tendency, because 3 in <br>that sense makes sense. Three is three times larger than 1, and 9 is <br>three times larger than 3. Three is in the middle, proportionately. <br>            But what if we took that logarithmic number line and change <br>the one to be the smallest thing we can observe, the Planck length, and <br>the nine to be the largest thing we can observe, the observable <br>universe. What would go in the middle? Well, as it turns out, we would. <br>The number of Planck lengths you could stretch across a brain cell is <br>equal to the number of your brain cells it would take to stretch all the<br> way across the observable universe. sold So, welcome to the middle.

Michael here. Let&#39;s take a moment to recognize the heroes who count. Canadian Mike Smith holds the world record for the largest number counted to in one breath - 125. But the world record for the largest number ever counted to belongs to Jeremy Harper from Birmingham, Alabama. In order to set the record, Harper never left his apartment. He got regular sleep, but from the moment he woke up in the morning until the moment he went to bed at night, Harper did nothing but count. He streamed the entire process over the Internet and raised money for charity while doing it, but after three months of counting all day, every day, he finally reached the world record - 1 million. Now, a million might not sound like a lot, but think of this way. One thousand seconds is about 17 minutes, but a million seconds is more than 11 days. And a billion seconds, well, that&#39;s more than 31 years. There&#39;s no full video online of Harper counting all the way to a million, but you can watch John Harchick count all the way to 100,000, if you have 74 hours to spare. John also has some other channels. One involves more than 300 videos of himself eating carrots. Another, more than 3,000 videos of himself drinking water. Many of John&#39;s videos literally have no views. <br>They are as lonely as a video on YouTube can get. A great way to find such videos is a website made by Jon van der Kruisen. This website auto-plays videos on YouTube that no one has yet watched. John and Jeremy, as well as Mike, the one breath counter counted like this. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and so on. But that&#39;s not the only way to count. And it doesn&#39;t seem to be the one we&#39;re born with. <br>Additive counting is the one we&#39;re all familiar with, where each next step is just one added to the last. But what if we multiply it by a number instead? Well, that kind of counting is logarithmic, from &quot;arithmos&quot; meaning number and &quot;logos&quot; meaning ratio, proportion. On this scale, similar distances are similar proportions. One is a third of three and three is a third of nine. Four is a third of 12 and so on. Our brains perceive the world around us on a logarithmic scale. It&#39;s believed that almost all of our senses are multiplicative, not additive. <br>For example, how loud we perceive a sound to be. Two boomboxes playing at the same volume don&#39;t sound twice as loud as one. In order to make a sound that is perceived as being about twice as loud as one boombox, you actually need ten times as many, so 10. And to double that loudness, you would need a hundred. And to double that loudness, you would need a thousand. Having an intuitive sense of logarithmic scales built into your brain is probably an advantage when it comes to natural selection and survival, because often proportion matters more than absolute value. For example, &quot;is there one lion hiding over there in the shadows or two?&quot; is a very different question than &quot;are there ninety six lions about to attack us or ninety seven?&quot; Sure, in both cases I&#39;m just talking about one extra lion, but adding one lion to one lion, doubles the threat. Adding one lion to 96, well, that&#39;s basically nothing. <br>Logarithmic thinking and feeling may explain why life seems to speed-up as we get older. It seems like I was a child for ever. And in college, in my early 20&#39;s, just whizzed by. And logarithmically, that makes sense, because each new year that I live is the smaller fraction of all the other years I&#39;ve already lived. When you turn 2 years old, the last year of your life is half your life. But when you turn 81, that last year that you&#39;ve lived, well, that&#39;s just a tiny part of the other 80 that you know. Logarithmic thinking isn&#39;t always helpful, especially in scenarios where proportion doesn&#39;t logically matter but we, nonetheless, act like it does. One of my favorite examples is the psychophysics of price paradox. This is something almost all of us do. <br>Researchers found consistently that people are willing to put a lot of effort into saving 5 dollars of a 10 dollar purchase, but they won&#39;t put much effort into saving 5 five dollars of a 2,000 dollar purchase. It&#39;s 5 dollars saved either way, but our natural obsession with proportion leads us astray. Take a look at these pictures. Can you tell how many objects are in each of them? You probably can. It&#39;s like really easy. You can tell if there are zero, one, two, three or four objects in a photo without even needing to count. How are you doing that? Is it some sort of sixth sense? No. <br>Psychologists call it &quot;subitizing.&quot; We can, intuitively, at a glance, determine whether there are about four or fewer objects in a photo. This has been part of human culture for a very long time and it may be the reason so many tally systems from all over the world all through history wind up having to do something different when counting the number five. When estimating or comparing amounts above 4, the brain uses what&#39;s known as an approximate number system. It&#39;s a psychological ability we have. It&#39;s about 15 percent accurate. It two amounts are at least 15 percent different, we can tell. So, for example, 100 objects and 115 or a thousand and 1,150 or 1,200. <br>If you wanna test the accuracy of your approximate number system Panamath has a pretty good test. We often take linear additive counting for granted, but it&#39;s not granted to us. We aren&#39;t born with it. We are, however, born with the ability to subitize and use an approximate number system. Children younger than the age of three can tell, without counting, that this line of 4 coins contains fewer coins than this line of 6, even if you spread the 4 coins out into a line that is physically bigger, longer than this line of 6. However, mysteriously, around the age of 3.5, children lose this ability and begin saying that this line of 6 coins contains fewer coins than this long line of just 4 coins, possibly because around this age the physical world of objects, physical sizes, is more salient in their minds. But then, when they begin to learn linear counting, they reverse back and begin again correctly saying that this line of 6 contains more coins than this line of 4, around the age of 4. <br>The smallest physical thing science could ever hope to observe is the Planck length. In order to look at anything smaller, you&#39;d need to have so much energy concentrated in such a small area a black hole would form and you would lose whatever you were looking at. Okay, with that in mind, here&#39;s a question. What number is halfway in-between 1 and 9. 5 seems like the obvious answer. There are four numbers on either side of 5, it&#39;s halfway between, right? Well, if you ask this question of a young child or a member of a culture that doesn&#39;t teach a linear additive number line, their answer will be 3. You see, they are exhibiting the human mind&#39;s natural logarithmic tendency, because 3 in that sense makes sense. Three is three times larger than 1, and 9 is three times larger than 3. Three is in the middle, proportionately. <br>\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0But what if we took that logarithmic number line and change the one to be the smallest thing we can observe, the Planck length, and the nine to be the largest thing we can observe, the observable universe. What would go in the middle? Well, as it turns out, we would. The number of Planck lengths you could stretch across a brain cell is equal to the number of your brain cells it would take to stretch all the way across the observable universe. sold So, welcome to the middle.

Let me explain:<br>There are two types of intelligence that can evolve from natural selection. The most common and often the most efficient one is hard-wired where the structure/organisation/workings of the brain are mostly static for a single lifeform. This evolves from an environment which is mostly static in its complexities both spatially and temporally.<br>The other kind is the kind that makes us, as humans, special, the adaptive/learning/pattern-finding kind. This evolves from an environment which is both extremely complex and whose complexities are evolving at a quick rate, so evolution is beaten by short-term adaptation and pattern-finding.<br>What causes this extreme complexity? Long-term large-scale stability. Ever wonder why you weren&#39;t born as an intelligent lifeform on a less stable planet? Think about it, we say all of these other planets are so destructive and extreme, but it&#39;s the opposite, our planet, compared to the vast majority of other planets with a capability to support life, is EXTREMELY non-extreme/stable. This stability allows more subtle complexities/patterns to have a much bigger effect on our observation of the world. There are some much more powerful complexities/patterns, which in most cases make the subtler ones nearly irrelevant, but if you have an environment where the subtler ones can make an effect significant enough to have resources invested into noticing them when it comes to neuroevolution, then that is adding to the complexity of the environment that is relevant to neuroevolution. Put simply: What&#39;s the point in noticing something that costs you more to notice than to not? If that pattern/complexity is enough of a benefit to notice, then neuroevolution will make it noticed.<br>Because subtler complexities/patterns usually being caused by more powerful/prominent ones, there is more of them, thus we want to make the powerful ones less powerful and the subtler ones more powerful to maximise the complexity. We have the laws of physics and the structure of the space that they apply to as the base for all of the complexities we see in our universe, but then they produce loads of complexities/patterns which are usually more subtle, which then produce loads of complexities/patterns which are usually more subtle, etc etc.<br>What makes them subtle? Being powerless compared to the more powerful ones, thus being difficult to notice and not having much of an effect. What is a good tool for amplifying the effect of patterns/complexities? Time (basis: chaos theory). So in order to &quot;crank up&quot; the power of all patterns/complexities we can use time, right? Not quite, another limit is the speed of the brain/neurological network/system. If a pattern is too quick in its &quot;temporal lifetime&quot;, then it cannot be noticed/taken advantage of by neuroevolution. Since patterns/complexities are built onto each-other/originate from each-other/built onto more fundamental patterns/complexities, the ones that are &quot;deeper&quot; on the &quot;pattern hierarchy&quot; will be more affected by the patterns that come before them. This makes subtler patterns more sensitive to change. Too much changing of these subtler patterns means that they blur in their effects and become irrelevant which is another reason why stability of the planet is important. This means that when the planet is extremely stable, the more fundamental patterns can be stable enough for the more sensitive complexities not to blur into irrelevancy/oblivion/out of existence. Also, the fact that more subtle complexities are built on other more fundamental/powerful ones means that they take with them the time scale and spatial scale of the patterns/complexities they are based off of/are reliant on to exist. The actual difference in time scale and spatial scale are of course relative to those previous complexities, meaning the relative proportions/fractions/ratios can build on each-other, thus the logarithmic range of the temporal and spatial scale of said patterns/complexities. This building on one another based can be described by a notion of chance of landing somewhere. If you take a random number from a said range, then every possible value you could end up on is equally likely. If you do it twice and add the results and then calculate the chance of getting a certain value in the new possible range, then the ones towards the middle have become more likely due to there being more combinations of two values to get to numbers nearer the middle than numbers nearer the limits of the range. If you do it 3 times more so. Repeat this, and you get a curve that is pretty much at nothing near the limits of the range, and is extremely likely in the middle of the range. This curve is called a normal distribution. Remember: patterns/complexities can be approximated to have a difference in temporal and spatial scale that is <b>proportional to</b> the patterns/complexities that are &quot;one up&quot;/less deep in the hierarchy, thus the cumulative scale is <b>logarithmic</b> and the cumulative chance is that of a <b>normal distribution</b>. So, after all of that, our perfect recipe for the most relevant/advantageous-to-notice complexities/patterns and thus intelligence to evolve is:<br> - extremely stable planet to allow the more fundamental patterns/complexities to be stable enough for the less fundamental, more subtle, more sensitive patterns/complexities that are deeper down the hierarchy to be stable enough to not change too quickly and thus blur, making them much more useful in noticing and amplifying their effect with the power of consistency<br> - a temporal and spatial scale that is in the middle logarithmicaly due to statistics and the &quot;building-on-the-previous/related&quot; nature of patterns/complexities and that causing a normal distribution occupying a logarithmic graph", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T20:50:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maxena Megalabrainiac", "comment_text": "Interesting end, but I didn&#39;t know brain cells were of a consistent size.", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T16:37:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lukas Schmincke", "comment_text": "the reason why life seems to speed up with every year is, the cells divide slower at a high Age, but time flys by, the same Speed.", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T15:52:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lukas Schmincke", "comment_text": "Chuck Norris counted twice to infinity, that&#39;s impressive.", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T15:46:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vorcas Awekete", "comment_text": "Mister, WHAT IS YOUR SOURCE! see what I did there?", "comment_date": "2015-11-05T21:27:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "michel fj\u00e4ll", "comment_text": "Who am I?", "comment_date": "2015-11-05T18:45:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Some Random Fellow", "comment_text": "Even more proof that I&#39;m the center of the universe", "comment_date": "2015-11-04T23:27:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Some Random Fellow", "comment_text": "Vi Hart", "comment_date": "2015-11-04T23:19:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SkyDuster", "comment_text": "I LIVE IN BUCHAREST AND U WERE THERE???

This also explains why your 100 watt stereo system, is about 4 x as loud as a 1 watt, if you use the same speakers and they are capable of handling the power.<br><br>Thanks to a thing called MUTUAL coupling, you can increase the efficiency of two closely spaced speakers. This would mean that 2 closely spaced subwoofers in separate boxes can give 4 x the acoustic energy using only twice the power as 1 subwoofer. This gain gradually dwindles off though as there is an efficiency limit with more and more speakers. This works because one speaker works against the higher pressure wave produced by the other and does more &quot;work&quot; on the air. As most of the energy in a smaller speaker is spent moving itself rather than the air around it, there is plenty of room for gains.", "comment_date": "2015-09-16T19:49:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caved Johnson", "comment_text": "?", "comment_date": "2015-09-16T19:23:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zac Grey", "comment_text": "DUDE, U Saved My Life.", "comment_date": "2015-09-16T15:16:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dom Carter", "comment_text": "&quot;welcome to the middle&quot; <br><br>woah.", "comment_date": "2015-09-16T10:21:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CloudTheLegend1975", "comment_text": "hah if you needed to find a video with no views, Just look at my channel", "comment_date": "2015-09-16T07:10:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mekratrig", "comment_text": "Michael alsways jumps up into frame from the bottom.

If he were to assume where he was standing it would be fair to assume he would claim that he is in the middle. After all he can see about as long in every direction. But is it safe to assume he is in the middle? Not really. <br>The same goes for us here. We have seen a distance and caluculated a size of everything based on the amount of time and energy we&#39;ve spent on expanding our own horizon of understanding. We have reached about as far in micro scale as in macro scale, which is to be somewhat expected of humanity. This never makes it safe to assume we are in the middle though. <br>Actually, if you would consider our history the existence of humanity has been shrinking constantly. First our planet was assumed to be in the center of everything. Then the sun took that place instead. After that we realized we are not even living in the only solar system. With further time, we realized our galaxy is small enough to &quot;not even matter&quot; statistically speaking in this universe. I think it is therefore safe to assume that also this universe might be a multiverse, and that multiverse might be a part of something else too. Everything has always grown.

To reflect on. Why is this important? What implications could this have? Are there neurological disorders or disabilities that allows certain people to look at a massive screen of dots and in a split-second know the exact number of dots there are? Do computers count linearly? What about a computer with AI capabilities, how would they count? Are schools teaching kids to count differently now? Is that a more effective way of counting?

By example big expanses like buying a car, a house, etc aren&#39;t done that often which means you only save those 5 once. However you will buy smaller things like clothes more often meaning that you save 5 multiple times in a year, maybe 10 or 20 times. Even more extreme is it on groceries and small stuff for around the household, here you could actually save maybe a 100 times the same 5.<br><br>This is why I think it&#39;s often still more valuable to save 5 on a small amount than on a large amount.

The experiment you were referring to, was one done by a biologist named Jean Piaget, as part of his &#39;cognitive theory&#39;.\u00a0This was debunked although mistakenly used to develop many flawed educational practices, but it is understandable why a biologist would interpret child development in this way.<br><br>Educational development is more cyclical that cognitive, as proved by Jerome Bruner.

Everything the human mind is capable of thinking in spatial terms (from a single Plank point to the extents of the &#39;known&#39; Universe) is information which is stored in and limited by the thinking capacity of a a single brain cell. Thus, the Plank length and Observable Universe are the extremes of the matter used in the brain cell to contain that information and process it. BUT, this is silly right? We have billions of cells in our brains, so how can this be true? Well, the way I see it is to imagine that the cells in our brains are wired up like the cells in a battery pack whose cells are wired in parallel (as apposed to series). The voltage or potential difference of a battery cell within the pack can be compared to the &#39;thinking capacity&#39; or &#39;bandwidth&#39; of the brain cell and the current is the &#39;thinking force&#39; or &#39;flow rate&#39; of the brain cell. So if I wired up billions of 3v battery cells in a parallel configuration, I would still have 3v at the end (i.e my entire brain could only think within the dimensions of one original brain cell), but I would have a very powerful current (i.e my brain could do many calculations at the same time).<br><br>Our understanding of the Universe in which we live in is unfortunately bound by the physical matter contained within our brain cells. If somehow we could collectively wire our brains together in series and think in a unified way, I&#39;m sure the Universe would be a very different place.<br><br>Thanks again, Michael.", "comment_date": "2015-05-20T11:27:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1ExplosionsHurt", "comment_text": "It&#39;s funny how many Greek words you have on your videos.

logical sense to think +/- $5 isn&#39;t important for a purchase of $1,000 vs. a purchase of say $20. \u00a0The most simplistic example I can come up with is buying something in bulk (let&#39;s forget about the fact that buying in bulk is always less expensive). \u00a0A basketball costs about $10, so 100 basketballs would cost $1,000. \u00a0But if someone charged me $1,005 for 100 basketballs, I would only be overpaying $0.05 per basketball (a nickel per basketball) so why should I sweat over a nickel per basketball? \u00a0I think that analogy is appropriate because things that are expensive are generally expensive because you are paying for <i>a lot</i> of components.  On the other hand, if two basketballs cost me $25, then I would be overpaying $2.50 per basketball--this seems to be much worse of a deal.<br><br>Another way to look at it is interest since a large purchase is generally financed. \u00a0If I purchase something at $1,000 financed at 10% APR for 2 years (24 months) then my monthly payment would be about $46.14 which means I pay a total of $1,107.36 vs. $1,005 financed in the same way with a monthly payment of $46.38 (so 24 cents difference on the monthly) and a total payment of $1113.12 for a total difference of less than $6? \u00a0Why is this important?", "comment_date": "2015-05-18T04:59:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "n00bsl4yer360", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s start a counting thing. <br>1...", "comment_date": "2015-05-18T04:39:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "desmon", "comment_text": "Holy crap, you&#39;re in Bucharest, Romania.

Although I feel like in some instances where there are four objects, I&#39;m already counting two and two. I&#39;ve come across the rule before on the &quot;Numberphile&quot; channel, and I&#39;ve been ruminating over whether this is expressed elsewhere. Music, for example, tends to happen in groups of two or three beats. I realise you can have 5/8 and 7/8 and 9/8, but in those rhythms, you can usually identify groups of two or three.<br><br>Another interesting possible expression of the phenomenon is in language. My second language is Slovak, which is a Slavic language. The Slavic languages have this interesting phenomenon whereby if you&#39;re counting objects, you&#39;ll use one plural form up to the number four, and then a different plural form (called the genitive plural) after that.<br><br>So, in Slovak, if you order one beer, you&#39;ll ask for &quot;jedno pivo&quot; (yednaw peevaw)<br>Two, three, or four beers would be &quot;dve, tri, \u0161tyri piv\u00e1&quot;.

I was right. This isn&#39;t the first time this happens. Also, when I dream, and I hear things in the dream, they make sense with what&#39;s happening in real life. For example, I&#39;m riding on a jet ski in a lake of soda pop, when in real life someone knocks on my door. So then in the dream, as im jet skiing, I hear the knocking sounds, But I also SEE an explanation to them in the dream! I see a man, knocking on the wood of a dock near the lake! How can my brain... Predict that the sound of knocking will happen? See, how does my brain explain the knocking sound as it happens?? Do you understand?<br><br>It&#39;s almost as if my dream is behind in time, and that&#39;s why. My brain isn&#39;t creating the dream in the same time as the knock is happening.

Three is a quantity. Quantity is determined by counting, which is what the word quantity means. I would ask a better question, one concerning the negative space, the white background. Is the quantitative value of the white background 1, or is it to be represented by a fraction since the red dots occlude part of its surface area? And if that could be the case, then the white background is quantified by a poly-numeric number, a fraction, one represented by a variety of digits which, as a collection, are a quantity greater than 1, and which at times each single digit\u00a0possess\u00a0a numeric\u00a0value greater than 1, yet the fractional representation is less than 1 but is at the same time a Whole unit.

As the train enters the tunnel, you manage to close both sides of the tunnel by the doors. The train begins to slow down therefore expanding. What would happen?&quot; My question is would the tunnel doors be smashed open? And if so where would the energy come from? Anyone with any possible and rational answers please reply to my comment.
