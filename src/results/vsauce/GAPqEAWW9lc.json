I always saw trailers for Youtube Red content but i never really felt inclined to buy it, but as you all know Micheal&#39;s content is superb and for that reason i am going to buy Youtube Red just to be able to watch this series.

Not available in my country. Even if it was, there is not enough content interesting to me to justify the subscription. And it&#39;ll probably cost $2.49 per episode like any other YouTube Red series without a subscription which is way to much for a poor student like me.

His outgoings will be in line with what he earns.. Youtube Red have obviously gave him a huge opportunity to create a very high quality online series and he&#39;s took them up on that and who can blame him..
