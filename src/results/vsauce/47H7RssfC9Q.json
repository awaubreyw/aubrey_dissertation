But as impossible as this sounds, like so many of the true stories in scripture, our bibles have all been supernaturally changed by Satan in the last several years, right in our homes, in the fulfillment of prophecy. It&#39;s being done to prepare for the reign of the antichrist and the extermination of all Christians. All languages and all translations have been changed with black magic along with concordances, encyclopedias, dictionaries, history books, the ancient\u00a0 Hebrew, Greek, Latin and Aramaic manuscripts.

I had never owned a computer and had never heard of the Mandela Effect back then. But after finding out about this phenomenon a year and a half later, I finally found out why I had been noticing all of the oddities in my bible. I then started diligently studying what should actually be called the Daniel 7:25 effect. That&#39;s where God said He would give the antichrist the power to do this. We&#39;re seeing the fulfillment of end time prophecies that we had misinterpreted until they started happening SUPERNATURALLY!

In Daniel 12:4 and 12:9 He told him to seal his book until the end days. He told John </b><b><i>not</i></b><b> to seal his book because the end time is at hand in Revelation 22:10. One of the Greek definitions of seal in Strongs concordance is \u201cto protect from Satan\u201d. He also told us to \u201cwrite His words in our hearts\u201d, which meant memorize, if not word for word at least the essence of what was written, because He knew this was going to happen. He also warned us in second Thessalonians chapter two, that He would send a strong delusion to all that didn\u2019t receive the love of the truth. I&#39;m convinced that this is at least part of it!

When I found out that Isaiah 11:6 had supernaturaly changed from a lion to a wolf it spun me out, and as a result it brought me back to Christ. I have been back in the arms of Jesus for 12 months now. I see changes in the bible constantly now. For example, you can not find the words, &quot;hallelujah, demons, wineskins&quot; in the Old KJV bible anymore. Too many changes to go into. In Gen 1:1, the word heavens has changed to heaven. It no longer has the letter s in the word...<br><br><b>God commanded us to &quot;prove all things&quot;, and people </b><b><i>better</i></b><b> obey Him, especially on this subject. The first 13 films in my playlist will prove to you that Isaiah 11:6 in your bible has been changed from &quot;Lion&quot; to &quot;wolf&quot;! I urge you to research this. There are many brothers and sisters making videos about the changes with more proof of what was originally written and I have lots more about this in my playlist which you can \ud83d\udc49\u00a0 find by typing in (proof of bible change residue junkie).</b> \ud83d\udc48<br><br><b>Even though I had to quit reading my bible 6 years ago, I&#39;ve continued to study scripture by learning what Satan has been changing. When &quot;they&quot; cut our lights all we&#39;ll have is hard copies of the bible that </b><b><i>Satan</i></b><b> wants us to read. At that point, Amos </b><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47H7RssfC9Q&amp;t=8m12s\">8:12</a></b><b> will be fulfilled too where it says we won&#39;t be able to find God&#39;s words anymore!</b><br><br>\u00a0 <b>I urge everyone to start researching this now as time is short. And at the top of my playlist is a web site that has a long list of changes that have been documented in a PDF which I recommend printing out to help preserve God&#39;s true words.</b><br><br><b><i>May God bless all who read this with eyes to see this incredible faith strengthener, and how close we are to our Saviour&#39;s return!!!!</i></b> \u2764\u271d\ufe0f\ud83d\udcaa<br><br><br><b>P.S.
