The skull, the rose a top the stem called the spine, contains the juggernaut we call the human brain. <br><br>Sensory inputs received by the rose will organize necessary movements first by commanding the eyes to initiate some movement in the skull and cervical spine. <br><br>Tangentially, the quality of movement uniquely available to humans originates from the precise yet powerful method of force production that torque enables.  This is the spiraling line of force that comes from brachiation and bipedalism - seen when a human rides a bicycle, throws an object, stands, walks, runs, etc<br><br>Returning to movement - the nervous system utilizes the musculoskeletal system to move through time and space. The previously established skill of brachiation provided a way to stabilize the nervous system when learning to walk, this can be seen in toddlers that will naturally grasp handles in order to emulate the gait patterns nearby humans have been using. Crawling allows for the hip flexors and pelvic position to organize sufficiently before attempting to stand. Tangent #2 - observation confirms that parents can promote optimal shapes being learned during early motor pattern acquisition by refraining from hoisting a young child up by the hands and encouraging him to egg-beater hid legs and attempt to balance. <br><br>In conclusion, the hierarchy of the anatomical naming system and the lexicon that develops outward from, for example, a scientific system for labelling can be logically followed by prioritizing the structures of the nervous system and the hard / soft tissues that control the slack in this system. The upper and lower extremities, which, quite literally, serve the central nervous system, insomuch as the lower extremities move the nervous system through time and space and the upper extremities interface with reality to the extent that it is within its reach.

I watched this clip of a wolf doing just this on some nature show and it was impressive.  The hunt was filmed from high above in a helocopter and the picture was zoomed in.  A beautiful white wolf bounds out of the bushes and spookes a deer somewhere up in Alaska.  But instead of trying to put on speed, it just loped behind the frightened deer, staying in sight of it as it tried to get away.  Eventually after fifteen miles the deer stumbled and tripped and spilled onto the ground at which point the wolf turned on the speed.  It was over.

Perhaps a form of sexual selection as well, Africans developed bigger proportions to further increase the chances of finding a mate within a demanding and hostile landscape.<br>Also another form of sexual selection is that people in West Europe and Scandinavia developed certain traits but for a slightly different reason, in those regions reproduction was even more scarce and hard to come by mainly due to the extreme cold and dangerous animals so... to counter act this they evolved blonde and red hair and coloured eyes, to attract more males easier. So they seemed different and more interesting than other people in Eroupe with the normal brown and black hairs/eyes. However today the colour of your hair or eyes does not mean\u00a0that those people are more attractive than others because today we have make up, clothes, perfume ETC.<br>Africans (similar to Asians) did not necessarily evolve different hair or eye colours because they did not have to, they lived in bigger groups and on one massive continent rather than the small reigon of Europe and neighboring small islands. Also having no or limited other people to compete with sexually so the dominant gene of black hair was superior.<br>Sorry got carried away with biological anthropology.", "comment_date": "2015-02-16T10:31:25Z", "likes_count": 86}, {"comment_by": "Dingleberry Tech", "comment_text": "Yaym Vsauce says I have a nice bum.

Because of this, it&#39;s probably the most efficient way of commute. If you put your leg out to take a step, you change the weight distribution. Extending the other foot upwards, changes the centre of gravity as you push, you change the angle of your body and gravity pulls at a different rate throughout this angle causing forward momentum. As your extended foot hit&#39;s the ground, your upper body is still moving, and you just need to let inertia do it&#39;s work to &quot;pull&quot; your body. The leg that is now extended, just has to fall and swing forward. This process is repeated, and you find that very little muscle is needed for movement. To make it even more efficient, you can just change your center of gravity by pushing your hips out to the point where it feels like you will fall if you don&#39;t extend a leg. Keeping your hips forward from your torso, allows gravity to assist your forward movement. I like to think of it as the body&#39;s natural gyroscope. Returning your hips to regular position slows and stops your momentum. I&#39;m confident that utilising forward momentum and gravity in this manner would allow someone to run great distances without loosing their breath because very little work needs to be done by the muscles, therefore heart rate wouldn&#39;t rise as much which means less oxygen is needed than someone who runs by pulling themselves with one leg while pushing with the other.", "comment_date": "2014-02-15T03:50:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "orangesims", "comment_text": "So.. does all this talk of butts make this an episode of Buttsauce, instead?\u00a0\u0ca0_\u0ca0", "comment_date": "2014-02-15T03:28:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CBA", "comment_text": "You know that moment when you have TMJ but you still eat hard chocolate because you love chocolate.", "comment_date": "2014-02-15T03:03:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "luke cox", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKg9Vl_Wg5U&amp;t=8m26s\">8:26</a> reminds me of 300", "comment_date": "2014-02-15T02:45:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "amyisaway", "comment_text": "Did <a href=\"http://youtu.be/xKg9Vl_Wg5U?t=8m15s\">8:15</a> scare anyone else??", "comment_date": "2014-02-14T22:27:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Draon Claw", "comment_text": "My butts to fabulous for you", "comment_date": "2014-02-14T20:56:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yukiko Asuka", "comment_text": "That Swedish document at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKg9Vl_Wg5U&amp;t=01m24s\">01:24</a>", "comment_date": "2014-02-14T20:32:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Norbert Rivera", "comment_text": "Great video,as always", "comment_date": "2014-02-14T20:12:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nxander23", "comment_text": "whats the outro song??", "comment_date": "2014-02-14T18:53:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danik S", "comment_text": "endurance my ass i cant breathe after 10 seconds of sprinting.", "comment_date": "2014-02-14T14:24:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aWorldview", "comment_text": "I can run faster than fruit too, not only vegetables.

Now this wouldn&#39;t be an issue but investigations into Sport Relief and Comic Relief have found that the industries that both charities invest most heavily into are in fact the arms trade and the nicotine and tobacco industries, two industries that cause many of the problems that both charities, but particularly Comic Relief, are meant to be solving, because they yield the best and safest return on their investments. Honestly, if you want to help local communities in the way that Sports Relief is meant to, then support local charitable organisations and programmes with your own money directly, and always be sure to investigate how any given charity spends the money that you invest.<br><br>Again, I never like downing on people trying to do the right thing, but frankly investing money into arms and tobacco with money meant to help people and children who are starving or have physical or mental disabilities is not how I would want my donations to be used, even if it is for a good aim further down the road.", "comment_date": "2014-01-08T17:21:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danger Angelous", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKg9Vl_Wg5U&amp;t=8m25s\">8:25</a> RUN!!!
