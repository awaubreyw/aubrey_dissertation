And so the king and all the people dedicated the Temple of God. 6 The priests took their assigned positions, and so did the Levites who were singing, \u201cHis faithful love endures forever!\u201d They accompanied the singing with music from the instruments King David had made for praising the Lord. Across from the Levites, the priests blew the trumpets, while all Israel stood.<br><br>7 Solomon then consecrated the central area of the courtyard in front of the Lord\u2019s Temple. He offered burnt offerings and the fat of peace offerings there, because the bronze altar he had built could not hold all the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and sacrificial fat.<br><br>8 For the next seven days Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters.[a] A large congregation had gathered from as far away as Lebo-hamath in the north and the Brook of Egypt in the south. 9 On the eighth day they had a closing ceremony, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the Festival of Shelters for seven days. 10 Then at the end of the celebration,[b] Solomon sent the people home. They were all joyful and glad because the Lord had been so good to David and to Solomon and to his people Israel.<br><br>The Lord\u2019s Response to Solomon<br>11 So Solomon finished the Temple of the Lord, as well as the royal palace. He completed everything he had planned to do in the construction of the Temple and the palace. 12 Then one night the Lord appeared to Solomon and said,<br><br>\u201cI have heard your prayer and have chosen this Temple as the place for making sacrifices. 13 At times I might shut up the heavens so that no rain falls, or command grasshoppers to devour your crops, or send plagues among you. 14 Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land. 15 My eyes will be open and my ears attentive to every prayer made in this place. 16 For I have chosen this Temple and set it apart to be holy\u2014a place where my name will be honored forever. I will always watch over it, for it is dear to my heart.<br><br>17 \u201cAs for you, if you faithfully follow me as David your father did, obeying all my commands, decrees, and regulations, 18 then I will establish the throne of your dynasty. For I made this covenant with your father, David, when I said, \u2018One of your descendants will always rule over Israel.\u2019<br><br>19 \u201cBut if you or your descendants abandon me and disobey the decrees and commands I have given you, and if you serve and worship other gods, 20 then I will uproot the people from this land that I have given them. I will reject this Temple that I have made holy to honor my name. I will make it an object of mockery and ridicule among the nations. 21 And though this Temple is impressive now, all who pass by will be appalled. They will ask, \u2018Why did the Lord do such terrible things to this land and to this Temple?\u2019<br><br>22 \u201cAnd the answer will be, \u2018Because his people abandoned the Lord, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt, and they worshiped other gods instead and bowed down to them. That is why he has brought all these disasters on them.\u2019\u201d", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T10:58:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gian TV", "comment_text": "O.O", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T10:33:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ckrux", "comment_text": "This guy fooled us all!

We&#39;ve broken God&#39;s holy and perfect law. Just like in today&#39;s world if you commit just one crime, you have to serve time in jail. We commit crimes (sin) everyday. Do you think we don&#39;t deserve to pay for them? We have to! The Bible says the wages of our sin is death. Death in hell. But you see, God is a good God, He&#39;s not just going to send us to hell. I mean, what father wants his children to suffer? Jesus came down 2000 years ago and died for sins He didn&#39;t even commit. He&#39;s taken the death sentence off of us by washing away our sins through His death on the cross. Even after all that it&#39;s our choice to follow God or not. It&#39;s totally up to you, but I hope you make the right choice. You won&#39;t care for the cure if you don&#39;t know about the disease. Our disease is sin, the deadliest disease ever. Christ is the cure!

Things don&#39;t &quot;come into being&quot; in the future or recede into the past - that&#39;s just an illusion. All of it exists right now, has since the beginning of space time, and never goes away. We just &quot;travel&quot; through it, and it is only our experience that makes it seem as if there&#39;s a difference between past and future, and hence an experience of &quot;time.&quot;<br>Think of the entirety of spacetime as being a giant loaf of bread - at one crust slice is the start of spacetime, and the other crust slice is the end of spacetime. But the entire loaf exists all at once and came out of the oven fully baked - it&#39;s not changing at all. Imagine a tiny ant starting at the beginning crust and eating it&#39;s way through in a straight line from one end to the other. It can&#39;t back up and it can&#39;t change it&#39;s pace. It can only move steadily forward and with each bite it can only get sensory input from the part of the loaf it&#39;s sensory organs are touching. To the ant, it seems that each moment is unique, and while it may remember the moments from behind it, it hasn&#39;t yet experienced the moments to come. It seems there&#39;s a difference in the past and future, but the loaf is already there on both ends. Now what makes it weirder is that the ant itself is baked into the loaf from start to finish so in a sense it&#39;s merely &quot;occupying&quot; a new version of itself from one moment to the next. This also isn&#39;t quite right, since it&#39;s more accurate to say that the ant is a collection of all the separate moments the ant experiences. It&#39;s not an individual creature making it&#39;s way from one end to the other - it&#39;s the entire &quot;history&quot; of the creature from start to finish.<br>Conceptually difficult to grasp with our limited minds, and this has serious repercussions for the concept of free will, but those are different subjects for different discussions.", "comment_date": "2021-03-26T22:36:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Corduroy", "comment_text": "Is his bathroom soundproofed?
