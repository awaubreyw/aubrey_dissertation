Part of the experiment was measuring certain personality traits of the participants at the very beginning. Even before given the role of a guard or a prisoner (for the record - the participants were randomized in those groups). The measurements showed that all of the participants fell into the &quot;norm&quot;, so nobody was more or less disposed to certain types of behavior. <br><br>Also, the part where Zimbardo told the guard to be more tough - that was only one time and with only one guard. The other guards didn&#39;t get this kind of &quot;instruction&quot;. And Zimbardo didn&#39;t want from the guard to be sadistic and evil, just to create a more military-like environment and to not get too personal with the prisoners (because in real prisons it&#39;s like that and Zimbardo wanted his Stanford prison to be as close as it could be to a real prison). None of the guards was instructed to be evil, cruel, sadistic. They were given a number of prison rules and were told to look out for breaking the rules and to punish the prisoners when not obeying the rules. The only requirement for the punishment was not to be physical aggression/violence. So many guards came up with pretty sadistic psychological tricks to punish the prisoners. <br><br>And speaking of instructions - the guards were instructed what to do and not to do with the prisoners at the very beginning of the experiment. As the experiment went on, the guards, not being instructed or something like that, but just because they had the power to do so, reduced the food portions of the prisoners, reduced their time in the toilet (and were physically assaulting them, while the prisoners were trying to do their thing. In result, the prisoners were peeing and defecating in their cells) and constantly told the prisoners that they were gonna cancel their meeting time with their family/friends, even tho there was an explicit rule that the prisoners can meet their friends/family in certain days and hours and this cannot be taken away from them as a form of punishment. Also, there was an explicit rule, for example, that a prisoner could not be held in the Closet for more than an hour. The guards locked up a prisoner for a whole night, breaking this rule, being too deep in their roles. It was Zimbardo&#39;s fault for not interfering tho. <br><br>As the days went by, the guards were getting more and more &quot;creative&quot; with their punishments toward the prisoners. And this &quot;creativity&quot; was theirs, not a result of instructions or suggestions from Zimbardo or any other psychologist, conducting the experiment. <br><br>Also, Dave Eshelman was one of the most sadistic guards out there. After Zimbardo ended the experiment, there was a meeting between the guards and the prisoners - in their normal clothes and in a normal environment. Most of the guards apologized to the &quot;prisoners&quot;, because they knew what they did was wrong. Eshelman was one of the few guards that did not apologize. And in this clip you can see how he&#39;s trying to downplay the wrongs he did to the &quot;prisoner&quot; (&quot;I didn&#39;t see where it was really harmful&quot;. Like, dude, you straight up humiliated young men for 6 days straight and you don&#39;t see a problem with that?!). And he admitted that he was making his own &quot;little experiment&quot;. Like... what???<br><br>Last but not least - an experimenter cannot tell to the subjects what he&#39;s really studying. This will f*ck up the whole thing. Like, it&#39;s not lying to them, but not telling them all (for ex. the hypothesis, the aim of the study, etc.). What Eshelman said (&quot;we were never led to believe that we were part of the experiment&quot;) is a nonsense to me. Because you see the ad, you go to Zimbardo, he&#39;s telling you &quot;Hey, mate, you&#39;ll live in a fake prison for 14 days, you&#39;ll get paid 15$ everyday for your participation and you&#39;ll be a guard/prisoner. You okay with that?&quot;. The moment you say yes, the moment you consent, means that YOU KNOW THAT YOU&#39;LL BE A PART OF THE EXPERIMENT. Like, that&#39;s basic - asking for consent to participate in a study. You know that&#39;s a study, that&#39;s an experiment. Playing a certain role is A PART OF THE EXPERIMENT. <br><br>Sry for the long a** comment, folks. But this video does not make justice to the SPE. The experiment has it&#39;s flows, crossed many lines, but it shows that a certain situation can really bring the worse in a human.

An observation I made was that the subjects often told the group what they were doing. How high they turned it and &quot;I&#39;m not going to let go of the button....ok that&#39;s enough&quot;. Which tells me that these people sought feedback from the group about wether what they were going to do was acceptable or not.<br><br>My hypothesis is that a bigger group creates a larger sense of anonymity and the need for feedback from the group would not be as strong. <br>Another hypothesis is that in a group of more evenly distributed personality traits there would be someone that has less of a problem increasing the volume and intensity, which COULD result in others being more willing to accept using a higher volume and intensity as well.  We&#39;ve all probably heard or used some version of the &quot;They did it, so I did it too&quot; argument. We all want to conform(heard mentality) to a group regardless of if we feel anonymous or not and that need for conformity can make us do things we normally wouldn&#39;t do. <br><br>The bystander effect also comes into play.

Maybe one of my favorite VSauce vids ever. That said, I had a couple of thoughts. <br><br>1) I thought your critique of the Stanford experiment was a little unfair. The first person, the journalist whose brother was the Army Ranger, I believe was a bit biased. Also, his army ranger brother was speaking from a place of extreme privilege. Namely, &quot;now that I got the desired outcomes I wanted (robbed and bank and received very little consequence) I am going to blast the science that got me my desired results.&quot; That was just a bit odd to me. I think the second person you interviewed, one of the actual guards in the Stanford experiment, really spoke to the actual conclusion of the experiment. This was a guy who decided during the experiment to &quot;run his own experiment to see how cruel he can become.&quot; Isn&#39;t that kind of the problem with abuse of power? People in power pushing the envelope... trying to figure out what they can get away with?? I will say it saddens me to hear that he is still receiving hate mail. Also, I do not believe the conclusion of the Stanford experiment, at least as I read it some years ago, was saying that good people will do evil simply because they are given anonymity to do so. And it kind of seemed like you were suggesting they were. <br>2) I wonder if your experiment gave participants enough time? The reality is, everyone has heard of the Stanford experiment and are mindful of it. Funny story, when I was in my early twenties me and a friend was part of a focus group for Jose Cuervo Tequila and I kind of thought it was some kind of Stanford experiment trick... it wasn&#39;t, but the point is I was mindful the whole time thinking &quot;don&#39;t turn into the evil guards.&quot; I assume your experiment did not go longer than a day for safety reasons, that said, I wonder if you would get the same results if you had an experiment that went over 24 hours, which I believe would give people enough time to &quot;live in the moment.&quot; <br>3) I believe there is a lot to be said about your conclusion about demand characteristics and how we should think about that today. What I concluded from your experiment is that if we put people with high moral character in positions on power, they are far less likely to be changed by their position even if that position is one that can lead to abuse of power. This should be studied by law enforcement, the prison system, and government. I think it could really help us become a better society. <br><br><br>Thank you for studying this and I hope a lot of people see your video because it is major food for thought!", "comment_date": "2022-07-11T12:34:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amanaka", "comment_text": "So you&#39;re doing the Stanford experiment but not actually doing the Stanford experiment?

It was february in Scandinavia and below zero degrees Celcius. <br>All would do the same tasks yet with some significant differences: <br><br>- The &quot;rich&quot; would keep their shoes and jackets, the &quot;poor&quot; would walk bare feet in T-shirts. <br>The &quot;rich&quot; would get many points from the same tasks, as well as occationally extra help if needed. <br>The &quot;poor&quot; would get only few points from the same task, which was occationally made harder for them. <br>Quite a number of both &quot;rich&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; were not pleased with the way the &quot;poor&quot; were treated with such inequality, but nobody did anthing to help or change the situation. All just accepted the world as it was, the &quot;rich&quot; being happy about how easy they earned a lot of points. <br><br>After these &quot;games&quot; we were promised dinner, but had to enter the building rich and poor each through their own door. <br>To our surprise the large room was divided by a barricade in the middle. There were tables and chairs for the &quot;rich&quot;, the &quot;poor&quot; had to sit on the floor. There we all sat, and we were <b>hungry</b> by now. <br><br>Now the food was brought in to a desk in the corner. Then the food was auctioned away for the &quot;points&quot; we had earned in the games earlier. <br>It&#39;s no surprise that the &quot;rich&quot; bought almost all the food with their many points leaving only a little and crappy food for the &quot;poor&quot; to buy. <br>After the auction we were all finally allowed to eat. The &quot;rich&quot; were having a party. The &quot;poor&quot; divided what they had but it wasn&#39;t nearly enough. <br>The &quot;rich&quot; visibly were having a great time and not caring about the situation of the &quot;poor&quot; except they would occationally throw half eaten leftovers to the &quot;poor&quot; who almost started fights over the food, being so hungry. <br>Then some of the &quot;poor&quot; were wispering together and suddenly jumped up and stormed the barricade  trying to get to the food, but they were repelled back by the &quot;leaders&quot; - &quot;the international society - so their &quot;revolt&quot; failed. <br><br>At this point the &quot;game&quot; was stopped, tables and chairs and a lot of delicious food for everybody was brought in. Again we were all friends, and feasting. <br><br>After this unusual dinner we had a long discussion about our experiences and what had happened both during the &quot;tasks course&quot; and the &quot;dinner&quot; auction. The discussion dragged on much longer than intended as we all had a lot to say about it, it had been a very strong and eye opening experience for everyone. Amongst others it had taught us how it&#39;s easy for the ruch countries to stay rich while it&#39;s hard for the poor countries to even survive. But more than that it also taught us how we humans can easily behave towards outsiders with injustice and unequality when in a group of equals, as well as apathetically accepting our destiny when our group don&#39;t think we can do anything about it anyway (until the &quot;storming of the barricades&quot; at least). <br><br>An eye opening experience it was, and a shocking one as well, to all of us.

When their express goal is to distract, the &#39;revenge&#39; factor could compound the effect and that would be really interesting to observe.

When they know the uncomfortable line is at a 7, and a back and forth escalates to that degree, who crosses the boundary first? In this case it was one sided so if the retaliation escalates to a 7 and the participants are shown that they&#39;re on the receiving end of an 8 or above, how would they respond? <br><br>Like soldiers in a war, a compassionate soldier would not fire on an injured and surrendering enemy, until betrayed.

In the experiment here, there is a sense of self-identification with the supposed other team. So even though they are depersonalized in some category, a person may personalize them by identifying with them through the category of similar circumstance. In the real world, although people may be personalized in some way circumstances vary such that people will depersonalize on the category of shared experience or circumstance.<br><br>Additionally, the idea of mob behavior is minimized here. It&#39;s been demonstrated that people will tend to assume a socialized behavior. The experiment with standing at random times in the waiting lobby demonstrates this. In some cases mob behavior will devolve to the lowest common denominator. Take, for example, the practice of following a car at a safe distance on the Interstate. If you learn this in driving school, then go try to practice it, invariably some third car will change lanes into your safe following distance making it unsafe. After a short bit of this happening, you realize that other drivers are treating you like a door mat, and you inch up to the car in front where people won&#39;t cut in front of you. This is why we have pileups on the Interstate when an accident happens. The question is where the line of safety is and the mob will agree on the shortest distance rather than the safest one and most everyone is socialized to follow that behavior. So the few people who are playing for power on the roads (&quot;I can threaten your life on the roads to make you do what I want you to do and you can&#39;t do anything about it.&quot;) effectively turn the majority of the mob into a play for power (&quot;Let&#39;s drive poorly to keep the jerks from getting their way.&quot;).", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T14:38:13Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Roscoeroly", "comment_text": "An important element was missing.

The duration of the Experiment was not wearing on the mentality of the subjects by any true means. <br><br>2. You pointed out that Zimbardo&#39;s language would attract a certain personality type, but then proceeded to do what you said he did wrong, but to a higher extreme -- you specifically tried to find passive personality types (for lack of a better word) which in a way also ties into my third issue.<br><br>3. The participants in the Stanford experiment were face to face the guards were able to see the result of their harshness/cruelty first hand. It almost feels like you skipped the power dynamic entirely - The &#39;alpha&#39; -ness , showing them who&#39;s the boss, belittling, even the subtler position of &#39;being in the right&#39; is left out - - though I cant think of a way to replicate the roles of a sort of Prison Guard knowing they&#39;re the ones not behind bars for doing something wrong the &#39;other guys are&#39; while still avoiding any sort of &#39;prepared task delegation&#39; mindset that one might think of as being labelled a prison guard. If the experiment was designed to see how cruel a good person would be with power, you neglected to allow for sadism (at least how I think of it as enjoying hurting someone but even more acutely enjoying seeing how hurting someone affected that someone), their behavior was retaliatory which I don&#39;t see as sadistic.. if someone comes up to me and punches me I get up and beat the living shit out of them it isn&#39;t necessarily sadistic until its clear they have no desire to continue the fight, In Jujitsu you would get a tap .. a better characteristic of something that might define evil behavior is being cruel without any instigation or just from the fact that they would challenge your authority <br><br>You basically tried to do an experiment that they did in the 70&#39;s in this day in age where any type of abuse of any sort is seen as so traumatic that you&#39;d probably get cancelled because of the treatment even if it had no real long lasting effects. People just wouldn&#39;t understand objectively the purpose of an experiment like that. Part of this is that if you take a person who has never had the chance to be evil, they may stray away from doing anything considered evil simply because that is the mindset of who they are, what would be genuinely interesting is to see how a person that never experienced being evil reacts to it when they can get away with it anonymously. People are very self righteous now a days, even worse than when I grew up, people are so quick to judge not realizing that giving a different situation, different conditioning, they would have a similar likeliness for doing things they consider shame-worthy currently. <br><br>Last thing was .. why a pitch black room is needed for anonymity sure the Stanford Experiment was hardly anonymous but I feel like having the power group wear masks for example could produce the similar levels of anonymity (voice changer perhaps). Besides it gives them a little motivation to be harsher to others because wearing a mask for extended durations is very uncomfortable. This would&#39;ve been my last point is there was very little motivation to interact with the other group at all de-focusing their attention onto another goal is as harmful to the credibility of the experiment as assigning the desired goal (in my opinion).", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T18:27:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ru Rome", "comment_text": "The expectation of performance is a factor", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T04:53:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ashzole", "comment_text": "This experiment is active today.

It&#39;s precisely because of the fact that we don&#39;t believe it&#39;s possible - that it&#39;s just down to individual character - that it does occur. We&#39;re used to believing as much in personality types as free will. Whereas studies like this show that those things are largely formed by environment and circumstance. Even Nietzsche said that the idea of a free will is erroneous, and that men are explained only by the sum total of their history, as well as the history of the world around them, and all the events leading up to their actions. Derren Brown demonstrated the same thing when he took an audience of people and gave them masks, and then they ruined a guys life all as part of a game show. At the end, the guy gets run over, and they take their masks off and realise what they&#39;ve done and are confused. And just look at online abuse. The ease with which it has become possible to exploit people&#39;s vulnerabilities online has arguably turned humanity into monsters. Race hate, sexual abuse, misogyny, all is on the rise precisely because of anonymity.

Here is why: <br>1. First of all you chose people with a specific psychological characteristic. It is not representative. A super cool person could have been influenced by a more gressive person for instance.<br>2. There was no feeling of Power over someone else. Which is something that is definitively a HUGE trait in humans. Well in any social mammals really. We are all power hungy; at least to a certain level cuz no one wants to be at the very bottom of the pyramid. The only thing that could vguely ressemble a feeling of power, is the power to annoye the other group, and even then, they couldn&#39;t see the results. Without any retroaction, one cannot get the satisfaction of feeling he has power / dominance over another, thus ruining the entire experiment. Take the catholic priests for instance. They took so much pleaseur in useless torture just because they were, like all humans, power hungry. And they even did it in the name of their god, a supposedly loving god, who would certainly not have approved such a behavior had he existed! You see how much power corrupts?

My mind is boggled by the lack of basic manors and respect I see from certain players. Instead of having a good time in the game by interacting with other players in a humane fashion, improving social skills in communication, building trust, story telling, etc. It seems the majority of the player base claims to &quot;enjoy&quot; being racist, hypocritical bigots, locked in a toxic state of mind in which it seems impossible to get anything out of them except for hurtful comments. <br><br>A typical encounter with this kind of player would sound something like:<br>rude player greets you with the intent to hurt feelings and begins by insulting your mother with a pinch of racism.<br>you kindly remind him &quot;hey, that was pretty rude what you just said&quot; <br>rude player responds, &quot;keep crying noob&quot; followed by an avalanche of kindergarten level insults, from a teen or adult. <br><br>This game also offers Role Playing Servers which attract players who want to have more positive interactions.

A even bigger step would be to have the participants put boxes with a screen in it over their heads where they can only see the other team of actors via camera who also have boxes over their heads and put them in a dark room this would keep their identities secret. I feel like this would give much closer results because as it stands the experiment here is lacking a great deal in seeing if random people are willing to become sadistic when given power over others without fear of punishment. In the second phase allow  the participants to speak to the other team via microphone and see if they will punish the other team with a click of the button or not but let them know that the buttons are still working and they can use them if they want and just see how they use the button if it is to give pain or if the participants will help the other team just don&#39;t tell them what to do with the microphone or button and just see where way they take it.

Part of that was because of the pressure imposed by the experimenters, I know, but it also allowed the participants to become more comfortable with their roles.  Still keep the updated guidelines, but see what happens as time goes on.  These people only had to do it for, what, two hours? Try doing it for four or more, and then extend that over several days.

Can people do evil depending on the situation or is it simply that some people are evil? Personally I think it varies person to person, but does that really matter? I&#39;ll tell you why it doesn&#39;t. A child molester is in trial for (you guessed it) molesting a child. In his case he brings up the fact that as a child he was molested himself, which became a trauma that caused him to molest a child when he grew up. The reason why his situation should NOT excuse him to any degree is because he gets molested as a child, so he molests a child, and that child grows up and molests another child. And so on. In other words, if we let evil have excuses then evil will never end because we don&#39;t see ourselves as evil simply by doing something evil. But the fact is that if you do something that you know is evil, you are therefore evil. Whether the excuse is trauma from childhood, the notion that God will always forgive you, etc. it is not valid because you still committed evil.<br>Lol and that rhetoric question from Dave, he knows it doesn&#39;t excuse him.", "comment_date": "2021-02-12T02:45:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marie Fray", "comment_text": "Thank You for sharing this to show that we have a choice in any situation.

If the &quot;other team&quot; doesn&#39;t push the volume to dangerous levels,  they don&#39;t have a reason to, especially if they know the highest setting will presumptively lead to their own hearing damage in retaliation. It&#39;s self-preservation NOT to play buzzer brinksmanship. <br><br>Thirdly, though the buzzer is annoying, it doesn&#39;t actually affect their ability to complete the puzzle, and there&#39;s not much verbal coordination you could do in the dark anyway. In the second half, the team is not even doing a puzzle, just &#39;pressing the buzzer&#39; - but what is the objective here? In the first half at least they may be competing for finishing the puzzle faster. They have no self-interest in intentionally distracting the other team for no reason, they simply do it because you told them to.<br><br>Fourthly, if you select a bunch of conscientious people in this environment, you&#39;re going to get a conscientious response. <br><br>I think what would be very interesting is a study where two guards are trained to act cruel, two prisoners are trained to raise trouble/provoke the guards/try to escape, and the rest of the prisoners and guards receive no instructions. That way you see the effects of peer pressure and how it could influence normal people to change their behavior to fit in with their &quot;group.&quot; <br><br><br><br><br>On the other hand, I don&#39;t see a problem with the original experiment&#39;s premise - after all, the people who sign up to be prison guards or cops in the first place are &quot;follow orders&quot; authoritarian types, so the people who would be attracted to the study may skew towards the personality types that would do those things in real life.

Think of them more as the &quot;inmates&quot;, and the guards were Michael and the Dr. in the room are the real test subjects. Us, the audience, play the role of the &quot;observers&quot; in the prison experiment. So you have us (the audience and &quot;observers&quot;), Michael and the Dr. (the &quot;guards&quot; with inconsequential free reign) and the people in the rooms (the &quot;inmates&quot; and victims).<br>The real experiment here is Michael and the Dr., particularly Michael, and I will focus on him for this.<br>So, the &quot;inmates&quot; here don&#39;t matter. They do have consequences in social repercussions of seeming malicious in the eyes of the other &quot;inmates&quot;. They are not free to do as they please and act in a malicious way. Proof of this comes from that they&#39;re hesitant to go very high with the sound, except that one girl who tested the waters by jacking it up kind of high (masked as a joke) and then never so high after that.<br>Michael, on the other hand, has no reason to hold back. He absolved himself from being the malicious one by saying he was doing it for benefit of the experiment, and the first chance he got to use the sound that he KNEW was uncomfortable for people to hear, he set it very high while saying it was to goad the &quot;inmates&quot; into retaliating. Did he have to go so high? No, not at all. He could have given a low sound for the same effect to just start a &quot;war&quot; between himself and the &quot;inmates&quot;. Additionally, he really did have absolutely no consequences because even if the &quot;inmates&quot; did retaliate, there would be no sound inside the room for him and the Dr.<br>By absolving himself to be above the experiment for the sake of science and the audience, he unknowingly fell right into the role of the &quot;malicious antagonist&quot;, and seemed to be quite enjoying himself.<br><br>This is why the experiment was a success. Michael had lifted himself to a position to be &quot;consequence free&quot;, and then became the malicious one as he had no consequences and could hide under the guise of doing this for science.<br><br>So is the conclusion that we are actually all inherently evil? I wouldn&#39;t like to think or say so, and i don&#39;t think this proves anything in that regard. I would think it&#39;s more that we&#39;re inherently infantile, while also simple with our interpretation of the world when good and evil are removed from a situation; as it was here for Michael. &quot;Good and evil&quot; are irrelevant because we, as humans, have defined what is good and evil. I would say that what is revealed here is that we actually have a very simple and straight-forward interpretation of the world when we don&#39;t have to consider consequences from someone else. <br><br>Think of Cain and Abel. True story or not, i think that is a story of Man in it&#39;s infancy. Good and evil are defined by something else (God), and Cain sees it as absolutely reasonable to kill his own brother for being having more of God&#39;s favour.

The precautions to have the testing be safe were highly laudable, but I believe resulted in some serious flaws in the two experiments. 1) As several people noted in the few comments I read below, there was no direct feedback of the response exhibited from the &quot;presumed&quot; competitive group after pressing the tone.  The researchers would sound a tone rather randomly, discuss observations,  send another tone some irregular time later, etc., but never seemed to directly reply in kind immediately as would be more normal in a real competitive test.  Hence, in both test groups, at least one person said they suspected there was no other group (possibly because there was no real back and forth interaction established?).  2)   I believe the test conditions should be the same you set up (doing a puzzle in darkness as they wished to work on it), but should have included 2 different groups at a time in 3 pairs as follows: non-aggressive vs non-aggressive, non-agressive vs aggressive, &amp; aggressive vs aggressive group members.   4)  Provide visual feedback between the groups (with no sound except the tones) &amp; giving group anonymity &amp; from others in the same group by having the participants wear hoods from the time of the personality screening.  The guard in the Stanton experiment admitted part of his motiviation was due to the feel of power over the other (feedback).  3) The tone used was only midly annoying and easily tolerated.  There are many more annoying (without increasing intensity) buzzers available.  The researchers start off the experiment by applying the buzzer simultaneously to both groups if none of the test groups has already initiated it after a few minutes (&amp; also during other extended periods of no action) but othewise, let them have at it.  Restrict the tone to only go up to a maximum level of (whatever is deemed safe with the buzzers in use) but have the controls set to record to attempts to use higher volumes.  4)  I believe the biggest flaw was the short time frame of your experiment (only 2 hours).  In interviewing Dr. Zimbardo, he even mentioned there was not much happening the first day in the Stanford experiment.  Have it last longer with more annoying stimuli, set it up with a desirable prize to for the winning group, &amp; I bet you would get different results.

The Guards broke their agreement by intentionally harming the prisoners so why should I care if I returned the favor? especially the main Guard by conducting his own little experiments I woulda knocked him the fuck out cold. I&#39;ve been to jail and it&#39;s nothing like this. The Guards are lucky because they picked nice people as prisoners versus people from experiences in <b>real</b> prisons. Those prisoners would have most likely fought the Guards regardless of it being an experiment or not. You picked prisoners that had good moral compasses. Try picking different people and watch the result change from the Guards in control to the Prisoners being in control. They could easily overpower the Guards. they were pussies with battons and sunglasses and just abunch of priviledged white kids in a university.... what kind of fucked up person runs an experiment like this? wtf were you trying to prove and what would you have done with this info if it had been completed? no definitive answer was ever given. This man does an illegal experiment and somehow doesnt go to jail or get sued? that SCREAMS white priviledge. The &quot;Guards&quot; could be liable for damages too in civil court for violating their contract. You wanna know what a <b>real</b> prison is like? try doing this same stanford prison experiment word for word in 2020... Oh you&#39;ll end up in there real fast.<br><br>They even denied a guy the right to his normal glasses so most of the time he couldnt even see and he got severe headaches that impacted his health which DIRECTLY violates the contract of not harming the prisoners in any way! That includes torture which it could have be viewed as in a court of law.<br><br>I personally think that Dr isnt a Dr at all and is just insane. In the movie which reflects what happened the &quot;dr&quot; was fucking his own students... what a real stand up guy to be commanding an experiment of this magnitude. He shouldve went to prison for real for this. Michael why the fuck did you even address this? I kinda lost respect for you for even thinking this was a good idea to try and recreate. Wtf were YOU trying to accomplish because I dont see it still even after your bullshit explanation. Even the &quot;Dr&quot; said you fucked up your experiement. All of this was a waste in my opinion. Why create experiments when you can just go to a real fucking prison? see it for yourself &quot;Dr Zimbardo&quot;. He only Stopped the experiment because his girlfriend was gonna dump him and he didnt want that. He knew what was going on, he faked being &quot;heroic&quot; the sick bastard he is. He is literally mindfucking everyone to thinking he is a good person.

There was no reward or satisfaction for their efforts. If the 2nd group look unbothered by level 3 or level 5 noise, I bet group 1 would turn up the dial until they elicit a desired response (which would be along the along the lines that group 1 wants group 2 to feel as annoyed by the noise as they are, so group 1 would adjust tensity until they feel the annoyance is on the same intensity regardless of level selected.) I bet it would have been different if there was a 2nd group in another room in which group 1 could see them.

Also, having that authority ranking over someone towards this experiment would&#39;ve made it more relevant to how real life society ranking officials can become easily corrupt such as cops, gov officials, etc. Even murderers don&#39;t tend to just kill for the result of killing. They generally seek to have that anonymous authority over someone, and is always more about using that power and going crazy with that.", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T17:42:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Demens VGC", "comment_text": "Quick disclaimer: I love both the channel and the series, but as a cognitive scientist I have to point out  a couple of flaws with your experiment. First of all you didn&#39;t actually measure the effect of personality. In order to claim that you did you would have had to include at least one group of people with different personality traits (i.e. aggressive people) and then compare the behaviors of the two groups. In your experiment you had only kind/mindful people so there is no way you could make comparisons and test your hypothesis that the non-aggressive behavior is due to personality. I can&#39;t believe that any serious experimenter wouldn&#39;t have realized that you need groups with <b>different</b> traits to reach conclusions about personality&#39;s impact in this kind of decision making, so my guess is that there must have been an &quot;aggressive&quot; group, but in the end it was discarded because it didn&#39;t produce the results expected (i.e. significantly different behavior than the &quot;kind&quot; group). The difference between your results and the original Stanford Prison experiment could be explained by a multitude of other factors that were different, such as guards having a clear dominant role, whereas both groups here were seemingly equal. Even when the participants were requested to act as &quot;distractors&quot; the power dynamics are nowhere close to those of a guard and a prisoner.", "comment_date": "2020-09-05T13:35:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yusuf Y\u0131lmaz", "comment_text": "I think that if they saw the enemy group before they started the puzzle, the results could be different, and in my theory, more cruel.

And the how they where expected to perform wasn&#39;t ever reinforced never got any feed back about if they where doing what was expected with the button or not.   but with the first one it seems like it wouldn&#39;t of been to hard to tell when you did something the researchers found interesting and that that would of then helped to encourage them as it would make the guards feel like those actions where producing better data which they saw as a good thing. so it encouraged them.", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T04:17:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maou", "comment_text": "You seem like a &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what&quot; guy", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T03:26:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anony Mous", "comment_text": "what the contradiction is is what we said in the first few minutes compared to what was stated and how the main guard was and how he acted and reacted to intensify the situation. if you give somebody power whether they are being watched or not they will take it and act upon it. more often than not people understand that power and abuse it regardless of consequences. though some people have sense enough to understand okay there is a limit. human nature is not a thing to be understood. everybody is different, and whether we like to believe we understand whats going in in certain peoples heads or certain situations, we honestly dont even really know what that person is doing, planning, if this is part of an act. i believe 99 percent of people knowingly use situations and circumstances to the best of their ability. main question is what are they trying to gain.", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T01:10:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wham Meister", "comment_text": "my main issue with this is that, unlike the stanford prison experiment, the participants didn&#39;t get to directly see how their actions were impacting the other team", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T23:33:28Z", "likes_count": 1092}, {"comment_by": "Tiny Raindrop \u10e6", "comment_text": "i dont like this guy but i like this type of content so i clicked .-.", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T21:47:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Victuss", "comment_text": "Also should have had people who were predisposed to aggression mixed with people who were more passive to test the potential for those people to be forced into aggressive behavior.

Participants didn&#39;t care about distracting the other team if they couldn&#39;t even solve their own. I think it should have been made simpler.<br><br>2) The buzzer and task were not connected. What I mean is that the buzzer was a distraction, but they could still work on the task. I would suggest directly connecting the puzzle to the distraction e.g. having the pieces give a mild electric shock when the button was pressed. This would hinder the participants to a more physical degree and create a direct physical link between the two &quot;teams&quot; similar to the guards and prisoners dynamic. I also think a progress bar for each &quot;team&quot; would&#39;ve been a good addition as it further connects the two teams and adds pressure to the task, meaning the use of the button perhaps would&#39;ve increased to actually hinder the progress.<br><br>3) From what I&#39;ve studied, I believed the original experiment was reliant that people would change based on social roles? They had been given a role and they adapted to it, becoming more violent as a result of that. Removing roles from a follow up and then comparing the two isn&#39;t fair on the original, as the original was how roles change people to go bad, not how good people can be bad anyway. Therefore comparison isn&#39;t really possible. <br><br>4) In general I think they changed way too many characteristics that could&#39;ve been transferred while still maintaining the ethical side. They removed social roles and changed the situation way too much to the point that observed effects can not be defined down to one single attribute. I think this is very unscientific as we are looking for change in a manipulation of an individual variable.<br><br>5) Demand characteristics were still all over the place. The second instance of the experiment was not even worth it as giving &quot;a task about working in the dark&quot; then switching the task completely would produce extremely unreliable data given it became all about the buzzer, which I would say is NOT a &quot;task about working in the dark&quot;.

The claim he tried to make based on the results was that the personalities of the people were the primary factor because they didn&#39;t act sadistic even when encouraged to. However, they were &quot;instructed&quot; VERY differently than the prison experiment&#39;s guards were. In the prison experiment they are simply told to be &quot;bad&quot; with no rules established for how bad, thus leaving them to draw their own lines. In Michael&#39;s experiment, however, even when the participants are &quot;encouraged&quot; they are still left with the rule not to turn their dial past 7. They are told where to stop, told going further would be dangerous, and they all avoid doing so. Yet we see people at multiple points eager to jump to the maximum setting they feel they&#39;ve been &quot;permitted&quot; to use; in the second group someone turned their dial to 7 the second the group was told it was now their job to press the button. Some of these people could have become much more sadistic in a different situation, and this simply was NOT a fair experiment at all.<br><br>And to anyone thinking about making a cheeky reply and saying &quot;no the whole point of his experiment was to be different,&quot; don&#39;t. I&#39;m talking about the second part of the test where he tries to expose the groups to conditions he claims are &quot;similar&quot; to the stanford prison experiment when in reality they aren&#39;t at all the same. In Michael&#39;s experiment, there was no indication that the groups weren&#39;t being monitored, and there was no indication that it was ALLOWED for them to turn the dial higher than 7. Also, Michael&#39;s experiment is far shorter than the prison experiment, and as mentioned that experiment took over a day to see developments.<br><br>I personally can tell you right now as a person who is knowingly sadistic that if I were in the stanford prison experiment, I would probably end up being a pretty big dick, whereas in Michael&#39;s experiment I would be actively avoidant of turning the dial higher than 7 because I would have been all but explicitly told NOT TO. Additionally, people not so predisposed to violence can also be made to act out of the ordinary by elongating the amount of time the participants are subjected to the situation, which the Stanford experiment did and Michael&#39;s did not.<br><br>Point being, this experiment is not sufficient evidence to debunk the idea that circumstance played a larger role in the Stanford prison experiment than personality.

All was in the Hands, off Ma Sheala and now.....It All endet by the pressing in , of USA Military.  So we are, the next after the Jakko Commune, just burned down, with Napalm, in the middle of the USA. Bhagwan, bevor HE left the Ranch. The total World \ud83c\udf0d Press, was invited for a long interview with Bhagwan. Direct in Buddha Hall, with many of HIS People, HIS Sannyasins. What the most from us, still are and will always be. This All, was about showing us the inner Nazi and people, where spying \ud83d\udc40 \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f on each other and enjoyed being in power, over people. And having privileges, being Part of the Mama System. Like going Shopping \ud83d\udecd, in expensive Shops. While we had to give up, most of our stuff, for the 2. Hand Boutique and from USA, the cheapest thinks we needed. And so on. It was all like in an Nazi Dictator World \ud83c\udf0e. Some where Kicked out. Not Abel to function, in such a system. Later Bhagwan said. That we are the only real Rebells and the only, real Sannyasins. Puh \ud83d\ude05 I was , one of them. That totally changed my life. I\u2019m more than thankful, that I was Chosen, to be Part of HIS most important Human Experiment. HIS great global experiment, of human Authority and the Dark Face of an Authoritative Society System. What we see global now, is Diktaturship every where. In Sports, Music , Kultur we have no Money . Only for Military. No money to the people, only the rich , more rich and more hatful, against people whit nothing. When you get the minimum Social money, us a pension. When you get money, for anything you worked. You have to give 70% to the Government and you can keep, 30%. So we get pressed, to not tell and become a criminal. Because you sheathed the Staat. But the money, we get, is not enough for our medical needs. Or our need for good food. No in Germany, you get a pass and then you are aloud, to go to the Social Help. To the \u201eTafel \u201e and you get the stuff, from the big Shops, from their Trash \ud83d\uddd1. Most fresh food, is already maultet. You can\u2019t eat that. And thy scream on the people and you have to take it. If you give outside, to other people, the things you don\u2019t need. They spy on you and they scream, that next time. They take my pass away. I don\u2019t go there anymore. I have some good shops and Market Stands. Who give me much better food. Others go in the night, to the super market backside and take, what is really good. And leave the rest of that, just on the next place opposite, of the super market. So bypassing people, can take it . It\u2019s all gone and clean , by the next morning. .

They wanted to eliminate our societal expectations of guards and prisoners, which while true that it MAY draw a certain crowd (that\u2019s not even necessarily true, it\u2019s just an assumption), it might as well also remove one of the key factors in the experiment that we do have a societal understanding of what these authoritarian and submissive roles entail and therefore have a easier tendency to lean into them when given the chance. Not only that, the participants themselves were subjected to the aversion that they could subject others to, which is not something the prisoners in the original experiment could do back because of the power dynamic: but also due to the societal understanding that prisoners are subjected to abuse because they \u201cdeserve\u201d to be abused. If both sides are subjected to same kind of abuse, it implies that the abuse is indiscriminate and therefore something that everyone can empathize with (unlike the prisoner and prison guard dynamic). Third of all, which in essence is an extension of the last argument, the anonymity aspect of the Stanford experiment works because it\u2019s one-sided.

If you take away the isolation factor and the direct interaction AND the prisoner/guard scenario, of COURSE you get different results! You changed EVERY effing variable of the original, but still compare them. This is not how science works. Yes, if you are a normal (or even a &quot;good&quot;) person, you will not try to hurt others (you can&#39;t see...and often even assume are not even existing) over a short time over a boring puzzle using some elaborate beeping technique. You have to ramp it up to get some reaction. You need to create adversity...like in the original. You do not have to make one team more powerful at first, just create competition over a price that is worth some action. And you have to give it time. In the SPE it took more than 24h to get juicy. Why? Because you can manage your feelings for some time. Otherwise you would be in jail already. When you lost sleep, are in an uncomfortable position, maybe hungry, in an enclosed space against your will, and then get bored or restless...that is when it gets interesting.<br><br>How do you make different conclusions? It does not matter, if you just turn evil by yourself, due to you having the potential to do it and not get punished. Or if you do it because you are told to do it from a person of authority. As long as this person is not threatening you, it STILL IS your free will to do what you do. And it is proven time and again. People are influenced by information, the behaviour of others they observe, or orders. You either have a personality that is firm and slanted to being &quot;good&quot; or you are easily influenced and shift your behaviour to that of the majority you interact with. Depending on you conviction to being a &quot;good&quot; person, this might go fast or slow...but it will happen eventually, unless there is some form of corrective influence to counter it. <br><br>You can see that in every prison, in every war. It has been proven over and over: The vast majority of &quot;normal&quot; people will turn evil if given the right circumstances, even without the fear of being killed if not. There is a small percentage of people that will stand fast and keep trying to help victims, but they will succumb to depression really fast, if not able to fulfill their own expectations. It&#39;s really easy to be evil, but extremely hard to be good. <br><br>I even experienced this myself. I was around 14 years old and playing with a friend. We were kinda influenced by the movie Conan, where he had to turn this giant wheel in the desert, while being lashed by guards. So we recreated it on a playground and a merry-go-round. One would be pushing, the other doling out lashes with a small rope or a small branch (nothing really dangerous...we were young, but not dumb). After a while we would swap roles. What we both realized quickly was, that each time we would hit harder. There was an escalation. And it would even escalate during the session. The longer you do it, the harder you hit. We concluded that this is a stupid game and that we stop it. But we discussed the repercussions of this and saw how this would end up, if it would be happening in a less civil, less controlled environment. My friend later became a psychologist...^^<br><br>Anyway, this IS easy to prove and it works. The concept does not hinge on the SPE being real or fake or influenced. It works.

However natural selection is actually the norm in society, e.g. the kinds of people that are found in certain contexts (i.e. a school vs. the army) are selected for by individuals&#39; own interests and proclivities. The pools of individuals that sign up for a &quot;pet shelter&quot; experiment, and those who sign up for a &quot;paintball&quot; experiment will be very different groups. Since in reality the appeals to recruit soldiers, bodyguards, gangsters, police, etc, all imply use of violence and force, perhaps a more representative experiment would use a term that implies violence, but then never asks for it, as Zimbardo mistakenly did.<br>2) I would imagine part of the payoff of sadism is the feedback one receives, i.e. being able to see and hear the results of your stimulus. These participants were sheltered from any of this &quot;sick&quot; payoff, however it might have made cruelty more alluring for them. The former &quot;prison guard&quot; you interviewed is surprisingly relatable, and I believe that his cruel interactions may have fed him a certain dopamine cocktail, giving him a positive sense of power--it was clearly a life changing and affirming experience for him. This happens to all of us even in harmless situations. Why is it so fun to knock people into the pool, or douse them with ice water?

Could a stronger belief in another team (eg showing or hearing another team) and running the experiment over a few days provide deeper insights?

SPE required a few days for behaviour to change as people need time to grow into and trust their new status. Longer time frame might provide deeper insights.<br>4. Perhaps giving the first team ear muffs as a quiet &#39;power advantage&#39; might provide deeper insights than disconnecting them from the &#39;unruly behaviour&#39; of the other team - eg still hearing the escalating buzzing but feel a level of power and protection from it. <br>5.

I think your revised &quot;Prison Experiment&quot; is not merely to be interpreted as the triumph of personality over situationism, or the triumph of conscientiousness over evil, but the breakdown of the experiment as a site of study. In our internet age, in the age of the selfie, the subject is now an avatar, always watched, always suspicious, constantly questioning the real. Consequences are delayed, postponed. It&#39;s some kind of pixelated or affective distancing from a situation. When Milgram did his experiment in 1962 and Zimbardo in 1971, the phenomenon of being watched was relatively new. In this time, people are more likely to whip out their phones to capture a hurricane, a boy being mauled by a silverback gorrilla. As such, I think there is a cultural element here: that your cultural context and preset ideas about the relative stability of the individual created the experimental situation and the results you observed. That&#39;s not to say the original experiments didn&#39;t have &quot;flaws&quot;, but that it is too simplistic to think about this within the regular personality-situationism spectrum.", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T09:28:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zachary Ratliff", "comment_text": "It would be interesting to look into this experiment with a third party of test subjects where the third party was observing the guards.

On the first day of the experiment, she told the children that &quot;brown-eyed children are bad while blue-eyed children are good&quot;, and enforced such notions with special privileges for the blue-eyed children and continually pointing out screwups any of the brown-eyed children did throughout the day. On the second day, she did the exact opposite. Now blue-eyed children are the worst and brown-eyed children are the best.<br><br><br>The effect was remarkable. The discriminated children often became aggressive to fight against the systematic injustices, but ultimately were demoralized or hopeless when the system re-established the powerlessness of them because of their label, punishing them or ridiculing them for their efforts. And though she did not demand that the &quot;best group of children&quot; of the day abuse and taunt the &quot;worst group of children&quot; of the day, they often did, some because of the conditioning that they were taught (that &quot;this group of people are worse, thus is fine to abuse/ridicule them&quot;; dehumanization is a little at play here), some because of the feeling of power, and some simply because the authority (teacher) was complacent in allowing the &quot;best&quot; group abuse the &quot;worst&quot; group. <br><br><br><br>These are often the conditions/reasons surrounding prison abuses.

I think the Stanford prison experiment\u2019s cruelty comes from micro mob mentality, rather than coming from the actual cruelty within people. I think when someone enters a group that is cruel to others, in order to prevent conflict they themselves will become extraordinarily cruel and break their own moral barriers to keep the peace. It\u2019s like this. Say you walk into Abu Grade, you are assigned to this position and your job is to be a guard. You look around you, people are being extraordinarily cruel to prisoners, and you believe it\u2019s wrong. You have two choices at that point. One the hard, but right route, stand up to the guard, tell him he\u2019s wrong, report him...only to get told by your superiors that everything is fine, he did nothing wrong(because they\u2019ve been covering it up), which leaves you with nothing changing but the guy you reported having a personal vandetta against you(best case). Or B, taking the easy route and letting it happen. If you let it happen eventually you\u2019ll end up having to participate, you\u2019ll become desensitized to the situation, and you\u2019ll end up part of the problem yourself. Most people would take option B, because people don\u2019t want to piss others off, and generally they want to impress those around them. In the prison experiment, all it really took was one guy going a little overboard, then everyone else in the group said, \u201coh so that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do\u201d and they started acting that way, and they started to play off each other in order to keep the peace amongst the other guards.

They treat everyone in a prison as the WORST kind of prisoner regardless of what they actually did. Most cops will act as if EVERYONE holds some sort of ill will towards them and weather this is a result of the attitudes of the police themselves or a demand of the job it really doesn&#39;t matter because it has become almost like a &quot;demand of the job&quot; that they HAVE to be this way and its being accepted, which  is the WRONG thing to do and the WRONG way to be. So the original experiment was CORRECT that the situation as well as the job DOES and CAN change a person and cause them to be more aggressive and or even more evil then they normally be, some because they like the power trip and others may feel that they HAVE to be this way due to some sort of threat to there person if they dont, even when thats not the case.", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T07:47:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wendigo Rabbit", "comment_text": "This experiment had multiple problems: 1) There was no human contact. They couldn&#39;t see or interact with the &quot;other&quot; people. 2) Their job was different. It wasn&#39;t to enforce authority over another person, but to do something completely unrelated- a puzzle. These two factors together COMPLETELY change the dynamic and the experiment. The Standford Prison Experiment was to study the effects of the environment in a prison. At that, the Standford Prison Experiment was far more effective and true to its goal. I don&#39;t think Dave would have felt that enjoyable power he described in this experiment at all.<br><br><br>3) The first half of the experiment is irrelevant and probably has a negative effect on it. They are made equals with the other team, which can buzz them back. Then, after being subjected to that treatment, are given the power to do it back without consequence. The prisoner of the Standford Prison Experiment describes what he had learned, being a prisoner. If he was made a guard after that, he wasn&#39;t going to act the same as the original ones. AND, who&#39;s to say the scientists won&#39;t switch the roles?

However, he does bring up an important point- that the scientists in the Standford Prison Experiment explicitly asked the guards to be tough and instructed weak guards to be tougher. That may be accurate to some actual prison environments, but what about environments when the guards are &quot;supposed&quot; to be humane, as instructed by policies and cultural opinion? And yet, their job is still to control this group of people- which can be very stressful. Personally, I think if the scientists hadn&#39;t given that explicit instruction, violence at the level seen in the Standford Prison Experiment would&#39;ve taken longer. In some situations, with pressure on guards acting out aggressively from other guards to behave humanely and a manageable level of prisoners, it may never have. But if the guards at some point discovered this power play to their enjoyment or stress relief, or if the prisoner to guard ratio became stressful, I see violence as incredibly likely even with policies in place meant to ensure &quot;humane&quot; treatment.", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T04:55:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trent Hollifield", "comment_text": "And now we know why cops are acting like they do now Bc of the power trip stand them down before they get over powered and hurt", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T04:28:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elma Robberts", "comment_text": "I would have loved to watch this series, but this presenter is too much.", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T22:19:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BeOnly777", "comment_text": "My only question?

But to get to the point, the main problem with it, happens that it is VERY common that this &quot;lider&quot; become agressive, REALLY agressive if the game is being lost, the theory is that this player feels that all the game is on him for taking the lidership and it will not tolerate failures on &quot;their team&quot;...

It could also be the case that there is low temporal validity as well, during the 1970s there was a lot of social change around the stigma of police brutality which in turn likely caused a lot of aggression towards high-powered individuals such as wardens or police. Today, though there is some awareness as to how high authority figures act, it could be argued that people today don&#39;t have that same aggression due to expressing views through social media rather than rallying against authority-induced brutality, which in turn means that the population in the 1970s and the population today differ in terms of views on how high authority figures should act - this would act as a limitation of the experiment.", "comment_date": "2020-03-15T00:44:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Deng", "comment_text": "Reply if you want to have a nice &quot;suprise&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-03-14T23:43:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrAJC5", "comment_text": "Zimbardo looked and still looks like an absolute super Villain.

Since you brought only people with passive morality, they didn&#39;t see a reason to be cruel, they didn&#39;t use the power to be cruel. What you should have done is to bring people with different states of sadism, one participant with the lowest sadism levels, two participants with medium sadism levels and one participant with the highest sadism level. This is important because, I think, the highest sadism level participant would influence the others to be a sadist as well, even if the didn&#39;t want to.<br><br><br>The problem with power is an unfair feeling. Think about this: People feel bad about themselves when they are a good person and gain nothing because of it, while bad people take advantage of others, doing the bad behavior and gain a lot because of it without being caught or without paying for the bad behavior. When you don&#39;t have power... Well, you don&#39;t have power, you can&#39;t be bad to gain with it, but the thing is, once you receive power, would you use the power to gain advantage as the other person? This is where moral comes to play.

The real problem in my mind with the jail one is that no one gets a job in a prison and gets to make up the rules, there is a pre-built environment with an inmate code, a CO code and institutional rules and regulations that co-exist, pulling both inmates and CO is many directions. Its the necessity of bonding with one of the two groups, the level of loyalty you allow yourself to commit, and the overriding demands of the system that creates ones position in the hierarchy of the jail. There is power of authority, power of threat, and power of influence being pushed on everyone all the time. Both COs and inmates are placed in a we\\they situation and both can be punished by the overseeing authority of the system. There is also in a prison a constant sense of fear and anger, of wondering when the next crisis will happen, being on the alert all the time. In Sanford County Jail the &quot;guards&quot; were not really at risk, which is unlike a real prison, also the participants were suppose to be basically level headed individuals, whereas in a prison, the inmates are pretty much all from either the bully category, addicts, or mentally ill, which makes that side of the equation very different. The rules control the COs in their response to inmate behaviour. The problem with the original experiment was that the Prof should not have played any part in the program and that no one can replicate a prison, it is just too unique and odd an environment. His &quot;guards&quot; would have based their behaviours initially on movie guard behaviour, and then as there was no negative response to their further actions, would naturally push their behaviour looking for the wall, the no go, the barriers that we all expect in any organized place. Having no restrictions would lead inevitably to excesses, at least that&#39;s my thought. I dealt with an inmate who had been a POW in the Vietnam war, and in discussions with him, he said that available punishments in the prison were laughable compared with what he had suffered and seen. That&#39;s just an example of the wide range of characters that COs must deal with. No experiment could duplicate that. I am still fascinated by this story and can draw parallels and it might explain some of the characters that I encountered in over 30 years working in prisons.", "comment_date": "2020-01-24T19:58:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uc7ac\uc6b0", "comment_text": "\uc81c\uac00 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 <br>\ub450\ubc88\uc9f8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud55c\uba85\uc758 \uc120\ub3d9\uc790\ub85c\uc778\ud574 &#39;\uc545&#39;\uc774 \ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0dd\uac01\uc774 \ub4dc\ub124\uc694 \uccab\ubc88\uc9f8 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc740 \uc2e0\uc911\ud558\uace0 \ub3c4\ub355\uc801\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub450\ubc88\uc9f8\uadf8\ub8f9\uc740 \ud55c\uba85\uc758 \uc131\uaca9\uacfc \uc2e4\ud5d8\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud56d\ud558\uc5ec \uccab\ubc88\uc9f8\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ub354\ub9ce\uc740 \ud589\ub3d9\uc744 \ud558\uac8c\ub054 \uc720\ub3c4\ud588\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc9d1\ub2c8\ub2e4 \uc2a4\ud0e0\ud3ec\ub4dc \uac10\uc625\uc2e4\ud5d8 \ub610\ud55c \uac04\uc218\ub4e4\uc911 \ud55c\uba85\uc774 \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc7ac\ub294 \uc880\ub354 \uacf5\uaca9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ud574\uc57c\ud574 \ub77c\uace0 \ubd80\ucd94\uae34\ub2e4\uba74 \uc880\ub354 \ud55c\ucabd\uadf8\ub8f9\uc774 \uacf5\uaca9\uc801\uc778 \ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uac00\ub2f4\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4\ub77c\ub294\uac83\uc744\uc694", "comment_date": "2020-01-24T13:37:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Micco Johnson", "comment_text": "So i know im late by a couple years. 6 days it took for the experiment to fail because the guards do take that power because if u have power over another being of course they gonna get evil.

I was sent to prison in 2004 for something that I DID NOT DO!!! wheater that I was innocent or not is not the question at hand here though. My question is while that I spent my 2 years in prison there were actually some guards that were actually pretty nice. However there were some guards that my opinion of them was I thought that maybe they didn&#39;t have any authority in their own home&#39;s so THAT was WHY that they chose to have a job as a prison guard!!! There were some of the guard&#39;s that the inmates took advantage of their kindness. On the other hand before that my two year&#39;s were up this particular guard ended up in some SERIOUS TROUBLE of his own because he was having sexual relations with one of the inmates housed at this particular prison. Then there was a young girl I THINK they said that she was about 23yo and her co-worker that had been working at this prison for about 15 years (not 100% sure of time he worked there) well these two were so mean that EVERYONE would get on their rack&#39;s (beds) BEFORE that they came in. It got so quiet that with 220 women in this dorm you could hear a pen drop!!! Now their was another guard that I believe had been working there for over 20 year&#39;s he was just up on the level treated the inmates with decency and respect BUT didn&#39;t care to remind you that if you treat him with such respect that he would have the same respect for you. This particular guard didn&#39;t mind letting you know that If nessacery that he would write you a ticket for breaking the rules if he had to. I still remember how nice that he was though. Before that my two years was up I got VERY SICK and needed to go be seen by a real doctor not just a nurse. Now I remember the guard who really CARED if that I was truly sick or not. I would go and see him every day and ask him if that they were going to take me to the doctor. This guard told me that he would keep telling them that I SERIOUSLY needed to get to a doctor.... even with his coaxing it took almost a year to get to see a real doctor!!! When I finally made it to the hospital I was admitted and stayed for three days. My diagnosis was Der&#39;ma&#39;ta&#39;myo&#39;si&#39;tis. Der&#39;ma&#39;ta&#39;myo&#39;si&#39;tis is a whole lot like lupus the main difference is that I get skin problems and break out into a violet purple rash and lupus doesn&#39;t have this rash. <br><br>Question&#39;s<br><br>1.Why don&#39;t you converse with REAL PRISONERS to conduct your studies?!?!?<br><br>2. Why don&#39;t you talk to Real guard&#39;s to conduct such studies!?!?<br><br>Well I&#39;ve been to prison and I totally disagree with the video that I just saw with people doing a study pushing buzzer&#39;s after you had pushed your buzzer. This isn&#39;t about buzzer&#39;s and people playing with PUZZLES this is REAL PEOPLE!!! REAL PEOPLE who have been locked up and been stripped of everything that they own when they first go to prison!!!! Hmmm prison worker&#39;s aren&#39;t all nice and aren&#39;t all bad!!! Before that I go I&#39;ll let you know something FUNNY!!! The individual that was the warden when that I was in prison embezzled money from the prisoner&#39;s food supply fund....the warden ended up in prison herself!!! LOL LOL LOL!!! I thought that it was funny because I kept begging her to allow my husband to come and visit me and she kept saying no. I didn&#39;t think that the garbage that the prisoner&#39;s had to eat was funny at all though......However thanks to the warden that&#39;s what ended up happening though. When I did spend time in the hospital the guard there wanted to handcuff me to the bed but there was a doctor&#39;s order not allowing it to happen. I had to have the sergeant to come and tell her that she wasn&#39;t allowed to do that. Now this guard sat in the chair and went to sleep!!! I wasn&#39;t dangerous BUT if I had of been a dangerous person she could have gotten hurt very badly!!! From what I did see on this video Prison IS NOT properly depicted!!! I did write the guard up for going to sleep on the job but her blue brothers and sisters found her innocent even though that they weren&#39;t even there.

Like the abusive nurse scene you played out in the heroism video, real-life versions of that could be largely prevented. Similarly, abuse in prison situations. Then if military forces gave personnel the questionnaire immediately before deciding who to deploy into situations where that dynamic might apply, or just on a regular basis so they at least know who to put in charge of groups if there&#39;s a need for mass deployment.

The conditions are nowhere near those that encourage cruelty or justify it and that is what the Stanford prison experiment was about. People can extremely easily become evil if it is demanded by an authority who provides money, justifies it with dogma etc. or is admired by society and that is what &quot;given the right situation&quot; means in the original experiment. That element was not present in this experiment and therefore was going in the totally different direction. This experiment is &quot;if we do not encourage cruelty and choose the most moral persons for the job they will not be cruel if they can choose to be or not to be cruel&quot; which is NOT what Stanford was about. Stanford was about persons being encouraged to do cruelty explicitly (they were ordered &quot;OPPRESS THE PRISONERS&quot;) and them having to fight internally and refuse the person in authority or submit which they did. The way these persons try to portray the show is intentionally misleading and they do one type of experiment and then talk about the conclusions that have nothing to do with Stanford being wrong like they somehow prove the Stanford was wrong. The conversation with dr. Philip Zimbardo was intentionally taken out of context and limited to what served the purpose of the people making the show. THe whole show is made to make you belive that Stanford is wrong but htere is NOT ONE SINGLE SHRED OF PROOF for that and even the hosts dare not to say that openly because they know they have nothing so they stay with vague and confusing statements that go in the different directions and use key words in such a way to make viewers believe they have &quot;proven&quot; something. <br>The worst thing is that these people know that this study does not prove anything and they still present it to people in an intentionally misleading way because they obviously have an agenda of some kind. Whether it is an attempt to show egoistic, self-obsessed glorification of their own personality who allegedly &quot;discovered&quot; that the the findings of the Standford genius experiment were &quot;false&quot; (which I do not thing is the case) or the organizers belong to some political orientation who was tasked to discredit the legitimate and truly scientific experiment of Stanford prison I do not know. Somehow, everything reeks of extreme leftist trying to fabricate &quot;evidence&quot; that the psychological findings of the past are not true by manipulation. These people are trying to undermine the importance of scientific discoveries on all fronts in order to gain power as power is all they want. I might be wrong but my gut feeling is telling me this is probably what the show was about.

This was so utterly flawed in so many ways!! <br>It\u2019s almost like comparing chalk and cheese. Both can be eaten but apart from that, they have very little else in common. <br><br>The prison experiment did not purposely seek out those with high moral standards. As pointed out, the volunteers for the PE were most likely to have lower moral beliefs, thus leading to major flaw number 1. You cannot expect to take 2 very different groups of people and expect the same result. It doesn\u2019t work that way. <br><br>With the PE experiment, it was all male (as far as I am aware) where as with this experiment, women were involved, thus leading to major flaw number 2 as men WILL behave with a lot more empathy when women are around OR if they believe the opposition to contain women also. <br><br>In the PE experiment, the \u2018guards\u2019 could physically see what effect their actions were having. They were able to get kicks out of being dominant and reap the rewards of their actions even though the rewards were negative. It gave them more of the sense of being powerful and in control. Thus leading to major flaw number 3, as with this experiment, every single part of that was taken away. They weren\u2019t able to have any physical interactions with the other \u2018team\u2019 which completely takes away those feelings of pleasure from being the more powerful and dominant team. They got no rewards to their actions and humans are naturally programme to respond to things that effect them in a positive way. <br><br>In the PE experiment, they acted out what would be daily lives in a prison based life. Natural variations were able to take over such as boredom and a stronger desire to fight back against those who were physically able to degrade them. This leads to major flaw number 4. Being in one room and away from the opposition for a short amount of times leaves little to no time for those same variables to play their parts therefore, they were able to concentrate more on the task they thought they were supposed to be doing. Also, depriving them of any light at all or any sense of day and night can put even the most calm people into a state of uncomfortableness, awkwardness and cause other restrictive emotions which again, will greatly impact on the results of the test. <br><br>Also, the 2 tests were so very different in how they were done. In the PE, the \u2018prisoners\u2019 were actually subjected to degrading, embarrassing and disgusting situations. All of these impact their emotions and responses tremendously as it will trigger the natural \u201cfight or flight\u201d reflex in humans and this lasted for days! This test only created a mild audio nuisance for a short period of time which would be tremendously less likely to trigger that same \u201cfight or flight\u201d response in humans. Also, in the PE, those \u2018prisoners\u2019 would most certainly have felt like their physical well being is at serious risk, again, greatly triggering that natural reflex to save ones self from harm. In this test, they went into it knowing fine well their personal safety and well-being would never be at risk. The only risk was being exposed to severe audio disturbances but again, would only last a short period of time. I am assuming they would\u2019ve known fine well that should any of them have shown any cause for concern, they would\u2019ve been pulled from the experiment.

I actually agree with zimbardo though that demand characteristics probably didn&#39;t play as huge of a role as others claim, they were told to be tough and enforce the rules in order to prevent people from becoming complacent and it becoming a cute little camping trip situation.

While people of the general public don&#39;t usually have any experience of being in a prison, it is still a place that people are aware of. Equally, people are aware of the kind of behaviour often exhibited by guards/people in uniforms, particularly with sunglasses through stereotypes which they gain from e.g. television media. What pushed them to be sadistic wasn&#39;t just that they were told to enforce the stereotype of a tough guard, but that they were put into the role. Wearing the uniform and being in the environment predisposes you to enforcing your role, just like how business clothes and being in an office make you predisposed to enforcing the behaviour that people in that position usually display. The people in this experiment weren&#39;t predisposed to behaving abnormally because they were I their own clothes and in an environment that doesn&#39;t commonly exist in the real world.<br><br>Furthermore, it is notable, that in the original prison experiment, most of the guards were willing to be tough, therefore establishing that the behaviour is accepted and even expected by the group (peer pressure to be cruel). On the other hand, in this experiment, the participants declared they unwillingness to be cruel with statements such as &quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that to my worst enemy&quot;, thereby producing peer pressure to not be cruel.

When an innocent or non-violent person is threatened they will defend what&#39;s right verbally, then as the abuse, mistreatment or misconduct is more applied and approaches the physical it will force the behaviour to change and go to a more defensive position... like that of any caged animal. Its feels danger and then reacts to protecting itself from anything that may be a perceived threat or danger to it&#39;s physical being. Big difference between the two studies, if you really look at it for what it was or in this case study, &quot;What it was not !!!&quot; This study was not permitting any physical contact between opposing groups of people.

In the Standford Prison Experiment, the guards were not just given power and anonymity, but they also had the knowledge in the back of their head that the prisoners were there to be punished.  I that&#39;s also something think you can see a lot with correctional officers today, who tend to abuse their power and treat the prisoners as subhuman. I think they also could be letting out a sadistic side of themselves because they KNOW that they WILL NOT be held accountable for their action. From birth we are surrounded by authority figures who have certain expectations for how we act, and we learn what these expectations are from a fairly young age. Whether its stealing something, disregarding table manners, ignoring our responsibilities or even hurting others, people know that they would have to hide it from other people who may condemn them, or find some kind of way to justify their actions. In this situation, hurting the other teammates could never be justified, and they were also aware that they were being monitored. That the lady in the second experiment who turn the dial all the way up to a 7 immediately. If she thought she wasnt being monitored by anyone, would the circumstances have changed? If any of the participants had felt they had been given a good enough reason, would they try to harm the other &#39;participants&#39;? <br><br>I think a better question for the Stanford Prison Experiment would be, if we give people a free range outlet to let out express their sadistic side, what would they do? How excessive would their punishments become?<br><br>Of course its unethical to try and recreate the experiment exactly as it was, but without the encouragement to act tough, but considering the way some prisons are run today, I think it&#39;s also possible that you may not have to. <br><br>For example, if you got together a group of newly hired prison guards and discouraged them from being excessively cruel to the prisoners and THEN you put them to work in the prison with absolutely no consequences to any of their actions for a short period of time, would the guards grow to start treating their prisoners more cruelly? Especially with prisoners who are particularly defiant or who cause a lot of trouble. Even then though, it does seem a little inhumane. <br><br>In this experiment however, I really do think that there is a benefit to testing a diverse set of subjects rather than just a set of like minded individuals. Humans are social creatures by nature, and because of that we can often times do things we wouldnt normally because someone close to us had encouraged it. So, if the question is whether or not you can &quot;make&quot; anyone cruel, then you would need some sort of variable to encourage them to cause harm to other people. For instance, if the group was split up 50/50 of people with high levels of empathy and people with higher levels of sadism, then how would that have effected the outcome? Take for example the second group. The first time anyone ever rang the buzzer it was contestant number 4 who turned it up to an 7, the highest she was told she could safely turn it. She seemed to enjoy it. Her attitude seemed to have rubbed off on the others, who seemed to have ALSO found it amusing. Then, after number 2 had taken over the buzzer, she held the button down for several seconds, partly out of revenge for the long buzzer they had received, and partly to laugh out of her teammates. That&#39;s a stark contrast to the first group, who had not had an individual encourage them or make light of pressing the buzzer. That group&#39;s conversation was much different, and none of them seemed to feel the need to press the button much if at all. Instead, they had from the begging (I think) Contestant 4 talking about how the idea of pressing of the button was immoral, to which they all agreed and continued to talk about throughout the test.  I think it&#39;s entirely possible that the stark change in how they thought of the use of the button could&#39;ve quite possibly been because of the first person to mention it, and the attitude they put forth surrounding pressing the button. (Immoral/Annoying or Fun/Amusing.) <br><br>So, if you were to get together a group of 4 people who all got along reasonably well, 2 of which being more sadistic and 2 being more empathetic, would the energy the sadistic people brought to the table cause them to become more cruel? Or maybe the empathetic people would hold their ground and become a sort of authority figure for the group, insisting that they not bother the other too much? <br><br>Theres just so much to consider", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T18:43:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris LeeWoo", "comment_text": "I wonder how many participants thought &quot;holy shit its vsauce guy!&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T16:59:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shocked Gaming", "comment_text": "Make more videos like you used to. \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T13:44:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Apex_grind", "comment_text": "Incredible show!!", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T10:21:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnson Company & Co.", "comment_text": "Holy fuck that guard they interviewed is straight fucked", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T05:41:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rumplefrumple", "comment_text": "what about the evergreen college experiment?", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T05:22:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trash Designer", "comment_text": "\ud835\udc3c \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c \u210e\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\u210e\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc5a \ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T03:40:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zech Newton", "comment_text": "This is the best yt premium series", "comment_date": "2019-06-20T03:25:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Solar Satan", "comment_text": "Make free videos please", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T23:18:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SirStrange", "comment_text": "Theres a whole movie on this for those who dont know", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T19:44:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Haris Jobson", "comment_text": "Rustin Cohle on the right at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KND_bBDE8RQ&amp;t=5m58s\">5:58</a>", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T19:17:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Spooky Gaming Channel!", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KND_bBDE8RQ&amp;t=12m45s\">12:45</a> failed clone of michael", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T19:02:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Acula", "comment_text": "I think the experiment could have obtained results more similar to what was expected if an air of competition was given to it, make the puzzle properly solvable to a degree, and have a public timer for both them, and the &#39;opposing team&#39;, with a &#39;score&#39; of correct pieces.

If guard tell the trainee that their safety depends on the reprehensible methods and abuses of power they use, the trainee would be absorbed into that community. The experiment wasnt nearly long enough to let an organic growth of abuse occur, as that can take decades to form within a new prison. What David (if I am remembering the right name) did and his explainations of what he did, extrapolate that the attention, power, and feelings of pleasing others (the researchers of course, but also his team of guards) made him feel high, which is the essence of power (control and influence over others). He acted as was the social expectation (both implied by others actions but also almost explicitly stated during orientation) and one could easily imagine guards of actual prisons falling into the high and socially validated narrative; you know it&#39;s wrong but you have other perspectives (a dominant one of those who know what prison is like) that allows you to justify those wrongs, and once you cross a line where not only is the behaviour expected, but the group is depending on your meeting that expectation, it becomes too far in to back out. I imagine the same phenomina happening with guards and even among police, where minor injustices lead to corruption of character where even extreme violations become normalized and the people dehumanized. <br><br>Here, I would say that it is indicative of a balance between an intrinsic level of capability and some measure of social and environmental corruption. David* may be an extreme example of a more subtle social force at play in real world environments, as people may take a long time to adjust and participate, and may take even longer to develop initiative in abusing their power, and so personal capability would remain, as one could quit the job or report on what theyve seen, during their initial introductions to the expected performance a guard is supposed to impose to fit in with his or her new community. Even in the experiement, it was implied that guards as well as inmates had a choice they could change at any time, even if those waters were muddied by indicating theyd ruin the experiment by leaving. <br><br>This social expectation probably works in a similar manner to the perception of authority and power in the Milgram experiment. And in some sense, within a community of guards or police officers or even soldiers, those of higher rank, and those of similar rank but many more years of hands on experience, are looked upon in very much the same way as authorities or men in lab coats. A mix of conflicting world views will stick with the individual until an experience trauma (such as seeing a fellow officer stabbed by a shank) solidifies and reaffirms the narrative of the community and its older authorities.", "comment_date": "2019-06-05T07:32:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kelly hill", "comment_text": "Ther is a factor thats left out.

But as a recreation/recreation of the Standford experiment, I think it was not too suitable. <br>I think this experiment has ended up being heavily in the latter mentioned approach. It&#39;s results are seem to be more or less about how the personalities work. My hypothesis about the aspects I consider affecting the outcome heavily:<br>- They deliberately picked up the nicest possible persons. This alone is a significant enough bias. They expected one extremity to turn into another. I think it might be due to the general opinion about the original experiment. We tend to expect a literal change of heart. But as I see, the in the Stanford experiment, it wasn&#39;t the case. Even Eshelman suggests that he was never really a very moral type. <br>- They&#39;ve given an extremely difficult task. With such morals of theirs, they would  feel compassion about the other team having similar difficulties they have and of course the don&#39;t want to make the situation worse<br>The moment they would start the ring the distractor, the responsibility would be on their side and on them personally.  <br>- It started and remained a hypothetical situation all along. They never saw the other team, someone just told them about it. Of course the buzzing happened, but as we&#39;ve seen, both of the group came up with the idea of the non-existing rival team. They didn&#39;t really saw each other as well, and i guess they have had previous knowledge about this kind of experiments, and the liability of the situation to imply actors, who are already told what to do. Again, due to their morality, they would never initiate something like distraction.<br>- It was a highly cooperative environment. They were tasked with the puzzle first, and was given the buzzers as an option. Their focus was on the puzzle, which was difficult enough with or without the noises. The first group clearly expressed that. They didn&#39;t even bothered with the buzzes, because it didn&#39;t affected their performance (as it couldn&#39;t be made worse). On the other team, #2 was doing the retaliation almost reflex-like. which is a reflection about her personality, and not the situation itself.<br>- The environment was really static. Nothing really changed. Hardly any interpersonal dynamics. The only kind of feedback was via talking between each other, all playing on the same side. The visual and situational feedback was never there to show them what effect they have on the other side.<br>Without that and without another team, the effect of witnessing others&#39; behavior towards the opposing side that could later on be used to justify one&#39;s own actions by or measure them to based on the reaction of the opposing members could never took place.<br>- There was no reward system as I&#39;ve seen it. There was nothing to compete for. This also lowers the effort as well.<br>- There were no marks of authority (like the sunglasses and uniforms) to give a sense of being different and more than the other team.<br>- There was no authority difference or dynamics, nor hierarchy among the members of team. In the Standford Experiment Eshelman quickly assumed the most dominant personality, and acted like the head of the operation. That could have pushed the others to trying to keep up with him.<br>- The experiment was short, without a set goal. As we could see, they were just told to go in and do the thing until they are ready or the time is up.<br><br><br>In conclusion, the setup has diffused the original experiments methods. We&#39;ve seen a different experiment testing different hypothesis.<br>The original environment because it&#39;s face to face situation was a &quot;me plus you vs them&quot; dynamic.<br>This version was a &quot;we vs some unidentified, faceless bunch who might not be even there&quot;.<br><br><br>But I liked how Micheal and Dr. Jarad have displayed the Standfordian results.

I had the same training as the correctional officers. They were criminal justice college graduates, ex-military and law enforcement. I saw the results of violence all the time. Violence committed on correctional officers  by inmates and violence on inmates by other inmates. I saw officers injured while protecting inmates from one another. I never saw an inmate injured by an officer  even when several officers had to subdue inmate violence or remove one from their cell. Yes, these are trained professionals but there was definitely a them or us mentality amongst all us staff, there has to be. There was plenty of of opportunity for abuses to occur,  if it did it was reported by other staff. The incident would be investigated and if staff was culpable they were canned. Inmates were NEVER trusted and really not respected much but they were not abused even in this adversarial environment. Make no mistake these officers are definitely of the warrior class but are not cruel. It was very obvious in that situation that there are people who are just cruel to others and people who will not be even if the opportunity is available. Cruel people is one big reason prisons exist. I know it may seem that I am biased on the side of staff but as a medical professional a child molester is treated with the same amount of care and respect as an 80 year old grandmother, just not the same affection.

Michael here. Where are your fingers? Seriously. It&#39;s a pretty easy question. You should be able to answer it. But how do you know? How does anyone know anything?<br><br>You might say, well, I know where my fingers are. I&#39;m looking right at them. Or, I can touch them, I can feel them, they&#39;re right here and that&#39;s good. Your senses are a great way to learn things. In fact, we have way more than the usual five senses we talk about. For instance, your kinesthetic sense, proprioception. This is what the police evaluate during a field sobriety test. It allows you to tell where your fingers and arms and head and legs in your body is all in relation to each other without having to look or touch other things. We have way more than five senses, we have at least twice as many and then some. But they&#39;re not perfect.<br><br>There are optical illusions, audio illusions, temperature sensation illusions, even tactile illusions. Can you turn your tongue upside down? If so, perfect. Try this. Run your finger along the outer edge of the tip of your upside down tongue. Your tongue will be able to feel your finger, but in the wrong place. Our brains never needed to develop an understanding of upside down tongue touch. So, when you touch the right side of your tongue when it&#39;s flipped over to your left side you perceive a sensation on the opposite side, where your tongue usually is but isn&#39;t when it&#39;s upside down. It&#39;s pretty freaky and cool and a little humbling, because it shows the limits of the accuracy of our senses, the only tools we have to get what&#39;s out there in here.<br><br>The philosophy of knowledge, the study of knowing, is called epistemology. Plato famously said that the things we know are things that are true, that we believe and that we have justification for believing. those justifications might be irrational or they might be rational, they might be based on proof, but don&#39;t get too confident because proven is not a synonym for true. Luckily, there are things that we can know without needing proof, without needing to even leave the house, things that we can know as true by reason alone. These are things that we know a priori. An example would be the statement &quot;all bachelors are unmarried.&quot; I don&#39;t have to go survey every bachelor on earth to know that that is true. All bachelors are unmarried because that&#39;s how we define the word bachelor. Of course, you have to know what the words bachelor and unmarried mean in the first place. Oh, you do? Okay. Perfect. That&#39;s great. But how do you know?<br><br>This time I mean functionally, how do you know? Where is knowledge biologically in the brain? What are memories made out of? We are a long way from being able to answer that question completely but research has shown that memories don&#39;t exist in the brain in single locations. Instead, what we call a memory is likely made up of many different complex relationships all over the brain between lots of brain cells, neurons. A major cellular mechanism thought to underlie the formation of memories is long-term potentiation or LTP. When one neuron stimulates another neuron repeatedly that signal can be enhanced overtime LTP, wiring them more strongly together and that connection can last a long time, even an entire lifetime. A collection of different brain cells, neurons that fire together in a particular order over and over again frequently and repeatedly can achieve long-term potentiation, becoming more sensitive to each other and more ready to fire in the exact same way later on in the future. They&#39;re a physical thing in your brain, firing together more easily because you strengthen that pattern of firing. You memorized. This branching forest of firing friends looks messy, but look closer. It could be the memory of your first kiss. A living souvenir of the event. If I were to go into your brain and cut out those cells, could I make you forget your first kiss or could I make you forget where your fingers are? Only if I cut out a lot of your brain. Because memories aren&#39;t just stored in one relationship, they&#39;re stored all over the brain. The events leading up to your first kiss are stored in one network, the way it felt to the way it smelled in different networks, all added up together making what you call the memory of your first kiss.<br><br>How many memories can you fit inside your head? What is the storage capacity of the human brain? The best we can do is a rough estimate, but given the number of neurons in the brain involved with memory and the number of different connections a single neuron can make Paul Reber at Northwestern University estimated that we can store the digital equivalent of about 2.5 petabytes of information. That&#39;s the equivalent of recording a TV channel continuously for 300 years. That&#39;s a lot of information. That is a lot of information about skills you can do and facts and people you&#39;ve met, things in the real world. The world is real, right? How do you know?<br><br>It&#39;s a difficult question, but it&#39;s not rocket science. Instead, it is asking whether or not rocket scientists even exist in the first place. The theory that the Sun moved around the earth worked great. It predicted that the Sun would rise every morning and it did. It wasn&#39;t until later that we realized what we thought was true might not be. So, do we or will we ever know true reality or are we stuck in a world where the best we can do is be approximately true? Discovering more and more useful theories every day but never actually reaching true objective actual reality. Can science or reason ever prove convincingly that your friends and YouTube videos and your fingers actually exist beyond your mind? That you don&#39;t just live in the matrix?<br><br>No. Your mind is all that you have, even if you use instruments, like a telescope or particle accelerators. The final stop for all of that information is ultimately you. You are alone in your own brain, which technically makes it impossible to prove that anything else exists. It&#39;s called the egocentric predicament. Everything you know about the world out there depends on and is created inside your brain. This mattered so much to Charles Sanders Peirce that he drew a line between reality, the way the universe truly is, and what he called the phaneron, the world as filtered through our senses and bodies, the only information we can get. If you want to speak with certainty you live in, that is you react to and remember and experience your phaneron, not reality. The belief that only you exist and everything else, food, the universe, your friends are all figments of your mind is called solipsism. There is no way to convince a solipsist that the outside world is real. And there is no way to convince someone who doubts that the universe wasn&#39;t created just three seconds ago along with all of our memories. It&#39;s a frightening realization that we don&#39;t always know how to deal with. There&#39;s even The Matrix defense.<br><br>In 2002 Tonda Lynn Ansley shot and killed her landlady. She argued that she believed she was in the matrix, that her crimes weren&#39;t real. By using the matrix defense, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity, because the opposite view is just way healthier and common. It&#39;s called realism. Realism is the belief that the outside world exists independently of your own phaneron. Rocks and stars and Thora Birch would continue to exist even if you weren&#39;t around to experience them. But you cannot know realism is true. All you can do is believe.<br><br>Martin Gardner, a great source for math magic tricks, explained that he is not a solipsist because realism is just way more convenient and healthy and it works. As to whether it bothered him that he could never know realism was true, he wrote, &quot;If you ask me to tell you anything about the nature of what lies beyond the phaneron, my answer is how should I know? I&#39;m not dismayed by ultimate mysteries, I can no more grasp what is behind such questions as my cat can understand what is behind the clatter I make while I type this paragraph.&quot; Humble stuff. What strikes me is the cat.<br><br>Cats do not understand keyboards, but they know the keyboards are a fun place to be. It&#39;s a great way to get the attention of a human, they&#39;re warm and exciting, surrounded by noises and flashing lights plus cats love to get their scent on whatever they can, a mark of their existence. We aren&#39;t that much different, except instead of keyboards we have the mysteries of the universe. We will never be able to understand all of them.", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T13:51:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P&W Geared Turbofan", "comment_text": "No one&#39;s gonna comment on how that prison guard participant clearly sounded like an authoritarian jerk?

You might have had them fill this paper out after the experiment but before telling them what it&#39;s about. Also the stated purpose of the study was see how well people can do a puzzle in the dark, the presence of buzzers with volumes that can be turned up to well beyond dangerous levels is itself suspicious. When you combine the two you nearly flat out give away the whole thing.  These type of candid camera stunts/studies etc., people are use to them. It doesn&#39;t take much for people to consider such possibilities and you give them two big clues. Three big clues if you throw in the second task being specifically just to buzz the other group unseen, which makes no sense for the stated objective of the study the group is suppose to be tricked into believing. <b>If people suspect the test is about their morality,  wouldn&#39;t it be obvious how they&#39;d behave?</b> This issue alone makes the experiment nearly worthless IMO.<br><br>Also I question how much one can trust such paper questions to know someone.<br><br>2.  No control group.<br>Let&#39;s say we can trust the paper questions to tell us how nice someone is. Why not test groups with more average responses or other profiles?

If you&#39;re in a group of bad people, and you&#39;re expected to be tough and to intimidate, its not just the anonymity but the social expectation on you to act.  If, for example, each of the four participants had a shock collar that could zap the (nonexistent) other team and three of the four were aggressive, the fourth would feel obliged to do the same.  And to a degree its likely that pressure would be felt by all of them, imposed by the others, or even imposed by themselves by their inaccurate perception of the other participants aggression.<br><br>Second, not seeing the impact inflicted on the recipient completely discredits the experiments validity.  With satisfaction coming from forcing the other person into submission visually, there is a greater incentive to act.  Further, to be faced with defiance from a person in front of you, rather than an anonymous second team, would drive one to action more readily.  Which is only natural; its a greater reflection of social dynamics practiced by early humans or even animals.  To defeat an equal or subjugate an inferior is something hardwired in us, because its how we survived.

The problem is that you have artificial and contrived responses.

The Stanford Prison Experiment is one of the most scientifically bogus in the game. The problem is that the participants KNEW that it WASN&#39;T REAL. Even their supposed outrage at mistreatment was still play acting within the recognition that it WASN&#39;T REAL.<br><br>I&#39;ve participated in dozens of these classroom experiments and without fail one or more showboaters exhibit a provocative behavior - BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT&#39;S NOT &quot;FOR COUNTS&quot;.

It&#39;s just acting. Showboating even.<br><br>Skinner and rats IMO IS valid, but you can&#39;t achieve the same with humans due to the vagaries of human response. In fact, in the college setting, you can even have participants biased to giving the performance or response that most pleases the experiment conductor. Look, I&#39;ve seen extremely competently performed experiments like this, where the entire supervising staff is stone faced and reveal nothing to bias the responses. That&#39;s admirable. (And necessary.) But you simply can&#39;t take such results and assert that they really hold.

What if &quot;Donner expedition 2&quot; had a certain religious preponderance? What if it had effectively vegans? What if one expedition was very cold, another was very hot, and another was neither? What if one expedition had people smart enough to figure out how to eat wood?

They just suggest what <b>may</b> be a result and outcome, subject to so so so so many variable that can cause your mileage to vary. Look at the voodoo that passes off as dietary science. Every few years they throw out former according-to-Hoyle gospel as quackery. I cannot believe that in my life that the 5 basic food groups and necessity of each for a balanced nutrition would be regarded as primitive, by whatever is fashionable today - by SCIENCE. Are bacon and eggs good for you or not? Until they have a 100% monitored 70+ year study, of every class (geographic, socioeconomic, you name it), they will always just have theories on diet, based on what they SURMISE went into that cadaver&#39;s digestive system.

In my opinion, and I really wanted to retaliate Zimbardo&#39;s theory ahahah, is that his vision is more accurate. Before I saw this episode, I&#39;ve seen the T01E01 of Mind Field that is about Isolation, and you entered there with a really good vibe, trying to stimulate your brain and everything, you did that in the first day, but then things started to get difficult, because you put yourself in an isolation situation and started having a bad time. This shows that the situation caused you to modify your mental state, and you even started to say that this soap&#39;s smell irritates you. I&#39;m also aware you said that your temper is mid-range, but I think anyone in that room would start to go mental, probably sad, depressed, but there are a lot of feelings we experiment because of the situation.

Now there is no evidence for me to prove my theory but from experience i&#39;m pretty sure i&#39;m right on this one. There is no need to go higher than 7 because you blasted with 3, so they can safely blast you with over twice the power level you used.<br><br>Where you to wait until they overthrow yours and match that or even go above it with 6 and 7 as a max, i&#39;m 99% sure they would go over the safe limit out of desperation in an attempt to get control back.This would probably result in levels used about 9 or 10, depending on for how long you would go on with the highest one used yourself.<br><br>2: <br>There was no feed back as to what the other team was like, how they reacted, if they where enjoying pushing the button or anything. Short: there was no human interaction, therefore no human response. To fix this you could have actors beforehand acting pretty, well.. douche, just like plain assholes who like hurting the others, evoking a certain hatred on the subjects. You could also have had the conductor come in more often and actually providing updates on how &quot;both&quot; teams reacted, this to give a little push without being suggestive. Also having a natural flow and responding to their own buzzers would have made the situation more real for the teams.<br><br>3: <br>Tell them beforehand that the other team has the task of disrupting you and you&#39;ll have this role the whole time, then you can let them build frustration in round one and with the surprise of the roles changing halfway through they will have a far more emotional reaction and sense of duty to overthrow and retaliate against the other team, resulting in dangerous levels of use.<br><br>4:<br>Another thing to keep in mind; this was over the cours of a few hours.

The anonymity provided by the Stanford Prison Experiment is more accurate to that which is provided to actual people in positions of power for relative situations like prisons.  The people in your focus group never got to experience the effect of their power and never actually had any power over anything, annoying someone or inhibiting their progress is not the same as making someone else do what you want them to do. You presented both parties as equals with BOTH being capable of harming the other. Even when you took away the power from the supposed opposition the presentation still does not actually give the test group any real power. Inhibiting someone is not a true obstruction of freedom and the situation plays out more like a game for the focus group. <br><br>A better experiment would be one where the focus group is given authority over another group (a real one) and is given complete power over them while both not encouraged to abuse that power, but also presented with no repercussion if the focus group were to abuse that power. There should be incentive for them to have control to make the  situation more similar to that of realistic scenarios. Most prisons do not have a vetting system based purely on morality; legal implications are considered, but morality isn&#39;t something that is generally evaluated for positions of power due to it&#39;s subjective nature.<br><br>Depersonalization was also not adequately represented in these experiments. Depersonalization is more important in regards to the control group in the Stanford Prison Experiment whereas you tried to apply it to the focus group. Depersonalization is applied to the control group in order to elicit a response of defiance which will then challenge the morality of the focus group. If the focus group has an objective that is being directly obstructed by the control group, then it&#39;s much more likely that they may escalate into amoral behaviors. The focus group needs AUTHORITY and the control group needs to challenge that authority; only then could you actually effectively evaluate the conclusion of the Stanford Prison Experiment. <br><br>Many positions of power also incur an environment that is explicitly impersonal. This experiment allowed the focus group to discuss with each other freely which presents an atmosphere of leniency that encourages them to be more nonchalant about the performance of the control group. They have no real bid in the control groups performance, so there&#39;s no test to their morality. I cannot say that a person is amoral if they don&#39;t hurt someone they can&#39;t gain anything from. For example, if I tell someone to punch someone else at no benefit to them they may be amoral if they chose to do so, but they cannot be confirmed to be of high moral standards by choosing not to because hitting the other person doesn&#39;t benefit them. They may not enjoy other people&#39;s pain, but they could still be &quot;evil&quot; in terms of greed or indifference to the well being of others. There has to be a self serving aspect to the experiment to properly gauge morality. If I were to leave a monopoly 100 dollar bill in front of someone to test their morality as opposed to a real 100 dollar bill and then say that the fact they didn&#39;t pick it up is a testament to their morality then I would be making an unsubstantiated claim. <br><br>Another thing to consider is social pressure. Let&#39;s say instead of having only people who score high on morality tests you throw in one or two who scored particularly low on those tests. If those two who scored low on morality tests did whatever they wanted those scoring higher on morality tests may be more inclined to behave in a similar way or may do nothing about it and are thus enabling sadism. <br><br>There are a LOT of problems with the experimentation here and I would really like it if this topic were revisited.", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T23:55:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hank Henry", "comment_text": "it was cheated &amp; biased", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T23:50:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Clark", "comment_text": "This was so unbelievably flawed in so many ways.

Working with seemingly immoral people may seem unappealing, but for the best results, it may be necessary even if the result seems obvious.<br><br>I understand using people&#39;s faces and describing them by their morals can tarnish their image, but maybe if the faces were blurred and their identity was hidden from the viewer, it could have made a better experiment to be viewed by an audience. It wouldn&#39;t even hurt to use volunteers actually inclined to sadism since no other team was actually suffering the noises.<br><br>Also, the fact that both teams believed there was no other team seemed to have tarnished the results of the second phase. No one wants to pretend to be cruel to imaginary people in a controlled environment, let alone a supervised study.

In every case, there seemed to be a moral confliction between the members on the justification of using the button or not using the button. This confliction is resolved through the consideration of three different aspects:<br><br>1) Their personal moral beliefs and accounts. It was obviously mentioned in the video that these people were those who tended towards conscientiousness and empathy, and this certainly played a large portion into their decision making. However, another factor not really explored is the fact that every member was demonstrated what a level 7 noise sounded like, which was certainly taken into account. Because of their own first-hand experience of a level 7 noise, they quickly concluded that they did not wish such onto others, with one subject even immediately outright saying &quot;I wouldn&#39;t wish that on my greatest enemy.&quot;<br><br>2a) Beliefs of those who can directly give feedback (group). Despite the great lengths made towards anonymity, there is still a large aspect of what others surrounding think/would think of what they&#39;re doing impacting their decisions. Due to these subjects&#39; high social regard, this alone surpasses the anonymous situation, and the fact of the matter is that these people are inclined to make this situation as un-anonymous as possible. Before any of them pressed the button, they always informed others in the group as if for confirmation/objection, to which they would change their action. One subject informed the others saying &quot;I&#39;m just going to keep my finger on this button&quot; to which another responded with &quot;damn,&quot; seemingly causing the former subject to keep their button pressed shorter than what they originally declared. It would be interesting to explore in a similar experiment, except one without a group scenario relying strictly on what one person personally determines.<br><br>2b) Beliefs of those who can directly give feedback (the &quot;other team&quot;). This one may be one of the biggest involved, and it&#39;s the fact that the &quot;other team&quot; never gave anything high. This feedback of what is mostly threes sets a sort of moral standard for them to go off of, and could almost be seen as an agreement reached between the two teams to not go so high and to instead focus on their task (the puzzle that the researchers are seemingly studying). These are not the people who would be the first aggressors to break their own moral standards and the &quot;truce&quot; they made to the others. Even when told that it was their task to press the button, this communication between the two groups in effect humanized the &quot;other group,&quot; which may have been a factor in how little the subjects pressed the button in the second part of the experiment.<br><br>3) Beliefs of those who can&#39;t directly give feedback (researchers). There is a sort of pressure towards their actions due to the fact that they&#39;re being closely watched, since it is, in fact, a research\u00a0study. It is clear to each subject that they are being witnessed by a group of researchers who are perceived to be higher up and &quot;superior&quot; to them in this situation, due to the fact that they are the ones running the entire experiment. The researcher that demonstrated the level 7 noise also seemed to imply her distaste/disapproval of it by, although slightly, commenting on it or agreeing with a subject reaction to it. This represents the whole research team as being disapproving of the level 7 noise, and due to the fact that even though the experiment is for the pursuit of science, they still feel as if they would be judged for their actions from those watching them.", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T10:37:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Myself", "comment_text": "I think one issue with this experiment is that the group was free to sit and talk with each other, and they also seemed to have some fun with the whole ordeal (even getting buzzed).", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T10:19:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jhibbitt1", "comment_text": "is dr jared bartels secretly Michael&#39;s future self?", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T09:59:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gabe Merritt", "comment_text": "Have to say that this experiment might have better scientific results and be more humane, but is far too different from the Stanford experiment to be properly compared", "comment_date": "2019-01-06T08:26:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Eric Barritt", "comment_text": "But in the second group some of them we more inclined to react.

Everyone in that room should have the ability to conclude that pushing the button = a chance of (stronger) retaliation = making the puzzle harder for us. The button doesn&#39;t provide a distraction.

No amount of Michael sensationalizing his new &quot;experiment&quot; will change that. That experiment is so widely taught and shown now that it&#39;s impossible to try to do anything similar to it again, and there&#39;s no feasible way of testing that without dipping into the unethical. The only reason why the SPE was so successful at showing what it did was because the guards had real, observable consequences on other people without having the other people know who they are. That&#39;s absolute power right there and I personally don&#39;t think this experiment, no matter what the temperaments of the subjects are, will ever be able to simulate that feeling of absolute authority like the SPE did. Ultimately, this experiment fails because, even if the subjects want to retaliate at higher levels, they know that A) the task they&#39;re doing is of no consequence (a puzzle) B) they don&#39;t see the results of their actions and C) they&#39;ll never meet the second group ever so why should they really care at the end of the day. <br><br>I also think this experiment was just simply too easy to figure out. Both groups were able to guess that there was no other group on their own, and to me that is enough to label these findings as inconclusive at best. Thinking that there was no other group can directly have an impact on behavior. If I think that there&#39;s no other group, why would I bother to push the button? Yes the horn is annoying, but the volume never increases above a 3 into truly obnoxious territory, and I know it&#39;s the experimenter&#39;s looking for a response. The only possible way this could have been done in a way that would yield results is to have shown the subjects how their actions impact the other group. Imagine how things would&#39;ve been different if there was a TV where this group could watch the second group where there only task was to press the button. If they could see the other group, and say they turned and flipped off the camera, they would be more inclined to press the button more and turn up the number. But again, you can&#39;t do that without straying into  the unethical. Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but I just can&#39;t help but feel this was a really poorly thought out experiment.

The fact that the potential for causing discomfort is, as far as the participants are concerned, a two way arrangement is probably a large factor in their decision making process where inflicting that discomfort is concerned.

The main prisoner happened to be a radical leftist who was planning to participate in order to prove that the prison system was unjust which caused the guards to respond which extreme measures of their own. Obviously the notion that participants were predisposed to be cruel doesn&#39;t make sense if some of the participants didn&#39;t even believe in the idea of prisons and their role was chosen by a coin toss.  I encourage people to read the actual study under the lens of analyzing responses to political actions from opposing groups. I think the prison study itself portrays itself as looking at dynamics of people fitting into perceived roles and using unchecked creativity to cause serious harm. The study itself explains that Dave Eschelman came up with tactics used in Nazi concentration camps and that the guards used psychological tactics to divide prisoners much like how prisoners are divided by race in real prisons.

If the testgroup plays the horn, they risk equal or harsher consequences. In the second part of the experiment, they have already experienced what it feels like to be tortured with the horn. Which increases empathy, which consequently defeats the purpose of dehumanizing the adversary.<br>3. the purpose is invert: finish the puzzle first. In the Stanford Experiment the purpose was extern: keep the prisoners disciplined. This is much more confrontational and more inclined to have the situation escalate.

Part of the sense of power is what the person perceives. For example in the Stanford Prison Experiment: The guards could see how their actions were taking effect over the prisoners which would have enticed more of this power behaviour. The guards would not have been aggressive if they didn&#39;t see or get the response from the prisoners. This behaviour is commonly seen in a workplace where the boss or supervisor throws their weight (Power) to get people to do their\u00a0bidding. The aftermath of their power results in people being shy, timid, afraid, cautious and these are all visible to the person in power, therefore this creates the need to exercise the power more and more creating the so-called evil described in the Stanford Prison Experiment.<br><br>2) You never adjusted the volume to properly reenact human behaviour and choice. Because you always made it volume 3 out of the potential 1-12 there&#39;s no sense that the &#39;other team&#39; were being spiteful or malicious. If the &#39;other team&#39; were not exercising their power then why should anyone else do the same? The biggest indicator for this was team 2 where number 2 always pressed 3 instead of a higher or lower number due to the receiving sound being the same and saw no need to retaliate nor exercise any more power than need be, only creating an equilibrium.<br><br>3) Part 2 from both teams was a null and void section because of what I said in my first factor. One of the experimentee&#39;s even noted that there is no other team because no one got the sense of power towards another person due to no response. There is no such thing as power when you cannot personally gauge your dominance and influence over another. Power is perceived and not felt or measured in any other form. A few examples of that are: A nuclear bomb, if a nuclear bomb video has never shown the shockwave effect of destruction, you never saw the crater from the fireball, never saw a mass of water being moved and never heard it. YOU COULD NEVER gauge the power of a nuclear bomb. Same goes for earthquakes, I have never experienced an earthquake, therefore I can not understand the power of an earthquake. I can look at what it can do damage wise, but that is as far as my understanding goes. Again, power is perceived and without that perception, you cannot run an experiment to get people to maliciously exercise their power and rights over others.<br><br>Thank you for reading, I hope I got my points across.

Two participants from group two don&#39;t respond but participant two becomes defensive after that. The expectation pressures seemed to work more heavily on the second group where the single person changed the group think with their dominant or at least initiative taking role in the beginning. This carried over into round two where they just sat there and repeatedly pushed the button. Group one however still did not push the button. One person with a desire to change the outcome by moving the group think in a particular direction changes everything. Most of the participants in either the Stanford Prison Experiment or this one were resistant to changes in any direction that seemed negative or bad, yet once a single individual took the role of responsibility holder or leader the rest of them fell into a different mindset.

In the original SPE some guards played along and some withdrew from their role but everyone kept it up or let it happen until the school called off the experiment. The guard Dave Eshelman even understood this to an extent and said later that he was doing his own experiment to see how far he could individually push everything. Yet, just like the study of people in lab coats telling subjects to kill their fellow test subjects with lethal shocks, this experiment just shows that people are comfortable following along with, or listening to authority. My conclusion is that we need to have way more classy icons of authority for children to idolize for the future because this sh*t is going to doom us. And global warming, so there is that. I guess, its nice to know that maybe humanity will finally find a way to exist in peace by not existing at all.

In the Stanford experiment, the guards probably knew each others faces, but still remained anonimous to the prisoners. Second, the power: i dont believe that the Team recorded was given Power over the other team because if they buzzed the other team had the same opportunity to retaliate. In Standford, the guards had &quot;weapons&quot; and they could decide when to feed or not to feed while the other team didnt have any freedom because they were behind bars. In michaels experiment the teams basically were equal. Finally, the depersonalization: this is something they got somewhat right because the recorded team wasnt able to meet the other team, therefore the other team was not personalized, but like i argued in the last point, both teams were more like equals and if one of them cruelly buzzed the other team there was a probability that both teams could meet outside the building when the test was finished and things couldve turned out badly.", "comment_date": "2018-12-28T17:24:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kakashi Hatake", "comment_text": "Why is this free", "comment_date": "2018-12-28T16:50:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Inshirah - Revival Of Thought", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KND_bBDE8RQ&amp;t=26m13s\">26:13</a> Number 1 is so high.", "comment_date": "2018-12-28T16:46:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elena Roche", "comment_text": "The prison experiment was very interesting.

If the prison experiment wasnt considered real enough, well this is way less real.

This experiment in my opinion was too soft. It was a good choice though, we want to see if even people with the humblest personalities can turn evil when they get power, but there was no motivation to use their power. Nobody seeks power for nothing, they all want something. Money is what most of us want, consciously or sub consciously, hence a driving factor like getting more money if you solved the puzzle first would maybe show us some different reactions? Also a level upto 5 could have been used, to make the experiement more practical. We know that they didnt want to hurt the people, but that was just too soft.

The participants knew they were being observed. Why would they in their right mind turn the dial above what was explicitly told to them as the safe level. I&#39;m surprised a lady even kept the knob at 7.\r<br><br>2. An extremely small sample size number not only reduces the statistical confidence we can have on the results but - in this particular case - it is bound to have a qualitative change as well:\r<br>For n people, n*(n-1)/2 one-to-one unique interactions are possible. So one-to-one unique \rinteractions scale by the square of n. For example, with 10 people we can have 45 unique handshakes but with 4 people only 6 unique handshakes are possible. The darkness and shortened time-span of the experiment seriously limited these interactions further.<br>\r<br>3. The time it takes for people to become comfortable in their environment was not taken into account. Few hours may not be enough. In my experience, a lot of people tend to put up their best behavior in front of strangers or in a new environment.<br>\r<br>4. The original experiment took place a few decades back. Social and cultural changes over this period of time are bound to cause deviations that were not acknowledged.\r<br>\r<br>5. The &quot;prisoners&quot; should have been dehumanized humans. Not humanized non-humans. [To say the two are equivalent in such scenarios itself would require several studies to back the claim.] One consequence of this was clearly evident: some participants did indeed begin suspecting that they were the only group and acted accordingly. This went against the initial assumptions the experiment was based on.\r<br>\r<br>6. The interaction of the participants with the &quot;prisoners&quot; was with the group as a whole. There weren&#39;t any &quot;prisoners&quot; who were acting out individually. How people interact with a group may not be the same as the way they interact with individuals belonging to that group.\r<br>\r<br>7. At times it takes one person to start something and others then find it a socially acceptable thing to do, even if they had already been considering doing it. The sample qualitatively and quantitatively prevented such a &quot;first person&quot; from showing up. They could have added one dummy participant who could remind that turning the knob a little higher was always an option. Adding another one who argued against it could somewhat neutralize the bias that was added.<br>\r<br>8. In the second part of the experiment, there was absolutely no feedback for the participants to function. Which is why there was one group that almost forgot that they had to press the buzzer, while the other group kept on pressing the buzzer. This should be a pretty good indicator that the second part of the experiment had broken down!\r <br>\r<br>9. And of course, there is the already stated bias added by cherry picking the candidates. This may have given us some new insights by treating the original as a control experiment and measuring the deviations to establish some correlations with personality-types ... had the other parameters, been kept constant. Unfortunately, this was not the case.\r<br><br>I feel like I&#39;m missing a few points, but I&#39;m already way past the number I initially had in mind. Sadly, this is first time I&#39;ve seen a Vsauce video and felt I haven&#39;t really learnt something new.

Still to this date the largest, deadliest riots in American history. Which primarily was a result in modern day prison reform.<br><br>To this experiment, I scratch my head. To me you have three types of Corrections officer;<br><br>Type A personality... Strong... Aggressive.... Motivated... Task orientated.... Will do as instructed.... Follows rules, regulations and procedures to a point. They are usually too firm and hardly fair, nor are they consistent with the application of rules. If not closely supervised and used to benefit the facility, it&#39;s teams then this person could be an issue for the inmate population and in turn the staff and administration as a whole. Though some facilities may promote this individual, it would be a mistake. Hiring them to begin with was a greater mistake.<br><br>Then you have the Type B personality... Though this person is strong, motivated, task orientated, they are not commonly aggressive, they have the ability to be aggressive, but only use it when it is an emergency situation or when necessary to resolve an issue. They have the right amount of Type A gene. They are an asset to the facility in every way. They work with minimal supervision, they not only work well with staff and administration, but most importantly they work well with the inmate population. They are firm, fair, and consistent with the administration of the inmate rules and regulations. Which in turn is mostly respected by most of the general inmate population. Basically, the inmates in this officer charge know what they get when this officer is working their cell house or unit. This person is a leader, promotable, and works well in and with the facility emergency teams. From first level emergency response teams to the advanced response teams, SORT/SWAT and hostage negotiations. This hire, was a great move.<br><br>And finally, there is Type C personality... Not strong, rarely motivated, not task oriented, has trouble doing as instructed for fear of retribution from the inmate population. Will follow the rules, regulations and procedures, but are not strong enough to apply these rules and regulations to the inmate population on a consistent basis. They are taken advantage of by the inmates in their charge, they need constant supervision and rarely can be relied on for much. They basically fill a uniform and a position. And will inevitably be hurt themselves, but most likely will be the cause of injury to staff and/or an inmate at some point too. Shame on administration for hiring this one.<br><br>Bottom line..... You have three types of people applying for this one job. Hopefully the staff in charge of hiring these perspective Correctional officers ask the right questions and weed out the Type A and Type C and successfully hire the perfect mixture of the first two. A prison is a dangerous place. Having the Type A or Type C walking around is a hazardous situation. It isn&#39;t a matter of if someone will be hurt, but more importantly when and how many, if these two are unleashed on the prison.<br><br>So, this long winded comment of my thoughts with this experiment.....

Thus no such thing as greeting that feeling of seeing the person you &quot;harmed&quot;.<br><br>2. In the first experiment, there where no difference in the power and abuse between the groups. Obviously I wouldn&#39;t press the button over 7 against the other group since they&#39;d propably just do it back to me. There were no authority but rather you gave a group a bat and told them the other group also has a bat. Attacking would obviously be a bad idea.<br><br>3.

But for ep 2 all i wanted to say was that i couldn&#39;t really watch after the first &quot;test.&quot; Giving a homeless person money isn&#39;t necessarily good and not giving isn&#39;t necessarily bad. One, giving a homeless person money would be good if they were homeless for any other reason besides a drug addiction. Giving them food would be good because they cant spend that on drugs. Also if giving money would be considered good then not giving wouldn&#39;t be bad, it would be more of a grey area between good and bad. <br>One time i visited Santa Monica in trip to CA for summer vacation and a guy walked up to me and asked for money. I said no and he gave me this look of disgust. For some reason he picked me out of the hundreds there at that time. I was and still am a broke college student who saved a couple hundred dollars to go for a week and needed every dollar to survive there especially after some jag on the HW strip stole 20 bucks from me. He also looked somewhat high maintenance based on his clothing and hair. Am I bad for not giving money? no, of course not. Maybe someone was running experiment and he was supposed to be homeless idk. he definitely didnt look like it.<br><br>This experiment wasn&#39;t too bad the groups seemed to see thru the ruse to easily for it to be completely valid or pure natural behavior. But i guess its not really possible to run an experiment as long or cruel as the Stanford prison experiment these days unless you can get an experiment where the cruelty wasnt expected or a false study is done where the supposed study is for labeled a study of something else but is actually a study of cruelty.", "comment_date": "2018-12-25T06:39:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K K", "comment_text": "Cx", "comment_date": "2018-12-25T06:31:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OctoRust", "comment_text": "I feel that there are a few flaws with this, although it was more ethical than the Stanford prison experiment. My main gripe is the fact that there is no purpose to pressing the button, other than annoying the other team. Perhaps if pressing the button set the other team back more then just getting annoyed. Also, when people get suspicious it makes them do &quot;immoral&quot; things as they think that there are no consequences. To combat that I think the team should meet a fake &quot;other team&quot; so the participants get it in their mind that there are real people they were affecting, which was one of the strong points of the Stanford prison experiment. In the Stanford\u00a0prison experiment, the guards clearly know that they are doing this to other people. All in all, I think this brings up more interesting points, much like the Stanford prison experiment, but it would have to be conducted on more personality types to get better evidence for its claims.

They have a motivation to cooperate in order to finish the task.  <br><br>In the second stage there was no payoff.  The prison experiment gave a sadistic payoff.  They were able to see the suffering they caused and had to decide if they weren&#39;t ok with it and wanted to quit, or if they were ok with what they were doing.  Once they rationalized their aggressive behavior, all bets were off and they could enjoy watching others suffer.  In this version, they couldn&#39;t see anyone.  In fact one girl assumed there wasn&#39;t another team, so it just didn&#39;t even matter.  It was just boring.  How can you prove innate sadism without an understanding of what sadism is.  Sadism is not enjoyment in performing acts of pain or humiliation, it is enjoyment in witnessing the mental anguish that is caused by those acts.  A sadist gets enjoyment as a perpetrator or as a bystander.&quot;<br><br>Upon further reflection, I have an Idea for way to test this more soundly.  You see, we have a way to create realities without the ethical dilemmas traditional real life situations can create.  Computer simulations!  Namely computer games.<br><br>The scenario should as such:<br><br>ABSTRACT:<br>Test subjects should be put into a game-play situation involving a cooperative non-zero sum game.  There should be a real world payoff for completing the game, but as is is non-zero sum, one player preventing other players from completion will have no effect on their own payoff.  Certain players are given an extreme advantage that allows them to deprive another player of their payoff.  The reactions of the victimized player can be seen by the perpetrator.  Players can not identify each other and all players understand that no-one else in the real world will see this.<br><br>EXAMPLE:<br><br>Find an older 3D game that uses an easily modifiable and skinnable  engine.  Create a game that is a cooperative zombie apocalypse survival 1st person shooter.  In this game there are 2 playable unit types, sniper and a melee respectively.  The opponent is an AI zombie horde.  both units should be balanced such that their unique traits give them an equal difficulty against the zombies, but against each other the sniper unit easily outmatches the melee unit.  For example, the sniper can easily kill unarmored and lightly armored units from a distance, but is slow moving and can only fire at a slow rate.  The melee unit can kill unarmored units easily and can move fast but can&#39;t do much against armored units.  both units have armor and zombies are unarmored.  Create an in-game messaging feature where each player can communicate, or use a headset capability.  (The headset doesn&#39;t even need to be a game feature, the appearance should suffice)<br><br>Next, bring in test subjects into a room with a single gaming console.  The cover story is: a gaming studio is alpha testing a game involving cooperative play.  At this point, all they are testing is the AI and game physics.  The game is far from completion and the graphics are super basic.  Because the game lacks in features, the R&amp;D team recognizes that the players may get bored and not be engaged (This also means that few resources need to be applied to creating a polished game).  To compensate for an unfinished game, each player starts with 100 lives and at the conclusion, they will receive $1 for each remaining life.  The researchers go over the basic game mechanics stating that it is meant to mimic real world cooperative survival with open world game play.  Players can be killed by zombies as well as other players.  Players can team up, or go it alone, depending on how they want to play.  According to the researchers, all the players are located in geographically different areas and are playing each other online. (Of course they could be down the hall in reality, but this gives them a reason why they cant see the other players). And last, the researchers require the test subjects to sign an NDA, stating that this game and everything that happens during the game-play is a trade secret and should not be talked about to anyone after they leave. <br><br>To start game play, half of the players are assigned each unit type, and game-play commences.  If at any point a player kills another player, the game should notify both players. Perhaps there is a feedback feature for player death events.  &quot;You just got killed by a zombie! Get better NOOB!&quot;  , &quot;You just go killed by PlayerX! Sucks to be You&quot;, &quot;You just shot PlayerY. Oh well&quot;.  This guarantees they understand what just happened, re-enforces the game creators&#39;s neutral stance on Player V Player death,  and most importantly gives them an opportunity for retaliation.  A that point if a melee play attempts to retaliate and kill a sniper, the imbalance will become crystal clear.  To make sure this happens, there should be a researcher playing in game as an agent provocateur in case no-one gets the idea to kill another player.<br><br>The goal is to see that, once the players discover the power dynamic on their own, will the players with power use it to deprive the other players of their $100?  If the snipers can run around sniping the melee units with no repercussion, will their inner sadistic impulses surface and cause them to antagonize other players for the LOLs, even knowing that there is a real world result?  This would remove all of the issues with both the Stanford experiment and this new Vsauce version.  Demand characteristics would not be an issue, the ethical issue of causing actual suffering will be removed, the worry of social backlash is gone due to complete anonymity, but the opportunity for true sadistic behavior will be right in front of them.<br><br>Cheers", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T20:32:32Z", "likes_count": 142}, {"comment_by": "Chelsie Frost", "comment_text": "I thought this was brilliant.

While it is quite likely that demand plays a large role, I personally have seen and even observed of myself that behavior is altered by what you see <i>others</i> doing or how you feel they may judge your behavior. If you&#39;re a more introverted sort of person you probably won&#39;t be the one to initiate a change in group behavior, but if you see others behaving a certain way you may decide to conform to that behavior for the sake of acceptance into the group. Potentially even if it goes against certain values you hold or tell yourself you hold. Or maybe if your convictions are strong enough you stand against group behavior that is not in line with your values/morals.<br><br>So, I think that an experiment that tests out this aspect would be useful. Have subjects that you screen for personality traits as you did in this experiment, but then place them in a group with &quot;actors&quot; who will either behave in a non-confrontational/non-aggressive manner or who will behave as though being cruel (buzzing at above a 7) is quite acceptable.

That is, if the buzzer didn&#39;t exist, but it did. You covered this in the first season of mind field, where someone would rather experience a negative stimuli instead of no stimuli at all, because being bored is that bad for humans. I believe this is a similar case, where instead of doing nothing and being bored, pressing the button was biologically more rational, especially after a participant said that she suspected there was no other group to buzz at. Overall, the Stanford Experiment was a lot different, like A LOT. For example, in that experiment even though guards kept their anonymity, they still interacted with the prisoners verbally and physically, where as in your experiment only form of communication was buzzing.

In the original, the most notorious of the prison guards, when confronted, seemed completely unaware that his actions could leave mental and emotional scars on the prisoners. He was 18... an adult. Yet today, my 15 year old son has a firm understanding of how his words and actions can effect others. He&#39;s grown up in a time of mental awareness. He won&#39;t even stand his little sister making negative comments about her body because he knows about body image issues and how prevalent they are, in young women especially.<br>Growing up, my mother both smoked around and spanked me and my brothers. None of this was done out of cruelty, but out of a lack of knowledge as to how damaging those actions could be to our physical and emotional health. Me, on the other hand, having grown up with that knowledge, I&#39;ve never smoked around my children and have employed other, more effective forms of discipline. <br>Take Reality TV Stars. In the earliest years, many of the people who volunteered to have their everyday lives filmed continuously, were shocked and quite frequently upset to see how they were portrayed. &quot;The camera made me look that way.&quot; They didn&#39;t get how reality tv worked or how they might come across once edited and broadcasted to the world. But today, the &#39;stars&#39; of the those shows know exactly what to expect and behave according to how they want to be seen by the audience. They measure their actions and words. Some lean into the villain persona while others temper themselves because they don&#39;t want to look bad.<br>In the original prison experiment, it doesn&#39;t seem that the guards really took into account that their behavior was being tested as much as the prisoners. I don&#39;t think they expected to have to defend their actions. They didn&#39;t consider the many aspects the experiment was looking at. Yet your test subjects are very aware of just what might be the real experiment. They discuss it among themselves. They guess that THEIR reactions to the loud distracting noise is the real test, rather than whether they can work together to complete a puzzle in the dark.

First of all, it&#39;s really difficult to say it was their &quot;personality&quot;. The participants behaved like they behave outside the experiment or, as you may say, as they were &quot;trained&quot; throughout their lives (the nurture x nature debate needs to be pointed here, like zimbardo did by the end of the video). Besides, if their behavior don&#39;t have any consequences (nothing happened when they pressed the button), then of course the behavior wouldn&#39;t occur/be maintained. People will use power when power allows them to get something (I don&#39;t agree with the assumption that people are naturally evil just waiting for the opportunity to be either, but they will be evil when they get something for being like that). The power you gave them didn&#39;t change anything to the participants. Your experiment just shows that consequences matter, something that psychologists have known even before the prison experiment. I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t have done the experiment, I&#39;m just saying the conclusions you make can&#39;t be made so easily. That said, congratulations for trying to isolate variables, that&#39;s probably the most important thing in science to achieve true knowledge.

Using the same scale they should have also chosen people with lower morals. Basically, increasing the sample size by choosing out of population randomly. Also the prisoners(team opposite to the participants) here were just Michael and his team. But if they were prisoners they should have not been allowed to retaliate similarly to the participants(the guards). Also, as one other person mentioned in their comment before, the human emotion of getting feedback from the victim/submissive plays a huge factor in how the person with power/dominant reacts next, which is missing in this video. Also finally the study should have been done over some days, which would capture the change in how annoyed both the guards and prisoners got over time and how does this change effect someone who can exercise power over someone else, both quantitively and qualitatively. I think this can also be an important factor because with time even people who love each other start to fight. And in some countries where the person with more power over the household(usually the husband) starts to exercise his power in sadistic ways(over his wife/children) if they provoke him enough number of times. All these factors combined and quantitative measured would have probably given a better problem statement and a better predictive model; that if given power and anonymity, and given that the dominants can experience the submissives getting hurt, over time(all these being independent variables) would the dominant chose to be exercise it in a way that would actually cause harm to the prisoners(evil =dependent variable)", "comment_date": "2018-12-22T15:38:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Oussama Bezzad", "comment_text": "Maybe they didn&#39;t press the button because the other group can do the same, so if they harm them they&#39;ll will be also harmed in return. <br>Also, if they added groups of more aggressive people or mixed ones to the experiment, it will be more interesting and we can conclude the influence of individual&#39;s personality on his behavior in a certain situation based on comparison of differences between participants&#39; groups with a variety of personalities, and the real impact of the situation by studying the similarities.<br>Perhaps, a more realistic feedback like hearing the other group can make the participants more aggressive by enjoying the pain of others.", "comment_date": "2018-12-22T15:35:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Europe in Arabic \u0627\u0648\u0631\u0628\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude0e\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0631\u0643 \u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628", "comment_date": "2018-12-22T15:03:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "1Trucxh OnDaMoV", "comment_text": "In REAL PRISON,  CALIFORNIA,  GUARDS ARE TOUGH,  HOWEVER MOST ARE WHITE MALES AND TEND TO OPENLY SHOW FAVOR TOWARDS WHITE MALE PRISONERS!", "comment_date": "2018-12-22T14:58:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xander ordinola", "comment_text": "Reading through the comments here, I see a lot of people critiquing your experiment and offering ways to improve it.

Thus not going above 5 for the most part could be in part fear of retaliation. They also never receive a level higher than 3, which seems to remain constant no matter their input, where even the participants correctly assume that there is no other team. Going higher in the second phase then doesn&#39;t really show anything, since they&#39;ve already surmised they are the only ones there.<br>Another big failing, is that they never get to see what the &quot;other team&quot; is experiencing.

Crucially, with this iteration,  although very conscientious and moral people were involved, the elements of competition, fear and to some extent, reward were added. <br><br>If you wanted to replicate this in the context of the experiment shown, you could modify it by playing a neutral (not in itself unpleasant) sound into the room, to signal incremental progress made by the &quot;other&quot; team on the goal, in this case, the completion of the puzzle . Having this go off every so often would have brought competition in. The team should also have been told that if the &quot;other&quot; finished the puzzle first, the &quot;distressing&quot; sound would be played into the room for an extended unspecified period of time and the participants would not be able to leave for the duration, bringing fear of the &quot;others&quot; success into the equation.  <br><br>Thirdly, an implicit or even vaguely imagined reward is introduced linked to the &quot;command&quot; where by participants can see how their actions now help their team mates, (as they won&#39;t suffer the sound either) which justifies even to conscientious people, that what they are doing is reasonable and benefits not just themselves (the greater good argument).

The audience invariably voted for increasingly bad things to happen to him, by high majorities, from someone spilling a drink on him and having an argument with him in the pub, to someone entering his home while he was out and smashing his TV. It culminated in them voting for him to be kidnapped by actors, at which point the experiment was stopped (somewhat cruelly) by playing the audience, rather than the live hidden camera feeds, and recording done by a lookalike stunt double earlier on of a kidnapping attempt and the &#39;subject&#39; attempting to flee and being run over.

I really wish these people would\u2019ve seen the faults in this experiment. I don\u2019t think of myself as particularly highly educated in the field of psychology, but there were clear differences in the Stanford Prison Experiment and the extremely castrated version, if you can even call it a \u201cversion\u201d, that the Mind Field team preformed. <br><br>Firstly, the study tends to accept that people will behave more cruelly if they are given that task. That does not somehow exempt the Stanford Prison Experiment\u2019s findings. If simply telling someone that they are encouraged to be oppressive to other makes them turn into pure evil and inhumane, then does that really validate your experiment? All you had to do was task them with doing it, and they did it. <br><br>Not only that, but the experiment didn\u2019t stop at simply limiting variables in the subject\u2019s actions, but it removed all of the feedback for their actions. They simply pressed a button, and they were given no feedback as to what their repeated button-presses were doing. They couldn\u2019t hear a loud buzz in the other room, they didn\u2019t hear the \u201cother team\u201d screaming or otherwise reacting, they were completely bored and didn\u2019t feel competitive whatsoever. So basically, this experiment removed all of the reward and reaction for their actions. <br><br>I have absolutely no doubt that environment can breed uncharacteristically cruel behavior, and this experiment absolutely did not change my conclusion. This has been proven time and again, and it is a well-known psychological fact that humans will conform and behave similarly to those around them, even if it\u2019s completely different than their usual behavior. The Stanford Prison Experiment only proves this. Simply patting someone on the back and saying \u201cgo be oppressive\u201d should not be nearly enough to make someone that is otherwise kind, to behave in an extremely cruel way. Rather, it\u2019s the environment and those behaving likewise around them, the response to their actions, and the feeling of competitiveness, that brings out this behavior. <br><br>Next time, preform this same experiment while showing the other \u201cteam\u201d on a screen, cussing the team out that is buzzing them, calling them names, reacting to their buzzes, and eventually showing fear and submission in response to their buzzes.

I don&#39;t think enough emphasis was put on the fact that the guards in the Stanford experiment could see the prisoners and see how their actions affected everyone. The prisoners weren&#39;t 100% anonymous to the guards because they still had a face and a voice that the guards could easily recognize. Their reactions to their punishments were also visible and audible. In my opinion, this experiment was flawed because there was a distinct lack of satisfaction for completing a sadistic act; which the guards got when the prisoners reacted to their punishments. One group claimed they discussed the possibility of there being no other group, which to me is a serious red flag that the participants are going to act differently than they normally would because they&#39;re aware that they&#39;re being deceived. Then there was the one participant who pressed the buzzer like crazy because she figured out that there was no other group so she didn&#39;t have to worry about harming anyone.<br><br>The biggest issue here is that Michael assumed that there was 100% anonymity in the Stanford experiment when in reality, everyone was still identifiable in one way or another; which heavily affected the outcome of the experiment.

The second group buzzed more &quot;in retaliation&quot; but we cannot tell if it was because she already concluded there was &quot;no other team&quot; and thus felt the button presses were inconsequential in the first place.

At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KND_bBDE8RQ&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a>, you start talking about the participants of the original experiment&#39;s predisposition to aggression saying, &quot;He signed up to something called a prison study...&quot;. I think that this condition maintains the original experiment&#39;s accuracy, since the people in an actual prison life scenario may have chosen or fallen into the rolls due to a predisposition to aggresion in the first place. A real prisoner having to have committed a crime to get there, and a guard having to be able to restrain and keep order, through verbal commands or force if necessary. People in these positions must have some tendency towards aggression in order to be drawn to these feilds in the first place. The original Standford Prison Experiment ad isn&#39;t much unlike a job posting, and the participants aren&#39;t much unlike someone searching for a job in at a prison. <br><br>While you&#39;re experiment was fascinating, I think that conducting the experiment again with people that have more aggressive personalities and comparing their results to the participant&#39;s results in the video, may shed some more clarity on the psycological effects something like this has. Until then, it will be hard to compare your experiment, and the Standford Prison Experiment.<br><br>This video was super interesting to me and I hope you dive deeper into more phychological studies!

Rather, simply inform the guards of the behavioral rules expected from the prisoners along with the routine schedule (meal times, activity time etc.) and just let them know that they are free to do whatever they need to do in order to ensure prisoner compliance and leave it at that ... then see if the aggressive behavior manifests ... they should not know ahead of time that they are applying to participate in a prison scenario, they are only told the specifics once they are sufficiently screened with the personality tests and then chosen to participate.<br><br>These participants trying to build a puzzle together were all people of high moral character and more than that, their morality was re-enforced through group peer pressure ... the individual interaction between authority and subject was never a dynamic allowed to play out in this experiment.<br><br>I don&#39;t see how this experiment could shed any light what-so-ever on the original prison experiment because none of those original dynamics were accurately re-produced as they should have been, only without the encouragement of aggressive behavior from the test designers.<br><br>Also, it would have been good to see this new test done with a group of people who&#39;s personalities are more in the center of the moral bell curve instead of leaning them towards the highly moral ... and maybe even a group who tend to lean more towards the immoral end of the bell curve.

I found some great insights in the comments and I&#39;d like to add my own.<br><br>1 - Following Michael&#39;s discussion with Zimbardo, you did the experiment with people having strong moral traits and concluded that the hypothesis of &quot;people won&#39;t freely exercise power over others (unless it was expected of them)&quot; was true, but no real answer was found on this &quot;balance&quot;. More experiments should be ran with groups of people purely with immoral traits and, more important, with a real normal distribution of characteristics (Zimbardo&#39;s ad on the newspaper was biased indeed).<br>2 - One interesting thing I&#39;m wondering is if individuals that are stressed out would show the aggressive signs even with these personality traits. Maybe you could reproduce the experiment with lots of waiting hours, like an endurance test, or waiting for them to be really hungry/thirsty, this would decrease their rationale.<br>3 - It&#39;s kind of weird expecting these people to abuse their power just for the &quot;idea&quot; of inflicting discomfort over others. Maybe there could be some reward/feedback factor there, so when expressing their aggressiveness people would feel great with it, exercising power over others - in this situation - needs to be satisfying and actually feel powerful, it&#39;s not about just inflicting discomfort but seeing/feeling someone&#39;s reaction to it.<br>4 - &quot;Go with the flow&quot;. How about infiltrating some person that tries to encourage them to press the buttons? This could give some insights too, idk.<br><br>Concluding, while - some of - Stanford&#39;s variables were {demand characteristics; ad-biased people (which Zimbardo claims to be normally distributed); instant feedback}, yours were {demand-free environment; also biased people (strong moral); no feedback}, so many other experiments would be needed to fill the puzzle IMO.<br><br>Finally, I&#39;m all up for debate on these, of course these ideas would need to run through a lot of discussion before being usable.", "comment_date": "2018-12-20T17:20:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "General of your mom, your best reptilioid", "comment_text": "Hanna Arendt", "comment_date": "2018-12-20T17:19:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peni S.", "comment_text": "I was expecting a recreation of the experiment almost exactly but with actors as prisoners, since they&#39;re not the ones being tested.

For example, if you had NOT screened for only the people with the highest moral fortitude, but had a mixture, and had one person going higher on the levels, would the others adopt it as the norm?<br><br>Additionally, in the original experiment, the guards weren&#39;t anonymous to each other.  So peer pressure characteristics could have easily taken hold.  Or being able to be seen as week or soft in their PEERS eyes, could have influenced them, as a group, to become more cruel - when individually without being able to be seen by the others, they would not have done so.  EVEN if the experiment did NOT demand this of them.<br><br>Finally, I think the prison experiment has one other factor - the prisoners in this case are considered a direct threat against them.  And just like police often do (with shooting of unarmed people), they might over react and be more cruel in an effort to protect perceived threats (or potential threats) to their own safety, than where there was no danger to them whatsoever.

Because of their knowledge of that they are in a study I observed there is reduced responsibility and frustration of being in the dark with a hard task and those conditions can compensate for that. And other variables can stay the same at that point, as you can still say at set defined point that their responsibility is now only &#39;punishing&#39; other team to make them focused on their task. But that&#39;d create an authority if you personally told them, which makes &#39;inhumanity&#39; inevitable. Instead of your voice you could&#39;ve said we made a contraption that would sound a beep whenever both you get distracted. Which would replace authority with set defined rules. That should increase anonymity and depersonalization of the experiment. That would reduce variables, make the existence of other team more believable and increase reproductability.<br><br>I know your intentions were biased to the other side of the spectrum to create an exception to original experiment.

No one is cruel alone, we need support from our environment to be an unethical radical(also that could be an album name).<br> <br>Also no one tried to communicate with the other team which is weird.

There are issues like this in medicine for example, when a medical condition is primarily researched with one demographic of test subjects, other demographics may be harder to diagnose because doctors expect one set of symptoms, but those symptoms are either different or less apparent in others (for example, cyanosis would be harder to see visually on people with darker skin). Of course having larger test groups as well also would help discern outliers and be able to better distinguish which behaviors are more or less common, instead of making assumptions for all people based on a small and limited group. Feels like it&#39;s hard for him to argue that they picked from a median range of people when the ones that would respond to the add would already have particular predispositions knowing that it was a prison experiment. Just knowing what I do in having studied science in college, it&#39;s still beyond me how someone can put together a group of people, encourage them to act cruel, and then claim the experiment proved people are predisposed to cruelty under anonymity just because the test subjects were told to.

In the prison experiment, the guards and the prisoners had that idea of a class difference between them. But with the participants in this experiment they were &quot;competing&quot; with a mysterious other team that they couldn&#39;t particularly gauge the skill or progress of, which I think is what led someone to figuring out that there was no other team. I feel like just telling the participants that the other team &quot;is&quot; in fact progressing would push them to not only try for the puzzle a little harder, but also probably provoke the participants to use the noise more. The puzzle also seemed particularly difficult, maybe finding a way to make it so at least most people are able to even fit 1 or 2 of the pieces in in the dark would give them enough confidence to try at the puzzle for a longer period of time.<br><br>I feel like the biggest probable error was in the fact that no one could get a single piece in. Maybe if everyone also had a simple shape like a circle or a square they could find the spot it fits in and get at least one piece in. If i was a participant I definitely feel like I would keep trying at the puzzle if i got one piece in. If I couldn&#39;t get any within the first 10 minutes or so I&#39;d definitely feel inclined to give up. but just one piece to fit right would probably give me the courage to keep trying. As it is, the puzzle is such a daunting task that I think it may have forced the participants to either focus too much on it or just flat out give up on it.

The most interesting thing about social psychology, is that it brings together the influence of social factors and individual  factors into the development of personality behaviour.

If the guards didn&#39;t fight back, they were either not doing their job well, not working to achieve that greater good by helping the scientists, or whatever. What if you designed the experiment such that they had shock collars around their neck that delivered a mildly irritating, but non harmful shock? They receive a small demo shock and then be told that if the opposing team wins, they will receive a very prolonged shock (though they actually wouldn&#39;t). Then the experiment could be set up so that the test group will naturally find out they have an advantage over the other group. Maybe actually use another group?

I mean, if 8 is unsafe, 12 should cause real harm. <br>2 - There&#39;s no relation of power (or impotence), authority or injustice between the &quot;two&quot; teams. It&#39;s just a buzzer war that you can either start or retaliate. No team is controlling the other and both can always fight back. <br>3 - Depersonalization is a big problem in both experiments, I think. I understand the ideia, but giving people numbers doesn&#39;t make them not humans or indistinguishable as to be treated as &quot;pack&quot; because that only happens when the group is pretty big, like in a real prison. Both experiments fail on that because the groups (12 prisoners or 4 puzzle solvers) are really small.<br>Among other (ethically inevitable) problems in these experiments, I personally believe the environment does play a huge role on the way people act, specially as groups, and that&#39;s where the buzzer experiment is interesting because when the subjects are able to crank it up to 12 without the others knowing they can make their personal will or cruelty a team&#39;s action and that at the same time as they give up their personal responsibility for it.

In the stanford prison experiment, no troubling behavior manifested until the second day. It took time for people to take on roles and behave sadistically. This experiment didn\u2019t even last one day, they didn\u2019t have enough time to become sadistic. There also wasn\u2019t anonymity, as they still knew they were being recorded, and had all seen the other participants beforehand. Also, there was no inequality of power like in the stanford prison experiment. Also, sadism is reactionary: it\u2019s about getting a response to your cruelty. When you can\u2019t see who you\u2019re hurting, and even question if they exist (as occurred here), people aren\u2019t going to get off on sadistic behavior like the guard from the first experiment described. Then there\u2019s the fact that the groups are not representative of the general population, which he only kindof justifies, but the real reason is he wanted a result that refutes the stanford prison study. This, of course, does not, because it only measures how groups of unusually kind people respond in the short term to \u201cpower\u201d over a group of people they have been told (but don\u2019t fully believe) exists and whose reactions they cannot observe, while they are preoccupied with another objective which they are also skeptical of.

First, they were put in a position where they had to choose between either accomplishing the goal (solving the puzzle) or abusing the other team, whereas for the prison guards, abusing the prisoners was directly linked to accomplishing their goal of maintaining control.  This was more like if the guards and prisoners were in a competition to see who could clean their side of the prison fastest, and while you had the option to stop cleaning and throw mud at the other side, all you were really doing was prolonging an unpleasant task that nobody was enjoying and everyone just wanted over with.  In a way, it was self-punishment to attack the other side.  That isn&#39;t how it was for the prison guards in the Stanford experiment.  <br><br>Second, without any confrontation between the two sides, the subjects weren&#39;t receiving any confirmation or reward to the actions they were taking, nor could the subjects feel directly threatened by each other.  I think this is a bit like the difference between getting into a fight with people online, and getting screamed at by a mob in the streets.  Nothing compromises the morals of an otherwise decent person faster than fear, and people who feel like they&#39;re in immediate danger will do and say things they&#39;d never do or say if they had even a few seconds of quiet contemplation to think about it.  The prisoners were obviously afraid, and the guards were at least afraid of losing control of the situation on Day 2.  The puzzlers were safe in their own room, hidden in darkness, surrounded by supportive teammates, and given a purely intellectual task.  Blessed with the opportunity to calmly think about it, one person even correctly concluded there was no other side.  So this experiment didn&#39;t have the emotional intensity required to parallel the Stanford experiment, in my opinion.<br><br>I think the main takeaway from the new experiment is that anonymity alone is insufficient to cause a decent person to commit malicious acts against their own self-interests, or at least malicious acts that don&#39;t convincingly help accomplish their goals.  Even then, you have to consider that they knew at some point the lights were being turned back on.  They even announced to their teammates when they were pressing the button.

The conversations more or less behave like this: M- I wanna do Stanford again to prove blah blah. X- Sure that idea is already really supported already, but this could add more weight to it.

Also, I think it&#39;s important to recognize that the bias of selection of authoritarian individuals might actually be closer to what happens organically in the prison systems. People who are drawn to that kind of employment are in general more authoritarian, and the system they are put into is one of authority, and the demands for cruelty may also be present in the prison system organically as well.<br><br>So the takeaway for me is that the Stanford Prison Experiment isn&#39;t universal, and shouldn&#39;t be applied to every single situation. But for authoritarian environments, like the military, prisons, and even some corporate environments, fit the conditions of the Stanford Prison Experiment well. I think it would be worthwhile to continue to experiment with the conditions and with personalty distributions to find where crossover might occur. I would also be interested in seeing different personalities getting mixed together, as much of the conflict in any environment stems from personalty incompatibilities. I&#39;ve worked for employers that weren&#39;t pleasant places to work due to a manager getting on a power trip and having different personalty clashes. Or even seeing different co-workers clashing on personalty incompatibilities, with some co-workers naturally assuming a position of authority, while others are more docile, or reacting in passive aggressive ways.

The participants in this experiment were introduced to the buzzer as a tool but not as a task. Even in the second stage, the participants acknowledged that the buzzer was only a tool. I believe that the puzzle was a distraction that had corrupted the experiment. Secondly, as Dr.Zimbardo stated at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KND_bBDE8RQ&amp;t=31m23s\">31:23</a>, in the Stanford prison experiment they used a wide variety of personalities to achieve the ideal result. To debate that 18-year-olds are violent and cruel\u00a0and obstructed the intent of the experiment is equivalent to debating that the participants in this experiment were too &quot;nice&quot;. I believe that there were many control variables that were violated or ignored that were vital for recreating the Stanford prison experiment. In conclusion, I really enjoyed the video and I highly respect the fact that Micheal&#39;s objective was to achieve the best result from an iconic experiment.

The ONLY way for your experiment&#39;s groups to be cruel to the other group was to use the distract buzzer, which based on their own experience, did not have any significant effect on progress, and didn&#39;t help their own group in any way. Having a clear goal may have taken priority, and pushed aside something as silly and unhelpful as the distract buzzer.", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T19:59:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AustinDoggie", "comment_text": "So happy vsauce is back!", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T19:59:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "unpoc", "comment_text": "hi", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T19:58:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Demonic's Gaming Domain", "comment_text": "Or you can watch any numerous movies about it, and have a more entertaining experience.", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T19:58:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DiploidDudnyk", "comment_text": "Your experiment wasn&#39;t appropriate.

Djervig", "comment_text": "This was an interesting video - it raised some interesting questions about the original Prison Experiment - but I don&#39;t think that the experiment Michael created had the sufficient parameters to truly explore the validity of the original. Some aspects of the original experiment that I would say were crucial to its results were missing; such as the length of the experiment, which means that the participants would have time to build a rapport with each other, and would hence likely feel some enhanced feeling of camaraderie. Another crucial aspect is the experience of the prisoners being uncooperative and acting out - as someone who has worked in the hospitality business for a decade, I&#39;ve seen a bit of everything, and many people in my line of work become jaded. In the beginning young people are very eager to please, so they&#39;ll bend the rules for guests, but eventually somebody will skip town without settling their bills or break the rules, or scold a staff member for something that they had nothing to do with, it&#39;s a feeling of betrayal, like people won&#39;t follow the agreed upon social norms for the given situation. If some kind of disobedience by a prisoner is observed by two guards, there will be a social pressure on and between the two guards to handle the situation, and if there is an additional feeling of betrayal between the guards and the prisoner the guards will feel a need to toughen up, and if this results in one of the guards doing something rash, there will be a pressure on the second guard to repeat or escalate in order to preserve social bonds. Last crucial aspect missing, the fact that people see each other face to face, you cannot expect to see people have the same social dynamic with the lights off and complete anonymity. Our mirror neurons need to feed off each others emotions. Just look at how much social interaction on the internet differs from real life. The interesting thing is also how we seem to be able to selectively focus our empathy on the group we believe we belong to.<br>I would recommend that anyone interested in this subject reads Mark Twains Mysterious Stranger.

Why would anybody get exicted or turn cruel at the thought of pressing a button? The only reason to do so would be for retaliation, and the experiment showed that.

Also, I have a big problem with the way your experiment was set up. The ficticious other group doing puzzles with our group was made to seem on equal standing. There should&#39;ve been a prominent and clear power dynamic, as one you would find with prisoners/guards. One where the other group is unable to retaliate. Also, the fact that our group could not see, hear, or sense the other team in any way really drew away from the experiment&#39;s credibility. The ability to see another human and inflict harm on them, exercise power over them, and see an immediate response. I don&#39;t think you should&#39;ve taken away the prison aspect. It&#39;s what the experiment is all about. Unless you could find another way to recreate a personal, real power dynamic, I don&#39;t think this experiment is effective.

Thus, power, in this case, would bring no positive feedback loop toward the participants&#39; psyche for the evil tendency to kickstart and snowball out of control. Because &quot;power&quot; in this case doesn&#39;t result into anything tangible, at least to their own comprehension upon the current situation.<br><br>Also, the puzzle being almost impossible to solve, renders the &quot;sense of progression&quot; meaningless for the participants, which also contributed an arguably large part to why they had almost no tendency to abuse their power to begin with, since they would apparently gain nothing from it, regardless of how frequently they might push the button.<br><br>With both reasons above combined, I really doubt that your experiment met the actual same requirements the Stanford Prison Experiment was trying to facilitate. There were indeed given means to exert power and dominance over others, with depersonalizing, anonymity and all. But the complete lack of how such combination would give a psychological feedback onto the human psyche in a competitive or objective-driven environment, I think, has misled the result into &quot;How people would endure boredom even when given power&quot;, rather than &quot;How easy for people to become evil, given enough means to exercise their power&quot;.<br><br>My suggestion is, redo the experiment, with a different, but easier and more cooperative puzzle, like building up a wooden tower in the dark or something, and blasting noises should be expected to ruin their progression more often than not. Then, occasionally, you guys should tell how bad the team is performing against the &quot;other team&quot;, just to shake their competitiveness up. <br><br>There should be no need for phase two, since the first announcement that compares both teams&#39; progression should kick them right into the expectation to exert their power over others to achieve their own objective - winning the game against the &quot;other team&quot;.<br><br>Still, great show, and I really enjoyed your take on this experiment.

A simple buzz noise doesn&#39;t replicate that sense of authority and control over other real people face to face. Seeing the consequence of exercising that sadism is part of the reason the guards were so aggressive. Regardless of whether they were encouraged to behave a certain way, they knew they had control over the prisoners and they were successfully able to make them do whatever they wanted. I think their personality traits are irrelevant in this case because the types of people who are interested in becoming prison guards/police already have the predisposition to strive for some sort of position of authority. I think telling the guards they should be cruel was a mistake in that experiment, but I think this experiment is remotely close to being able to draw any conclusions about people in authoritative positions being cruel....
