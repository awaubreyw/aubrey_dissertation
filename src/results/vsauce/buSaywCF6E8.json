Professional sports\u2019 cameras may have super high frame rates in order to get frames/stills without motion blur, but they definitely aren\u2019t broadcasting 1000 fps. That would take so much bandwidth it would be insane. Motion blur is caused by a slow shutter speed, but sports cameras have super fast shutter speeds so they can capture slow motion.

Motion blur is actually an artifact of our eyes remembering the photons that were there previously (I&#39;m kinda bumbling up the explanation, but that&#39;s the gist). We add artificial motion blur because images are actually showing up too slow for that effect to take place. The reason people feel ill while watching higher FPS content is simply the fact that people aren&#39;t used to it. Especially with older audiences, because they don&#39;t consume much YT content (which has had 60fps for years now) and they don&#39;t play modern games where the standard has become 60fps and now being pushed this very year to 120fps!

On the other hand, if you see a fast moving object but don&#39;t track it with your eyes, light coming off of it is going to move across different parts of your retina without giving it that 1/15th of a second to see a clear image, which results in motion blur<br><br>The problem with motion sickness is not caused because the &quot;picture is too clear&quot; in HFR content. In fact, the higher the frame rate, the more closely it&#39;ll resemble reality because it allows our eyes to more naturally track or not track objects. That means we might still see the natural motion blur caused by our retinas even if there is none in the video. The cause of motion sickness is actually the camera movement. Because movement is so smooth and realistic in HFR content, some people who easily get motion sick misinterpret camera movement from the screen as real movement, and when that doesn&#39;t match up with the signals coming from the vestibular system, their brain gets confused by those mixed signals and the result is motion sickness", "comment_date": "2020-08-25T13:25:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Lewis", "comment_text": "No-Glasses Micheal is not real Michael", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T22:45:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Georgi Zashev", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buSaywCF6E8&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a> laughing in 120 fps.", "comment_date": "2020-08-17T18:33:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Travis", "comment_text": "Back when 48 hours uploaded were much.

Yes, our eyes don&#39;t see in frames per second. And although you didn&#39;t mention it specifically, I got the feeling you hinted at how there are diminishing returns as you get a higher framerate. Recently I switched from a 60 Hz monitor to a 144 Hz monitor and the difference is night and day. I find it hard to play games on 60 Hz anymore. At my college for our eSports program, we use 240 Hz monitors, and the difference is still definitely noticeable for me, but not as pronounced. This isn&#39;t completely relevant, but it&#39;s just my background with experiencing greater than 60 fps, which is the standard for monitors (at least in the US, it might be 50 in other parts of the world, but I don&#39;t know for sure).<br><br><br>When you say we start to get headaches from higher framerates (you mentioned 1000 fps), that would be what it is recorded at (well, sort of. But for simplicity&#39;s sake and keeping this readable, lets just assume that it is being recorded at 1000 fps). The reason that would give people headaches is because each of those 1000 frames is more like a picture, but it can&#39;t display the full 1000 frames per second. That would depend on the monitor or TV you use. If you record something at 30 frames per second, then each of those frames is actually in a way, an average of everything that happened in 1/30th of a second. That is motion blur. If you then play it back at 30 frames per second, then it would look relatively smooth. But if you were to record it in 1000 fps and play it back in real time at 30 frames per second (skipping frames so that it would play back in real time) it would look much choppier; the frame would only have been an average of the last 1/1000 of a second. It would essentially have no motion blur. But if you would display the 1000 fps video on display that could display 1000 fps, (a 1000 Hz display) then it would look like a super smooth video.", "comment_date": "2019-10-16T18:02:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chales dor", "comment_text": "there is no such thing as photons.....dumbass earthlings....they would destroy the eye", "comment_date": "2019-10-16T04:06:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "METALHEAD2000", "comment_text": "What tv is 1000fps, he talking plasma 600hz", "comment_date": "2019-10-15T08:20:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TrenttheN642", "comment_text": "This", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T21:55:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Dertavitian", "comment_text": "So our tracking of motion is delayed and extenuated even more when motion is fast moving, therefore what we see and what our brain infers are two separate things.

(yes even glass people, no glass can fix the lack of cell animal have since it is not related to focus)<br><br>so finally we have millions of cells firing up randomly/interlaced creating a random FPS that averages around 500 FPS~ that is why when you get used to 75+Hz setting on your PC CRT and go back to 60Hz (Hz and FPS are the same) you see bullets becoming jittery and the camera moving is jittery also and you get head aches! the best is about 85Hz where your mind has enough FPS to work with but to an excessive amount! JUST 75 FPS and your mouse in windows looks better (less mouse trail, turn it on and off on 60 FPS/Hz and you will not see much difference...) and for some odd reason the actual peripheral (the mouse device) behaves differently!", "comment_date": "2018-02-05T16:59:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swarty Swooty", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buSaywCF6E8&amp;t=2m48s\">2:48</a> you see michaels nose", "comment_date": "2018-02-04T06:55:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Honza", "comment_text": "T H I C C", "comment_date": "2018-02-04T01:56:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikke The mightey", "comment_text": "Whats the deal with the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buSaywCF6E8&amp;t=4m10s\">4:10</a> bit?

Here&#39;s my logic: since you can&#39;t have two particles (or particle/wave dualities) in the same spot, you would only be able to see things at a certain frequency/framerate. Knowing this, I looked up the wavelengths of light in the visible spectrum. It said that they were 390 nm to 700 nm. so, light being approximately 300000000 m/s I divided that number 1000000 to put it into nm. I then multiplied that number by the wavelengths I found, and it turns out that: <br><br>the highest frequency light we can see is coming at us at 769230770000000 fps<br><br>and the lowest frequency is 428571430000000 fps", "comment_date": "2015-11-08T16:56:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pyr3x", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not apart of anything I&#39;m just a consumer.", "comment_date": "2015-11-07T05:23:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Kramer Scariot", "comment_text": "Why there is no comments on this video?", "comment_date": "2015-11-05T14:52:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aa me", "comment_text": "But wait how many pixels does your eye have?", "comment_date": "2015-10-29T16:47:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moonchild of Orcamoon", "comment_text": "There are cells in the heart just like Brain cells", "comment_date": "2015-10-28T14:24:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "weasel945", "comment_text": "That guy in the background at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buSaywCF6E8&amp;t=2m20s\">2:20</a>", "comment_date": "2015-10-27T00:51:58Z", "likes_count": 269}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Zhang", "comment_text": "Will the &#39;frame rate&#39; of our eyes drop in darker environment (like a camera tries to get more light for each frame by slowing down frame rate)?", "comment_date": "2015-10-24T17:06:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TCarrot Gaming", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buSaywCF6E8&amp;t=4m43s\">4:43</a>, no!", "comment_date": "2015-10-24T11:47:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TCarrot Gaming", "comment_text": "No, I think your camera made more blur, and I did feel like I got a headache, for 24.67 seconds!", "comment_date": "2015-10-24T11:45:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexandra Horton", "comment_text": "This is great!", "comment_date": "2015-10-22T22:18:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lars & Rosa", "comment_text": "Vsauce You are amazing!

The human eye actually has a very tiny area that it focuses on at any given time, and since a TV screen is fully focused at a much larger area to compensate for changes of areas of interest on screen, you don&#39;t get the same blur you would from waving your hand in front of your face. Just as a jet flying by at mach 2 isn&#39;t blurry\u00a0 at all if its flying by at a distance of 15 kilometers away, where you have a fuller view with which to focus. The pain some people have isn&#39;t a wives tale, but its not from just motion, its over exposure to light intensities. In fact, an outfit in Japan got in big trouble for making an animated movie with too much flashing light, because animation is an assortment of flasing black, and bright pannels and too much of it can overload sensitive neural signals, and even burn out your retina temporarily. Also, the single most effective way you can prevent the spread of germs is by washing your hands!

This is normally expressed as Hz (Hertz), as in &quot;cycles per second&quot;, a measure of frequency used in many other situations, including sound, light color, vibration. In short, Hz is a measure of oscillation, the undulation of a wave, the on/off of light, frames per second, the refresh rate of a screen.<br><br>Many newer computer monitors can refresh as fast as 240Hz or 240fps, maybe faster. This depends on the video card and how much information it has and can output to the monitor. Any faster is overkill, but for some applications you want the highest frame rate possible. However, Video games don&#39;t really need to be seen any faster than 60Hz/fps. There is no discernible change in game play quality past 48fps. 60fps is more for computational margin so the game can add in AI, physics, Special Effects, and so on. This is also true for TV, as higher frame rats can allow a TV to add back in Motion blur, 3D, and so on.<br><br>While it is possible to get eyestrain from no motion blur caused by recording the image at 1000fps or so. The bottom neck remains the screen replayed on and broadcast video is still limited to 30fps at most. This may change in the future.
