This would also explain the large portion of our DNA long labeled &quot;junk DNA&quot;, which we couldn&#39;t understand for many years, and has recently been discovered to actually be extraterrestrial in origin. Now they are breeding with humans, which would produce a species in between them and us. Why would they do this? Maybe an experiment. Maybe they want certain qualities that only primates/ humans have. You can speculate on what they&#39;re intentions are and what kind of agenda they have. They could have enslaved us for a while too, which would explain much of ancient Egypts hieroglyphics and pyramids. Odds are they don&#39;t have humans&#39; best interest at heart though. But then again it&#39;s likely that there are many many different alien species, such as the Greys and Reptilians who feud over earth and what to do about humans. Reptilians actually view us as a food source and don&#39;t respect us as in intelligent life form, and are the ones responsible for cattle mutilations, as well as multiple recorded incidents of human mutilations. The stories of human mutilations are absolutely fucking TERRIFYING. One thing is certain though, there is overwhelming evidence showing that they are already here among us, and have been for a very long time.
