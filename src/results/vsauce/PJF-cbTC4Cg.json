I am not sure they are even showing disapproval, let alone profound disapproval.  Seems like they just wanted a meal to me.  Furthermore, I doubt that the animal thinks, &quot;oh gee, this food is contaminated with poop which has many bacteria and can harm me.&quot;  This might be simple avoidance, not disgust.  It may be as simple as the food taste better when the poop is washed off.... not some complex human emotion.    On one hand, the scientist think they are seeing a complex emotion, yet in the same clip, the monkeys can&#39;t figure out how to better wash their food.  Not random acts of cleaning, but you sure wouldn&#39;t eat the peanut after their cleaning methods.  An animal who could show a complex human emotion could surely figure out how to clean their food better.   This is a clear example of anthropomorphism.<br>Wonderful stuff to talk and discuss.

However, while humans choose to be irrational about their adventure paths and explore as much as possible without calculating the consequences, Neanderthals chose to be rational and didn&#39;t pursue unknown adventures. When we consider the discovery of antibiotics we see a similar story, under normal circumstance, we would be disgusted by such cheese, yet one was brave and lucky enough to taste one in right time. I see a similar pattern on Machine Learning and Deep Learning training processes, straightforward models are outperformed by those who are able to add different noise to the data. Stochastic, noisy, random approaches may be helping us to &quot;improve&quot; things in an authentic way. I would love seeing this topic explored more.
