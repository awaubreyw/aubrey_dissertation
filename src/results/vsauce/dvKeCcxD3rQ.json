Michael here. The title of this video is misspelled in honor of mistakes. Mistakes are everywhere, they surround us like air. To err is human. Faults, flaws, faux pas, fumbles and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today as the stuff we&#39;ve gotten right. For instance, if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee, why would there be so many &quot;k&quot;s? Well, the &quot;k&quot;s are silent by mistake. The original old English forms of these words were pronounced with &quot;k&quot; sounds. K-nife, k-night, k-nee. But that&#39;s a bit of a mouthful to say and because reading and writing weren&#39;t as common hundreds of years ago, people just pronounced words the way they want to do, regardless of spelling. Spelling is fun. Warren G knows what I&#39;m talking about. In the fourth verse of his &quot;What&#39;s Next&quot;, he asks what&#39;s next. What&#39;s next, what&#39;s N-X-E-T. Spelling isn&#39;t the only thing we get wrong. The history of science is a graveyard of dead an abandoned ideas. Fritz Machlup coined the phrase &quot;Half-life of knowledge&quot;. The amount of time it takes for half of the knowledge within a field to be superseded by new, better ideas or to simply be shown untrue. Donald Hebb famously estimated that the half-life of knowledge in psychology is just five years. Humans are awesome, don&#39;t get me wrong, but we tend to believe that what we currently think we know about the universe is reasonably correct, even though statistics aren&#39;t on our side. Previous generations incorrectly thought the exact same thing about what they used to think was true. My favorite examples of the ubiquity of mistakes are production errors in popular songs. They&#39;re like humbling Easter eggs, just waiting to be found. For instance, Buffalo Springfield&#39;s &quot;For What It&#39;s Worth&quot;. 26 seconds in the &quot;be&quot; in the lyric &quot;beware&quot; is clipped, as is the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;people&quot; at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=1m24s\">1:24</a> minute. Once you hear the mistake, it&#39;s tough to unhear it. In &quot;Hey Jude&quot; Paul McCartney misses a cord. And if you listen closely you can clearly hear him say &quot;F**ing hll&quot;. Seriously, it&#39;s in the actual song. Go listen to it. In fact, there&#39;s an entire website that chronicles mistakes in Beatles&#39; songs. Take a look at this 700-year-old prayer book. A monk wrote it on fresh, clean paper. I&#39;m kidding, of course. He scraped the ink off an older manuscript, cut the pages and rotated them before writing all over them. A mistake? Well, kind of. Recent multispectral images of the prayer book have revealed that the old manuscript he erased was a previously unknown copy of a work by Archimedes. It was called &quot;The Method&quot; and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years before Newton and Leibniz. If that one monk hadn&#39;t erased that one book, would we be hundreds, thousands of years mathematically and technologically more advanced today than we currently are? It&#39;s hard to say. All that is certain is that we would continue to make ridiculous mistakes, like the Mars Climate Orbiter. This 327.6 million dollar expedition burned up in the red planet&#39;s atmosphere because when calculating flight maneuvers NASA used the agreed-upon metric units while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system. This is Neil Armstrong taking humankind&#39;s first steps on the Moon. It&#39;s about the best footage we have. The original tapes containing the highest quality recording of that moment have been lost. They were probably recorded over by later test missions. Ten years ago Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while hunting outside of San Diego. Hoping to attract the attention of rescuers, he lit a small fire. But that fire quickly got out of control and became a giant Cedar Fire. It destroyed 300,000 acres of land, 2,322 homes and killed 15 people. The man carrying a wounded soldier in this painting, based on a photograph taken during World War I, is Henry Tandey, an English recipient of the Victoria Cross. Four years after the event in this image Tandey caught a wounded German soldier in his gun sights. But rather than kill the man, Tandey took pity on his wounded state and spared his life. The German he allowed to live was this man. Later the man whose life he spared wore his mustache shorter but still had the same name, Adolf Hitler. In 1918 did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill Hitler? Detailed researchers found that the exact days their units were in the same location don&#39;t quite match up. The story is apocryphal but what is known is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting of Tandey, and in 1938, when meeting with Neville Chamberlain, Hitler pointed to Tandey and told Chamberlain: &quot;That man came so close to killing me in 1918 that I thought I should never see Germany again.&quot; So, who&#39;s wrong? Maybe Hitler confirmed the story merely because he hoped to make up extra evidence that providence had kept him alive to pursue his goals. Either way, someone is mistaken. Missed opportunities are a bummer. Obsessing over them is not healthy but regret is a powerful emotion. How do you deal with regret, with guilt? Can you? In the early morning hours on a bench outside a hotel in Anaheim this summer Ze Frank told me something I am going to paraphrase. I love this metaphor. Stuff in your past is like a carving on the bark of sapling. Over time, the scar, the carving won&#39;t go away. Because of the way trees grow it won&#39;t go up or down much either, it&#39;ll just stay right where it began. It might even get darker. But it won&#39;t get bigger. You, however, can. You can keep growing, doing more things, more branches, being more things. The wound won&#39;t get smaller but you can make it a smaller part of who you are. Maybe regrets are like that. They stick around forever like arborglyphs. Or maybe they make like a tree and leaf. A red or purple leaf in the autumn. As days get shorter and chlorophyll production decreases, the yellow and orange carotenoids, which are always in leaves, appear as the green fades. But red and purple leaves are the interesting ones. As winter approaches it would seem to be a good time for trees to conserve energy but some trees do the opposite. Instead of giving up, they spend extra energy producing anthocyanins to turn their leaves red and purple hues. These colors protect their leaves from sun damage before their nutrients can all be used and may also be a defense against insects looking for a parasitic home. A way for the tree to tell the insects: &quot;Yes, I am in part dying but not without a fight. I am still very much vital.&quot; Drought and even tourniquets applied by man can bring about these colors prematurely. When you look at beautiful autumn colors, you are looking at stress. But the bigger the fight the trees put up, the more energy they put into their defenses at the very end, the more brilliant their colors will be. Winter will eventually come. But scientifically, the brightest, deepest, most remarkable colors come from not giving up too easily or quickly.

Or the first few recordings that had to be mass produced by recording each physical unit they planned to sell, they eventually started the concept of Master tracks where all tracks where made from the original composition/recording which brings forth the term &quot;Masters&quot;.  On Jay Z&#39;s &quot;Magna Carta Holy Grail&quot; Album, you can hear his chains clinking together, which is normally a &quot;no-no&quot; by engineering standards but I believe it was left in as a commentary on his affluent status and as a reference to the debate about young rappers wearing jewelry vs very wealthy people not wearing jewelry.

Michael here. The title of this video is misspelled in honor of mistakes. Mistakes are everywhere, they surround us like air. To err is human. Faults, flaws, faux pas, fumbles and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today as the stuff we&#39;ve gotten right. For instance, if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee, why would there be so many &quot;k&quot;s? Well, the &quot;k&quot;s are silent by mistake. The original old English forms of these words were pronounced with &quot;k&quot; sounds. K-nife, k-night, k-nee. But that&#39;s a bit of a mouthful to say and because reading and writing weren&#39;t as common hundreds of years ago, people just pronounced words the way they want to do, regardless of spelling. Spelling is fun. Warren G knows what I&#39;m talking about. In the fourth verse of his &quot;What&#39;s Next&quot;, he asks what&#39;s next. What&#39;s next, what&#39;s N-X-E-T. Spelling isn&#39;t the only thing we get wrong. The history of science is a graveyard of dead an abandoned ideas. Fritz Machlup coined the phrase &quot;Half-life of knowledge&quot;. The amount of time it takes for half of the knowledge within a field to be superseded by new, better ideas or to simply be shown untrue. Donald Hebb famously estimated that the half-life of knowledge in psychology is just five years. Humans are awesome, don&#39;t get me wrong, but we tend to believe that what we currently think we know about the universe is reasonably correct, even though statistics aren&#39;t on our side. Previous generations incorrectly thought the exact same thing about what they used to think was true. My favorite examples of the ubiquity of mistakes are production errors in popular songs. They&#39;re like humbling Easter eggs, just waiting to be found. For instance, Buffalo Springfield&#39;s &quot;For What It&#39;s Worth&quot;. 26 seconds in the &quot;be&quot; in the lyric &quot;beware&quot; is clipped, as is the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;people&quot; at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=1m24s\">1:24</a> minute. Once you hear the mistake, it&#39;s tough to unhear it. In &quot;Hey Jude&quot; Paul McCartney misses a chord. And if you listen closely you can clearly hear him say &quot;F**ing hll&quot;. Seriously, it&#39;s in the actual song. Go listen to it. In fact, there&#39;s an entire website that chronicles mistakes in Beatles&#39; songs. Take a look at this 700-year-old prayer book. A monk wrote it on fresh, clean paper. I&#39;m kidding, of course. He scraped the ink off an older manuscript, cut the pages and rotated them before writing all over them. A mistake? Well, kind of. Recent multispectral images of the prayer book have revealed that the old manuscript he erased was a previously unknown copy of a work by Archimedes. It was called &quot;The Method&quot; and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years before Newton and Leibniz. If that one monk hadn&#39;t erased that one book, would we be hundreds, thousands of years mathematically and technologically more advanced today than we currently are? It&#39;s hard to say. All that is certain is that we would continue to make ridiculous mistakes, like the Mars Climate Orbiter. This 327.6 million dollar expedition burned up in the red planet&#39;s atmosphere because when calculating flight maneuvers NASA used the agreed-upon metric units while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system. This is Neil Armstrong taking humankind&#39;s first steps on the Moon. It&#39;s about the best footage we have. The original tapes containing the highest quality recording of that moment have been lost. They were probably recorded over by later test missions. Ten years ago Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while hunting outside of San Diego. Hoping to attract the attention of rescuers, he lit a small fire. But that fire quickly got out of control and became a giant Cedar Fire. It destroyed 300,000 acres of land, 2,322 homes and killed 15 people. The man carrying a wounded soldier in this painting, based on a photograph taken during World War I, is Henry Tandey, an English recipient of the Victoria Cross. Four years after the event in this image Tandey caught a wounded German soldier in his gun sights. But rather than kill the man, Tandey took pity on his wounded state and spared his life. The German he allowed to live was this man. Later the man whose life he spared wore his mustache shorter but still had the same name, Adolf Hitler. In 1918 did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill Hitler? Detailed researchers found that the exact days their units were in the same location don&#39;t quite match up. The story is apocryphal but what is known is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting of Tandey, and in 1938, when meeting with Neville Chamberlain, Hitler pointed to Tandey and told Chamberlain: &quot;That man came so close to killing me in 1918 that I thought I should never see Germany again.&quot; So, who&#39;s wrong? Maybe Hitler confirmed the story merely because he hoped to make up extra evidence that providence had kept him alive to pursue his goals. Either way, someone is mistaken. Missed opportunities are a bummer. Obsessing over them is not healthy but regret is a powerful emotion. How do you deal with regret, with guilt? Can you? In the early morning hours on a bench outside a hotel in Anaheim this summer Ze Frank told me something I am going to paraphrase. I love this metaphor. Stuff in your past is like a carving on the bark of sapling. Over time, the scar, the carving won&#39;t go away. Because of the way trees grow it won&#39;t go up or down much either, it&#39;ll just stay right where it began. It might even get darker. But it won&#39;t get bigger. You, however, can. You can keep growing, doing more things, more branches, being more things. The wound won&#39;t get smaller but you can make it a smaller part of who you are. Maybe regrets are like that. They stick around forever like arborglyphs. Or maybe they make like a tree and leaf. A red or purple leaf in the autumn. As days get shorter and chlorophyll production decreases, the yellow and orange carotenoids, which are always in leaves, appear as the green fades. But red and purple leaves are the interesting ones. As winter approaches it would seem to be a good time for trees to conserve energy but some trees do the opposite. Instead of giving up, they spend extra energy producing anthocyanins to turn their leaves red and purple hues. These colors protect their leaves from sun damage before their nutrients can all be used and may also be a defense against insects looking for a parasitic home. A way for the tree to tell the insects: &quot;Yes, I am in part dying but not without a fight. I am still very much vital.&quot; Drought and even tourniquets applied by man can bring about these colors prematurely. When you look at beautiful autumn colors, you are looking at stress. But the bigger the fight the trees put up, the more energy they put into their defenses at the very end, the more brilliant their colors will be. Winter will eventually come. But scientifically, the brightest, deepest, most remarkable colors come from not giving up too easily or quickly. And as always, thanks for watching.", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T19:13:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GB Redstone", "comment_text": "V\u0335\u031a\u034b\u033e\u0356\u0359\u034es\u0338\u035d\u0360\u033f\u035c\u0321\u034ea\u0334\u0341\u034b\u033d\u031d\u033b\u0359u\u0338\u035d\u035d\u0358\u032b\u0318s\u0334\u034c\u0346\u0352\u0318\u033c\u0354e\u0335\u0351\u033d\u0353\u033b\u0326", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T18:50:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GB Redstone", "comment_text": "m\u0338\u033e\u0341\u0349\u032a\u034ei\u0338\u0314\u0344\u0340\u031f\u035a\u035as\u0334\u0314\u0344\u0340\u034d\u0356\u0322t\u0334\u0313\u0312\u034a\u032b\u0356\u032aa\u0338\u0350\u033d\u0312\u032a\u034d\u0349e\u0335\u0313\u0343\u0312\u034e\u0318\u034es\u0335\u035b\u035b\u0344\u032b\u0354\u034e", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T18:49:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GB Redstone", "comment_text": "M\u0334\u0352\u0358\u0354\u0321\u0347i\u0334\u0352\u0341\u0315\u0349\u0353s\u0334\u0314\u0341\u0351\u034d\u033a\u033ct\u0335\u0351\u0344\u034c\u0319\u035a\u0322a\u0334\u0352\u0346\u034b\u0347\u0319\u032bk\u0338\u0310\u0352\u0347\u0326\u0356e\u0335\u0340\u0350\u034b\u0326\u0347\u033as\u0334\u0346\u0346\u0358\u0353\u0353\u0354", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T18:46:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "funchampiongaming", "comment_text": "So basically, Imperial units are wrong..", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T16:30:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Smith", "comment_text": "Michaels said: &quot;4 years after the events in this image (the image of carrying a wounded man) Tandey caught a wounded German solider in his gun sights but rather than kill the man Tandey took pity on his wounded state and spared his life&quot;, if I understood correctly Michael isn&#39;t saying that the pic &quot;may be&quot; for Tandey carrying Hitler right? it&#39;s just the same Tandey but the pic is surely not of Hitler.", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T15:19:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rei", "comment_text": "Searched up &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and this showed up", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T14:26:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soggy Tonis puri", "comment_text": "I am somewhat one myself", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T09:59:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kresher", "comment_text": "<b>Intresting fact: you don&#39;t search this video.</b>", "comment_date": "2020-04-16T18:00:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u0391\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2", "comment_text": "\u02da\u0f3a\u22c4\u22b0\u1e6eh\u1e15\u2218\u2240\u221d\u0f3b\u02da", "comment_date": "2020-04-16T16:49:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Name", "comment_text": "&quot;Imagine Spelling Words Wrong..&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>This post was made by The Skeppy Gang.", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T11:03:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saturn Refinement", "comment_text": "Vsauce decides to talk about air,<br><br>Also Vsauce: <b>ERR</b>", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T07:54:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xeliicious", "comment_text": "Micheal rolling around in the snow is perfect. 6 years later, it&#39;s still the best ending to a Vsauce video.", "comment_date": "2020-04-12T21:50:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liza Piashko", "comment_text": "TIL that I&#39;ve been pronouncing knife properly this whole time", "comment_date": "2020-04-12T21:14:44Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "L 1000", "comment_text": "<b>hey michael vsauce here</b>", "comment_date": "2020-04-12T14:15:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Charlie He", "comment_text": "Every time he begins with &quot;Hey, Vsauce!

Michael here. The title of this video is misspelled in honor of mistakes. Mistakes are everywhere, they surround us like air. To err is human. Faults, flaws, faux pas, fumbles and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today as the stuff we&#39;ve gotten right. For instance, if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee, why would there be so many &quot;k&quot;s? Well, the &quot;k&quot;s are silent by mistake. The original old English forms of these words were pronounced with &quot;k&quot; sounds. K-nife, k-night, k-nee. But that&#39;s a bit of a mouthful to say and because reading and writing weren&#39;t as common hundreds of years ago, people just pronounced words the way they want to do, regardless of spelling. Spelling is fun. Warren G knows what I&#39;m talking about. In the fourth verse of his &quot;What&#39;s Next&quot;, he asks what&#39;s next. What&#39;s next, what&#39;s N-X-E-T. Spelling isn&#39;t the only thing we get wrong. The history of science is a graveyard of dead an abandoned ideas. Fritz Machlup coined the phrase &quot;Half-life of knowledge&quot;. The amount of time it takes for half of the knowledge within a field to be superseded by new, better ideas or to simply be shown untrue. Donald Hebb famously estimated that the half-life of knowledge in psychology is just five years. Humans are awesome, don&#39;t get me wrong, but we tend to believe that what we currently think we know about the universe is reasonably correct, even though statistics aren&#39;t on our side. Previous generations incorrectly thought the exact same thing about what they used to think was true. My favorite examples of the ubiquity of mistakes are production errors in popular songs. They&#39;re like humbling Easter eggs, just waiting to be found. For instance, Buffalo Springfield&#39;s &quot;For What It&#39;s Worth&quot;. 26 seconds in the &quot;be&quot; in the lyric &quot;beware&quot; is clipped, as is the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;people&quot; at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=1m24s\">1:24</a> minute. Once you hear the mistake, it&#39;s tough to unhear it. In &quot;Hey Jude&quot; Paul McCartney misses a chord. And if you listen closely you can clearly hear him say &quot;F**ing hll&quot;. Seriously, it&#39;s in the actual song. Go listen to it. In fact, there&#39;s an entire website that chronicles mistakes in Beatles&#39; songs. Take a look at this 700-year-old prayer book. A monk wrote it on fresh, clean paper. I&#39;m kidding, of course. He scraped the ink off an older manuscript, cut the pages and rotated them before writing all over them. A mistake? Well, kind of. Recent multispectral images of the prayer book have revealed that the old manuscript he erased was a previously unknown copy of a work by Archimedes. It was called &quot;The Method&quot; and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years before Newton and Leibniz. If that one monk hadn&#39;t erased that one book, would we be hundreds, thousands of years mathematically and technologically more advanced today than we currently are? It&#39;s hard to say. All that is certain is that we would continue to make ridiculous mistakes, like the Mars Climate Orbiter. This 327.6 million dollar expedition burned up in the red planet&#39;s atmosphere because when calculating flight maneuvers NASA used the agreed-upon metric units while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system. This is Neil Armstrong taking humankind&#39;s first steps on the Moon. It&#39;s about the best footage we have. The original tapes containing the highest quality recording of that moment have been lost. They were probably recorded over by later test missions. Ten years ago Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while hunting outside of San Diego. Hoping to attract the attention of rescuers, he lit a small fire. But that fire quickly got out of control and became a giant Cedar Fire. It destroyed 300,000 acres of land, 2,322 homes and killed 15 people. The man carrying a wounded soldier in this painting, based on a photograph taken during World War I, is Henry Tandey, an English recipient of the Victoria Cross. Four years after the event in this image Tandey caught a wounded German soldier in his gun sights. But rather than kill the man, Tandey took pity on his wounded state and spared his life. The German he allowed to live was this man. Later the man whose life he spared wore his mustache shorter but still had the same name, Adolf Hitler. In 1918 did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill Hitler? Detailed researchers found that the exact days their units were in the same location don&#39;t quite match up. The story is apocryphal but what is known is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting of Tandey, and in 1938, when meeting with Neville Chamberlain, Hitler pointed to Tandey and told Chamberlain: &quot;That man came so close to killing me in 1918 that I thought I should never see Germany again.&quot; So, who&#39;s wrong? Maybe Hitler confirmed the story merely because he hoped to make up extra evidence that providence had kept him alive to pursue his goals. Either way, someone is mistaken. Missed opportunities are a bummer. Obsessing over them is not healthy but regret is a powerful emotion. How do you deal with regret, with guilt? Can you? In the early morning hours on a bench outside a hotel in Anaheim this summer Ze Frank told me something I am going to paraphrase. I love this metaphor. Stuff in your past is like a carving on the bark of sapling. Over time, the scar, the carving won&#39;t go away. Because of the way trees grow it won&#39;t go up or down much either, it&#39;ll just stay right where it began. It might even get darker. But it won&#39;t get bigger. You, however, can. You can keep growing, doing more things, more branches, being more things. The wound won&#39;t get smaller but you can make it a smaller part of who you are. Maybe regrets are like that. They stick around forever like arborglyphs. Or maybe they make like a tree and leaf. A red or purple leaf in the autumn. As days get shorter and chlorophyll production decreases, the yellow and orange carotenoids, which are always in leaves, appear as the green fades. But red and purple leaves are the interesting ones. As winter approaches it would seem to be a good time for trees to conserve energy but some trees do the opposite. Instead of giving up, they spend extra energy producing anthocyanins to turn their leaves red and purple hues. These colors protect their leaves from sun damage before their nutrients can all be used and may also be a defense against insects looking for a parasitic home. A way for the tree to tell the insects: &quot;Yes, I am in part dying but not without a fight. I am still very much vital.&quot; Drought and even tourniquets applied by man can bring about these colors prematurely. When you look at beautiful autumn colors, you are looking at stress.

Michael here. The title of this video is misspelled in honor of mistakes. Mistakes are everywhere, they surround us like air. To err is human. Faults, flaws, faux pas, fumbles and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today as the stuff we&#39;ve gotten right. For instance, if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee, why would there be so many &quot;k&quot;s? Well, the &quot;k&quot;s are silent by mistake. The original old English forms of these words were pronounced with &quot;k&quot; sounds. K-nife, k-night, k-nee. But that&#39;s a bit of a mouthful to say and because reading and writing weren&#39;t as common hundreds of years ago, people just pronounced words the way they want to do, regardless of spelling. Spelling is fun. Warren G knows what I&#39;m talking about. In the fourth verse of his &quot;What&#39;s Next&quot;, he asks what&#39;s next. What&#39;s next, what&#39;s N-X-E-T. Spelling isn&#39;t the only thing we get wrong. The history of science is a graveyard of dead an abandoned ideas. Fritz Machlup coined the phrase &quot;Half-life of knowledge&quot;. The amount of time it takes for half of the knowledge within a field to be superseded by new, better ideas or to simply be shown untrue. Donald Hebb famously estimated that the half-life of knowledge in psychology is just five years. Humans are awesome, don&#39;t get me wrong, but we tend to believe that what we currently think we know about the universe is reasonably correct, even though statistics aren&#39;t on our side. Previous generations incorrectly thought the exact same thing about what they used to think was true. My favorite examples of the ubiquity of mistakes are production errors in popular songs. They&#39;re like humbling Easter eggs, just waiting to be found. For instance, Buffalo Springfield&#39;s &quot;For What It&#39;s Worth&quot;. 26 seconds in the &quot;be&quot; in the lyric &quot;beware&quot; is clipped, as is the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;people&quot; at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=1m24s\">1:24</a> minute. Once you hear the mistake, it&#39;s tough to unhear it. In &quot;Hey Jude&quot; Paul McCartney misses a chord. And if you listen closely you can clearly hear him say &quot;F**ing hll&quot;. Seriously, it&#39;s in the actual song. Go listen to it. In fact, there&#39;s an entire website that chronicles mistakes in Beatles&#39; songs. Take a look at this 700-year-old prayer book. A monk wrote it on fresh, clean paper. I&#39;m kidding, of course. He scraped the ink off an older manuscript, cut the pages and rotated them before writing all over them. A mistake? Well, kind of. Recent multispectral images of the prayer book have revealed that the old manuscript he erased was a previously unknown copy of a work by Archimedes. It was called &quot;The Method&quot; and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years before Newton and Leibniz. If that one monk hadn&#39;t erased that one book, would we be hundreds, thousands of years mathematically and technologically more advanced today than we currently are? It&#39;s hard to say. All that is certain is that we would continue to make ridiculous mistakes, like the Mars Climate Orbiter. This 327.6 million dollar expedition burned up in the red planet&#39;s atmosphere because when calculating flight maneuvers NASA used the agreed-upon metric units while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system. This is Neil Armstrong taking humankind&#39;s first steps on the Moon. It&#39;s about the best footage we have. The original tapes containing the highest quality recording of that moment have been lost. They were probably recorded over by later test missions. Ten years ago Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while hunting outside of San Diego. Hoping to attract the attention of rescuers, he lit a small fire. But that fire quickly got out of control and became a giant Cedar Fire. It destroyed 300,000 acres of land, 2,322 homes and killed 15 people. The man carrying a wounded soldier in this painting, based on a photograph taken during World War I, is Henry Tandey, an English recipient of the Victoria Cross. Four years after the event in this image Tandey caught a wounded German soldier in his gun sights. But rather than kill the man, Tandey took pity on his wounded state and spared his life. The German he allowed to live was this man. Later the man whose life he spared wore his mustache shorter but still had the same name, Adolf Hitler. In 1918 did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill Hitler? Detailed researchers found that the exact days their units were in the same location don&#39;t quite match up. The story is apocryphal but what is known is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting of Tandey, and in 1938, when meeting with Neville Chamberlain, Hitler pointed to Tandey and told Chamberlain: &quot;That man came so close to killing me in 1918 that I thought I should never see Germany again.&quot; So, who&#39;s wrong? Maybe Hitler confirmed the story merely because he hoped to make up extra evidence that providence had kept him alive to pursue his goals. Either way, someone is mistaken. Missed opportunities are a bummer. Obsessing over them is not healthy but regret is a powerful emotion. How do you deal with regret, with guilt? Can you? In the early morning hours on a bench outside a hotel in Anaheim this summer Ze Frank told me something I am going to paraphrase. I love this metaphor. Stuff in your past is like a carving on the bark of sapling. Over time, the scar, the carving won&#39;t go away. Because of the way trees grow it won&#39;t go up or down much either, it&#39;ll just stay right where it began. It might even get darker. But it won&#39;t get bigger. You, however, can. You can keep growing, doing more things, more branches, being more things. The wound won&#39;t get smaller but you can make it a smaller part of who you are. Maybe regrets are like that. They stick around forever like arborglyphs. Or maybe they make like a tree and leaf. A red or purple leaf in the autumn. As days get shorter and chlorophyll production decreases, the yellow and orange carotenoids, which are always in leaves, appear as the green fades. But red and purple leaves are the interesting ones. As winter approaches it would seem to be a good time for trees to conserve energy but some trees do the opposite. Instead of giving up, they spend extra energy producing anthocyanins to turn their leaves red and purple hues. These colors protect their leaves from sun damage before their nutrients can all be used and may also be a defense against insects looking for a parasitic home. A way for the tree to tell the insects: &quot;Yes, I am in part dying but not without a fight. I am still very much vital.&quot; Drought and even tourniquets applied by man can bring about these colors prematurely. When you look at beautiful autumn colors, you are looking at stress. But the bigger the fight the trees put up, the more energy they put into their defenses at the very end, the more brilliant their colors will be. Winter will eventually come. But scientifically, the brightest, deepest, most remarkable colors come from not giving up too easily or quickly. And as always, thanks for watching.  cool huh.", "comment_date": "2019-11-03T19:32:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ravi Kiran", "comment_text": "Fuck that monk", "comment_date": "2019-11-03T04:11:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "c C", "comment_text": "My mom made the worst mistake ever", "comment_date": "2019-11-03T02:57:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "slipery monkey", "comment_text": "at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=3m27s\">3:27</a> i had deja vu", "comment_date": "2019-11-02T16:49:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Addison Q", "comment_text": "This is is what I get when I search up my name", "comment_date": "2019-11-01T22:42:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frallan", "comment_text": "\u200c", "comment_date": "2019-11-01T21:47:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin Lees", "comment_text": "When you open your phone at night <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a>", "comment_date": "2019-11-01T08:24:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ray lxh", "comment_text": "&quot;There is no mistakes , only happy little accidents&quot;<br>-Bob Ross", "comment_date": "2019-11-01T03:26:35Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Cartoon Master", "comment_text": "No one:<br>Absolutely no one:<br>Me: (sees title) JuST MOnKiA &gt;:D", "comment_date": "2019-11-01T02:04:07Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Multi Creations", "comment_text": "\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e", "comment_date": "2019-11-01T01:56:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pandakicker", "comment_text": "I BLOW MY NOSE AT YOU, ARTHUR KING!

Michael here. The title of this video is misspelled in honor of mistakes. Mistakes are everywhere, they surround us like air. To err is human. Faults, flaws, faux pas, fumbles and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today as the stuff we&#39;ve gotten right. For instance, if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee, why would there be so many &quot;k&quot;s? Well, the &quot;k&quot;s are silent by mistake. The original old English forms of these words were pronounced with &quot;k&quot; sounds. K-nife, k-night, k-nee. But that&#39;s a bit of a mouthful to say and because reading and writing weren&#39;t as common hundreds of years ago, people just pronounced words the way they want to do, regardless of spelling. Spelling is fun. Warren G knows what I&#39;m talking about. In the fourth verse of his &quot;What&#39;s Next&quot;, he asks what&#39;s next. What&#39;s next, what&#39;s N-X-E-T. Spelling isn&#39;t the only thing we get wrong. The history of science is a graveyard of dead an abandoned ideas. Fritz Machlup coined the phrase &quot;Half-life of knowledge&quot;. The amount of time it takes for half of the knowledge within a field to be superseded by new, better ideas or to simply be shown untrue. Donald Hebb famously estimated that the half-life of knowledge in psychology is just five years. Humans are awesome, don&#39;t get me wrong, but we tend to believe that what we currently think we know about the universe is reasonably correct, even though statistics aren&#39;t on our side. Previous generations incorrectly thought the exact same thing about what they used to think was true. My favorite examples of the ubiquity of mistakes are production errors in popular songs. They&#39;re like humbling Easter eggs, just waiting to be found. For instance, Buffalo Springfield&#39;s &quot;For What It&#39;s Worth&quot;. 26 seconds in the &quot;be&quot; in the lyric &quot;beware&quot; is clipped, as is the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;people&quot; at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=1m24s\">1:24</a> minute. Once you hear the mistake, it&#39;s tough to unhear it. In &quot;Hey Jude&quot; Paul McCartney misses a chord. And if you listen closely you can clearly hear him say &quot;F**ing hll&quot;. Seriously, it&#39;s in the actual song. Go listen to it. In fact, there&#39;s an entire website that chronicles mistakes in Beatles&#39; songs. Take a look at this 700-year-old prayer book. A monk wrote it on fresh, clean paper. I&#39;m kidding, of course. He scraped the ink off an older manuscript, cut the pages and rotated them before writing all over them. A mistake? Well, kind of. Recent multispectral images of the prayer book have revealed that the old manuscript he erased was a previously unknown copy of a work by Archimedes. It was called &quot;The Method&quot; and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years before Newton and Leibniz. If that one monk hadn&#39;t erased that one book, would we be hundreds, thousands of years mathematically and technologically more advanced today than we currently are? It&#39;s hard to say. All that is certain is that we would continue to make ridiculous mistakes, like the Mars Climate Orbiter. This 327.6 million dollar expedition burned up in the red planet&#39;s atmosphere because when calculating flight maneuvers NASA used the agreed-upon metric units while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system. This is Neil Armstrong taking humankind&#39;s first steps on the Moon. It&#39;s about the best footage we have. The original tapes containing the highest quality recording of that moment have been lost. They were probably recorded over by later test missions. Ten years ago Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while hunting outside of San Diego. Hoping to attract the attention of rescuers, he lit a small fire. But that fire quickly got out of control and became a giant Cedar Fire. It destroyed 300,000 acres of land, 2,322 homes and killed 15 people. The man carrying a wounded soldier in this painting, based on a photograph taken during World War I, is Henry Tandey, an English recipient of the Victoria Cross. Four years after the event in this image Tandey caught a wounded German soldier in his gun sights. But rather than kill the man, Tandey took pity on his wounded state and spared his life. The German he allowed to live was this man. Later the man whose life he spared wore his mustache shorter but still had the same name, Adolf Hitler. In 1918 did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill Hitler? Detailed researchers found that the exact days their units were in the same location don&#39;t quite match up. The story is apocryphal but what is known is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting of Tandey, and in 1938, when meeting with Neville Chamberlain, Hitler pointed to Tandey and told Chamberlain: &quot;That man came so close to killing me in 1918 that I thought I should never see Germany again.&quot; So, who&#39;s wrong? Maybe Hitler confirmed the story merely because he hoped to make up extra evidence that providence had kept him alive to pursue his goals. Either way, someone is mistaken. Missed opportunities are a bummer. Obsessing over them is not healthy but regret is a powerful emotion. How do you deal with regret, with guilt? Can you? In the early morning hours on a bench outside a hotel in Anaheim this summer Ze Frank told me something I am going to paraphrase. I love this metaphor. Stuff in your past is like a carving on the bark of sapling. Over time, the scar, the carving won&#39;t go away. Because of the way trees grow it won&#39;t go up or down much either, it&#39;ll just stay right where it began. It might even get darker. But it won&#39;t get bigger. You, however, can. You can keep growing, doing more things, more branches, being more things. The wound won&#39;t get smaller but you can make it a smaller part of who you are. Maybe regrets are like that. They stick around forever like arborglyphs. Or maybe they make like a tree and leaf. A red or purple leaf in the autumn. As days get shorter and chlorophyll production decreases, the yellow and orange carotenoids, which are always in leaves, appear as the green fades. But red and purple leaves are the interesting ones. As winter approaches it would seem to be a good time for trees to conserve energy but some trees do the opposite. Instead of giving up, they spend extra energy producing anthocyanins to turn their leaves red and purple hues. These colors protect their leaves from sun damage before their nutrients can all be used and may also be a defense against insects looking for a parasitic home. A way for the tree to tell the insects: &quot;Yes, I am in part dying but not without a fight. I am still very much vital.&quot; Drought and even tourniquets applied by man can bring about these colors prematurely. When you look at beautiful autumn colors, you are looking at stress. But the bigger the fight the trees put up, the more energy they put into their defenses at the very end, the more brilliant their colors will be. Winter will eventually come. But scientifically, the brightest, deepest, most remarkable colors come from not giving up too easily or quickly. And as always, thanks for watching.", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T23:29:09Z", "likes_count": 4766}, {"comment_by": "CandySeller74", "comment_text": "Bro this title is totally me", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T19:03:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kosmiczny Szkieletor", "comment_text": "My life is a mistake", "comment_date": "2019-03-27T14:41:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frappy", "comment_text": "I&#39;m also a mistake!", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T23:41:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "King Treedede", "comment_text": "Lol it&#39;s spelled mistake", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T20:56:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zeeshan Khokhar", "comment_text": "Love you Michael", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T08:20:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Blob Of Slime", "comment_text": "Misspelled is an understatement, your title got possessed  by satan.", "comment_date": "2019-03-25T00:58:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "aSb_flixks7o", "comment_text": "There is no mistake in this sentence.

Michael here. The title of this video is misspelled in honor of mistakes. Mistakes are everywhere, they surround us like air. To err is human. Faults, flaws, faux pas, fumbles and fallacies are as much a part of who we are today as the stuff we&#39;ve gotten right. For instance, if a knight knocked your knuckle or knifed your knee, why would there be so many &quot;k&quot;s? Well, the &quot;k&quot;s are silent by mistake. The original old English forms of these words were pronounced with &quot;k&quot; sounds. K-nife, k-night, k-nee. But that&#39;s a bit of a mouthful to say and because reading and writing weren&#39;t as common hundreds of years ago, people just pronounced words the way they want to do, regardless of spelling. Spelling is fun. Warren G knows what I&#39;m talking about. In the fourth verse of his &quot;What&#39;s Next&quot;, he asks what&#39;s next. What&#39;s next, what&#39;s N-X-E-T. Spelling isn&#39;t the only thing we get wrong. The history of science is a graveyard of dead an abandoned ideas. Fritz Machlup coined the phrase &quot;Half-life of knowledge&quot;. The amount of time it takes for half of the knowledge within a field to be superseded by new, better ideas or to simply be shown untrue. Donald Hebb famously estimated that the half-life of knowledge in psychology is just five years. Humans are awesome, don&#39;t get me wrong, but we tend to believe that what we currently think we know about the universe is reasonably correct, even though statistics aren&#39;t on our side. Previous generations incorrectly thought the exact same thing about what they used to think was true. My favorite examples of the ubiquity of mistakes are production errors in popular songs. They&#39;re like humbling Easter eggs, just waiting to be found. For instance, Buffalo Springfield&#39;s &quot;For What It&#39;s Worth&quot;. 26 seconds in the &quot;be&quot; in the lyric &quot;beware&quot; is clipped, as is the &quot;p&quot; in &quot;people&quot; at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=1m24s\">1:24</a> minute. Once you hear the mistake, it&#39;s tough to unhear it. In &quot;Hey Jude&quot; Paul McCartney misses a cord. And if you listen closely you can clearly hear him say &quot;F**ing hll&quot;. Seriously, it&#39;s in the actual song. Go listen to it. In fact, there&#39;s an entire website that chronicles mistakes in Beatles&#39; songs. Take a look at this 700-year-old prayer book. A monk wrote it on fresh, clean paper. I&#39;m kidding, of course. He scraped the ink off an older manuscript, cut the pages and rotated them before writing all over them. A mistake? Well, kind of. Recent multispectral images of the prayer book have revealed that the old manuscript he erased was a previously unknown copy of a work by Archimedes. It was called &quot;The Method&quot; and laid out the heart of calculus thousands of years before Newton and Leibniz. If that one monk hadn&#39;t erased that one book, would we be hundreds, thousands of years mathematically and technologically more advanced today than we currently are? It&#39;s hard to say. All that is certain is that we would continue to make ridiculous mistakes, like the Mars Climate Orbiter. This 327.6 million dollar expedition burned up in the red planet&#39;s atmosphere because when calculating flight maneuvers NASA used the agreed-upon metric units while Lockheed Martin used the imperial system. This is Neil Armstrong taking humankind&#39;s first steps on the Moon. It&#39;s about the best footage we have. The original tapes containing the highest quality recording of that moment have been lost. They were probably recorded over by later test missions. Ten years ago Sergio Martinez became lost in the woods while hunting outside of San Diego. Hoping to attract the attention of rescuers, he lit a small fire. But that fire quickly got out of control and became a giant Cedar Fire. It destroyed 300,000 acres of land, 2,322 homes and killed 15 people. The man carrying a wounded soldier in this painting, based on a photograph taken during World War I, is Henry Tandey, an English recipient of the Victoria Cross. Four years after the event in this image Tandey caught a wounded German soldier in his gun sights. But rather than kill the man, Tandey took pity on his wounded state and spared his life. The German he allowed to live was this man. Later the man whose life he spared wore his mustache shorter but still had the same name, Adolf Hitler. In 1918 did Henry Tandey miss a chance to kill Hitler? Detailed researchers found that the exact days their units were in the same location don&#39;t quite match up. The story is apocryphal but what is known is that Hitler owned a copy of the painting of Tandey, and in 1938, when meeting with Neville Chamberlain, Hitler pointed to Tandey and told Chamberlain: &quot;That man came so close to killing me in 1918 that I thought I should never see Germany again.&quot; So, who&#39;s wrong? Maybe Hitler confirmed the story merely because he hoped to make up extra evidence that providence had kept him alive to pursue his goals. Either way, someone is mistaken. Missed opportunities are a bummer. Obsessing over them is not healthy but regret is a powerful emotion. How do you deal with regret, with guilt? Can you? In the early morning hours on a bench outside a hotel in Anaheim this summer Ze Frank told me something I am going to paraphrase. I love this metaphor. Stuff in your past is like a carving on the bark of sapling. Over time, the scar, the carving won&#39;t go away. Because of the way trees grow it won&#39;t go up or down much either, it&#39;ll just stay right where it began. It might even get darker. But it won&#39;t get bigger. You, however, can. You can keep growing, doing more things, more branches, being more things. The wound won&#39;t get smaller but you can make it a smaller part of who you are. Maybe regrets are like that. They stick around forever like arborglyphs. Or maybe they make like a tree and leaf. A red or purple leaf in the autumn. As days get shorter and chlorophyll production decreases, the yellow and orange carotenoids, which are always in leaves, appear as the green fades. But red and purple leaves are the interesting ones. As winter approaches it would seem to be a good time for trees to conserve energy but some trees do the opposite. Instead of giving up, they spend extra energy producing anthocyanins to turn their leaves red and purple hues. These colors protect their leaves from sun damage before their nutrients can all be used and may also be a defense against insects looking for a parasitic home. A way for the tree to tell the insects: &quot;Yes, I am in part dying but not without a fight. I am still very much vital.&quot; Drought and even tourniquets applied by man can bring about these colors prematurely. When you look at beautiful autumn colors, you are looking at stress. But the bigger the fight the trees put up, the more energy they put into their defenses at the very end, the more brilliant their colors will be. Winter will eventually come. But scientifically, the brightest, deepest, most remarkable colors come from not giving up too easily or quickly. And as always, thanks for watching", "comment_date": "2019-01-18T21:52:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zaid Moazzam", "comment_text": "What was that after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=9m10s\">9:10</a>", "comment_date": "2019-01-18T13:43:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pope Francis", "comment_text": "Vsauce is good", "comment_date": "2019-01-18T12:45:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stevey Ray", "comment_text": "Ironically there is a mistake in this video in that when talking about the moon landing Michael omits to mention the much bigger mistake that is made.

I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric.

But what Mr Vsauce seems to be saying is that these trees actually SPEND energy producing additional red/yellow colouration to overpower and mask the normal green colouring.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-02-06T02:47:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackson Lake", "comment_text": "Lol ironic Michael made 2 mistakes in video, he said it was his fav metaphor even tho it was a similie also he supports Gillingham, that&#39;s a mistake cuz football must be fuckin depressing for him...", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T23:42:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackson Lake", "comment_text": "Lol ironic Michael made 2 mistakes in video, he said it was his fav metaphor even tho it was a similie also he supports Gillingham, that&#39;s a mistake cuz football must be fuckin depressing for him...", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T23:42:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Theeverest Peak", "comment_text": "If that monk hadn&#39;t gotten written over that paper....we could have the iphone 7!", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T21:50:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skylar Karrasch", "comment_text": "How do you get the weird mess of code around &quot;mistkaes&quot; at least thats how it looks on my computer. it reminds me of MissingNo. from Pokemon", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T21:16:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Khalid Al badhri", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=4m53s\">4:53</a>-<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=5m26s\">5:26</a> this is why there are no pussy&#39;s in the army", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T20:57:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cal Ford", "comment_text": "More DONGS plz!", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T19:58:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benoit", "comment_text": "How have I never heard about your channel before today V-Sauce, I&#39;m loving your vids.", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T17:51:01Z", "likes_count": 26}, {"comment_by": "Lyubomir Koynarski", "comment_text": "Fan of Gillingham? ;d", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T17:20:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MRazZ", "comment_text": "damn !! the last part was fucking inspirational !!", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T15:23:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "natashaitaliano31", "comment_text": "You are amazing!!!", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T12:02:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "natashaitaliano31", "comment_text": "Really?", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T12:01:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "natashaitaliano31", "comment_text": "You real or not?", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T12:00:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zain gilani", "comment_text": "You should be a teacher mike", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T07:43:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yeehawwoohoo", "comment_text": "oh goodness sir! thou hast an arrow in thy kuh-nee.", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T07:37:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Florence", "comment_text": "dem sick moves", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T06:26:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gundamn Mechas", "comment_text": "i really needed to hear this.", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T06:02:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Lozada", "comment_text": "Dat ending", "comment_date": "2014-02-05T05:12:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "commentcomingthrough", "comment_text": "I made the mistake of pronouncing tyranny as TIE-ra-nny and now the actual pronunciation sounds odd.

The first time I noticed it was when Michael made that expression A LOT during the &quot;SPACE STRAW&quot; video, and I re-watched a couple recent videos, and he also had that expression a lot. Also, you know how Michael has been taking ridiculously long breaks?\u00a0<br><br><b>EVERYTHING FOLLOWING IS SPECULATION ONLY</b><br><br>Remember when Vsauce&#39;s video breaks were only a few days? As most of us know now, it normally takes WEEKS before another video was posted. If one of you comes up with the argument saying &quot;he&#39;s making cooler and longer videos&quot;, he&#39;s managed to make &quot;cooler and longer&quot; videos in less than half the time of the break time for this video to finally be uploaded.<br><br>This video took three weeks to upload, which makes me, and a couple others, feel worried. I am not sure what happened to Vsauce and why he&#39;s been acting like this so much, but what if something happened where Michael was too caught up in it to make videos in enough time? Of course, I don&#39;t have any say in it, but I&#39;m just speculating.\u00a0<br><br>Vsauce, if you see this comment, I really think you should answer these questions in a video. If not, at least take this into mind. Sooner or later, he&#39;ll have to explain why breaks between videos have been taking so long, because he&#39;ll be barraged with these questions.

However, he then brought up the point that if before Hitler was born, racism still existed.\u00a0<br><br>Most people before this time (including several newspapers) were racist, and often judged people by colour or culture. When Hitler started the war and began killing all the Jews and Blacks, everyone started thinking,<br>\u00a0&quot;This is extreme, maybe we should stop all of this racism and violence, it&#39;s wrong to judge people like this!&quot; and we fought back. After Britain and there allies had won the war, racism was a no where near as bad as it was.<br><br>Maybe if Hitler hadn&#39;t started this war and done all these horrific things, we would still be having that problem today, as after the second World War, we had learnt our lesson about something very important...violence, racism, prejudice. In a way, Hitler saved us from a horrible future. After all, I&#39;d rather live in a place where somebody did horrible things in the past, than a place where it is all still happening in the present.<br><br>Before I finish this comment I would like to bring up that I know Hitler was a HORRIBLE man and I CERTAINLY do NOT agree with what he did IN ANY WAY. I think what he did was wrong, and I am glad he has died now and that he lost the war.

Perhaps someone that didn&#39;t publicly say things that scared the life out of all the Jews, and perhaps then all the Jewish- German scientists would not have fled to the US. The Germans would have undoubtedly had nuclear weapons long before anyone else, and it would have been virtually impossible for anyone to have stopped them, and then they would have been able to commit genocide unopposed.", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:41:49Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "SamRosNY", "comment_text": "How do you even search for this video with that title?", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:41:45Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Matty Davies", "comment_text": "GILLINGHAM GILLINGHAM GILLINGHAM, that was a guess, but best had be gillingham on your hat or i am going to look very stupid", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:41:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheBenchPressMan", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s be honest - &quot;Winter is coming&quot;", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:37:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C\u00e9dric Beaudoin", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=6m49s\">6:49</a> to get a good metaphore from Ze Frank\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:36:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheWastedButler", "comment_text": "Speaking of half-life, does anybody else think he could play the role of Gordon Freeman in a half-life movie?", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:33:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Isaac Elguea", "comment_text": "Sees the title<br>&quot;What is this black magic?&quot;", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:31:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Misbah Khan", "comment_text": "This video was such a pick me up considering that finals just ended lol", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:27:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "G Salvador", "comment_text": "that effin monk...", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:24:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andrew", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvKeCcxD3rQ&amp;t=8m24s\">8:24</a> exactly what my grandpa said before he past......", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:23:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CaptainClapped", "comment_text": "GODDAMIT TANDEY!!!", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:16:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ian Royal", "comment_text": "I love the ending", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:16:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Claudio Tapia", "comment_text": "I&#39;m so mind fucked right now.....and then Michael plays in the snow celebrating LOL ", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:16:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zain Amjad", "comment_text": "Hey, Heisenberg.", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:12:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "granyte", "comment_text": "epic ending to a very nice video", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:12:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kristina Lobzhanidze", "comment_text": "Dude this is so deep.....", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:10:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jeremiah Montgomery", "comment_text": "great vid very nice", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:07:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Walden Smith", "comment_text": "the tree medifor is a grate one", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:06:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Roberts", "comment_text": "Mistakes<br>", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:01:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nick Arnold", "comment_text": "Atlantis?", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:01:32Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Sgt.Beans", "comment_text": "Vsauce makes me a better person with each video", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:01:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kaique Farias", "comment_text": "What is the name of the ending song at 9min?", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:00:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Spang", "comment_text": "i think it&#39;s time for a new vsauce intro!", "comment_date": "2014-01-02T03:00:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Williams", "comment_text": "NICE GOING, TANDEY.

This popping effect can be reduced by something called a pop shield which is put in front of a microphone when recording vocals (it helps break up the blast of air that is caused by creating these particular sounds). Unfortunately even then the effect can still be quite audible. The raw vocals in this particular track probably had big &quot;pops&quot; in those particular spots and were therefore edited out because that sounded better then load pops in the mix.
