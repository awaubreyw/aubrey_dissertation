The Electron creates a fixed point forming a triangle from nucleus, etc. At the center of the E8 lattice is a hexagon (Most energy conserving shape) made up of 6 even triangles.", "comment_date": "2021-06-07T15:29:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zyad nasser", "comment_text": "So, what is the main topic of this video exactly?", "comment_date": "2021-06-07T13:39:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andres", "comment_text": "I&#39;m all four these puns in this four year old video, wish there were more puns moving fourward from here", "comment_date": "2021-06-07T04:50:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "CeejDaDeej", "comment_text": "there is no way this video is 4 years old...\ud83d\ude2d", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T18:05:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nightmare Court Pictures", "comment_text": "Andy Warhol.

To start things off, the easiest to understand: Mr. Krabs.

Spongebob, of course has both of these features and it is even better presented in one episode where he has golden flowing hair. Squidward represents upper class Europe with his fancy ways. He can also be interpreted as the Jews persecuted by the Germans which then helps clarify why SpongeBob constantly pesters him.<br><br>Up next is Plankton. Arch-nemesis of Mr. Krabs and this can be taken as enemy of capitalism as well. Who else despised capitalism? Soviet (Communist) Russia. Back then, Russia was thought to have this advanced society where everything is used and made with shiny silver/iron. This can be seen inside of the Chum Bucket operated by Plankton himself. Plankton constantly trying to steal Mr. Krabs&#39; recipe is also a metaphor for Russia&#39;s attempts at sabotaging American society leading to the red scare that can be seen whenever Plankton is spotted within the Krusty Krab and the entire restaurant goes on lockdown to prevent anything from happening. <br><br>Patrick represents the lower classes throughout war torn Europe. Patrick is unemployed and without education and conforms to whatever SpongeBob (Germany) does whether that be hunting and catching Jellyfish (outliers such as those that rebelled against Nazi Germany) or annoying Squidward (prosecuting the Jewish population).", "comment_date": "2017-02-20T19:03:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henning Andersen", "comment_text": "Does the fixed point theory really fit the cofee-mixing??

Lets look at temperature, the fact that the temperate EVER changes anywhere on earth proves that there was a jump in temperature.

I just wanted someone to disprove this because I think a lot, keep getting stuck on this point and no one seems to want to listen to me.<br><br>Infinite has an intrinsic probability. For example if a light has two settings (on, off) that means there is a 1 in 2 chance it is on and 1 in 2 chance it is off. 0.5 probability. If there are two lights with two settings there are one in four chances the first will be on and the second off. 0.25 probability. If there are infinite lights and infinite settings that means there is a 1 over 1 chance they are all on. 1 probability. This doesn&#39;t seem to make sense as there is 100% chance they are both all on and all off. You could also say it like this. If there are infinite universes there is 100% chance there is one that you can travel to all universes from and 100% chance there is a universe that cannot be traveled to even though they cannot logically coexist. <br><br>Now intelligent people and people who think they are intelligent have I found something, have done something illogical in my reasoning or is there some science/mathematics that has already taken this into account.

That theorum(in regards to Earth) assumes that you can&#39;t go from one point to another without the temperature/pressure raising/dropping in spikes. In other words: the temperature in point A and the temperature in point B drops 2 degrees, not 1. If you use exact points on the graph, instead of line, then no, this theory just falls apart. In fact, the further your degree of accuracy goes, the more unlikely it is that you will ever see two opposite points on earth with the same temperature, or the same pressure.<br><br>This theory for Earth only holds if you graph using a straight line instead of pinpoint accuracy. <br>Example: Point A was 13.659 degrees on both sides of the Earth, but no matter what, there was no Point B that was 13.659c, 13.658c, or 13.660c, simply because the temperature of the very next atom nearby on at least one side was 13.661c, while the other side was 13.657c. <br>Or, the very next atom was .000000000000000000001m to the left/right/up/down of it&#39;s counterpart. <br>Or, there was no atom at all to counterpoint, just the vacuum between loosely packed atoms, which is more likely if the surface is water. <br><br>The theory for the coffee cup is also misleading: there are infinitely more places for atoms of coffee to exist than there are atoms in the cup. Even by a degree of movement as small as the fraction of a fraction of an electron&#39;s quark, the chance that EVERY ATOM will be somewhere new and not occupying any previously existing place EXACTLY (the most exact atom could still be 1 degree tilted on the z axis differently than before mixing) is infinitesimal. <br><br>The theory CAN be true for these examples, simply due to probability, or by looseness of definition.

Reorder the numbers from largest to smallest - 9853.<br>3. Reorder the numbers from smallest to largest - 3589.<br>4. Subtract the number in step 3 from the number in step 2. 9853-3589 = 6264<br>5.

But if you use Veintitres (10) -&gt; Diez (4) -&gt; Cuatro (6) -&gt; Seis (4) -&gt; Cuatro (6) -&gt; Seis (4), you get stuck in an endless loop and never land on Cinco.

In order for it to be true, both temperature and pressure must vary continuously over the surface of the earth, but neither do.  Regions of different temperatures and pressures are separated by boundary layers that meteorologists call fronts.  Since the assumptions of the theorem are violated, the application of the theorem is invalid.<br>I knew you were going to hit one of my pet peeves the moment you mentioned infinity.  Aleph Null is not a number.  No operations valid for numbers are defined for it, not even equality.  Furthermore, any infinite sequence at n terms is different from the infinite sequence less one term at n terms by the difference between the first and nth terms, for <b>any and all n</b>, so they are only equal when the first and nth are equal.  In a monotonically decreasing sequence, this is never true. So Aleph subscript infinite aleph is not equal to Aleph subscript [infinite less one|warning: this expression is undefined, too] aleph for both reasons.<br>The coffee stirring example is wrong for the same reason as the Borsuk-Ulam example, coffee is not continuous.  I give you credit for noting that coffee isn&#39;t continuous, but a collection of particles.  But I give you failing marks for continuing.  A theorem which isn&#39;t true for discontinuities isn&#39;t true.  There is no such thing in logic as almost true.<br>But for the sake of argument, let&#39;s pretend coffee is a continuous substance.  Putting the spoon in it is a discontinuous deformation.  So is taking the spoon out.  If some of the coffee sticks to the spoon when you take it out, its a cut.  If a drop of that liquid falls off the spoon back into the coffee, that&#39;s a paste.

This seems true only in the case that an isotherm or isobar happens to have precisely corresponding antipodes to itself, allowing the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem to be used again. I do not see how math would prove this true with two continuous variables considered independently the way you described. It could just be a rare coincidence. However with that argument, it then seems highly unlikely, and can be conceivably false. I watched the other videos on the Borsuk-Ulam Theorem from the links in the dooblydoo of your video and I am still not convinced of the proof method described.

With Japanese it depends how you write the number.  Hiragana, romaji or kanji.  Or katakana, I suppose, but why use those for numbers?  Anyway, with kanji, a longer number in terms of characters within the Arabic numeral system that we use in English won&#39;t necessarily increase the number of kanji, or if it does, not by much.  For example, 10000, man, has one character in kanji, 100,000, jiu-man would use two, as would 1000,000, hyaku-man.  But then after 10,000,000, sen-man we reach the next order and a new, singular kanji because the Japanese numbering convention is based around systems of ten thousand.  A more complex number, however, would use more kanji.  10,003, for example, is man-san, which is two kanji.  Then 11,283 would be man-ichi-sen-ni-hyaku-hachi-ji-san.  Which would be seven or eight kanji, depending on if you include ichi (1) in reference to the number of thousnds (sen) or not.  In either case, the number of kanji is lower than ten, so would itself be one kanji, which then loops.  With a complex number of more than ten kanji, it would reduce to either two or three, which reduces to one, which repeats.  Nothing special there; of course one loops in this instance.  With hiragana and katakana, it would function a little differently.  San, meaning three, consists of two characters; sa and n.  Then two is ni, which is one.  Ichi is two; i and chi, so it loops between one and two.  Ten thousand, hyakuman consists of hi(ya), ku, ma and n.  This reduces to four which is either shi or yon; which go to one and two respectively and establish the loop.  Even 11,283 would do this; consisting of 14 or 15 characters, depending on if you count the ya as seperate to the hi in hyaku.  It could also be 12 or 13 if ichi is omitted.  Jiu-ni, jiu-san, jiu-yon and jiu-go consist of 3/4 or 5.  Which enter the ichi-ni-loop.  With romaji it would loop at san or ni.<br><br>Anyone who responds to this please do something similar with Spanish, then nominate a language for the next person.", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:59:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csInNn6pfT4&amp;t=7m29s\">7:29</a> Me trying to save my grades this semseter", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:59:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ColosouTDR", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csInNn6pfT4&amp;t=12m15s\">12:15</a> ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:59:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cole Richards", "comment_text": "that wafer would probably be bleached by the sun after all these years", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:59:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aiden J", "comment_text": "now lets  wait three months now", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:59:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CocaCole24", "comment_text": "Ay, that&#39;s pretty good", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:58:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thundararious", "comment_text": "god.... damn it Andy Warhol.....", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:58:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cha", "comment_text": "i love michael :)", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:58:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MeekoD", "comment_text": "WE WANT SPIT FACTS", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:58:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shea Roberts", "comment_text": "Lost me at Alf, can&#39;t find that cute cat eatin&#39; rascal anywhere...", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:58:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr TwiiL", "comment_text": "i wonder if jhin from league of legends is based off of the four number letter concept.", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:58:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Apple Dough", "comment_text": "Excellent video as always Michael.", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:58:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "big boy", "comment_text": "No spit facts.

It&#39;s called Newton&#39;s Method. If you want to find the point where two lines intersect you repeatedly use the formula <b>x-(f(x)/f`(x))</b> until the answer is continuous<br>Where:<br>x=Initial guess and subsequent answers<br>f(x)=Your original formula<br>f`(x)=The derivative of the formula<br><br>If you wanted to find sqrt(16), then you would have y=sqrt(16). However, for the formula to work, your function must be equal to 0. It has to be 0 because the formula is meant to find where the line tangent to the specified point crosses the x-axis. So we get y^2-16=0. So now f(x)=x^2-16. Plugging in these values to the formula we get:<br>g(x)=x-((x^2-16)/2x)<br>You can simplify this to get:<br>g(x)=(x+(16/x))/2<br>Where 16 is the number you want to find the square root of.<br><br>If you plug in any value and then plug the answer into the formula again, the answer will get closer and closer to the value you need. So if we use 3, we&#39;ll get the following answers:<br>g(3)=4.167<br>g(4.16666666667)=4.003<br>g(4.00333333333)=4.00000138773<br>g(4.00000138773)=4<br>g(4)=4", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:09:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oskar", "comment_text": "the idubz reference and that penis, this has to be the funniest vsauce video yet", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:09:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LordChristoff", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csInNn6pfT4&amp;t=12m15s\">12:15</a>.....Heyyyyyyyy that&#39;s pretty goood....", "comment_date": "2016-09-28T23:09:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pabs SD", "comment_text": "About time!

The grey point on the manipulated grid which would glow on the bottom right point only is located in the pink point and won&#39;t glow. The pink point on the manipulated grid which would glow only on the pink point above the bottom right point would be located on the bottom right (grey) because only the top row (originally bottom row containing grey point) of the manipulated grid is located on the pink point.

I&#39;ll try to explain it but it&#39;s hard with text and it would be easier if you could see it so I recommend using any program where you can paste images then move / rotate them (and optionally make them slightly transparent). First image the squares are named A-E from left to right and 1-5 from top to bottom. I first rotated\u00a0a second copied\u00a0image 180 degrees and made it small enough so the whole thing could fit inside one square from the other image. I then put the full shape inside box E2 which is yellow except the left most column which contained the same yellow same which I position so it was outside of box E2 and inside box D2. I hope this is clear enough for others to recreate my findings as I don&#39;t have a good way to post an image.

And I thought about if this could apply to real life, and it does. If you press the elevator call button right before if coincidentally reaches the floor you just called it to that would be a critical action.

We can get stuck in the same cicle with the number ocho (8), because it also has cuatro letters, and cuatro has seis letters and so on. The same with tres (3), and with uno (1, and uno has 3 letters), and with dos (2, the same as one), and others.<br><br>Let&#39;s try a different number, 7: siete has five letters and cinco (5) has 5 letters also. Nueve (9) also has 5 numbers, so right now we know that in sanish there can be two different cicles.<br><br>Let&#39;s try a bigger number: 1 000 000, un millon has 8 letters, and then it is in the first cicle. Dos millones (2 000 000) has eleven letters, and once (11) has also four letters, so it fits in the first cicle. Let&#39;s pick something more random, let&#39;s say dos mil setecientos ochenta y cuatro (2 784)and it has 31 letters,  and treinta y uno has 11 letters... also fits in the first one.<br><br>Then, looks like even when in spanish there is a number with the same amount of letters than the amount it represents looks like there is another cicle that has more elements to fit in, y eso siempre.

It isn&#39;t how it is in a base-10 numbering system.  The first digit to the left of the decimal point is the number of times that you have 10 to the zero-th power (or ones).  The second position is the number of times you have ten to the first power (or tens).  The third position is the number of times you have ten to the second (or hundreds)... and so forth.  Each place is one power of ten larger than the previous that is closer to the decimal point. All of this is obvious as we all just know.<br><br>Thus 25 is more accurately 2 times 10 to the first power (10+10) plus 5 times 10 to the zero-th power (the zero&#39;-th power of any base number 2 or greater is always 1... so 5 times the zero-th power of 10 is equal to 5).<br><br>Mathematically 2 ten times is the same as 10 two times. But, when trying to explain the number we know as 25, it is best to use the poper way that expresses the digits of the number in its base number notation.<br><br>A complicated subject as Fixed Points mixed in with this kind of under sight, to me, dilutes the discussion and validity for me to a consider the concept of Fixed Points.  To me, if one of the foundation building blocks of a concept is fundamentally wrong, I can&#39;t proceed with what is proposed farther down the line.
