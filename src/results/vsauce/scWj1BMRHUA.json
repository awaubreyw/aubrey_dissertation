Of course, this book is from 2006 so maybe he couldn&#39;t have anticipated what the internet would become. He says that the author controls the narrative and it is dangerous because the reader is not in control, but when you read a book the text does not change from one reader to the other one. So it would be harder for the author to control big masses, when in the case of let&#39;s say Facebook the content is tailored to the individual, so if Facebook wants to pursue someone to believe in something they can use an individual approach. Thanks to an abundance of data on users and computational power to analyze this data the problem of mass control becomes feasible.

Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on this earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there are only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water.<br>-<br>WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don&#39;t try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years.<br>-<br>DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early &#39;90s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don&#39;t know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. + TRUTH about COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc</a> <br>-<br>Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scWj1BMRHUA&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly?<br>-<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once.<br>-<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current.<br>-<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor.<br>-<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING. This website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000s as a Vision of a 10-speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ <a href=\"http://free-energy.yolasite.com/\">http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity.<br>-<br>This is a diagram <a href=\"https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php\">https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php</a> that looks a lot like the wiring of this former \u201cscience experiment\u201d YouTube video if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology<br>-<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages.

If you look at a video chances are nothing&#39;s going to spark your imagination except for all the innuendo out there and descriptions in the description of a video usually describing something complex or simple. But with books every single word ignites the mind and the imagination is lit on fire until every single part of your brain just lights straight up and then you travel from where you are to where the book describes and not only do you travel but you end up thinking that you experience something that you honestly never took part in. But at least with videos you know you didn&#39;t take part in it and you only witnessed it but with a book it can get a little muddy. Someone reading a certain book called time machine actually ends up following the page reference his going through the book in odd or this is not a natural book but Magic actually giving you the ability to play out your life in the book as if it actually shows you ways that your brain can then create the story that you want or sink you want based on probably one or two choices. But it goes even deeper than that folks. every time you touch a book someone else also touched it. but your personal device is something you alone touch and you alone can infect yourself but if someone else touches the book that you touched possibly the person who made the book or someone else who sold the book to you you never know what could be on any one of those pages perhaps some drool or some sweat or God forbid coffee stain. and I coffee stain could have germs on it. a lot faster as the book is entirely enclosed and left in darkness and likely whose terms could have spread throughout all of the page itself. at least when you&#39;re holding a device you know exactly what you&#39;re touching. and what about all that wasted wood that was used to make the paper we could have used that wood to make furniture that we could sit on while we watch things. Except there is also audio books online the worst kind the describes things in ways that also put in phasis on words that you might not have thought of in that certain way if you were to just read it yourself. but there are documents that you can just read and they have exactly the same amount of information as a book the screen versus a page has the right amount of light for your eyes but with a page you have to be in surrounding light in order to even read it such a waste of power. not to mention the ink that the book is printed in or the books pictures. we might be able to see pictures on the internet&#39;s but these books could be pop out books. such a thing is allowed to be not only flat but then end up in free Dimensions like a hologram only it actually has physicality because you can touch all the dimensions even though it started off as a flat surface it defies logic. And what happens if the bird crew to catch on fire or what happens if you get a Papercut or what happens when somebody rips out a page of the book then it no longer exists as you want some. But you can&#39;t do that digital books you know that everything is there and was not deleted by any other user because they can&#39;t even delete the book you know that what was once there it will always be there and you can rely on that. don&#39;t get me started on cardboard.<br> <br> What do you think? could I have a talented mind?

Reading requires visualization and the involvement of other senses, and what you get out of much of it depends who you are.  People with different levels of intellect will get different results.  So will someone who reads about how a flower smells and remembers it instead of not sharing the sense impression the author attempts to convey.  Have a half dozen people read a poem and see how many different impressions you get, from appreciation to understanding, and on many different levels.  Try to read a book after seeing the movie and not picture the hero with the actor&#39;s face.  Try to read a book with politics you disagree with and feel unaffected.

We would expect alien creatures on another planet (that fly) to develop very similar shapes and methods of movement.  They are constrained by the laws of ohysics in the same way the bird, plane, and alien are.<br>The point is that sci-fi designs become real in the future not because those inventors were copying old ideas but rather because in the &#39;old&#39; days the people writing the stories (or films) were looking forward with a good sense of design creativity.

Now, where did this all come from? This complex information system? The Big bang explains the &quot;How&quot; if you choose to believe it but like all people ask, what was before? Right now, no one knows at all. It could very well be a creation, a simulation, an experiment, a fluke, we don&#39;t know.

A lot of which is morally reprehensible. The peak of the deep web is haven to hackers and script kiddies, celebrity gossip, research data and government files (wikileaks started here). Anyone who frequents it enough, knows about what lies below that, and not exactly that much farther down. At best, the deep web at its peak is morally sketchy with suicide recordings, gore, low-ball child pornography. Superviruses lurk here as well, like Michelangelo or Blowfish. If you&#39;re browsing here, know what you&#39;re doing, and have a strong antivirus.<br><br>As we go down and require TOR services with more dedication, we approach powerful artificial intelligence, data analysis, company secrets and contacts that you aren&#39;t supposed to know as a rank and file citizen. Be warned, at this point, you are dealing with people who are MUCH smarter than you. You may run into the wrong alley if you catch the metaphor.<br><br>As we go deeper, we are going into the absolute morally derelict sections of the internet. Things that I won&#39;t even discuss in detail in public, but more commonly, assassination networks, weapons trade, hard drugs dealing, human trafficking, SLAVERY, hardcore child pornography, exotic animal trade, poaching, corporate exchanging, multi-billion dollar deals, hard candy, the Silk Road (which has been taken down), the dark network...<br><br>Your proxy that you&#39;ve been using is basically useless at this point. In all honesty, if you are a normal, law abiding citizen, there is no reason why you should be here. Absolutely none. Click on the wrong thing, you could have federal authorities busting down your door, or worse, people that you don&#39;t even know. You should be paranoid at finding information.<br><br>As you go deeper, and at this point we&#39;re deep, we&#39;re finding information that you can&#39;t even access unless you&#39;re the top 1% of computer know-how. AI Superintelligence, the Nephilism courier network, the AI box, even more hardcore pornography (Ariel Castro type, the things here make him look like a small time drug dealer). It&#39;s very sketchy in here, and it&#39;s expected to go deeper, in what&#39;s called the Mariana&#39;s Web. What lies here is anyone&#39;s guess.<br><br><br>tl;dr Don&#39;t go browsing the deep web, you DON&#39;T know what you&#39;re getting yourself into. Some people have said on here that you&#39;re going to be put in prison immediately, that&#39;s not true, but I guarantee you that there is a reason why this is a haven for those who don&#39;t want to be tracked.<br><br>It is the real deal criminal world on the power on the internet, doing what criminals have always done, and they&#39;re smart.

This type thing happens all the time, especially on Youtube, sometimes for the better, often times not, change is then usually taken back or further tweaked until a desired outcome is reached.<br>I have nothing against the musical talent you have used in recent weeks, I don&#39;t think the selections picked have been very fitting to the Vsauce mold. Mr McCoy I&#39;m sure would be better listened to as a stand alone product. Not tossed into the sauce, in an attempt to recreate the ambiance we took for granted a few months back.<br>Honestly, Vsauce without Jake Chudnow&#39;s ambient sounds tying everything together is like having a race car, that when you press the accelerator, instead of an engines roar, you hear a squeaking hamster wheel.<br>As one of the earliest subscribers, and a faithful follower of all things Vsauce, I&#39;d like to address the issue of Jake Chudnow&#39;s audio tracks, and their sudden removal from the channel. The two parts, the channels content, and those music tracks, were a marriage found nowhere else. JC&#39;s tracks helped create a feel that so far no replacement you&#39;ve provided has been able to accomplish. As an unbiased viewer/listener I think the removal of JC&#39;s music reduces the whole Vsauce experience, without that feel the channels content is reduced to just one small step ahead of most other science and discovery type channels, that being due to the way Michael draws an audience in veering all different directions from the first stated sentence therefore breaking the monotony other related channels fall victim to. Vsauce seriously needs to consider bringing Jake Chudnow back or possibly dropping background music completely until a more suitable replacement can be had. What I heard this episode was more of a distraction than smooth background fill.<br>Even if what I have said falls on deaf ears, I will still be watching, learning, filling the gray matter.<br>Thank you for your time.<br><br>Vsauce viewers: Please thumb this up, it deserves attention from the Vsauce powers that be, Michael, or whoever make decisions for the channel should see this post.
