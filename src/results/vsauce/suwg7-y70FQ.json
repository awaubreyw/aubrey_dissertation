Is it simply to have a good job, build a family, and enjoy life? Is that all there is? Certainly not. We\u2019re made for so much more. Your purpose is to know God. After we die, the Bible says we\u2019ll face God as our Judge. Have you ever rebelled (sinned) against God? Examine yourself by God\u2019s Law, the Ten Commandments. Have you ever told a lie? Ever stolen (the value is irrelevant)? Jesus said, \u201cWhoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.\u201d In God\u2019s courtroom, our sins are very serious crimes. They\u2019re so evil that the just punishment is death and eternity in a terrible place called Hell.<br><br>The Bible says that God takes no pleasure in the death of the wicked. He is rich in mercy and provided a Savior: \u201cGod so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.\u201d Jesus Christ died on the cross, paying the death penalty for sinners. He then rose from the dead three days later, defeating death. Hundreds saw Him after His resurrection; it\u2019s no fairy tale. Jesus fulfilled all the prophecies about the promised Savior, written in the Holy Scriptures hundreds of years before His birth.<br><br>Religious rites, sacred traditions, or attending church can\u2019t save you. Salvation is a free gift of God that you can\u2019t earn. To know God and have your sins forgiven, do what the Bible says: repent and believe. Trust in Jesus as you\u2019d trust in a parachute\u2014don\u2019t just \u201cbelieve\u201d it can save you, put it on and cling to it with all of your being. Wholeheartedly commit yourself to following Christ, and turn your back on sin. Then show your gratitude by obeying His command to be baptized. Be sure to also join a Christian church and read the Bible daily.

We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 &quot;But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.&quot;. God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus&#39;s sacrifice. John 14:6 states: &quot;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.&quot;. Romans 10:13 states &quot;For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;. \r<br>\r<br>   Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don&#39;t let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you&#39;re getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it&#39;s because Satan doesn&#39;t want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it&#39;s not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It&#39;s everlasting torture with no relief. I&#39;m only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.", "comment_date": "2021-06-16T03:01:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M.

I don&#39;t know how much time we left on this earth before Jesus comes, but I want all of us to be ready when He does. Let&#39;s leave these things of this world behind for in scripture it says in Matthew 24:35 that heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear. &quot; Also in 2 corinthians 4:18&quot; So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.&quot; Time is so short. And I always say this&quot; I want all of us to be saved. &quot; Jesus is coming back soon.&quot; with tears in my eyes I love you guys. Let&#39;s take Jesus and His words seriously in these time were in. I know the road isn&#39;t easy because there are so much distractions and temptations in this life. But through prayer and fasting we can overcome them. I&#39;m not\u00a0forcing anything on anybody or even forcing to do something they don&#39;t. But if you were to see your mother about to get hit by a big truck, you would do everything to try and save her and if you didn&#39;t, it show that you don&#39;t love her. So I do the same thing for us about the wrath of God that is to come. I don&#39;t want anyone I love, know/don&#39;t know or even those who hate or dislike me to face such things. Because I know every soul is precious to God and are valuable to Him. Because before we were born He knew us, He knitted us in our mother&#39;s womb, He called us to be His children . His love for us is so great and so strong, it&#39;s beyond human comprehension, that even the angels in heaven don&#39;t understand it. So I want to tell you it&#39;s time to get ready, time to prepare ourselves for the Second Coming of Christ, for the trails and tribulations and for the rapture. As you can see, so many people have turned away from God. The world has become so immoral, wicked, disgusting and violent. Killing people without any care or heart. And that shows that the love of God is growing cold in the hearts of people. Please be ready friends, for when the Son of Man comes. Time is running out. Let&#39;s not leave this world with regrets. Because I tell you this, my biggest regret is not knowing Jesus Christ earlier. I love you Guys and Jesus loves you too, that&#39;s why He didn&#39;t think twice about dying on the Cross for us, knowing that we may not even love Him back. Please take what was said today in consideration because ready or not Jesus Christ is coming back believe it or not Jesus is coming back. <br><br>How to be saved? To be saved, a man must confess that Jesus is Lord while acknowledging in his heart that Christ must have full rule over his life and that he died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected on the third day\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe. Also one must repent and turn away from thier sin. NOW, is the time to turn to JESUS, do it before its too LATE and the DOOR of Grace is Shut.<br><br>Prayer of Salvation in Jesus Christ\ud83d\ude4f<br><br>Dear Lord Jesus, I know that I am a sinner, and I ask for Your forgiveness. I believe You died for my sins and rose from the dead. I turn from my sins and invite You to come into my heart and life. I want to trust and follow You as my Lord and Savior. Amen<br><br>Spreading the Gospel on every content on YouTube \ud83d\ude4f\u2764\ufe0f.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T23:49:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdallah Essam", "comment_text": "Is it weird that i farted while watching this", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T23:48:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roman Hashon", "comment_text": "This is the one study that OSHA did that I could get behind....

When he tries to back out and choose another project, his teacher tells him that he needs to do the fart candy because he needs to carry on Benjamin Franklin&#39;s legacy or something. Then the kid makes it, wins the science fair, gets national news coverage, a big-time candy company hires him and starts selling his candy, and he becomes a millionaire. I forget what actually happens in the second book (yes, it was a series), but I remember it is revealed that in the time between the books he released a bunch of new flavors, everyone in the world started eating his candy so now everyone is more open about farting in public because it doesn&#39;t smell bad anymore, and he hired his former bully as a product tester.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T14:47:41Z", "likes_count": 518}, {"comment_by": "Alayna Loetzel", "comment_text": "The quack network concomitantly compete because ethiopia ideally depend astride a bustling show. diligent, level lynx", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T14:47:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The 10 of Diamonds Card", "comment_text": "The 1% is trouble in real life, too.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T14:47:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "flipflapflop", "comment_text": "gonna start stashing farts in jars so i can have a famous su\u00ee\u00e7\u012bd\u00e9", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T14:47:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Viking", "comment_text": "This what i needed today..", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T14:47:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Tommy Pickles", "comment_text": "Please don&#39;t spam the sub feed with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23shorts\">#shorts</a>, they&#39;re annoying to your longtime subscribers.", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T14:47:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gistas Banaitis", "comment_text": "Finally. we know the composition of Shrek&#39;s fart", "comment_date": "2021-06-14T14:47:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "StuRoRo", "comment_text": "THIS IS WHAT THE INTERNET WAS INVENTED FOR......
