I agree with the idea death = life is more valuable. Scarcity creates value that\u2019s a fundamental principle of reality.

We might need the next 1000 years to fully grasp that concept. \ud83d\ude02<br><br>But what I meant to get at, is A) I don\u2019t think we need immortality to feel effectively immortal, guarantee most people would act as such with just a 1k Yr lifespan, for a century or two anyway haha<br><br>And point B) to expand, I also agree life would gain value, or maybe meaning is a better word. Because after a short period of contemplation, maybe a few years of hedonism in the case of certain types of people, I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019d just end up (in \u201crelatively\u201d short order) getting ridiculously excited that instead of stressing TF out and overthinking way too much because life is short and I have to always question if there\u2019s not a better plan I could implement to achieve what I want and spend my short life doing what an imperfect, fallible, and by future standards monumentally stupid person like me has deteriorated to be the most meaningful path....<br><br>.... and throw it out the window, all the stress, anxiety, all the plans, because now I get to plan what would basically be TEN LIFETIMES!

We all take from those around us, specifically our caretakers&#39; food and shelter when we&#39;re children, all without our consent, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean we are taking from them. Yes, the food we consume to grow is the food they are not consuming to survive (under a finite food assumption) but they are willingly giving it to us. No human in history has willingly consented to being conceived, but when we are, we&#39;re comprised of material that would be elsewhere, and our consent keeps getting pushed back further and further as we grow older. For example, it&#39;s irresponsible to not feed a child under your care, regardless of their consent to accept food from you, because as a consequence, they would die. But say a 30 year-old that is equally unable to provide for themselves and relies on the generosity of others as a means of survival, doesn&#39;t want to die or starve if they do not consent to being provided for, although it&#39;s inextricably linked. It does however show the acknowledgement of displaced time and food from these caregivers, and empathetically saying &quot;don&#39;t waste your time on me.&quot; Even though from the perspective of the caregiver, &quot;They are worth it because they are here.&quot;<br><br>Michael isn&#39;t saying that because the atoms that he&#39;s made from came from somewhere, that they were taken, but rather that regardless of his consent, it was given. We feel the need to justify our existence many times under different circumstances, but in the context of death, it can be comforting to know that we were here, and that&#39;s justification enough. That our ability to make choices and how those choices affect others don&#39;t have to matter in order to know, that because we are going to die, we had to have lived, and because we lived, someone cared enough for us to.<br><br>This probably falls into a coping/denial cultural belief, but considering the line drawn between fact and unknowable, I think this belief is the most optimistic and conducive to positive behavior, taking into account all collective human knowledge.

Well, I&#39;ll tell you how long too long is: When all those that you know and love are all passed away. All of your immediate family, aunts, uncles, first cousins, and your friends. I am the very youngest of a really large family. My mother is the youngest of ten children and I am the youngest of her and my father&#39;s five children. So I am the bottom of the barrel. ALL but two of my MANY aunts and uncles have passed away. Autoimmune disease runs in my family so I have had many cousins suddenly die from those diseases. Also,  several of them have grown old and died of natural causes. So I only have a few left. So out of my huge family, there are very few left that are still alive and the loss of so many relatives has been VERY difficult.<br><br>Then, my wife suddenly died a few years ago and that was devastating. The feeling of aloneness starts to really bother you when it gets down to only a few relatives and friends being left in your life. At some point when they are all gone it will be almost unbearable. So, how long is too long to live? To the point of being all alone after everyone else has passed on because you outlived them. Just watch the show from the 90s called Highlander. It is so heartbreaking at times because the main character is immortal and travels throughout Scotland and Ireland, so sometimes he sees old castle ruins and he will remember living there with a wife and children. Then that memory will turn to the death of his wife and children when they grow old and die. He has been married and had children many times because of how long he has lived. It is a very good show and demonstrates how having incredible longevity is actually like a curse in some respects. Too long life is when we are left all alone to struggle with the emotional devastation of losing everyone dear to you.", "comment_date": "2022-03-11T22:07:48Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Hayden Mack", "comment_text": "Vsauce, fans. The wages of sin is death, God is very clear about that. BUT!!! The GIFT of God is ETERNAL LIFE through Jesus Christ. Romans 6:23. Look, death and sickness are around because of sin, and there definitely are consequences for our sins, but wow, every last one of us can be forgiven, and all of our unrighteousness can be cleansed. Do you realize that God wants everyone to come to a knowledge of truth? 1 Timothy 2:4  The gospel is so inclusive because through Jesus, any person, may come to God with confidence, I mean ANY. If you are guilty of sin, maybe you are watching porn, or sleeping around in adultery, or maybe you&#39;ve done something even worse...there is no person Jesus will send away. Anyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. He DIDN&#39;T say, unless you&#39;ve sinned, God will save you. That&#39;s not God, and how lucky we are!! Jesus modelled a perfect life without sin, until he was crucified and died as a perfect sacrifice for our sins. if you simply believe in him, you will not perish, but live through him. John 3:16<br><br>I understand Vsauce  made this video, and from his perspective we are going to die. And people die everyday, I get that.

She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she had a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I&#39;m a mature person. I wanted the best for her and I harbored no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seemed happy with her boyfriend, so I didn&#39;t bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it. I told her she&#39;ll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already since I first saw her. Besides, I am quite happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wanted to live some other life without me in it, so I said, &quot;Okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness.&quot; My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can&#39;t sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally couldn&#39;&#39;t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she&#39;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what&#39;s up.

Maybe not to you, but I think you&#39;ll learn your lesson after even 3 years. Otherwise I believe that if somebody is kept in prison for too long you&#39;re just torturing them at a certain point and they will either become more messed up in the head because of it and then they will be an even worse criminal when they get out, or they will become institutionalized and I&#39;ll become totally fine with living in prison and they&#39;ll want to stay there they won&#39;t know how to operate on the outside world, and they might even commit another crime just to get sentenced again", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T23:57:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u2022F O G\u2022", "comment_text": "Some day, I will die.

He wants you to be in heaven some day and not hell. It\u2019s not by being a good person that gets us to heaven. Because being a good person doesn\u2019t justify you enough to enter in,  because we have all sinned against a holy and righteous God that hates sin. So, its by putting your faith and trust in Jesus, and believing the gospel as truth unto repentance. The gospel is that Jesus the son of God, came as a man, being fully God and fully man, lived a sinless perfect life, and gave his life as a random for all of mankind by paying and taking on the punishment of our sins  by dying for our sins on the cross. And on that cross he bore the sins of all of mankind upon himself, caring a heavy burden that you and I couldn\u2019t bare. So, after his death, 3 days later, he victoriously rose form the dead. So, you must truly believe that and truly put your faith in him.  <br><br><br>Along with believing the gospel  comes repentance. Repentance means to have a change of mind, so you must have a change of mind concerning your current state of being, meaning, that you must turn from your sins and turn to God in faith. Having a  realization that you are a sinner, and are in need of a savior. Jesus came to save you. To save you from the path of destruction, which is the lifestyle of a sinner, which ultimately leads a person to hell. Sin leads to hell. The Bible says that the wages of sin is death, meaning, that the result or consequence of sin is death. When Adam sinned, death was brought into the world. And now all men must die. But\u2026. as the verse continues to read ,it says that the gift\ud83c\udf81 of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus-Romans 6:23. So, his gift towards you is eternal life\u2026. after death. Life truly begins after death. Life after death is eternal\u2026 so whatever place you end up in, you will be there for eternity, which is why this message is sooo very important. You eternity is at stake! Lastly, I will conclude with this famous Bible verse that you mighty or might have not heard of. Yet, it is the essential message of the gospel itself! <br><br><br>John 3:26- For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,( Die as a sinner and end up in hell) but have ever lasting life. <br><br><br><br>To summarize all of this up, the core message is that, Christ came to redeem, to recuse, to atone, and that by having faith in him, and his testimony, which is the gospel, and turning to him in repentance, you as a individual will be saved, and through Christ, you may have access to eternal life. <br><br>To redeem and to recuse  you from your own folly, which is your sinfulness, your sins,  which will lead you to eternal damnation, which is hell.<br>To atone, or in other words, pay for your sins by dying for them. Remember, not only did he die, but he was the Vessel, the container, the  bearer of mankind&#39;s sins. He carried a burden that no man could carry. <br>That through him by putting your faith and trust in him, and believing the gospel as truth, and turning to him in repentance, then you may have access to eternal life. It is a gift\ud83c\udf81 from God to a true believer. <br><br><br><br>Life is short guys, but eternity is long. You will never know when you will leave here. It can be today, tomorrow, or even years from now. Make your decision today while you still have breath in your lungs. <br><br>Whoever has gotten to the end of this I applaud you. Think about what I have wrote for what I have said is the truth. I love you, but God loves you more.  I hope you have a great rest of your day.

You can now already note plenty of elderly people who stopped personally growing, widening their horizons and evolving since their teens or twenties, although plenty still do grow wiser.  I think however that it is going to be the non evolving type of person who clings to life the strongest, and that will be salient among those who cease to age.  And furthermore, if aging is cured among all or most people, this will literally stall evolution itself, of the biological variety.  It won&#39;t fully stop, because people won&#39;t be invincible, nor infertile (but an immortal human race may mandate sterilization, possibly for all but the privileged families and clans) but the whole process of evolution in humans will slow to a molasses pace because individuals couldn&#39;t cope with finitude.", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T08:06:44Z", "likes_count": 901}, {"comment_by": "That Trucker Wes", "comment_text": "He talked to Ask A Mortician?!", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T07:20:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ugly Potato34", "comment_text": "&quot;Should I Die?&quot;<br><br>My thoughts towards myself: yes", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T07:19:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OK", "comment_text": "Yes", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T07:11:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L Lane", "comment_text": "Bro I got asked if this was a good video", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T06:35:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Goose", "comment_text": "Can you imagine a future when we can peer into other universes/timelines and get real variables in these kinds of tests by changing the situation for the exact same people to see how they would have reacted when affected by different factors", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T06:19:53Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Lithium 1", "comment_text": "No", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T06:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bullet Time", "comment_text": "Me: <b>casually searching for funny pokemon moments</b><br><br><br><br>YouTube: hey wanna watch Vsauce having an existential crisis?", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T05:34:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gilbert gaming7150", "comment_text": "uhhhhhhhhhhhhhh", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T05:13:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "juanpablo", "comment_text": "no.", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T05:12:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Suparno Sinha", "comment_text": "No Michael !!!

I&#39;m asked about one subject in particular and two questions pop up more than any others &quot;don&#39;t you have a problem around dead people?&quot; and &quot;doesn&#39;t it bother you to be near death?&quot;. Honestly you do get used to bodies (for example i&#39;m 36 and i&#39;ve been to thousands of visitation prior to the families arrival) it does help i&#39;m sure that i arrive after the mortician and coroner have done their work. However that visage of a gentleman or lady lying in that casket has matured my perception of death to the point that though I obviously don&#39;t want to die I also don&#39;t feel that I alone have a choice in the matter of the end of life. To me death is not only universal, it&#39;s necessary. I understand why I get flak for this position because it&#39;s not normal yet I feel that life being temporary spurs grow and a certain drive you simply wouldn&#39;t have with a lifespan of a 1000 years for example at the same time it will become apparent in the future that our natural lifespans will not be able to accommodate the amount of information needed to further studies of ever increasing complexity. So in conclusion, I believe it is necessary for humans to live longer if for no other reason than to accumulate more knowledge and to further our species progression but at the same time knowing there&#39;s an end to your story I feel drives that progression more than hampering it. Death is the end of 1 and the beginning of another so my only message to those out there reading this is, Don&#39;t fear death even mighty stars and born then eventually die if you look outward or inward all around you death gave way to life and vise versa, living would have no real purpose if you had nothing to achieve over a given time and knowing you have a limited window to achieve that task or goal in gives you that push to keep going if for nothing else than to be remembered by those actions. \u201cThe gods envy us. They envy us because we\u2019re mortal, because any moment may be our last. Everything is more beautiful because we\u2019re doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now.

The truth is simple. Death is the opposite of life. While alive you are a living being - to use a Bible word you are a soul. The use of that word (soul) is unfortunate because so often people will add \u201cimmortal\u201d. But the word in scripture never implies immortal. It is correctly translated as \u201cbeing\u201d. Check Strongs Concordance for proof. So man was created a living being (soul) and is subject to death. The soul (being) that sinneth it shall die. - ezek <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRxI0DaQrag&amp;t=18m20s\">18:20</a>. In that verse it refers to what is the second death and not dying here and now. Remember the word resurrection? After dying there is a resurrection from the dead. If we had an immortal soul floating around playing a harp we would sure hate being resurrected as a human soul (being) again. I know I would hate that anyhow. <br><br>So now if ever someone tells you you have an immortal soul you ask where that soul is?

One conversation we have had recently is how sad they feel that all the people they have known their age or older are all pretty much dead. They mention that it is hard to find anyone in our small town who can relate to their experiences from 50 plus years ago. They explain basically that they can tell me about all kinds of things about my town from the 1940s and 1950s. I may seem very interested, but considering I was born in the 1970s I will never be able to experience the same emotional connections to various places or events on the same level as them because I was not alive to experience it like they did.  If these patients can managed to be brought back to life would they still have their memories of their previous lives in the 20th and 21st centuries? What would the emotional effects be on someone who wakes up to realize they are alive again and it is the 22nd or 23rd centuries? It would be a very lonely world, a world which they will not understand. If they do find family they would most likely be complete strangers to them.  They could be family born 6 or more generations after they passed. How different will the place they once lived be in the future. There would be that huge gap of time for the first patients. I think the first patients would be far more emotionally depressed compared to the future patients who will only need to be frozen for a very short period of time before rebirth.

How did you get here? Why are you conscious of your own existence? What is the meaning of it all? Well, logically speaking, you exist, meaning the atoms in your brain which had existed in the earth once before are inside of you. Your existence began when you were born, but the atoms that form you have been here since the universe had begun. After you die, (if we are to believe what is currently scientifically known), your consciousness and yourself cease to exist. Your body and all that remains are taken by the earth. Consumed by organisms, becoming part of the earth. But you had been born before, from seemingly nothing, trapped inside this flesh cage, controlling your own body, aware of your own existence. You were born. So, what does that mean for you after you die? In truth, nobody can know for certain unless they were to die themselves, and if that were the case, they wouldn\u2019t be here telling you about it. But since you have come from another organism, and you are in your body right now, it might not be wrong to think that you may live again in another form. The atoms and molecules that make up your body will be eaten by the worms and absorbed by the plants. Your body will be used by nature. Your brain will be consumed as well. You will be apart of life flourishing, and this life will use some of those molecules and atoms to reproduce. Will you be apart of those new organisms? Likely, yes. And those organisms will be eaten by other organisms and they will move down the chain. Eventually, perhaps reaching one with consciousness. Awareness of existence. Will that mean you will eventually control and inhabit another body? Maybe. Consciousness is still a very abstract concept, and all that science can really say at this point is that it is the result of the electrical signals in your brain. But science cannot currently explain why we are here. Why you are conscious, why I am conscious. Or where consciousness even comes from. If two people reproduce and produce two clones, and those clones are in the exact same life situations, will those clones make the same choices? Will they be the same people? And if they are the same people, what does that mean? That someone\u2019s personhood is really controlled by the environment around them, by their experiences? Doesn\u2019t that mean that we must all technically have the same roots? Perhaps. It\u2019s difficult for me to comprehend why I exist. I don\u2019t want to believe anything, I want proof. And the fact that it is impossible to figure out where my consciousness came from and why I am here upsets me. I want reincarnation to be real. I want to, once I die, have no perception of time and thus when I end up in another body, to exist again in this world with a fresh new experience. I want that to be the case. Because logically it would make sense and it would explain why I am here. But if that isn\u2019t the case, what is life even for? Why the hell does existence even exist? It\u2019s a giant paradoxical problem, and the more I think about it, the more anxious I get about my future death. I don\u2019t ever want to lose the people I love, but I know it is inevitable one day. Permanency is a comforting thought, but it isn\u2019t reality. But, here is a thought. We all came from an organism before us. And that organism came from one before that. And if we keep going down the line, eventually we start going further into the past. Eventually to when life started. And if that\u2019s the case, if life started from one random organism created through random changes in the universe, an organism that could reproduce, then we all come from the same roots. We all come from that organism. Could we say that we are all the same? I honestly don\u2019t know. I feel, to answer what happens after one dies, we first need to find out what happens when one is born. How does their consciousness come to be? What causes them to be aware of their own existence and control their actions? And of course, someone could simply just say \u201cit\u2019s the brainwaves that do it\u201d. But that\u2019s not a good enough explanation. Because you are here, controlling your body. And, electrical signals simply being the culprit would indicate that the brain has no free will, that it\u2019s the result of a control center that is conditioned to behave in such a way to survive. And if that were the case, why would I feel like I can control what I do? Why can I freely choose to jump off a bridge as I please?", "comment_date": "2021-02-28T02:03:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pirran Jay", "comment_text": "are we not going to talk about how v sauce just casually has a COFFIN", "comment_date": "2021-02-27T22:29:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "benqq", "comment_text": "No , should I?", "comment_date": "2021-02-27T22:03:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ugmagir", "comment_text": "yes", "comment_date": "2021-02-27T21:46:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "greg eads", "comment_text": "Why is chloe Kardashian pretending to be a mortician?

In 80 years I might decide to be cryonically preserved) but Alcor&#39;s facility just seems like a facility filled with a superiority complex and an ego that their presence and 2000 century wisdom will be needed/wanted in a future filled with a completely different genre of humans.", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T03:20:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NJC", "comment_text": "The constant knowing that time\u2019s running out makes me feel like there\u2019s not enough time for everything", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T02:21:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NJC", "comment_text": "Tbh I really wanna live either forever or for a very long time just so I have more time to do as much as possible since right now there\u2019s not much I can do", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T02:20:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Modasar Shaffiq", "comment_text": "Hmmm \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T00:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Laverde", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve decided to die&quot;<br><br>So you have chosen... death", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T23:49:20Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "nanas moralin", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t believe I just watched Michael have an existential crisis for entertainment", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T23:34:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KingCrashPlays", "comment_text": "Here is my theory with the idea of tampering with life.  I won\u2019t bring God into the equation because honestly you don\u2019t need God for the theory I have come up with.  In fact, I wouldn\u2019t even call it a theory, but more like common sense.  There is a rate at which we learn and gain wisdom and maturity as a human being.  Some peoples\u2019 rates are faster or slower than others of course, but there is an average rate.  I believe that rate is connected to our lifespan.  If we looked back to when the average life span of a human being was around 40 or so years, people mentally developed faster.  Humans at the age of 16 and 18 were already married and raising a family as well as dealing with issues that adults dealt with. If we look now, it\u2019s not uncommon for someone to be 20 and still live with their parents.  Families aren\u2019t made until the late 20s to even early 40s.  Now to reach to the same level of maturity and have the same level wisdom as the people from the far past you must be around 60-70 years of age.  The guy in the video mentioned the world would be better off because people would gain wisdom and maturity infinitely.  But honestly I think the rate of how fast you gain maturity and wisdom would just flatten out and would take longer to reach that same level of maturity.  So not only will you have more \u201cadult children\u201d in the world, overpopulation would also become an even greater problem.  Death is our mental catalyst that determines how fast we mentally develop.", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T14:45:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rizaldy", "comment_text": "Towa Maji Tenshi (TMT)", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T07:05:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DNTME", "comment_text": "None of this is meaningful since we still have no real alternative to death.

Think about it, you as a person, before you are born, you have no meaning because you are not YOU, you are nothing, being born and alive is what gives meaning, and death brings you back to being not YOU anymore. Life is what gives meaning, and death takes it away. the universe(death) doesn&#39;t care about the labels and meanings you assign things with, the universe gives no meaning or do anything to keep it, it is you who gives the meanings and the universe is what takes you away.

Since then i am unable to stop thinking about death. Not that i would limit my behaviour fearing death as an outcome but i did limit my life expectancy by a lot. I went into a state of nihilism. Life is worthless, life is short and everything you will do in your life will end in the same way: dying. This thought process never left me and positive thinking like you should live life to its fullest because you only have one just doesnt cut it for me. Sure i will enjoy life but i will not think it matters to any extent. Ill be dead in the end anyway and all the love and achievements i gain will be lost in a flash. When i got older at like 20 i started getting more more interested into astronomy. Space and the vastness of it. At first this put my nihilism in overdrive making myself feel less and less significant. The thought of how small we are smaller then we see ants compared to the vastness of space and planets/stars just destroys your ego. Later in an older age i started thinking about it differently i started to feel part of an extremely complex world, a world my brain cant even comprehend. The universe feels like an incredible work of art an infinite possibilities of beauty and destruction and we are part of it. But this bring me to my current state of mind. A world &quot;the universe&quot; All created by pure chance. We do not know exactly what started the official &quot;start, big bang&quot; or the universe but we do know everything that followed is pure chance. There is a chance a planet is made, a chance a star is lit, a chance a planet orbits a sun at the right distance, a chance for water to be on this planet, a chance for bacteria to evolve and ultimately for natural selection and biological evolution to take place for such a long time of trail and error pure by chance and survival rates for a more advanced animal. Slowly created by pure genetic mistakes that happen to have a possitive outcome.  It is all pure roll of the dice the entire universe is a roll of the dice. This got my back into a nihilistic way of thinking feeling like anything just exists by chance. it has zero meaning what so ever. There is no reason we are alive its just because it got the chance to.  There is no reason to being alive it was a roll of the dice and what we make of our lives and call it a reason to live is made by our own consciousness we all tell our selves a different story that we ourself claim to be the right path and the way it should be. But its all fabricated in our brain, Its an illusion. The only thing that could be considered a reason to live is reproduction. But with over-population coming our way that is quickly dismissed as well. I am unable to lie to myself and call my self important the only thing that is important to me is that the universe will give chance to anything that can become and will become, everything to live once and die once like a star.", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T08:06:27Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "RJ", "comment_text": "Immortality will come.

I wish everybody gets the chance to live for several hundred years. but having a predisposition of what you believe death is, is what really matters in this video. Michael doesn&#39;t seem like he believes in a higher power nor an afterlife, (which I don&#39;t hate or fault him for) but if he did he likely would have been way more carefree and optimistic about death. because in my eyes, I see two main opinions on death: 1. once you die that&#39;s it, and you turn into dust and no longer exist, and its all over, game over. and 2. death is just a transition between the physical plane and the spiritual plane, akin to like a nether portal in Minecraft..... and me personally, I believe in the latter.

Keeping us at the peak of our genetic design.<br>Only then would the length of life time become a problem for those who have trouble with loss.<br>If I could live forever but everyone else didn\u2019t want too. Then I would loss every one. Many suggest this would be a big issue.<br>I say no, it\u2019s not. At least not for me since knowing death would be a choice. If every one chose to die, well... that would be their choice. Plus, who am I to tell them what to choose? From a young age we lose friends, though not to death but to simply moving away and what not. Today, when a person dies of \u201cnatural\u201d causes we learn to accept and move on in life keeping the dead in our memories.<br>So acceptance and freedom of choice to accept such loss makes this easy for me. If you want to die, that\u2019s your choice and I will accept what to choose to do with yourself in your life. I\u2019ll live on happily knowing that time is nothing but our own creation and, without aging, can continue to enjoy the life I live.<br>That brings us to our reality, though...<br>We can\u2019t by choose live without dying, yet.<br>So as we get old and wither within a crusty shell that hurts more with the passing of days would I still want to live?<br>Hell, yes I would.

But I think the fundamental flaw with it is the assumption people don&#39;t want to die. What if someone wants to die, but continues to live because of various reasons pushed upon them by outside forces such as family or society? And it failed to answer why we should choose to continue living. To want to be alive while also accepting we will die some day is to fear death, avoid death and to continue living. You can still fear and avoid death while also accepting that it will happen eventually, but are you truly accepting it, or disregarding what you cannot control and in essence it&#39;s a fancy way of denying it.<br><br>The fact you will die does not give your actions meaning, the intent and results of your actions gives them meaning. If someone dies saving another life, we deem that action good. If someone takes their own life to end someone else&#39;s we deem that as a bad action. If your reason for living is to do good, then you should want to live for as long as possible. If you reach a state of being where you are no longer able to do whatever your reasons for living are, you loose your reasons to choose life and you want to die. This may explain why elderly people sometimes want to die, it probably also explains why David Attenborough has not retired yet.<br><br>The massive issue at its core is the reason for living or dying is unique to each and every individual person. So the most horrible thing about the question &quot;should I die&quot; is that can only be answered by you AND the question itself can only be constructed by you, it&#39;s a philosophical loop you both open and close. In my opinion there is a number of reasons for each person to be alive, each reason is crafted and cared for by the individual alone. There are also reasons to die, depending on the person these reasons to die increase or decrease. As long as your reasons to live out weigh (not out number) your reasons for death you will choose to continue living.<br><br>I personally see no reason to die, I don&#39;t believe in an after life and I know the world and universe will keep going once I am gone. I also don&#39;t see many reasons for living, there&#39;s no purpose in personal gain as it will mean nothing when I die, and why help others because it wont mean anything when they die and of course we&#39;re all going to die eventually and at any time. This also means my bar for wanting to stay alive is very low, doing good and having fun is enough for me to choose to keep living. Sadly for some people, they live with too much pain and have had too many reasons stripped away from them to choose life.<br><br>At the end of the day there is no reason to live or die. Everything that we value or what gives us purpose is a construct of our personality shaped by our genetics and experiences. Morty says it best &quot;life has no meaning, we&#39;re all going to die, come watch some tv&quot;.

We know it&#39;s wrong. We know how painful it is, and how it can make us anxious. We know how much we can delude ourselves to sooth our minds. Why not face it ? Death is not an absolute of nature, of life, some animals don&#39;t die (some simple animals, look it up) cancerous cells can be immortal, most plants can be crafted and start anew. <br><br>We and all other living beings are the way we are now because of evolution. Natural selection is one of the best tools to understand why we are how we are. There is an upside to living longer, or living longer healthy, as it allows more time to reproduce. However the longer the being lives, the more likely it is to die in the current year, let&#39;s say.<br>Another factor that prevents natural selection from selecting people with a longer life-span is the average at which they reproduce.<br>If there&#39;s people that reproduce early and will go on to live very short lives, that mutation is just as likely to be part of the gene pool than other mutations that improves life conditions for the elderly. <br><br>Basically, living a longer life is not a strong evolutionary advantage, and thus hasn&#39;t been selected for that much. I say this but perhaps the few centuries some animals can live is already a tremendous success of evolution ... depends on how you want to look at it. <br><br><br>Anyways, we don&#39;t have to be constrained by evolution.

People who do have it and people who have severe chronic pain, or both (like myself) often just want an end to all experience. Because their lives are filled with so much suffering that experiencing things becomes not worth it. And in rare periods of improvement, even those periods are darkened by the thought that they too will quickly end, and more suffering will ensue. We want a cure, or at least an ongoing treatment that works, but the truth is - both healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry have largely given up on us. We don&#39;t think that there will be a cure or even an effective treatment within our lifetime, it&#39;s probably unrealistic to believe this, - a fool&#39;s hope. But society and families will not let us go. It&#39;s fine when it&#39;s our bodies that kill us (cancer, stroke, etc.) but somehow not OK when it&#39;s our brains that kill us? Because this is what suicide is - it&#39;s wrong to think that there really is some kind of choice when it comes to this. Our brains are predisposed to gamble with death until one day we pop too many pills, take our food and water fasting 2-3 days too far and so on. Depression kills, chronic pain kills. Society won&#39;t acknowledge it. Our families are more unhappy watching us suffer when we are alive. If we were to die: it would be a terrible loss for them, but eventually it will get better. But while we are alive: it won&#39;t get better, - it&#39;s a perpetuated cycle of suffering. There should be an option of euthanasia for Treatment Resistant Depression the same way there is one for terminal illnesses of the body. We should be free to liberate ourselves, our families, our friends, our loved ones from suffering our unhappy brains put them through. And in this respect: cryogenic facilities make sense, because it&#39;s entirely possible that one day MDD will be a thing of the past and chronic pain will be successfully treated, so we could once again be revived but this time : enjoy the rest of our days.", "comment_date": "2020-05-04T07:58:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chevy", "comment_text": "A women sunbathing nude <br>blonde lady:7 years<br>A person writing profanities on abraham lincoin :<br>Blonde lady:1 year", "comment_date": "2020-05-04T03:54:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Harry Potter Fan", "comment_text": "I got this by searching \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0447\u044c \u043c\u043d\u0435 Im \u0443\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0435\u0442", "comment_date": "2020-05-04T03:17:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zSwift", "comment_text": "No", "comment_date": "2020-05-04T01:09:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Marzano", "comment_text": "I love how seriously those psychologists take their job.

You have been created and you might create a human being yourself, they will not replace you but use the space you occupied to make their own life and we need to give them that opportinity. If people lived forever or for a really long time the older you were the better but the younger ones will never be better even if they are 200 years old because the rest will have existed longer, they will not have the chanves they deserved.

And here&#39;s my reasoning; You don&#39;t know me, but if there&#39;s a god and a heaven or hell, I would rather go to hell. Not because I am an edgy teen with a demon complex, but because eternity in heaven would bore me. Sure, the first few years would be cool. Unlimited food, drinks, games, whatever there is that makes heaven so great. But after a long time, food would taste stale, games would have been played over and over. &quot;what if heaven discovers new things, though?&quot; At some point, everything will be discovered. Nothing will be satisfying enough, and the torture of knowing you&#39;ll exist, forever, in a place you can&#39;t get out of would be a nightmare. Heaven, would be my own personal hell. &quot;So why hell?&quot; Because if the hell-heaven theory is true, I would rather be punished and be in pain for eternity, than be bored for eternity. And if we would live on forever, eventually our sun, will burst. And we&#39;d all suffer incredible pain, to then finally die and be introduced to a whole new world of things that have already be discovered. Another reason why we should die, is because of overpopulation. Overpopulation is, in fact, NOT being caused by the many births of children all over the world, but because people are getting much and much older. When I have to get a job, I will be taking care of 6 elders&#39; pensions, instead of what the average adult cares for now; 2. (In The Netherlands.) Why is that? Because people are getting old, and there&#39;s less and less children being born. We, who are not so big in numbers anymore, will have to take care of our elders, who are with many. So yes, we should die. And one more reason. In order for new flowers to grow, you must get rid of weeds. Which basically means, in order for us, Millennials and Gen Z to develop, spread our wings and fix the world our dear beloved ancestors left so destroyed, we must get rid of their old ways. And habits die hard, but the old ways like: &#39;same sex marriage only&#39; &#39;no people of color&#39; or well, &#39;do anything out of the norm of society.&#39; we all know that our society is changing, due to us, the younger generations, creating our own. This does not mean that all older generations are a bunch of shitbags, it means that what was once normal for them, is not normal anymore. And that&#39;s due to us changing it, together. But the fact that people are becoming much much older makes it harder for these traditions to die, because there&#39;s still a part of the population judging us for being abnormal to their standards. It sounds harsh, and it is, but in order for us to grow, the elder should eventually die out. TL;DR: Living too long or forever would get boring because eventually nothing new would be discovered, Overpopulation is being caused by people growing much older, and for our newest generations to grow, we need the old ones to die out.", "comment_date": "2020-02-24T19:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashenn Hayden", "comment_text": "But doesnt skin gradually get fluffy and old?", "comment_date": "2020-02-24T17:52:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcus Williams", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRxI0DaQrag&amp;t=28m04s\">28:04</a><br><br>&quot;You sure could.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Roll for initiative.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-02-24T16:04:21Z", "likes_count": 187}, {"comment_by": "mas reklaw", "comment_text": "Yes", "comment_date": "2020-02-24T13:17:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chloe Jaye", "comment_text": "Ok, but I have a some questions.<br><br><br>if you were cryogenically frozen, what would happen in terms of beliefs on heaven and hell or reincarnation?<br><br><br>For example, would being cryogenically frozen delay you going to heaven or hell?<br>(not that that is what I believe but say it does end up being real).<br><br><br>Or take reincarnation and things such as your soul/spirit. <br><br><br>would your soul/spirit still leave your body once you die?<br><br><br>And if that does happen what would happen once you were brought back?

If in let&#39;s say... 50 years, the first of these Alcor patients get revived - and let&#39;s assume our consciousness is an essence leaving our body in the moment we die - what will happen to that first person being revived? This moment would answer a fundamental question about what consciousness is and if it&#39;s being created by our brain itself or not. Because if our consciousness is an essence, getting reincarnated into another living being after our death - then according to this belief all these patients who&#39;d get revived would be without a consciousness - because their consciousness already lives on in another body.

Who would want that done to their body? And what if a future tyrannical government restores you to life, just to do horrific, torturous medical experiments on you?

Once you&#39;ve had kids and they&#39;ve survived to adulthood, there&#39;s no real reason to keep living.<br><br>Furthermore, every death has a specific medical cause, not just &quot;old age&quot;. Heart failure, lung failure, those are the specific events that end a person&#39;s life. So for each person cryopreserved, their specific cause of death would need fixing. I.e. a person who died of heart failure would probably need a heart transplant, or at least something to give them a functional heart again.<br><br>And here&#39;s another thing: people trying to live indefinitely could definitely cause conflicts, because it creates more competition for resources like food, space, housing, which are needed to live. Furthermore, if an old person, cryogenically preserved, is restored, and their heart is replaced let&#39;s say (since, let&#39;s say, heart failure was the cause of their death) - they will still be an old and frail person in the rest of their body. So they will not be productive. And therefore society will have to support them with elderly care. And will future working-age humans put up with this? It&#39;s not unreasonable to imagine they might ban people trying to cryogenically preserve themselves and restore themselves, because it might put too much strain on society&#39;s resources.<br><br>Unless the revived person gets some sort of robot body, but then who&#39;s paying for the robot? If they&#39;re rich enough that their estate can pay for it, then fine. But otherwise, I don&#39;t think the working-age population will want to fund robot bodies for revived people.

My Great Grandfather also died this year and throughout his life he helped his community in New Hampshire frequently, donating to local charities and volunteering at soup kitchens.

I want the tree to be a Maple both to represent my Canadian ancestry and because Maple trees symbolize Intelligence, Generosity, balance, and serenity, all ideas or states of being I strive for. I want this because I\u2019ve lived most of my life near the Sequoia National Park, nature has always been apart of my life and my appreciation for it is deep and spiritual to me and I feel it is only right that I give back to the earth that\u2019s given so much to me upon my death.<br><br>Our lives are borrowed, sooner or later we have to pay back our debt.

Life expectancy has gone up decades. Why would this arbitrary lifespan people happen to get to now be the &#39;natural death we should accept&#39;? Everyone will die at some point, it&#39;s simply inevitable, if only for the fact that entropy exists. But the 90ish years we have now has no right to be our final max age. Reversing aging is more than likely possible. Imagine not only having far more time on your hands, but also having your youth for all that time. Not having grown tired and weary after 50 years of work, but still feeling like you did when you were 20. You&#39;re just given so much more time to enjoy the things you like in life. Read that other book you just hadn&#39;t gotten to yet. Finally pick up on that hobby that always interested you, but you never found time for yet Sure, with more time on your hands, you will procrastinate more too, but does that really matter? We already do that anyway. It&#39;s not like you&#39;ll be actually immortal, you can still die in an accident, or anything like that. Even if you upload your mind if that becomes possible. Your file can get corrupted, deleted, damaged. Even with all the backups and fail safes, though you may grow to be eons old, at some point it will fail, and you will die. ..but you sure had a far longer and more meaningful run than any of us could have. <br><br>Regarding overpopulating, that is an issue in today&#39;s world for sure. If no-one dies anymore (other than from murder/accidents), yet people keep making babies like they do now, the earth would get overrun. That&#39;s why it&#39;s also important to keep investing in other areas of technology. Creating artificial habitats such as Oneil cylinders to house everyone in should fix that problem. Besides, if you&#39;re able to grow to ages of 100s of years as biological being, it might very well become normal to not have kids till you&#39;re for example a 100.

Frankly the question of, &quot;Should I Die?&quot; Has literally always been a no-brainer to me. No, and thinking anything to the contrary is insane to me. Yet here I am watching this video because I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. Gotta love how the brain fixates on what it perceives as a threat. I actually get pissed off when I hear people who say that, trying to live forever is bad, that death gives meaning and that it&#39;s bad that people like me think dying is bad. My daily existential dread isn&#39;t granting me increased drive in my life, I&#39;m literally clinically depressed and don&#39;t get much of anything done because of it. As for whether immortality is &quot;sensible&quot;... if you mean feasible and a thing we should do? I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s doable, I don&#39;t know if there is or is not a way to avoid random chance that will doom us. I do think that opposing technology to end death, working against what people like me are desperately hoping for, is kind of shitty. You want to die, you do that, but please don&#39;t be the one that protests when the immortality technology starts getting developed. Anyone who does that is killing others in a roundabout way.<br><br>As for cryo-preservation... These people aren&#39;t being fed nutrients. So basically, the neural structure of their brains might be preserved, their flesh is still there, but there is no brain activity. They are, in fact, brain dead? Because if so, that&#39;s not immortality as far as I&#39;m concerned. That&#39;s a bit of an issue of philosophy, I understand, but I&#39;m still not seeing any current preservation technology.<br><br>As for &quot;Eventually, something&#39;s going to get you.&quot; Well... maybe? Maybe I&#39;m delusional, maybe I&#39;m just being hopeful because I&#39;m so freaked out that it&#39;s literally manifested into mental illness. But, couldn&#39;t you say the same thing about smallpox eventually getting you? If you make it through humanity&#39;s advancement, ideally, we eventually get enough control and knowledge to start eliminating random factors that cause deaths. We start modifying human minds to progress faster, or even develop AI (and don&#39;t fuck that up), we can advance exponentially, very rapidly. We eventually get control of enough that even gamma ray bursts are things we&#39;ll defend against. Heat Death? I don&#39;t know what to do about that. But ideally, if we can control for everything else, maybe there&#39;s something we can do about that. A chance is better than what we have right now.

We all know we will die some day, but if you didn&#39;t suddenly being confronted with destruction you could not come back from becomes darker. Faith in a afterlife will fade over time and the coping mechanisms we have adapted as a society will disappear. Its so hard to loose a child because you subconsciously know you will die before them and when it doesn&#39;t work that way it hits you hard. Now imagine a world where you never thought you would loose anybody, its not in movies, books, or in life anymore but a house fire takes one of your friends.

If I believe that I have had a good turn on this rock and would like to share it by making room for future people, then I should probably hang up my existential coat and die when my time has come. If I believe that I just haven&#39;t had enough time, or I feel like I could truly flesh out my curiosities only if I had a life extension, then by all means I should put all my chips on genetic modification, or robotics, or skynet, or ALCOR.<br><br><br>Either way, the problem I see left and right are miserable bastards just begging to stop the ride as soon as possible, or lunatic doc-brown types desperately trying to cling onto any shred of being for as long as possible, no matter the cost, no matter the consequences. It would seem then that living and then dying should not be seen as a curse (antinatalists and immortalists funnily enough agree that it is), but to rather view it as something like a <i>carousel</i> . It is a ride worth trying out at least once, but you should not be coerced to get off soon or stay on indefinitely; to do so undermines the joy of the ride itself. The <i>meaning</i> , if you will, of the ride is not given based on borrowed time (i.e. you have to get off at some point so you better enjoy it quick, because once you&#39;re off, you&#39;re off) nor in how long you can keep it running (i.e. you have been given an amazing opportunity, for the love of god don&#39;t you dare stop, because once you&#39;re off, you&#39;re off).<br><br><br>Just the concept of being comfortable with leaving the ride at all should, in my opinion, be wholly embraced. As conscious beings, we&#39;ve been granted a surprisingly unique position in the universe as we know it, and maybe we&#39;re more scarce than we think. Most things that exist don&#39;t even get a chance to ride the carousel in the first place, even other living things; even other people.<br><br><br>The carousel of life is not ? <i>meaninged</i> ? by either it&#39;s total sanctity nor it&#39;s total futility. The ride is neither a mistake nor something to desperately cling on to forever. Do not be terrified of stepping off the ride, and do not try and jump off as soon as you can; be amazed at it&#39;s outstanding wonder, yet be happy to say goodbye at a moment&#39;s notice. Embrace the ride&#39;s utter impermanence and absurdity, yet also embrace how cool it is to even get to ride it at all. Take it in stride, but don&#39;t ignore why you&#39;re on it, or that you&#39;ll get off it. One of the greatest powers you have is that is that you can decide fully, on your own terms, when you are ready to leave the ride. The goal of a species of intelligent beings should be to make sure that the ride offers no persuasion to either staying on as long as possible, nor getting off as soon as possible.<br><br><br>We are an endurant species, and are surprisingly good at figuring out why what we do is worth it. If you take anything from this, it should be that you came from this world due to forces out of your control, be it your parents, God, evolution, the big bang, whatever; and you will most likely leave due to other forces out of your control, be it disease, aging, war, entropy, heat death, whatever. However, if we combine our collective undeserved, temporary brain power, we might be able to put the ball back in our court, where conscious life can seize the control panel of the carousel; where we can stop the time limit, and set our own. A ride where we don&#39;t have to ensure another rider takes our place due to time constraints (procreation) nor be forced to step off (preventable death). A life where we can relax, be grateful that we are here, knowing that we are here because our parents and ancestors weren&#39;t required to make us, but did so purely to introduce us to what the believed was a worthwhile experience; and a life where we die not because we are forced, but because we determine when we&#39;d like to go.<br><br><br>I think it should be our next human goal to alleviate as best as we can our desperate factors that drive us to put aside our own conscious experience of life, like endless reproduction and unsatisfactorily short lives. We don&#39;t need to be immortal, just have enough time to not worry so hard about the end; to have enough time to make correct decisions, and to allow human kind to achieve peace with itself, where we do not curse our ancestors for bringing us into being without consent, nor de we dread our future for taking us out without our consent.<br><br><br>We have the power to turn affliction into opportunity, and there&#39;s no reason to think any idea is too far-fetched, we&#39;ve been turning impossibilities possible for a couple thousand years now ;)<br><br><br><br><br>Sorry for the word vomit lol, hope I helped you out though.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>tldr:<br>Death is best approached when we lighten its grip enough so that we have time to make sense of it and then choose our way out before it takes us. You don&#39;t need to stay alive for eternity for your life to be worthwhile, nor should you cut to the chase and end it early because of fear for the future, nor wish that you never even existed in the first place.

A person eventually gains experience, enriches himself intellectually, becomes wiser, and this means he is getting better. The longer we live, the better the society as a whole becomes. 2. A person does not have enough 70 years of life to realize himself creatively in many forms in which he would like. Eternal life gives him this opportunity. 3. Not everyone succeeds in seeing their offspring two generations in advance. But what if you live so long that you can pass on your experience to your great-great-great-great-grandchildren? 4. Centenarians - carriers of real history. Think about how historical science would develop if we had witnesses to the history that happened 200, 300, 400 years ago? There are other reasons to live forever. The apology of death is self-deception and an excuse from powerlessness to oppose something to it. Death is a form of universal violence, an absolute evil.

Bc yes cryo pts ARE declared \u201cdead\u201d before the process begins....HOWEVER the place you on LIFE SUPPORT UNTIL they get to the point of replacing your blood with their special fluid. But EVEN THEN your heart &amp; lungs are being operated mechanically &amp; YOU MAY STILL be \u201cin there\u201d. But once ALL BODILY FUNCTIONS ARE SUSPENDED...is what us \u201cUS\u201d still in there? Or had our  Consciousness or soul...depending on your beliefs...winked out or passed on to whatever is next? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 That question will ONLY BE ANSWERED once the first person is successfully BROUGHT BACK! Personally I think it will have to be someone FULLY ALLIVE who ELECTS TO TEST IF the process ACTUALLY WORKS. \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33 I don\u2019t think they will necessarily be 100% healthy we this occurs. So maybe someone with a severely degenerative illness such as MS or ALS will volunteer to go into the process while VERY MUCH still able to be functional &amp; alive. Only to be brought back days, months or even a year later..SOLELY to test if such a thing IS POSSIBLE. I am 100% CERTAIN that ONE DAY SOON...I\u2019d say in the next 15-20yrs they WILL HAVE the knowledge &amp; capabilities to bring cryo preserves human bodies (either by current cryo methods or an altered version) BACK to a point of ALL the vital systems WORKING WITHOUT mechanic medical assistance. I believe THAT WILL HAPPEN! But the tricky question is...will what is stored in the brain BE PRESERVED AS WELL?? Or will it be a COMPLETELY BLANK SLATE that emerges? THAT will be the determining factor of if cryo preservation works &amp; IF IT DOES I feel it will become mainstream INCREDIBLY FAST!! However...I HIGHLY DOUBT MOST of those who have ALREADY been frozen...especially those frozen MUCH EARLIER..will be able to be revived. As far as those preserving SOLELY their heads...I believe we are a LOT FURTHER AWAY from being able to \u201crevive\u201d them. Now I DO BELIEVE that we\u2019re CLOSE to being able to DOWNLOAD &amp; STORE our brains. Which I believe WILL BE A NECESSARY STEP in a SUCCESSFUL cryo reanimation. As I\u2019m doubtful of our memories being preserved by cryo. Just my opinion\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2019-06-05T11:45:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rogue Wolf", "comment_text": "<b>*WARNING: VERY LONG IN-DEPTH COMMENT/DISCUSSION*</b><br>I Haven\u2019t watched the full episode...HOWEVER...I found it VERY INTERESTING that the older white haired lady in the FIRST control group gave ONES to the crimes of fake dr when the child FULLY RECOVERED &amp; vandalizing the Lincoln Memorial...2 things which ended in NO LASTING damage. EXCEPT for the EMOTIONAL SCARRING of the child &amp; their parent(s). YET gave the HIGHEST PUNISHMENT of 7 for a woman simply sunbathing in the NUDE on a playground witnessed by a child and parent!!\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 In that case the ONLY POSSIBLE long terms repercussions would be the emotional/moral trauma of the parent &amp; view of the human body BY the child. Which ACTUALLY would be influenced MORE by the PARENT\u2019S REACTION than the nude body ITSELF! (depending on age of the child of course)  \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28 It\u2019s VERY INTERESTING that the participants\u2019 view of public nudity was SO MUCH WORSE/NEGATIVELY STRONGER than the PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY HARMING act of a FAKE dr BOTCHING a surgery ON A CHILD! I feel like MOST people would find that SURGICALLY HARMING a child would be FAR WORSE than a VERY BRIEF exposure to a naked wanna SIMPLY SUNBATHING! Versus say a man/woman exposing themselves to a child SEXUALLY. Which would be typically viewed as worse. But JUST sunbathing is a VERY PASSIVE exposure &amp; based on the age of the child &amp; the moral/social views instilled in the child by their parents/authority figures/peers/public...the PARENT\u2019S REACTION would MOST LIKELY cause MORE of impression of the event THAN ONLY <b>BRIEFLY</b> SEEING a naked woman just PASSIVELY laying on the ground. But TRULY...HOW BAD could the impact POSSIBLY ACTUALLY BE from seeing a naked woman VERSUS the actual PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL &amp; PSYCHOLOGICAL HARM from having a NORMALLY PAINFUL procedure...*which MOST KIDS over age 3 DO REMEMBER*...made EVEN MORE painful &amp; traumatizing by being BOTCHED by a FAKE DR &amp; REQUIRING FURTHER treatments <b>LIKELY INCLUDING ADDITIONAL</b> surgical procedures?<br>So...WHAT DOES IT SAY about the participant\u2019s MORAL VIEWS that she views PASSIVE PUBLICLY nudity viewed BRIEFLY by a child as FAR WORSE than ACTUAL PHYSICAL HARM done to a similarly aged child resulting in having to ENDURE FURTHER physical/emotional/psychiatric TRAUMA!!\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Just goes to show HOW STRONG SOICAL/CULTURAL TABOOS can be viewed by members of those societies/cultures. Because REMEMBER there ARE MILLIONS of children RAISED where full/partial ADULT FEMALE NUDITY is COMPLETELY NORMAL &amp; ACCEPTED! With NO DISCERNIBLE negative effect on the children of such societies/cultures! MUCH LESS ANY TRAUMA!! So WHY does THIS participant...who was <b>SIGNIFICANTLY OLDER</b> than the others...VIEW even a BRIEF PASSIVE viewing of a naked human body AS MAJORLY WORSE (literally the MOST punishment vs the LEAST punishment) than ACTUAL physical/emotional/psychological harm of a person of similar age?? HOW SEVERE must the NEGATIVE connotation BE/HAVE BEEN as she matured to illicit THAT SEVERE of a reaction WHEN COMPARED to ACTUAL physical/psych/emotional harm??\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 Kinda goes to show HOW EXTREME our societal/cultural moral views can SKEW our morals/views surrounding OTHER WORSE actions &amp; the CONSEQUENCES we would CHOOSE TO IMPOSE for VIOLATING each breach specifically. EVEN WHEN ASKED to essentially DIRECTLY COMPARE the 2 cultural/societal violations!! Something <b>I</b> got out of her reaction is THAT THIS is a HUGE FLAW/ISSUE with out JUSTICE SYSTEM in reference to NOT ONLY being judge by a \u201cjury of our peers\u201d BUT ALSO to the SENTENCING handed down BY THE JUDGE and in SMALLER CASES purely the judgement passed by the judge!! And on an even LOWER LEVEL of law enforcement the JUDGEMENT/DECISION of individual law enforcement officers to give an offender a warning/ticket/arrest! And THESE FLAWS cause BY the variances in the societal/cultural accepted/taboo behaviors/actions ARE WHY we see SUCH ASTRONOMICAL VARIATIONS in the SEVERITY OF/LENGTH OF PUNISHMENTS handed down FOR VERY SIMILAR CRIMES!! Which depending on YOUR PERSONAL MORAL/ETHICAL cultural/social BASED VIEW could seem INCREDIBLY LENIENT/HARSH or APPROPRIATE. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f SO...the QUESTION IS precisely WHAT IS the TRUE FAIR/JUST PUNISHMENTS for various violates of the laws we CHOSE to create..BASED ON social/cultural TABOOS &amp; PERCEIVED/ACTUAL HARM towards the rights/liberties/safety of the individual in EACH DIFFERENT society/culture?\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 And should those raised IN DIFFERENT societies/cultures BE JUDGED BASED ON the society/culture where they committed  the offense? (ie A Christian American striking a cow in Hindu India or Uncovered female is an Arabic strictly Muslim country) Or even by those OUTSIDE the society/culture who CHOOSE to ENFORCE THEIR beliefs/practices on the society/culture DIFFERENT from their own? Such as white settlers to African tribes/American Indians. OR HOW BOTH MANY Christians &amp; Muslims want to ENFORCE THEIR religious beliefs/taboos/practices on AS MANY COUNTRIES/CULTURES/SOCIETIES/PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE? Or even how the US &amp; other democratic countries PURSUE FORCING OTHER NON-democratic countries INTO BECOMING democracies? TO THE POINT of STARTING public uprisings OR EVEN CIVIL WARS to IMPOSE THEIR BELIEF that democracy is the SOLE MORAL &amp; ETHICALLY CORRECT/ACCEPTABLE form of government! So...are such actions/judgements TRULY FAIR OR JUSTICE? \ud83e\udd28\ud83e\udd28 And HOW as a world of WIDELY VARIED &amp; OFTEN OPPOSING societal/cultural beliefs &amp; laws/taboos that AS OUR WORLD SHRINKS due to faster/cheaper travel &amp; the internet COLIDE MORE &amp; MORE OFTEN...do we find NOT ONLY actions which we CAN AGREE are harmful of individuals/property/society as a whole &amp; SHOULD be punished. BUT ALSO WHAT TYPE of punishment SHOULD be given for COMMITTING any of the agreed upon laws AS WELL AS the SEVERITY &amp; DURATION of those punishments in CORRELATION WITH the SEVERITY of the breech or agreed upon laws. Which a SCALE of what makes a crane more/less severe would be YET ANOTHER ASPECT society AS A WHOLE would have to agree upon. ALL OF WHICH IS DIFFICULT as our individual cultures/societies/religions ALL view actions as VERY DIFFERENT in terms of actions deemed punishable/level of punishment appropriate. Again as an example let\u2019s consider India\u2019s views/laws protecting cattle. INTENTIONALLY KILLING cattle of ANY AGE can now be punished BY LIFE IN PRISON W/O ANY CHANCE of parole. Now this SEEMS RIDICULOUS to people raised in cultures which raise &amp; slaughter cattle BY THE MILLIONS to be consumed as food. So...the question is...SHOULD someone from a society/culture which uses cattle for MEAT be given LIFE IN PRISON if they were to LEGALLY PURCHASE a cow in India &amp; then HUMANELY slaughter it for food if they could PROVE they had NO KNOWLEDGE of the culture &amp; laws PROTECTING cattle in India? Or a less extreme example would be a tourist HITTING a cow in a way Indian law would consider \u201cabuse\u201d with NO IDEA it was ILLEGAL &amp; that such an action COULD CARRY a sentence of YEARS in prison?? SHOULD such a person receive THE SAME PUNISHMENT as someone who KNEW THE LAW BEFORE committing the act?? Or be given a LESSER sentence OR NO punishment AT ALL &amp; just given A WARNING or maybe be BANNED FROM RETURNING to the country/area controlled by the society/culture who deems such an action as wrong \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14<br>I know it\u2019s a long comment for 10sec of videos but poses a VERY INTERESTING question.

Life is the journey, to which death is sometimes necessary to keep it fun and on going, and if my death adds to a better journey then I will gladly accept death.

As an American English Teacher in China for over eight years, Rebellious children of the wealthy Chinese parents would complain about what is happening in China and, &quot;...Uncle Joe, what can we do?&quot; Bearing in mind their parents were among the students protesting in the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident. Their parents became 35 and in control of government and tempered their rebellion. So I told my students, my children if you will allow me to call them such, a quote from my High School English Teacher Sam Vogel, &quot;The best changes happen slowly. At age 61 would I convict life imprisonment or the death sentence? The death sentence my be more kind. I love Chinese system of court.

It\u2019s not a bad thing and the fact that we got to have a run at this world, becoming part of the universe being made aware of itself is unbelievable.

Waste of time. <br><br>Our position about our own death evolves as we go through life. It is driven partially about how we feel about our own mission toward self and others (completed or not). Illnesses and pain, both mental and physical do have huge influence about how we see death. Feeling of loneliness, abandonment, lack of purpose are also contributing factors. Nothing of that is covered in this video. The title is completely misleading.

She&#39;s a great YouTube personality doing great work. If anyone is sceptical, thinking she&#39;s just in it for the money, her funeral business is a nonprofit based in LA and discourages the more expensive unnecessary treatments like embalming and casket seals; she&#39;d be making more money if she just went with the flow.

In both cases there were 1s and 7s what if you let people choose a number of years / months freely, and / or also letting them choose the death sentence and no-sentence option. Perhaps we could see if one group has no death-sentences, and the other does? What if one group has a no-sentence and the other don&#39;t? This could be interesting to see. <br>As an example, if I want to choose a life in prison sentence, and you want only 10 years in prison, you both choose 7 because it&#39;s the highest number. <br>Just like that woman did, she picked 10 and counted it like a 7, were clearly she wanted way more than the other woman that also picked 7. Both 7s are not equal. <br><br>Anyways, the episode was great and very interesting, and I&#39;m looking forward for all other episodes !<br><br>Sincerely,", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T12:38:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IlyobniareslI", "comment_text": "vhere are ze russian subtitlies, mhm?", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T12:34:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Konstandinos Delacroix", "comment_text": "Sooooo... you&#39;re saying that nationalists are the most aware people ?", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T12:30:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Margot Kafka", "comment_text": "OMG ASK A MORTICIAN AND VSAUCE IN A VIDEO? \u0399 feel so educated", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T12:22:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giovanni Mahoney", "comment_text": "I can support both views because I think that immortality is a bad idea but our current lifespans are too short.", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T12:20:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sand Spider", "comment_text": "Wait ... what, no vsause when i wake up in the year 3000 , fk that .. spose i&#39;ll die too then!", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T12:03:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giovanni Mahoney", "comment_text": "Nice content, very nicely put together", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T11:58:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Awaited2K", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2018-12-27T11:54:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simon carlsson", "comment_text": "-Death is the enemy.

As a psych major they teach you a lot about confirmation bias in psychological research. One of the first things the researcher said was \u201cwell what were hoping for is X\u201d which is a major red flag in the psychological sciences. The attitude you need to have when conducting these procedures is not \u201cwell I\u2019m theorizing x and y will PROVE X CORRECT, so I should look for y\u201d <br>That\u2019s confirmation bias and it will lead to misleading or inaccurate results. What you should instead think is \u201cI\u2019m theorizing x and z will DISPOVE x, so I should look for z\u201d <br><br>Also there were things in the experiment that weren\u2019t controlled and made the research sloppy at best. For instance in the experimental group, the age difference between them and the control was too wide. So the ppl that weren\u2019t asked about their death were on the younger side and the ppl that were were mostly older, with one of them having gray hair. This will obviously lead to misleading results for a number of reasons but one of them being the fact that the hypothesis is saying that people IN GENERAL are afraid of change because they are afraid of death. Not that people of a certain age are. So it\u2019s important to control for things like age because the prospect of death for a younger person is not as pressing and prevelant and therefore is not as scary to a younger person as it is for someone who is older and death is a much more imminent possibility. <br>I don\u2019t know if any of this was done or purpose to be manipulative or if these people simply didn\u2019t do their homework in their undergrad or in grad school but I find the latter to be highly unlikely due to the fact that grades are a very important factor to anyone who wishes to go into research and since this is show business, a betting person would say that this was likely not coincidental or accidental.
