There would be torque &quot;this way&quot; only while making the wheel spin. Once it is spinning there is no torque &quot;this way&quot;. Once the spinning wheel is released pivoted at one end then the only torque on it is due to downward gravity and direction of this torque would be inward to the screen plane to start with. This results in a small angular momentum component in the direction inward to the screen plane to start with which along with the wheel spin angular momentum component results in a preceding RESULTANT angular  momentum and henceforth changes the direction of wheel plane and hence direction of gravity torque and hence the direction of the angular momentum component due to gravity and hence the direction of preceding RESULTANT angular momentum and in an ideal condition the wheel thus keeps preceding.<br>Since there is a continuous gravity torque there has to be a continuous angular acceleration &amp; hence continuous angular velocity change.

In fact if you install that bicycle wheel on a solid bar with a rotating bearing in the ceiling (so it always has to point 90deg horizontally) all processing stops. The proof for this is if you put a generator in that solid bar to extract energy from the procession (between where the bar is fixed to the roof and the rotation of the bar), you would be able to extract free energy forever, as it would be practically possible to have air bearings so low in friction and a motor so efficient at maintaining the gyroscope&#39;s speed, that you could extract more power than the energy to keep the gyroscope spinning at a constant speed. <br><br>It is in fact because gravity is allowed to act on the gyroscope that it processes, you can think of it like the outside tip of the gyroscope&#39;s axle being &#39;plugged in&#39; to a fine-pitch screw thread, the faster the speed of the gyroscope&#39;s rotation, the finer the pitch and the &#39;weaker&#39; / slower the procession (because it is &#39;falling down&#39; slower). Eventually the axle of the gyroscope must be pointed straight down. Also as gyroscopes naturally slow, that is why the procession increases, because the &#39;corkscrew&#39; gets a &#39;larger pitch / spacing&#39;. The maximum amount of energy you could extract would be the same as if you just had a rope and generator attached to the outside axle and it fell down to its lowest point. At first I thought that energy was being &#39;harvested&#39; from the gyroscope&#39;s rotation, but after a lot of research that is not theoretically possible (and doesn&#39;t fit any known data).<br><br>Phew, that took me ages to work it out because every single youtube video and online discussion gets this wrong, they all say the procession would occur forever. I would be fascinated to see a large gyroscope with a small stator (motor) in it to keep it at fixed RPM, and verify that this is correct, as the alternative is a free energy device and/or all a substantial branch of physics being wrong.", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T04:55:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Dunklee", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve watched this video like 4 times in the past week.

Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on this earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there are only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water.<br>-<br>WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don&#39;t try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years.<br>-<br>DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early &#39;90s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don&#39;t know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. + TRUTH about COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc</a> <br>-<br>Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly?<br>-<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once.<br>-<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current.<br>-<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor.<br>-<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING.

I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery.

So, why the inconsistency?<br>2) I&#39;m curious to the <b>speed</b> of the precession. It&#39;s obviously much slower then the rotation of the gyroscope, but what defines the precession speed?<br>3) If a force is needed to create precession, what force causes the precession of the Earth&#39;s path through space?

But one could argue, &quot;what about if you hit it at the speed of light?&quot;    It would be impossible to do that fore in order to hit the ball and expect it to move you need an obect with mass.  And an object with mass can not go that fast, but would the resulting velocity be perpindicular to the original.     In theroy, no, but seeing how you can not graph the speed of the ball, for the ball experinces a stop in time relitive to the ball, so its not like it can record itself, and you can not record its Path of travel, fore you can not see it, (at this point does the ball even technicaly exist).     This is going nowhere, i think the balls velocity will have a linier p.o.t. nonperpindicular with the orignial velocity", "comment_date": "2020-07-14T05:58:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sauce Man", "comment_text": "Arigato Gyro\u2026\u2026", "comment_date": "2020-07-13T05:10:05Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "KobeKoala", "comment_text": "Imagine getting that box on your doorstep", "comment_date": "2020-07-12T12:05:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Habibi Cat", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=6m11s\">6:11</a><br>I thought it will crash.", "comment_date": "2020-07-11T03:23:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bromicron", "comment_text": "Michael&#39;s fanbase are just group of memers running out of templates", "comment_date": "2020-07-11T01:11:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bromicron", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;ll try spinning that&#39;s a good trick&quot; <br>-anakin skywalker", "comment_date": "2020-07-11T01:08:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kalle Von Brundin", "comment_text": "What if the erth rotated with the equator over south and north pole?", "comment_date": "2020-07-10T23:33:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wave Mage497", "comment_text": "The golden rectangle", "comment_date": "2020-07-10T03:57:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "master Player", "comment_text": "Now I know how helicopters work! <br>\ud83d\ude81", "comment_date": "2020-07-10T01:23:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Is Nice", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=0m47s\">0:47</a> <b>Vsauce music intensifies</b>", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T18:44:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paranoint DE", "comment_text": "Hehe &quot;Gyro&quot; Zeppeli", "comment_date": "2020-07-09T07:46:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Stumm Stefan", "comment_text": "Guys i think <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=12m40s\">12:40</a> is a bit wrong?

The sky would explode/expand into an ever expanding ever thinner sphere. The water wouldn\u2019t be climbing into a ball but would instead spread out into an ever thinner spinning splat. <br><br>It is claimed that a gyro can resist the spin of the Earth but then it is claimed that a gyro could never be positioned perfectly upright and so would always begin to process. The procession due to imperfect vertical positioning would have a stronger effect than the procession due to a spinning ground. The variables wouldn\u2019t allow for a precise enough measurement.<br><br>It\u2019s imposiball for stuff on and in a spinning ball to all travel at the same speed. The supposed spinning Earth/Water/Sky ball simply couldn\u2019t travel as one ball shape. If the Earth ball was completely solid then it would at least have a chance of being a spinning ball. The gasses would @#\u00a3&amp;off into the available space. The explosion effect is exponential. The smallest movement away from the Earth ball makes the following movement away even easier. The clouds would need to some how gain speed to keep pace with the ground.

Can you explain to us, maybe making a video about the physics that happens in the inner core - subatomic center of a spinning object? I searched on the internet, but couldn&#39;t find an exhaustive explanation of the phenomenon. My opinion is that, knowing that an atom is made 99,99% of empty space, somehow that infinitesimal small center point must find itself in that empty space and somehow every other matter (proton and neutron) or particles (electrons) spins around that point. It found this to be a plausible explanation, but, what happens if the object is larger and that axis passes through billions and bilions of attoms? What if on a certain point, axis hit the nucleus of an atom? Has the nature a law to solve the problem? As far as i digged on this, I do not understand how can an spinning object have 0 velocity at center! That means that  at the center, some attoms are at rest and others are spinning around them! This Is friction and friction produces heat, not to mention some posibile decay of the object for the simple fact that is spinning. Something is not wright and I would appreciate if you help us to figure it out.

Thus the hand is in a position to assist the shot to reach its destination as close to where the athlete&#39;s eyes see the target. It kind of takes into account the offset of the eyes from the target because the arm is a little offset from the exact 90\u00b0 angle from the neck - to - shoulder line. In any case, the shotputter adjusts to make the shot make its mark. In a way, arrow shots follow this difference between eyes abdominal arrow on the string. Gun and rifle shooters taking thus into account call the difference between the gun and the kick &quot;werble.&quot; <br><br>For discus and Hammer throw, the athlete must rotate to the left (counterclockwise from the top) to make their mark at a different angle than a shotputter. A hammer is released when the athlete is facing 90\u00b0 from the target. The athlete relies on centripetal force to not only go perpendicular to the inward force created by the swinging athlete, but also the horizontal ballistic motion the swinging gives the hammer. For it is the force parallel to the ground that determines the distance.<br><br>A discus thrower has an advantage over the hammer thrower because the discus thrower, like the shotputter, can give vertical  spin, accelerating the discus in the up direction due to its spin, which creates a further gyroscopic force. Any angular force can be determined by your right hand: curl your fingers in the direction of the spin, and the thumb shows the direction of the force.", "comment_date": "2018-10-29T14:52:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ginny Jolly", "comment_text": "Wait just a <b>moment!</b>", "comment_date": "2018-10-29T14:14:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Created An Account For This", "comment_text": "If I spin too much I get dizzy and fall over.", "comment_date": "2018-10-29T01:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MeltedPlatypus", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=2m20s\">2:20</a> <b>WAZZZAP</b>", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T22:58:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Sandler Birthed me in a Pit of Fire", "comment_text": "Wow!", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T22:37:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Werner Boden", "comment_text": "Gravity is different from the rope, as far as I can conclude from spacetime.<br>Astronauts in the ISS are not pushed towards the outer wall, even though it<br>flies around earth in 92 minutes.<br>An object in orbit around earth, is actually moving in a straight line in bent space. <br>It looks like a circular motion, but that&#39;s relativity.<br>On contrary to centripetal force with an object on the rope,<br>there should not be centripetal force on the space station.<br>It is funny to think about it,<br>that an object, moving in a straight line, gets back to a point, where it left.", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T10:53:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris shaw", "comment_text": "How do we know things in &quot;orbit&quot; (a word humans created) don&#39;t go in a square shaped path and not a circle \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T08:30:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jean", "comment_text": "You remind me of my cool science teacher", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T05:55:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xyon \u2705", "comment_text": "<b>What about</b><br><i>Gyroscope in space?</i>", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T04:47:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Inside_of_patrick", "comment_text": "My 4th grade teacher put vsauce on.the hey vauce made us laugh", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T01:47:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wolfskull Wardagger", "comment_text": "Car urine", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T00:32:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AceTenYT", "comment_text": "Wtf he called dibs!?!?!", "comment_date": "2018-10-28T00:07:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wayde DT", "comment_text": "Ima gyro man", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T23:31:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kai Beattie", "comment_text": "They should have shown this in my physics class for a third of one of our lessons to help explain the unit.", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T22:29:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kirby Perler", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=2m21s\">2:21</a>", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T20:03:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lives of the Party Podcast", "comment_text": "The NECKst best thing", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T15:38:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blowfishes", "comment_text": "I wonder if I can blame my golf driver shot always fading harshly to the right on the Coriolis Effect?", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T13:21:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ho LWe", "comment_text": "You said there easter egg", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T07:55:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DeezDaims", "comment_text": "Why the hell is Vsauce so smart?", "comment_date": "2018-10-27T03:50:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sai", "comment_text": "Hey vsauce, Michael here", "comment_date": "2018-10-26T23:00:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Moon's Evil Sister", "comment_text": "WHY DO GYROSCOPES HAVE TORGUE?!

Everyone knows what energy does but no one seems to be certain what it is. Essentially there are two models used to describe the nature and behaviour of energy; the transformation model and the transference model.<br><br>However, rather than rely upon two contradictory theoretical models based upon the assumptions of others, we will be relying upon knowledge which is both historically and commonly available, and by making use of this knowledge, take a step by step approach to understanding the nature of energy and matter.<br><br>To build anything that is solid and designed to last, or to put forward a proposition that can withstand the utmost scrutiny of logic and rationality, first there must be a solid foundation to be built upon.<br><br>Oxford English Dictionary (Abrv, OED)<br><br>OED: Energy: The capacity of matter or radiation to do work: The means of doing work by utilising matter or radiation.<br><br>OED: Matter, a <b>physical</b> substance in general as distinct from *mind and spirit*. <br> <br>Three Universal Foundations - Fundamentals<br><br>Regardless of all assertions and all theories to the contrary, all things of the universal Cosmos are made up of two primary things, physical matter and energy,<br><br>Matter could not do any work or exist without energy, energy could not do any work or exist without matter.<br><br>Life could not exist without physical matter and energy, intelligent life could not exist or do any work without metaphysical energy,<br><br>Law of Physics<br> <br>Gravitation: A force of attraction between any particle of matter in the universe and any other\u201d.  <br> <br>Rational<br> <br>Fact: Particles of matter exist both at the lower invisible level of the quantum microcosmic universe, and higher visible level of the macro-cosmic universe.<br><br>Laws of Physics<br> <br>There must be an input of energy for there to be an output of energy (Equally, without an input of energy, there cannot be an output of energy).<br><br>Given a continuous input of energy there must be a continuous output of energy.<br><br>Fact: The use of the two words input and output denotes that, particles of matter are <b>intermediary vehicles</b> between an energy input and an energy output.<br><br>Fact: Particles of matter both at the invisible quantum level and the macro-cosmic level of the universe, serve as the input and output vehicles for the transition of energy between any particle of energy in the universe and any other.<br><br>Fact: As quantum energy is the only substance that surrounds fuels and pervades through all particles of matter throughout the Cosmos, so it is that quantum energy also serves the role of being the universal oceanic medium of transit for all particles and wavelengths of particles of matter. <br><br>Further confirmation<br><br>Law of Physics: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction<br><br>Given that NASA uses jet propulsion to drive and steer its space rockets through outer-space, and the propulsion of rockets is reliant upon there being matter present for the jet exhaust to react against and convert it into the power of thrust.<br> <br>So it is that the oceanic medium of outer-space is comprised of invisible quantum particles of matter and energy.<br><br>OED: Energy: The capacity of matter or radiation to do work: The means of doing work by utilising matter or radiation.<br><br>Rational <br><br>Fact: It is the input of energy into particles/vehicles of matter both at the invisible quantum level, and the macro-cosmic level of the universe, that causes particles of matter to move and to do work throughout the universe.<br><br>Fact: Energy is the fundamental fuel of the motions (work) of all particles of matter, in the universe and their outputs of radiant energy..<br><br>Fact: It is the outputs of radiant energy between all particles of matter in the invisible universe and the visible universe that causes them to be attracted toward and interact with each other.<br><br>Fact: Particles of quantum and macro-cosmic matter exist within all fluids, gases, plasmas and all solids of the universe, regardless as to where these states of matter may exist in the universe.<br><br>Fact: Particles of matter require an instantaneous and constant input of energy, in order to fuel their instant and constant speeds of motion, and their constant outputs of radiant energy, regardless as to where these states of matter may exist in the universe. <br> <br>Fact: All sizes of the particles of matter of the quantum and the macro-cosmic universe require this invisible and instantaneous supply of energy, in order for them to be able to attract and interact with other particles of matter.<br><br>Fact: It is the size and the density of particles/vehicles of matter that determines, the quantity of input energy that is needed, to fuel their motions and the quantity of radiant energy output force, that is needed to cause them to be attracted toward and to interact with each other, so that they can combine and grow.<br><br>OED: Force: A measurable influence that causes something to move.<br><br>Rational <br> <br>Fact: Potential force is the sum of the quantity of energy that is present within particles of matter.<br><br>Fact: Without an input of energy into particles of matter, their structures could not exist or possess any form of motion.<br><br>Fact: Without greater inputs of energy into particles of matter than that of their basic requirements for motion, particles of matter could not emit outputs of influential radiant force.<br><br>Fact: Without the presence of smaller particles of matter within the emitted radiations from larger particles of matter, the radiations emitted could not possess a motion of influential force.   <br><br>Fact: Force is the sum of the quantity of energy and particles emitted during their radiant interactions with other particles of matter, or the sum of the energy that is released when a particle of matter is invested with a greater amount of energy than its limits of matter can contain.<br><br>Fact: Given particles of matter that become invested with a greater quantity of energy than they can contain (e.g. a nuclear mass going critical), the released energy and matter returns to a free state of existence within the surrounding quantum universal ocean of energy and matter.<br><br>First Law of Thermodynamics<br><br>Energy may be converted but energy cannot be either created or destroyed. <br> <br>Fact: Quantum energy and quantum matter cannot be created or destroyed<br><br>Rational<br> <br>Fact: Energy is not matter (m) and matter is not energy (e). <br> <br>Fact: Neither energy or matter is mass.<br> <br>Fact: Energy does not equal mass, matter does equal mass<br> <br>Fact: Mass equals the quantity of energy present within particles and bodies of matter, relative to the quantity of matter present within the structures of particles and bodies of matter, which equates in each case to being their combined density of potential force. <br> <br>OED: Matter, a <b>physical</b> substance in general as distinct from *mind and spirit*.<br><br>Fact: As the substance of energy is not physical in nature, then it can only be <b>Metaphysical</b> in nature.<br><br>Fact: As energy is metaphysical in nature, it cannot be in a physical sense <b>Any---Thing</b> whatsoever.<br><br>Fact: As metaphysical energy exists but it is not <b>Any---Thing</b> of physical nature or of any physical sense, so it is that at the quantum level of the universe, energy exists intro &amp; extra spatially, as an all-pervading and voluminous eternal state of being <b>No-Thing</b> physical.<br><br>Fact: The Cosmos is made up of some-thing called matter, and no-thing called energy.<br><br>Fact: Energy and matter may be converted, but energy and matter cannot be created or destroyed.<br><br>Please see also: Centrifugal Force \u2013 Magnetism \u2013 Inertia Gravity continued as a reply to this comment

I have always assumed that this was due to the fact that Lilongwe was higher in elevation than Blantyre, so on average I will be going up hill one way and down hill the other way, but a 20% difference did not actually make sense since the elevation difference is just about 11 meters.

Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix myself a sandwich. But then I found out that I&#39;m out of mayonnaise so I went to the store to get some. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I&#39;m really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I&#39;m a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she&#39;ll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quite happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can&#39;t sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can&#39;t take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she&#39;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what&#39;s up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I&#39;ve been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there&#39;s my phone  and this video still had four minutes of play time on it.", "comment_date": "2017-11-24T22:02:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff Lox", "comment_text": "I have a gyroscope at home", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T22:43:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jumpex03", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=5m46s\">5:46</a> To be continued...", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T20:27:27Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Jemma Williams", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=14m34s\">14:34</a> <br>Vsauce: E\u00f6tv\u00f6sh<br>Subtitles: Hood bush", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T19:29:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hintzofcolorconcepts", "comment_text": "Faux-cult Challenge:<br>If you can build a large motor driven gyro that demonstrates the Earth&#39;s rotation,<br>I&#39;ll buy it for $10,000(US)", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T18:34:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T7x", "comment_text": "I wish there was more Vsauce and less D.O.N.G.", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T16:44:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Southworth", "comment_text": "earth is a gyroscope", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T14:04:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dumdum", "comment_text": "Time to go east", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T06:25:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "[REDACTED]", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=1m28s\">1:28</a> I swear I\u2019m tripping balls", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T03:53:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liam", "comment_text": "i love how proud you are because you cut the disk out of cardboard yourself", "comment_date": "2017-11-23T01:53:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucca Rodrigues", "comment_text": "<b>WAZZAP</b>", "comment_date": "2017-11-22T19:54:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ernesto Zavala", "comment_text": "Thank you Michael.

If you powered a gyroscope continuously it probably wouldn&#39;t remain in a stationary relative position whilst the Earth rotates, mainly because the forces involved are orders of magnitude smaller than the friction present in any gimbal or support mechanism you would necessarily have to have. Flat Earthers (bless their poor misguided souls!) often use this precise experiment to &#39;prove&#39; that the Earth isn&#39;t spinning and therefore can&#39;t be a globe. But the science is 100% sound and using specialist bearings and suspension in a vacuum etc etc, you could certainly show this effect. There&#39;s serious doubt around the validity of Focault&#39;s gyroscope experiments by the way, because these techniques weren&#39;t available in the 1800s.

Well, photons have inertia (despite having no mass) and also are affected by gravity (again, despite having no mass). Plus, they move really really fast, actually as fast as absolutely possible. So, how does this influence our measurement of photons? If I look east, will everything be very slightly blueshifted than if I look west, and by how much?

He went with Newton&#39;s formulation for simplicities sake. The basic thesis though was that math is the character of physical law. There are six parts, IIRC, to the messenger lecture series.

Also, I suppose I&#39;m assuming that the weight difference would be significant to fuel consumption at all.

Which is small, but anyway :). It would be interesting to see a video where you explain how can our weight change in different parts of the earth, locating yourself at the north pole, at the equator, and at a mountain close to the ecuator, as the city of La Paz for example at 4000 meters above the sea level. The diference in rotating speeds should be taken into account as well as the fact that the earth is not a perfect circle, meaning that the distance to the center of the earth varies depending on wether you&#39;re at the pole or at the ecuator and so does gravity : g ~ 1/r^2 by Newton&#39;s law.

Anyway, an involute curve is the basis for the profile shape of a gear-tooth that can be a universal form for gears of various numbers of gear teeth that can all mesh as pairs of gears while transferring rotary motion that&#39;s smooth and regular.  This regular motion is called &#39;conjugate motion&#39; that is constant, without gear-tooth induced positive or negative rotary accelerations!  This allows geared transmissions to run at very high speeds without significant vibration.  Involutes are very intriguing.

The rotational equivalent is the moment of inertia, which likewise determines how an object will accelerate and decelerate in rotational motion about any of the 3 arbitrarily determined orthogonal rotational axis&#39;s as it reacts to a torque.<br><br>Force = mass * acceleration    (F = m*a)<br>Impulse = Force * time = mass * change in velocity = Change in Momentum   (Impulse = F * t = m * (\u2206v ))<br><br>Note: Impulse equation basically means if you apply a force for a period of time, an object with mass, m, will experience a change in velocity.<br><br>Also<br><br>Angular Momentum = Moment of Inertia * Angular Velocity     (L = I * \u03c9)<br>Torque = Moment of Inertia * Angular Acceleration (\u03c4 = I * \u03b1)<br><br>Note: a similar impulse effect applies to rotation.

A spinning gyroscope is upright. You apply a force downward at it&#39;s perimeter. You now are encouraging an alteration of an active spinning axis which has angular momentum already, and its momentum is valued on 2 things. 1 is the moment of inertia that exists already, and the other is the angular velocity. These values combine, and you have a value for L, the angular momentum. It is this value of the angular momentum which resists changes in orientation of an actively rotating axis, and this is why gyroscopes resist tipping. This is why fast moving bicyles are easier to ride than slow moving bicycles. This is how tops work. This is why you can spin a ball on your finger tip. This is how frisbees, when thrown correctly, would be so stable as they soar through the air.<br><br>Yes, for an at-rest gyroscope, tilting it is simple. You apply a torque that would alter it&#39;s orientation, and it moves responsively. <br><br>Tilt a spinning gyroscope, however, and the story is different. When you apply a torque that would change the axis of rotation, active rotational momentum would have to be &quot;redirected&quot; around a new axis, so you find yourself fighting a form of inertia responsible for the gyroscopic properties you saw in the video. That rotational kinetic energy about the z-axis will now continue at a similar energy level about a different composite x-y-z axis in relation to the original z-axis, and the reason the spinning gyroscope resists motion is due to the fact that your excitation forces are literally applying to a system that already has a lot of established rotational energy in it, and you&#39;re acting to reorient its spinning conditions so that it&#39;s already high level of kinetic energy will be acting in a new plane or axis.<br><br>That&#39;s my take on it.

That is, you can have radial and tangential acceleration; the idea that all objects in circular motion move with constant radius and velocity isn&#39;t just wrong but contradicts the idea of a torque, since a torque can only exist when some force (hence some acceleration) is present. Michael doesn&#39;t explicitly say this, but when first describing a circle it is shown to us this way, and we are led to watch the whole video believing that the magnitude of the velocity of an object in circular motion is constant, even when it experiences a torque. It&#39;s a nitpick, but it can lead to some lazy physics.", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T07:48:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Lira", "comment_text": "No M\u00e9xico Shipping?", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T07:45:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antisceptic", "comment_text": "Brilliant stuff, well explained.", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T06:48:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xela Shade", "comment_text": "We learned about Coriolis effect in our Oceanography class in my college :D that&#39;s how all airplanes operate.", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T06:46:51Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "00N9NA", "comment_text": "Vsauce finally broke my brain", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T06:30:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Science N Stuff", "comment_text": "Do you guys think with some of that money they will research the effect of using CBD on the patient (not the THC)", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T06:27:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DoubleTen95", "comment_text": "Question/Request for potential future video: Is there a bottom of the universe?", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T06:04:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick D", "comment_text": "Someone already pointed it out but for the real science, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=11m33s\">11:33</a>.", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T05:50:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The Angry Owlbear", "comment_text": "I liked this for the cool kids comment.", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T05:46:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DiScord Chaoz", "comment_text": "WAZZAAAAAHH", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T05:13:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sanket Gaikwad", "comment_text": "hey!!!<br>where can I buy that gyroscope???", "comment_date": "2016-12-15T05:12:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruno", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHGKIzCcVa0&amp;t=11m34s\">11:34</a> BURN HIM!

If gravity itself was applying the torque, then if you dropped the gyroscope from a few feet up, it would spin the same way it would on the table. However, that is not the case. If you dropped the gyroscope, it would fall straight downwards with a slight spin, different from the table-top trial. The torque is actually coming from the force the table - or, in this case, the cardboard beneath the gyroscope - applies upwards a distance from the center of mass.

Spinning a mere toy and acts oddly when tilted? You claim gravity is the basis that provides an object spin around in orbit. Instead of gravity you tether it with a string and just as other science people do, you suggest we imagine the string as gravity. The fact that nobody can prove gravity as a tried and tested truth, then we must imagine.  A string attached to a gyroscope is acting as a string would and so it was really mind boggling to the idiots out there, but it does not prove that earth is a ball and spinning in an orbit due to the theory of gravity. Gravity is just ones man&#39;s best guess and nothing but a THEORY, but the string attached to the gyroscope is is a reality and has cause and effect that we can all study and it just confuses the simpletons because it sounds logical and they are amazed at the spectacle of the spinning toy. I don&#39;t know why you have been making anti flat earth video&#39;s as of late, but you obviously have a dog in this fight. Are you controlled by some threat now and told to attack the minds of everyone who watch your video&#39;s, are you unwilling or unable to face the answers and are afraid of the whole concept? If you are controlled, was this all you could come up with to re-enforce the brainwashing that the school system attacked us with, when we were little kids in elementary school? Everything you parroted was taught to you in the school system and you only have those teachings to have as a reference and your broken mind that was corrupted at such a young age has you so lost that I fear it will be harder for you to break free and see the other possibilities to the habitat you exist in. If it&#39;s round or if it&#39;s flat, you are a smart guy and can obviously see that there is an a Long standing Antarctica treaty and we have yet to see a picture of the earth. That we get all of our info and relay that info through cables and that the moon walk, the space shuttle and the space station is a fucking joke.

You talk about a rope and also about gravity. Later you mention that centrifugal force isn&#39;t real. All well and good, but I find a lot of people can&#39;t reconcile the thrown outwards effect of rope swinging with the definitely not thrown outwards effect of astronauts on the ISS - bearing in mind that in both cases there is only one single force acting. Here are some words about this that I wrote on another YouTube video by Physics Girl.....<br><br>This is interesting now. One guy below was talking about centrifuges. Imagine you&#39;re standing in a cradle that some giant is swinging around on a rope. Just like standing on the Earth you feel a floor beneath your feet and it feels like there&#39;s a force pulling you &quot;down&quot; (or outwards if you prefer) to that floor. This is why the notion of centrifugal force is so popular - because we&#39;ve all experienced it. So why in the ISS aren&#39;t the astronauts thrown against the further wall of their space station? In both cases there is only one force acting, the rope wielded by the giant, or gravity in the ISS. And yet the astronauts drift weightlessly whilst you in your cradle are anything but. The difference between these two situations is as follows. The centripetal force applied to you by the rope is applied via the cradle floor. As you go up through your body, slice by slice, each slice applies and reacts the forces to the slices above and below, just like standing on the Earth. So it&#39;s like a pile of books on a table. The uppermost book only feels itself whereas the lowermost has to carry the force of all of them to the table. On the ISS however, the force of gravity isn&#39;t applied to an astronaut locally, through a floor or wall. It is applied to each and every atom and elementary particle of his body simultaneously.. So there is no stacking, slice upon slice. Every slice experiences the exact same force as every other. It&#39;s as though, instead of a single solitary rope, gravity has a vast number of ropes all pulling with the same acceleration on every particle of the astronaut&#39;s body, simultaneously.", "comment_date": "2016-12-11T22:01:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cody", "comment_text": "You know everyone is depraved of Vsauce when a new upload gets #5 on trending.

For instance Pewdiepie&#39;s view count dropped since Youtube &#39;changed.&#39; Of course it wasn&#39;t just pewdiepie who&#39;s views dropped drastically, but other big youtubers like KSI, Caspar Lee, and even Vsauce! This is definitely a problem because all those youtubers need to get money to live, but losing all those views is going to make their pay checks go down. Now of course Vsauce isn&#39;t the first one to talk about this, it&#39;s everywhere; 100s of youtubers talk about this and they seem very serious about this. Pewdiepie and Jacksepticeye have already talked to youtube about this and they said they are going to fix it right away. That was a couple weeks ago.

Question:- How did Nikola Tesla manage to make a Twin Gyro with initial Angular Velocity V1, gradually spin faster and faster with no external input. Both gyros were connected with a spiral torsion spring. The top gyro oscillated. If angular velocity was 5 m/s and the wight of the Gyro Ring two kilos, the stored kinetic energy is 5 x 5 = 25 Joules. A similar gyro above connected by the torsion spring also has an angular velocity of 5 m.s and a ring-mass of two kilos. so it also has a stored kinetic energy of 25 Joules. HOWEVER the coiled torsion spring has\u00a0two Joules of stored elastic spring energy. and upon release, there is a Galilean invariance equal and opposite &#39;Action and Reaction of one Joule. The lower Gyro loses one Joule of energy,\u00a0 and rotates at Sqroot 24, slightly less than 5 m.s but the upper gyro invariably by multiple independent replicated experiments (REMEMBER THE ROYAL SOCIETY MOTTO &quot; NULIUS IN VERBA&quot; OR PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE STUPID PHYSICS LECTURER, BUT DO THE EXPERIMENT YOURSELF TO MAKE HIM BLUSH AT HIS OWN IGNORANCE.) The top gyro will increase in angular velocity to just under 6 m/s. and that gives it a stored kinetic energy close to 36 Joules. The Nkola Tesla Gyro is kept in a box, and by some process, the excess free energy 36 -25 = 11 is used to ree-tension the spring 11 - 2 - 9 Joules (ideal) and mechanical parasitic inefficiencies consume 67% of those 9 Joules, still allowing three Joules to increase the overall &quot;Angular Velocity&quot; The Legendary Nikola Tesla Gyro that Powered Andrew Carnegie&#39;s Steel Empire, after he sacked Frick, his redundant coke supplier.

Most long shooters agree that, when shooting latitudinally, compensation for the Coriolis Effect is necessary, often in the form of several inches of adjustment.<br><br>If anyone is interested, you can do a quick Google search for an online Coriolis calculator.
