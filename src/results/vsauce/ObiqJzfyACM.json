I use a version of the demonstrated &quot;Will The Cards Match&quot; trick shown at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObiqJzfyACM&amp;t=9m55s\">9:55</a>.   I note that at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObiqJzfyACM&amp;t=9m40s\">9:40</a>, in his prelude to that trick, Vsauce&#39;s statement &quot;As long as the total number of swaps adds up to the pack total minus 1, we&#39;ll have matching pairs...&quot;  could be generalized to &quot;{For the number of cards, n, currently in a pack,} as long as the total number of swaps {mod n} adds up to the pack total minus 1, we&#39;ll have matching pairs...&quot;    For example, in the first round where there are n=5 cards in each pack, the number of swaps, X, could be 4, as demonstrated with the word &quot;Will&quot;, because the requirement is X mod n = n - 1 = 4 and we have 4 mod 5 = 4, which is correct.  Possible numbers of swaps for the first round are therefore X = 4, 4+5= 9, 9+5=14, 14+5=19, etc, as all of those numbers mod 5 are congruent to 4.  This fact makes it possible to customize a message which is &quot;shuffled&quot; into the packets.  The word &quot;Cards&quot; has 5 letters and is used in the round where there are n=3 cards left per pack.  As required for this case where n = 3,  X mod n = n - 1 = 2.  We have 5 mod 3 = 2, which is correct, so the number of swaps could be X= 5, 5+4=9, 9+4=13, etc.  The point is that &quot;the pack total minus 1&quot; sets a lower bound for the number of swaps in a given round, with larger numbers of swaps being constrained by X mod n = n -1 .

Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on this earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there is only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water.<br>-<br>WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don&#39;t try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years.<br>-<br>DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early 90&#39;s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don&#39;t know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. + TRUTH about COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc</a> <br>-<br>Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObiqJzfyACM&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly?<br>-<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once.<br>-<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current.<br>-<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor.<br>-<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING. This website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000&#39;s as a Vision of a 10-speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ <a href=\"http://free-energy.yolasite.com/\">http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity.<br>-<br>This is a diagram <a href=\"https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php\">https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php</a> that looks a lot like the wiring of this former \u201cscience experiment\u201d YouTube video if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000&#39;s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology<br>-<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages.

First all all, Shakespeare had nothing to do with the Bible.  Biblical manuscripts, including the text found in the Dead Sea Scrolls were around more than 1,500 years before Shakespeare was born.

The preamble words, &quot;A song and song for the sons of Korah&quot; before verse one is part of the text.  <br><br>Also, &quot;spear&quot; is 47 words from the end, not 46, as the final musical notation &quot;Selah&quot; is part of the text.  Additionally, you cannot base it on &quot;47&quot; (Shakespeare&#39;s age in 1611) because Psalm 47 contains neither the words &quot;shake&quot; or &quot;spear.&quot;  Finally, &quot;Shakespeare&quot; is spelled with an &quot;e&quot; at the end.  &quot;Spear&quot; is not.

Say you are now going to shuffle them (but make sure to never interlace the cards, just take some from the top, then put them to the bottom, or vica versa) then flip through the cards, and ask them to tell you when to stop. Do this multiple times to really convince them that the cards are shuffled. Then look at the top card. Then put it back. The order you memorized will be the same order as the ones you have.

You&#39;re going to walk around the world along the equator, but take a very leisurely pace of one step every billion years. The equatorial circumference of the Earth is 40,075,017 meters. Make sure to pack a deck of playing cards, so you can get in a few trillion hands of solitaire between steps. After you complete your round the world trip, remove one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean. Now do the same thing again: walk around the world at one billion years per step, removing one drop of water from the Pacific Ocean each time you circle the globe. The Pacific Ocean contains 707.6 million cubic kilometers of water. Continue until the ocean is empty. When it is, take one sheet of paper and place it flat on the ground. Now, fill the ocean back up and start the entire process all over again, adding a sheet of paper to the stack each time you\u2019ve emptied the ocean.<br><br>Do this until the stack of paper reaches from the Earth to the Sun. Take a glance at the timer, you will see that the three left-most digits haven\u2019t even changed. You still have 8.063e67 more seconds to go. 1 Astronomical Unit, the distance from the Earth to the Sun, is defined as 149,597,870.691 kilometers. So, take the stack of papers down and do it all over again. One thousand times more. Unfortunately, that still won\u2019t do it. There are still more than 5.385e67 seconds remaining. You\u2019re just about a third of the way done.<br><br><br>To pass the remaining time, start shuffling your deck of cards. Every billion years deal yourself a 5-card poker hand. Each time you get a royal flush, buy yourself a lottery ticket. A royal flush occurs in one out of every 649,740 hands. If that ticket wins the jackpot, throw a grain of sand into the Grand Canyon. Keep going and when you\u2019ve filled up the canyon with sand, remove one ounce of rock from Mt. Everest. Now empty the canyon and start all over again. When you\u2019ve leveled Mt. Everest, look at the timer, you still have 5.364e67 seconds remaining. Mt. Everest weighs about 357 trillion pounds. You barely made a dent. If you were to repeat this 255 times, you would still be looking at 3.024e64 seconds.

How do I know if this is really happening. And if it wasn\u2019t happening than how would I be explaining it right now. The simple answer is... I\u2019m not explaining anything. The reality of this message is that this is an entire hypothetical thought of things that could happen. Then again, how would it be possible for me to explain something that\u2019s happening if it\u2019s not really happening. Just keep thinking and maybe you\u2019ll be stuck in a loop like me bacause there is no true way for anyone to explain anything to anyone unless they were ENTIRELY sure what they were explaining and ENTIRELY sure that whoever they were explaining it to was ENTIRELY sure that they could have something that hadn\u2019t been experienced  by themself explained to them ENTIRELY CORRECT. But, how would I be successfully be explaining this to you right now if that were to be true. Nothing that you read right now is guarantied to be explained correctly because no one has ever correctly experienced their explanations of something that hasn\u2019t been done. If you read all of this than you will understand how it\u2019s possible that nothing that has happened EVER is ENTIRELY real.

But all of the cards, even where red got paired with red, they all matched with a 4 card.<br><br><br>(The red card values were:  5, 1, 2, 4, and 1. All randomly pulled from the deck, which had more red cards as well as purple and blue cards)", "comment_date": "2019-06-22T19:40:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snoop Dogg", "comment_text": "BUT NOT YOU VANESSA", "comment_date": "2019-06-22T08:56:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carter The Chevrolet", "comment_text": "Why do they get peeled off to the sides?

Ultimately, I want to see your explanation. Did humans invent math or was it discovered, just like everything else? Did someone really take that much time to create such a logical language that almost seems magical and and seamless no matter which formula one uses. Numbers, math, they just make sense, as much as humans need for oxygen and water for survival. If this is true, then numbers and math were always there, until one day someone cracked open a geode, and discovered some patterns, and needed to explain their findings, giving birth to numbers and math. (or something like that). I assume math began as patterns, then they needed a way to keep track for larger amounts, so someone invented formulas, and then we got more complicated over time. I did try to find what I was looking for on Google, but I like your visuals and sources you provide. I am fascinated with numbers.

If infinite time of being dead (before being born and after having died) really existed, wouldn&#39;t it be impossible for us to live right now? We would either be trapped in the infinite past before we are even born or we would have died by long and be trapped in infinity in the future. So basically, if infinite life didn&#39;t exist, we wouldn&#39;t be alive right now.. because chances of being alive would basically be 0.

Why? Because you often have magicians say &quot;you&#39;re going to use your ESP&quot; and if you already believe in that sort of think (or didn&#39;t previously) and you leave them with this trick, they&#39;ll either think they actually have it OR might think they HAVE had it. <br><br>Combine this with years of experiencing probabilities and tricks like this and you end up with people honestly believing they have things like ESP that are actually just the brains flawed understanding of probabilities and the fact that the human brain is wrong ALL the time. This wouldn&#39;t matter if you didn&#39;t have psychics and stuff telling people to stop searching for their kids because they&#39;re dead, and then it turns out years later that the kid was actually alive the entire time (like what happened to Silvia Brown) OR simply screwing people out of their money.<br><br>Knowing that: <br><br>A) The brain makes mistakes all the time (not able to quickly grasp numbers, probabilities, friggin&#39; optical illusions, etc)  and<br>B)  You can make fun tricks that exploit this.<br><br>are what make magic so fun in the first place. But even better than that is knowing how they work. Once you REALLY understand, to your core, that NO magic actually happens here, well then you can forego having to ruin the secret every time.  <br><br>Knowing there isn&#39;t any ACTUAL magic in the world DOESN&#39;T make the world any less magical since the REAL reason this trick, and peoples &#39;ESP&#39;, etc. work is BEAUTIFUL. The brain is hugely complex and flawed and isn&#39;t it more amazing once you have the &quot;ah-HA&quot; moment here over ... just thinking some weird bullshit happened to make this work? At that point you&#39;ll start being able to see how EVERYONE (myself and you included) is tricked ALL. THE. TIME. It&#39;s why we search for the truth about phenomenons instead of just accepting that they are magic. Every time we figure out, definitively, the answer it turns out to be much more beautiful and, dare I say it\u2047, MAGICAL in the first place!", "comment_date": "2016-03-02T20:34:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hassanal Bolkiah", "comment_text": "I guessed Ace of Hearts and Ace of Spades, except for the Queen.

Then  remake the columns by puting one card at a time in every column (sideways). Repeat again, and when he tells you wich column is for the third time, it will always be the 4th card, of the 2nd column, top to bottom. You can make whatever you want after knowing what card is it, but do not finish it there, so it doesnt look obvious. I&#39;ve known this trick since i was 12 or so.

First, i am 12 years old. i never lived in the 90&#39;s or earlier an i still hate this generation.and i know plenty of other people my age that wold be happy to tell you the same thing.whys that?mean i&#39;s not my parents i decided to hate today&quot;s world on my <a href=\"http://own.is\">own.is</a> it my opinion.if so why do so many other of my peers say the same thing. In your video you mentioned that in 1871 the Sunday magazine published an article stating &quot;now we fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes instead of sitting down and having a talk over a real piece of paper.&quot;  Your right, people have been complaining about the latest generation for hundreds of years. But they&#39;re just notes. Back then if you wanted to reply to the person who wrote the letter you would either have to mail them a letter back or go over and reply to them. Now a days, you can talk to each other via text instantly. I understand technology has to advance for human life to be easier. And it is useful when you can&#39;t get to someone. But even if you can get to someone, people rather text than talk to each other. You then say in 1907 that the Journal of Education wrote that at a modern family gathering silent around the fire each individual has his head buried in his favorite magazine. There just magazines you have to get bored or finish reading eventually. On the internet you won&#39;t get bored or if you do it&#39;s so addictive you probably won&#39;t notice. And there are so many things that it would keep you occupied for days. You then state that drug use is down. Fair enough you also state that exercising rates are up, but obesity rates are up too. And that graph that you shown lists people from 18-24 not under 18. Math and writing abilities have increased, how ever the public education system is completely flawed. Crimes committed by young people are down, but cyber bullying is up. Hate comments reported by children has dropped, however cyber bullying is up. The amount of high school students that got into fights has dropped, how ever cyber bullying is up. And the amount of teens who fear to go to school has dropped. However cyber bullying is up. Isn&#39;t cyber bullying worse than regular bullying? in your video you mention that  every generation has fair share of there dumb and smart music such as led zeppelin who made &quot;babe i&#39;m gonna leave you&quot;and Justin Bieber&#39;s &quot;baby&quot;true but it&#39;s not what you say it&#39;s how you say it&#39;s how you say it.mean don&#39;t get me wrong Justin sang his song quit decently.but the way he sang it wasn&#39;t good enough.for the first minute i thought he was some kinda girl back up singer.led zeppelin made his song with a better rhythm and the lyrics sounded less like he was choking to death.so it&#39;s not so much the lyrics it&#39;s the way they sound and the rhythm.and when it comes to Justen&#39;s song pray he&#39;s such a hypocrite because he dose bad things he has been arrested before.you said Mozart wrote poems about farts.true but that was on poem.have you ever heard of breadwinners combine all the fart jokes Mozart did in his life twice and you wouldn&#39;t come close to how many fart jokes that show has in one episode. watch it.you&#39;ll hate trust me.you say that people might not like the violence,language,or morals they put on t.v. it&#39;s jest your opinion.i agree with you to some extent.mean if you don&#39;t like a show like the middle then fine it&#39;s not a bad influence and it&#39;s not offensive.but can you guess what show this plot came from.character steels other character&#39;s diary.character shares it with side characters and side characters laugh knowing the diary is stolen.character who own&#39;s the diary gets sad and cries. side characters get mad at character who stole the diary in one of the worst states of hypocrisy you will ever see.what show is that from.think about it. think really hardly.think.think.think.think.you thought of some adult like show.but that plot came from modern spongebob sqarepants.a show aimed for kids had that plot.and before you say well it probably is a mistake it&#39;s not.almost every episode from season 5 and up has the same amount of cruelty.you then say reruns have made us smarter. doesn&#39;t  that prove what i jest said that t.v. in the old days is better since there on reruns?you said pop music is better because it&#39;s similar but remember what i said that no one puts meaning and effort in to the rhythm and the voice.please remember this is jest a question and i really would appreciate an answer thank you.", "comment_date": "2016-03-01T01:02:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "taelor adderly", "comment_text": "you should do a video on biokinesis", "comment_date": "2016-03-01T01:01:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paulo Henrique", "comment_text": "OK, ACE OF HEARTS.<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK?", "comment_date": "2016-03-01T00:41:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vali | osu!", "comment_text": "I was thinking of number 7S and he said &quot;seven of you&quot; i was like jesus fucking christ wtf", "comment_date": "2016-03-01T00:40:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan", "comment_text": "it&#39;s 1pm don&#39;t make me think", "comment_date": "2016-03-01T00:38:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Average Youtube Commenter", "comment_text": "You guessed all my cards...I&#39;m done.

The trick involves a person selecting a card, memorizing it, and by the end after performing the routines you&#39;re are to reveal their card every single time without any form of deception. Just with pure mathematics. <br><br>You take 21 cards and divide them into three piles of seven cards. They choose a pile, you fan out the cards of that pile, and they must mentally remember one card. The pile they picked must be placed in-between the other two piles. You then deal the cards, one card at a time, from left to right until all are dealt back into three piles. Then, you pick up one pile and fan out the cards and ask the person if their card is within that pile. If not, you place the pile back from where you picked up and proceed onto another pile and do the same until you have the pile containing their card. Once you have the pile containing their card, you place it back in between the other two piles and do that same exact routine again. <br><br>After finding the pile containing their card and placing it in between the other two piles for the second time, you then deal out ten cards and the eleventh card will be guaranteed without a doubt the card that they memorized. <br><br>There are several different ways to deal out the ten cards to make the trick look fancy, you just have to remember that the eleventh card is their card. This trick works every single time without fault and there is no need for any type of deception. It has always kind of blew my mind at how they get to choose the card and you never get to see it or know what it is, yet you are always able to find their card, simply through mathematics. <br><br>I wish someone could show me the math behind so that one day I can properly explain it without just saying &quot;it&#39;s magic&quot; lol", "comment_date": "2016-02-16T05:28:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Apextr8der", "comment_text": "Look!

We just saw how HUGE 8.0658x10^67 is, check this out. Here is the link to the article I got this from. <a href=\"http://creation.com/lifes-irreducible-structure-part-1-autopoiesis\">http://creation.com/lifes-irreducible-structure-part-1-autopoiesis</a><br><br>Life contains such a vast new world of molecular amazement that no one has yet plumbed the depths of it. We cannot hope to cover even a fraction of its wonders in a short article, so I will choose just one example. Proteins consist of long chains of amino acids linked together. There are 20 amino acids coded for in DNA, and proteins commonly contain hundreds or even thousands of amino acids. Cyclin B is an averaged-size protein, with 433 amino acids. It belongs to the \u2018hedgehog\u2019 group of signalling pathways which are essential for development in all metazoans. Now there are 20^433 (20 multiplied by itself 433 times) = 10^563 (10 multiplied by itself 563 times) possible proteins that could be made from an arbitrary arrangement of 20 different kinds of amino acids in a chain of 433 units. The human body\u2014the most complex known organism\u2014contains somewhere between 105 (= 100,000) and 106 (=1,000,000) different proteins. So the probability (p) that an average-sized biologically useful protein could arise by a chance combination of 20 different amino acids is about p = 106 /10^563 = 1/10^557 . And this assumes that only L-amino acids are being used\u2014i.e. perfect enantiomer purity.<br><br>Mind you, this is just the probability of one, just one protein arising by chance!", "comment_date": "2016-02-12T01:37:05Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Cesar Perez", "comment_text": "always the best videos.", "comment_date": "2016-02-12T01:36:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mallory Crosby", "comment_text": "Everyone should check out zach mccoy. his song all dogs go to heaven is playing at the end of the video.

Pretty much you would put the jacks down(in there own pile) and then the match the suits. So jack-&gt;queen-&gt;king-&gt;ace. So it would end up being jack through ace in each pile(4 piles) same color didnt really matter too much if i remember right... But anyway. You&#39;d have four piles...and you place each pile on top of each other(so the order remains the same). Then you would have the spectator CUT the cards as many times as they&#39;d like as long as they didnt mix up the order, it would work. After they cut the cards, you&#39;d make 4 piles, putting 1 card at a time down on each pile, then repeating(say the order was QKAJQKAJQKAJQKAJ(the order wouldnt change since they were cutting), you would put Q in pile 1, K in pile 2, A in pile 3, and J in pile 4. Then repeat.)<br>This makes all the cards come into their own piles. Usually a story would go along with it.<br>The story i remember was something like: Royal families are walking through the woods and arguing with their own kind....the Princes(jacks) decide to go back to their hotel rooms and go to bed.(jacks start making piles) Then the queens decided to go to bed and joined their respective jack in their room. Then the kings and finally, the guards(aces/sometimes 10s). Then the guards turn out the lights(flip over so they are all face down).<br>At this point you collect the piles face down and have them cut 7times(7 is what i remember). Then you tell a story about how they are all asleep(blah blah) and continue this until you place all the cards in 4 piles again. Then you say in the morning they wake up and reveal that they are all with their own kind again! <br>It was pretty silly and such a simple trick, but as a kid, it AMAZED ME and i made him show me how he did after about the 3rd time.<br><br><br>EDIT: Found a guide online...kinda wish i didnt type this but whatever :D <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Do-the-%22Royal-Vacation%22-Card-Trick\">http://www.wikihow.com/Do-the-%22Royal-Vacation%22-Card-Trick</a>", "comment_date": "2016-02-10T03:47:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kiet Lau", "comment_text": "the first card I thought of was ace of spades", "comment_date": "2016-02-10T03:45:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Godzilla Bane", "comment_text": "I like how he says &quot;probably die&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-02-10T03:43:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Conor Turk", "comment_text": "Lol, that trick at 13 mins.

On another note, more math card tricks! Deal out 9 cards and have someone pick a card from the 9 selected cards. Place the other 8 cards face-down and have them place their card face-down on top of the pile of 8 face-down cards. Then, place the remaining deck on top of the pile of 9 face-down cards.

(So, each time you say a number, flip over a card face-up from the deck.) If you get a &quot;match&quot; (ie. you say &quot;seven&quot; and you happen to flip over a 7), place the card face-up on the pile you are on and move on to the next pile or stop if you already have 4 piles. If you do not get a &quot;match&quot; (ie. you say &quot;one&quot; and an Ace does not come up... Aces have value &quot;one&quot;) deal one more card face-down to cover up that pile. Then, either move on or stop until there is a total of 4 piles. Once there are 4 piles, have them add up the value of each pile (each face value card on top is the value of a pile... ie. 4 Hearts, 8 Clubs, 2 Hearts, 7 Spades = 21, note a covered pile has the value of 0). Then say, &quot;The total sum of the piles will be the location of your card, so your card will be the Xth card.&quot; (In the example, &quot;Your card will be the 21st card.&quot;) Then, from the remaining deck, count off the number of cards in order to reveal that their card is the Xth card.", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T20:01:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Edwards", "comment_text": "I&#39;m confused why 52 factorial is a timer, instead of the amount of possibilities, given the amount of cards shuffled in las Vegas alone...<br>I think we would be somewhat close.", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T20:00:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Princeofnorwayz", "comment_text": "that got real deep at the end", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T19:53:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "03Inolvidable", "comment_text": "One of the cards were what I thought of haha yessss", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T19:49:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Waldo Versteckt", "comment_text": "wow!!!!<br>i&#39;m speechless", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T19:44:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ray", "comment_text": "its about time", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T19:37:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "growtopia gamer737417", "comment_text": "vsauce(3) has 6 letters, 6-(3)=3.<br>triangle has 3 sides, triangle has 9 letrts 9*4=r483/4=666/3=iluminati cinfitned", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T19:35:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saga Kh", "comment_text": "Your videos gives me life.", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T19:31:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "batman", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObiqJzfyACM&amp;t=16m57s\">16:57</a> nooo XDD holy feck", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T19:30:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "adnan Shahnawaz", "comment_text": "Gimme some subs or your account xD", "comment_date": "2016-02-08T19:29:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "23cupsofcoffee", "comment_text": "That didn&#39;t feel like 19mins!

There is one card trick my dad teached me when I was small. I haven&#39;t found anyone to explain me why it works. :D So if anyone can tell me how the math works behind it, I&#39;ll appriciate. :D<br><br>Take a deck of cards (no jokers) and put first card in the deck to the table. check the numeric value of it (aces are considered 1 in this trick) and from that number, keep counting to 13, adding one card for each number. After you get to 13 in you counting, flip the pile over (if card you started with was king aka 13, naturallly you flip it right away), and start another pile, and repeat the process. Do this till you got 3 piles, or go trough whole deck for extra dramatic effect, just remember that when dealing the last pile, unless you don&#39;t get to 13, just don&#39;t make a pile from those card and keep those in your hand. Now, if you have more than 3 piles, take away any extra piles so you are left with 3 in the end. Now flip top cards over from 2 of them. Well, the numbers shouldn&#39;t surprise you as these are the cards you started counting from, put this is where the magic comes in. <br><br>lets imagine, that cards on top of the piles are 5 and 7. 5+7 is 12. Now, if you counted your piles right, something neat has just happened. take cards on your hand, and discard as many cards away as what is the sum of the flipped cards (in this example 12). Now, discard extra 10 cards. now count how many cards are in your hand. That is the numeric value of the top card on the third pile. Flip it to check.

When you have a cyclical stack and you reverse a portion of the cards by counting them down and then riffle shuffle it once (no matter how sloppy) the cards will still be in their pairs except you do not know the order of the pairs.<br><br>So if you setup a deck of cards in a simple sequence like a Si Stebbins order and you take any arbitrary number between 10 and 26 and count of 26 cards.<br>Then riffle shuffle it and then you will find:<br><br>first 2 cards are of color<br>second 2 cards are of color<br>third 2 cards are of color<br>and 4th 2 cards are of color<br><br>Then the next 4 cards contain all suits<br>The next 4 cards contain all suits!<br>The next 4 cards contain ALL SUITSSS!<br>and the next 4 cards contain ALL SUITSSSS!<br><br>Just to show I can predict your choices I will tell you the next 2 cards are of colour.<br><br>Then the next 13 cards.... contain every card of the Ace through King<br>The next 13 cards contain.... also every card ace through king but in opposite colours.<br><br>Statistically it seems impossible this working out EVERY BLOODY TIME but because of the Gilbreth principle and the cyclical stack it works every single time! As long as you reverse count a few cards and riffle (and only riffle!) shuffle then one.", "comment_date": "2016-02-05T21:23:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charlie", "comment_text": "I was thinking Ace of hearts!!!!", "comment_date": "2016-02-05T21:23:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Eves", "comment_text": "Well done you got ace of spades correct", "comment_date": "2016-02-05T21:23:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Timur Sultanov", "comment_text": "I thought about the Queen of Hearts first, after that was thinking that he will pull out Ace of hearts twice in a row.

Clearly Michael believed that the Youtube media has gone off the rails(probably arguing with the 75% cut off view money) and so he became to add so much fillers, doing long videos once a month(as he realizes a month is the time where videos usually peak their views), while doing half the work he did before(when he used to post 4 videos per month).<br>To make things worst he became recycling themes and, instead of producing inspiring new insights about mixed topics, he became to just copy and paste, gluing everything with the worst glue you can find.<br>The videos quickly became boring over the last year, instead of inspiring and giving you a big sense of awe, of surprising facts that went unnoticed even you clearly thought you knew about those things.<br>Videos have become fillers within itself, counting cards, tasks, whatever. What a bad way to go uh Michael.<br>Your channel, just like minutephysics, were bright stars in this youtube realm, back in the day.

In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?\u201d -richard dawkins", "comment_date": "2016-02-05T18:21:16Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "TroyHandsome", "comment_text": "This might be the most mind blowing one you&#39;ve done.
