That is: smallness. Already, it&#39;s more than an adult being reminded of their own species&#39;s baby, as these proportion differences across age aren&#39;t exclusive, yet animals likely don&#39;t respond the way we do to cuteness despite this.<br><br>Kids can acknowledge cuteness and even babies respond to it their own way as well, be it an animal or cartoon etc., just like any kid can respond to scary images, fangs or not. It&#39;s unlikely the functions of baby care are simply taking over at such an age. They can see a smaller, lesser or simpler creature just in general. And everyone can acknowledge that women are smaller and more quaint than the male, which has lead to the words existence in the first place, apparently. She is smaller, like the males of many insects are next to the hawking female.<br><br>Did Koko&#39;s cat friend merely remind her of her baby, or is it truer she can acknowledge that it is a smaller, more vulnerable creature, like her baby would be. Both incorporate the same features universally and both are soft and quaint on their own, in their own way. Plus, she would probably be more on a scale with the cat itself, as many animal species can bond and grow up together as either play mates or acquaintances.<br><br>And so, even if we did look like the mongoloid creature there and were just as smart, we probably would still have a similar appreciation of other smaller creatures too, as they still look nothing like us even now.

Mammals have certain features that we consider &#39;good&#39;, and when we recognise those features in other animals, we like it.

The more distantly related the animal is to mammals, the less cute we find it.<br><br>I wonder if there could also be a psychological phenomenon going on here that&#39;s similar to the uncanny valley, but obviously with a different effect.

However, you probably still find baby animals and otherwise &quot;cute&quot; things to still be cute like I do, in spite of actual human babies getting no reaction. I believe I&#39;ve got an explanation for this phenomenon:<br><br>The human mind is extremely-focused on social pursuits due to how we evolved, and tries to impose social identifiers and other such constructs on other humans as often as possible. These identifiers range from good ones like &quot;friendly&quot;, &quot;harmless&quot; and even &quot;cute&quot;, to &quot;annoying&quot;, &quot;dangerous&quot; and even &quot;potential threat&quot;.<br><br>From what I can tell, when looking at something that&#39;s &quot;cute&quot;, most people have their mental defenses shut off and avoid assessing the glaring negative traits of babies. They don&#39;t get as bothered by the sounds and smells, and they don&#39;t assess the cute thing&#39;s behavior alongside adult human behavioral guidelines. This is very good for humanity, since our being able to see that a baby is highly-detrimental to us now and might potentially grow to usurp us socially and/or physically later makes us want to get rid of the annoyance and/or threat.<br><br>In animals that lack this mental inhibitor, like some reptiles and insects, infanticide is frighteningly common. Without having the warm, fuzzy, &quot;gotta protect and nurture this thing&quot; instinct, animals naturally see offspring as tiny, resource-guzzling rivals. And that is what leads to a whole lotta dead babies that weren&#39;t fast enough to get away.<br><br>I think people who don&#39;t find babies cute like myself might have a less-powerful version of this instinct, in comparison to &quot;normal&quot; humans. We more easily see the potential for our own misery and ruin that our offspring carry, and that negates the cuteness quite a bit, if not entirely. We see very clearly that human babies are detrimental and potentially-dangerous, much like the aforementioned insects and reptiles, and thus feel little-to-no biological compulsion to protect and nurture them.<br><br>But you may be wondering, &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t this apply to baby animals and other cute things too?&quot; The answer to that question is this: Cute things like baby animals do not fall into our social orders and do not possess the same potential for danger as a human, so we don&#39;t see them as threats. While we might assess babies as mini-humans, with all of the potential for rivalry and danger of a normal adult human, baby animals and other cute things don&#39;t even register on the same scale.<br><br>When we look at a cute thing, like a baby animal or a kawaii hammer, we know that it does not even remotely fit into human social order, and cannot really biologically replace us or exceed us among our kin. We also know that, from a physical standpoint, these cute non-human things stand little-to-no chance of hurting/killing us, which deactivates our self-protection guidelines as well.<br><br>In a sense, while those of us who hate babies can see their potential social and physical danger to us adult humans, we also see that baby animals/kawaii hammers/etc. are capable of neither.<br><br>When we look at a baby bunny or something similarly cute, we intrinsically know that it cannot replace us mentally/physically/socially, and that it poses no physical threat. Therefore, the mental misfire (or perhaps lack of such a misfire) that lets us see babies as threats does not and cannot activate for other cute lifeforms and objects.<br><br>While most human beings lump babies and other cute things all together under the &quot;harmless &amp; cute&quot; category, some people instinctively fail to put babies in that category. People like me, and many of you, are these people who do not mentally put babies in the same category as infant animals and cute hammers. We&#39;re mentally &quot;glitched&quot; in a sense, seeing everything cute <b>except</b> babies as harmless.\u00a0<br><br>But hey, that&#39;s just my theory on it.<br><br><b>TL;DR:</b> People who hate babies can instinctively see that they might currently or later be threats, so the mental processes judging cuteness go haywire. These people don&#39;t have the same problem with animals and/or hammers, because they also instinctively know these things don&#39;t pose the same threats as human infants.", "comment_date": "2014-04-05T02:02:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gelato Dwaginicus", "comment_text": "But.......not only do I not find babies cute, I find every animal out there to be adorable.", "comment_date": "2014-04-03T21:50:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan White", "comment_text": "Did anyone else think that short, disproportionate sized head, and huge eyes represent all anime girls", "comment_date": "2014-04-02T22:35:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "neromagick", "comment_text": "Michael in the many years that I have watched you that &quot;awww&quot; was the most adorable thing I have seen you do", "comment_date": "2014-04-02T04:22:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mael Lorach", "comment_text": "hurt the hammer before hammer hurts you", "comment_date": "2014-04-02T01:36:46Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Michey", "comment_text": "Just saw the Why are things creepy vid and went straight here afterward.
