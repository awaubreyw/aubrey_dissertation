Matthew 13:50 (UKJV) \u201cAnd shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\u201d Hell is very terrible and it\u2019s very very hot, you can\u2019t survive placing your hand on a hot stove for 10 seconds, don\u2019t even think you will withstand burning there without being consumed,<br>The thing here is you will be burned without being consumed in hell the same same way you boil a hard rock in water you will be there for eternity,<br>Again after judgement you will be thrown in lake of fire forever. <br><br>Hell is a place of suffering from intense tormenting, so why choose to go there instead of going to Heaven? <br><br>Here is the steps you must read, understand and believe in order to be sure you will be on your way to Heaven. <br><br>Salvation<br>Jesus said, &quot;I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me&quot; (John 14:6). He also said, &quot;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved&quot; (John 10:9, NASB). Jesus is not only the way to heaven, he is also the door to heaven. <br>Realise you are a sinner; Isaiah 64:6 (UKJV) But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses(the quality of being morally right) are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.<br><br>Deserving hell for sins<br>Realise that you deserve hell for your sins; <br>Romans 6:23 plainly states that the wages of sin is DEATH.\u00a0In Genesis 2:17 God warned Adam and Eve that they would die THE DAY they ate of the forbidden fruit.\u00a0They disobeyed God, but didn&#39;t DIE physically until hundreds of years later.\u00a0Why? It&#39;s because they DIED SPIRITUALLY that awful day, and all mankind has been born spiritually dead since (Romans 5:12).\u00a0Please understand that spiritual death and the second death are\u00a0not\u00a0the same.\u00a0Every person who is not born again is ALREADY spiritually dead.\u00a0The second death is Gehenna, i.e., the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15).\u00a0All those who die in their sins, without being born again( that is believing that Jesus Christ got crucified and shed his blood for their sins, buried and rose again in the third day and alive now in heaven), will be arraigned, prosecuted, and sentenced at\u00a0The Great White Throne of Judgment\u00a0and then cast into the Lake of Fire forever.\u00a0<br><br>Repent<br>So repent, Repenting means: to change your mind; a sincere turning away, in heart, mind and action; Therefore God wants you to repent of sinful values and of sinful living. God wants you to decide to follow Him and to make Jesus the Lord of your life.<br><br>No other way <br>If you want to go to heaven, you&#39;ve got to go through the door marked &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot; There is no other entrance. <br>By no other entrance it means belief in gods, Buddha, Muhammad or other beings or objects cannot save you; But only belief in Jesus Christ our Lord can save you.<br><br>Hebrews 10:4, 10 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.<br>By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. <br><br>Any other form of sacrifice be it animal sacrifices it can&#39;t save you but we are only saved through the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus Christ did for you as simple as that. <br><br>Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br><br>Believe <br>All you need to do is to truly believe with your heart and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ suffered and got crucified and shed his blood for your sins at the cross, He was buried but rose again on the third day just to prove he was God and now alive in heaven. After that you will receive the holy spirit and you will know that you are going to heaven after death or when Jesus comes back while you are still alive.<br><br>After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c. <br><br>Romans 6:10-11 For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.<br>Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.<br><br>As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.

After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, \u201cPeace and safety,\u201d destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.

Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s true: <br>Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, <br>&quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery <br>already with her in his heart.&quot; Ever looked with lust? If you have said <br>&quot;Yes&quot; to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, <br>thieving, adulterer at heart; and we&#39;ve only looked at three of the Ten <br>Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or <br>guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That&#39;s not<br> God&#39;s will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son <br>to take your punishment: &quot;God commended His love toward us, in that, <br>while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Jesus then rose from the<br> dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who<br> confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do <br>that today . . . you may not have tomorrow.

Even with a mask, one could breathe the fear of the unknown in the air.\r<br>\r<br>From ancient times to the modern day, several prophecies point to a catastrophic and deadly plague around this time. Now the pressing question before us is: How big will the current coronavirus plague get? If the future is as tragic as described in the prophecies, how can one survive it?\r<br>\r<br>To find the answer, we can look to some clues from the great plagues of ancient Rome about two thousand years ago.\r<br>\r<br>Persecution of Christians and Plagues in Ancient Rome\r<br>In 33 A.D., after Jesus was put to death in the province of Judea, some of his followers witnessed the miracle of Jesus&#39; resurrection. The number of Christians kept increasing after that.\r<br>\r<br>On July 17, 64 AD, a fire broke out in the ancient city of Rome, engulfing the whole city. In the flames, some people witnessed Nero, the fifth emperor of ancient Rome, standing at the top of a tower, playing the lyre and singing folk songs about the fall of Troy. The fire burned for six days and seven nights.\r<br>\r<br>After the incident, Nero insisted that the arsonists were Christians and began to arrest them, calling them \u201ccultists.\u201d Although many people believed that Nero had ordered the army to set the fire, they were afraid and unwilling to look into the truth in the face of Nero&#39;s tyranny.\r<br>\r<br>Immediately afterward, various rumors about Christians&#39; \u201cbaby-killing,\u201d \u201cbinge drinking,\u201d and \u201cincestuous behavior\u201d began to fly, and the public began to despise and hate Christians. Riding on this \u201cpublic opinion,\u201d Nero&#39;s persecution of Christians became even more unscrupulous.\r<br>\r<br>The ancient Roman historian Tacitus described the following in his Annals: \u201cIn their very deaths they were made the subjects of sport: for they were covered with the hides of wild beasts, and worried to death by dogs, or nailed to crosses, or set fire to, and when the day waned, burned to serve for the evening lights. Nero offered his own garden players for the spectacle, and exhibited a Circensian game, indiscriminately mingling with the common people in the dress of a charioteer, or else standing in his chariot.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Most of the people of ancient Rome at the time applauded the horrific persecution of Christians.\r<br>\r<br>In 65 A.D., a plague broke out in the city, claiming more than 30,000 lives. This plague was, in fact, a prelude to a series of plagues that struck ancient Rome. In 68 A.D., a riot broke out in Rome and Nero ended his brutal life by stabbing his own throat with a dagger. However, the outbreak of the plague and the tragic death of Nero did not provoke much reflection among the ancient Romans.\r<br>\r<br>In 79 A.D., an even larger plague quickly swept through Rome. According to Tacitus, at its peak, more than 10,000 people died every day. Houses were filled with corpses, and the streets were filled with lines for funerals. The plague also took the life of then-emperor Titus. This plague, although fierce, was not ranked among the four great plagues of ancient Rome.\r<br>\r<br>After the death of Titus, his successor Domitian did not restrain himself and instead forced people to worship him as \u201cLord and God.\u201d He persecuted those Christians who did not want to do so. The emperor Trajan, who came after Domitian, intensified the persecution of the Christians and killed Ignatius, the second bishop of Antioch, by having him torn apart by a fierce beast.\r<br>\r<br>In 125 A.D., the Plague of Orosius broke out, accompanied by swarms of locusts.\r<br>\r<br>Plagues Strike One After Another\r<br>The Orosius Plague, which took the lives of nearly a million people, was recorded by later generations as the first of four great plagues in ancient Rome.\r<br>\r<br>In 161 A.D., Marcus Aurelius became Emperor of Ancient Rome, and upon assuming power, he became the first emperor to order the eradication of Christians throughout the country. Aurelius rewarded those who reported Christians, even to the point of giving the reported Christians&#39; property directly to informants. For Christians who did not renounce their faith, Aurelius either ordered their execution outright or had them thrown into the Colosseum to be torn apart by fierce beasts.\r<br>\r<br>In 166 A.D., a second great plague struck ancient Rome and lasted 15 years, killing more than 5 million people and taking Aurelius\u2019s life as well. It was recorded in history that, \u201cAs the strength of the body is dissolved, the bowels dissipate in a flow; a fire that begins in the inmost depths burns up into wounds in the throat... the intestines are shaken with continuous vomiting ... the eyes are set on fire from the force of the blood ... as weakness prevails through the failures and losses of the bodies, the gait is crippled or the hearing is blocked or the vision is blinded ...\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Emperor Decius came to power in 249 A.D., when the ancient Roman Empire was already in crisis. Instead of reflecting on the short lives of his predecessors, Decius believed that the lax control over Christians and allowing them to have faith was what led to the decline of the empire. Therefore, Decius made the persecution of Christians his first priority.\r<br>\r<br>In 250 A.D., Decius issued a decree that forced every Roman citizen to renounce his faith in Christ on a chosen day of repentance. Those who refused were imprisoned, killed, enslaved, or had their property confiscated.\r<br>\r<br>In the same year, a third plague hit ancient Rome, this time on a much larger scale. Known as the \u201cCyprian Plague,\u201d it lasted about 20 years and killed 25 million people, making it one of the most serious plagues in human history.\r<br>\r<br>In 303 A.D., then-Emperor Diocletian initiated another brutal persecution of Christians. Churches were destroyed, bibles were seized and destroyed, and missionaries and Christians were slaughtered. In 312 A.D., the plague broke out again in western Rome, and the continuing catastrophe hit the Roman Empire hard.\r<br>\r<br>In 395 A.D., the Empire split into two halves, east and west, and disasters continued. In 476, the Western Roman Empire was destroyed by barbarians. The surviving Eastern Romans, due to years of betrayal to the gods, suffered from overall moral decline, contempt for life, and indulgence in sex, promiscuity, incest, and adultery.\r<br>\r<br>From 541 to 542 AD, the fourth and largest plague of ancient Rome came, known as the \u201cThe Plague of Justinian.\u201d It killed 16,000 people a day at its peak and took the life of Emperor Justinian. This great plague repeated four more times, killing 30-50 million people in total, making it the most serious plague in ancient Roman history.\r<br>\r<br>The continued persecution of Christians was accompanied by repeated plagues. The once-magnificent Roman Empire, with its 120 million people, was wiped out.\r<br>\r<br>In 680 AD, the survivors finally came to their senses and began to condemn the persecution of Christians by those in power and denounce the moral decline of society. The citizens of Rome took to the streets one after another, holding the holy bones of the Christian saint Sebastian in procession, and made a devout confession to God. The awakening of man was finally forgiven by God, and from then on the great plague in the city of Rome disappeared completel", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T04:52:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohit Ahuja", "comment_text": "sold me, not gonna lie", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T04:34:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pronobozo", "comment_text": "action lab", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T04:19:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alf alfa", "comment_text": "kinda disappointing that it&#39;s just an ad", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T04:00:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrJojo2go", "comment_text": "Every time you say &quot;take a look&quot; it activate my Google", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T03:54:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CustomMedia Creations", "comment_text": "Awesome.", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T03:53:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. \u03c0", "comment_text": "Too easy....", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T03:45:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "keepitoveritsthing", "comment_text": "Holy balls!!!", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T03:19:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TacticalIdiot17", "comment_text": "The man is back!!", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T03:09:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PhD Flopper", "comment_text": "who knew that after 2 months... vsauce would come back licking a rubber ball", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T02:56:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HMB HMB", "comment_text": "Does this mean this channels back up again?", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T02:44:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gieven", "comment_text": "Bol", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T02:43:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Henderson", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1CIvcNwnf0&amp;t=0m11s\">0:11</a> Me to my homie", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T02:32:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "13pbarr", "comment_text": "Two different balls the second of which probably has a weight inside", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T02:21:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Levi Doney", "comment_text": "He licked that ball like it bought him dinner first.", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T02:15:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andoni", "comment_text": "Love your videos", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T02:13:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "funny man", "comment_text": "<b>he comes back after 2 months and this is what we get after 2 months</b>", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T01:53:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Choty", "comment_text": "&quot;If you like supporting alzheimers&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T01:51:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "zunkwind", "comment_text": "Remember when you made YouTube videos?", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T01:47:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ish", "comment_text": "Who else got misled by the title?", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T01:30:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KINGNIGHTMARE617", "comment_text": "The way he licks it is just funny...

My sister and I need little assistance, It breaks my heart my heart seeing my only sibling cry for food and I can\u2019t help, she currently has stomach ulcers as a result of constant starvation, We barely eat these days honestly, We don\u2019t even have a safe apartment to lay our head but that 1 can wait\ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude25, food is our biggest challenge right now, I\u2019d be forever grateful if we can get little financial assistance to get some groceries while I continue my search 4 a little job.\ud83d\ude25\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udfff<br><br>Kelechiekeh4@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/wbufz-help-me-save-a-life\">https://www.gofundme.com/f/wbufz-help-me-save-a-life</a>", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T22:48:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grea Blood", "comment_text": "Oh that kind of ball", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T22:36:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Morningstarrss", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T22:23:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PrestonMusic Man", "comment_text": "When will you make another Vsauce video?\ud83e\udd7a\ud83d\ude16", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T22:14:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dost", "comment_text": "But do I get the ball that Michael licked?", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T22:13:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gou Karuma", "comment_text": "It&#39;s an ad.", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T22:08:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Guerrero", "comment_text": "The creepy box contradictorily signal because flower ectrodactyly marry apud a sour print. perpetual, encouraging willow", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T21:54:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "You can\u2019t escape the garf", "comment_text": "2.

O Nasser Mohammad,don\u2019t you know that the dark phase (Muhaq) of the moon of Shabaan will be at the fifth hour and thirty one minutes on Monday at dawn? Surely this is impossible for the middle night of the month of Ramadan for this year of ours 1442 to be after sunset of Sunday which is the night of Monday? This astronomical science of physics is in finest precision the entire scientists of the astronomical of physics do not dispute over it even in one second! And it is an international moment called the central pairing (alignment) for the sun and (Muhaq) moon in dark phase and (Muhaq) dark phase moon for Month of Shaban would never occur except on Monday dawn at the fifth hour and thirty minutes at dawn of Monday in the honored Mecca time, a global moment and not two of the humans dispute over it; which means at two o\u2019clock and thirty-one by the global time (UTC)\u201d.<br><br>Then Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni replies to the entire questioners and I say: I am a witness over this that the crescent of the new month it should not be for it to be born before the central pairing (alignment); because the pairing of the sun with the moon its face is completely dark from glow; it should not be for the sun to overtake the moon, since Allah created the heavens and earth. Confirming with the word of Allah the Most High: {And the moon, We have ordained for it stages till it becomes again as an old Orjoon.(39) Neither it is for the sun to overtake the moon, nor can the night precede the daylight.

That\u2019s because the sun will overtake the moon so the crescent would be born on sunday yet it will set before sunset of Sunday which is the night Monday by the honored Mecca time while it\u2019s just a newly crescent at first of month (Ramadan), yet it is not a crescent of the end of the month (Shaaban). Surely I am not of the ignorant ones and I know that none among the worlds can ever witness the crescent for the first (day) on month of Ramadan after sunset on Sunday which the night of Monday the fore-beginning of Ramadan because crescent of Ramadan will set just before sunset of Sunday which is the night Monday while it is in the state of overtaking, so the sun would meet with it while it\u2019s just a newly crescent at the appointed time to perform (Fajr) dawn prayer at the time of beginning shadow by Honored Mecca time, as for the full-moon rise for the month of Ramadan for this year of yours 1442 so it is after sunset of Sunday which it the night of Monday when the moon would rise as full-moon to the viewers in the entire easts of the worlds after sunset of Sunday which is the night of Monday; night of the middle for month of Ramamdanfor this year of yours 1442 AH it is better than a thousand solar month, indeed the length of the solar month is a thousand month and it\u2019s equivalent to eighty three years and for months of what you count. As for the eighty three years it would end by the end of the month of Ramadan, as for the four months, surely these are the sacred months that will end by the end of Muharram the fourth month of the sacred months and it is itself the twelfth month of the Lunar year.

Drawing upon recent work in psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, human-computer systems, and beyond, Supersizing the Mind offers both a tour of the emerging cognitive landscape and a sustained argument in favor of a conception of mind that is extended rather than &quot;brain-bound.&quot; The importance of this new perspective is profound.
