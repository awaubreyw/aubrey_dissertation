She can feel water temperatures, pain, she reacts to bright things like the sun even though she can&#39;t see. She sleeps and she is awake a lot of the time. She makes noises that reflect how she&#39;s doing, so say her tummy hurts she will whine a lot, she will smile at certain things like warm water or when she is around other people, ect. Now none of this means that she can see, feel, move, or have emotions, but there is a certain aspect about her that is hard to study because of how rare she is.

Uh, I wanted to record a message for you to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I&#39;m finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, but I&#39;m here to tell you there&#39;s nothing to worry about. Uh, you&#39;ll do fine. So, let&#39;s just focus on getting you through your first week. Okay?<br>Uh, let&#39;s see, first there&#39;s an introductory greeting from the company that I&#39;m supposed to read. Uh, it&#39;s kind of a legal thing, you know. Um, &quot;Welcome to Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza. A magical place for kids and grown-ups alike, where fantasy and fun come to life. Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for damage to property or person. Upon discovering that damage or death has occurred, a missing person report will be filed within 90 days, or as soon property and premises have been thoroughly cleaned and bleached, and the carpets have been replaced.&quot;<br><br>Blah blah blah, now that might sound bad, I know, but there&#39;s really nothing to worry about. Uh, the animatronic characters here do get a bit quirky at night, but do I blame them? No. If I were forced to sing those same stupid songs for twenty years and I never got a bath? I&#39;d probably be a bit irritable at night too. So, remember, these characters hold a special place in the hearts of children and we need to show them a little respect, right? Okay.<br><br>So, just be aware, the characters do tend to wander a bit. Uh, they&#39;re left in some kind of free roaming mode at night. Uh...Something about their servos locking up if they get turned off for too long. Uh, they used to be allowed to walk around during the day too. But then there was The Bite of &#39;87. Yeah. I-It&#39;s amazing that the human body can live without the frontal lobe, you know?<br><br>Uh, now concerning your safety, the only real risk to you as a night watchman here, if any, is the fact that these characters, uh, if they happen to see you after hours probably won&#39;t recognize you as a person. They&#39;ll pr- they&#39;ll most likely see you as a metal endoskeleton without its costume on. Now since that&#39;s against the rules here at Freddy Fazbear&#39;s Pizza, they&#39;ll probably try to...forcefully stuff you inside a Freddy Fazbear suit. Um, now, that wouldn&#39;t be so bad if the suits themselves weren&#39;t filled with crossbeams, wires, and animatronic devices, especially around the facial area. So, you could imagine how having your head forcefully pressed inside one of those could cause a bit of discomfort...and death. Uh, the only parts of you that would likely see the light of day again would be your eyeballs and teeth when they pop out the front of the mask, heh.<br><br>Y-Yeah, they don&#39;t tell you these things when you sign up. But hey, first day should be a breeze. I&#39;ll chat with you tomorrow. Uh, check those cameras, and remember to close the doors only if absolutely necessary. Gotta conserve power.

Commonly, people refer to the mind as more of a non-physical \u201cplace\u201d in which feelings and opinions are taken into account and where we speak to ourselves within and such, while the brain is purely mechanical and functions for the sake of keeping our bodies up and running. <br>We know that the brain controls our bodies (and, seemingly US, too), and therefore does what it pleases. But when we think of doing something bodily, we process it in our mind to make the decision; we have clear intentions of doing something, but at times these things don\u2019t go as planned. Here\u2019s and example I borrowed from a book: You awake one morning with the desire of, say, copulating with another.. so you do. But during the process, you realize you\u2019ve become impotent. <br>Did the body make the choice or did the mind? Did the brain intrude your sexual life just because it felt like doing so?

God bless, share the gospel and put God first. i hope you have a nice week. Jesus isn&#39;t just someone who is divine, full of grace, and someone who can free you of all sin and death. He can also free you of depression, tears, sadness, and of a life that isn&#39;t great or fulfilling. I have found that in Christ, a happy, fulfilling, holy, and a better life. Many others have as well,  and I hope you do too. Jesus loves you so much that He died for you on the cross, taking your sin and death that once was hard to take back. Jesus forgives you of your sins and helps you to repent, and leads you into salvation which is given by the cross to accept the reward of Heaven, Jesus&#39;s Kingdom. We cannot earn it nor work for it, if you believe in the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, you will be saved. To be saved means to be saved from God himself, God&#39;s wrath lies on those who do not believe and rebel, joining the world in its evil deeds and practices. Jesus rose from the dead, showing the people that if He could conquer death, you can too. Heaven is where you conquer death. True salvation requires sacrifice, but in the end it is worth it. A life is never the same when Jesus impacts it. We are punishable by death by sin, but if you would say to the Lord, &quot;forgive me, help me to repent and sin no more and live a life for you&quot; we would do better, be better, and repent and be saved by Jesus Himself. Jesus is King, and &quot;I can do all things with Christ who strengthens me.&quot; -Phil <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3teflb1QNN4&amp;t=4m13s\">4:13</a>. God bless you.

40 miles per hour but nerve impulses are really quick they can clock in at 250 miles per hour but sometimes thats not even fast enoughFor instance if you accidentally put your hand on a hot stove cells are dying quickly and 250 mph doesnt cut it you need to take an action fast its not worth it to tell your brain whats happenig right away and so instead your immediate reaction to pull away is mediated by other parts of your nervous system the same can be said for involuntary and unconcious processes for instance cardiac muscle is self exciting (unlike skeletal muscle which requires nervous system stimuli so in a way these unconcious involuntary or reflexive behaviors could be considered no-brainers but im not quite satisfied yet because they still require that your brain be there keeping you alive so what if you werent alive well in your dead brainless body your muscle cells still contain of energy in the form of ATP backyard brains right here on youtube deomstrates this with insect parts this leg is no longer connected to a brain or a body but energy remains in the cells and so researchers can detect electrical signals when the leg is touched or even simply breathed on the muscle cells of a human limb would respond in just the same way but you dont need wires to observe behavior like this salt can also do the trick the introduction of sodium ions can cause a process similar to an action potential in a living animal salt added to these fresh frog legs makes them dance though not for very long the cells will eventually run out of energy or simply decay but to be sure there are many other brief candidates for no brainers at the moment of death for example muscles relaxing causing a person to soil themselves technically a no brainer but its a misconception that a corpse contin ues to grow fingernails and hair instead its actually the skin itself sinking as it dries making hair and nails appear longer but lets tawke a closer look at these skin cells because we might be on to quite a satisfactory no brainer your skin cells live on the periphery of your body and they dont require a constant stream of new nutrients from your blood and even though your dead and your brain is no longer calling the shots your skin cells can continue to live gathering nutrients from osmosis and dividing for days infact you can harvest skin cells from a coorpse after 24 gours on a related note digestion sure a lot of the digestive processes completed by you being alive and having a nervous system that works but part of the work is done by bacteria that just haappens to live inside your gut and when your dead or when your brean is gone they will continue digesting so in a way making poop at least part of that process is a no brainer but heres the thing these bacteria that liveinside you are foreign bacteria are they you for that matter what about hte skin cells that can continue to live after your dead are they you or are they merely cells that you have made a good home for we&#39;re getting pretty philosophical here becuase were basically asking ifr you are merely your brain and everything else that goes on when you no longer have one is just other stuff that you arent doing You could argue that without a brain your body no longer has your intentions it no longer does things because you have decided to do them in other words a no brainer may be impossible for you to do because it requires not using you if you are merely what your brain does and not what your cells do off on their own when the brain is gone then in a way being you being alive is a yes brainerAnother great yes brainer is checking out vsauce 3 you can find some scientific video game analysis some gamer lut and some pretty cool apps to download go check that out and as always thanks for watching", "comment_date": "2019-11-21T00:49:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "konstak05", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3teflb1QNN4&amp;t=0m21s\">0:21</a> what is this?

Thinking is more interesting than digesting, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the cells responsible for the first should be more you than the ones responsible for the latter. If we think that, it is only because we identify more with our consciousness,  and that process of identifying with our consciousness, in essence, is just brain activity, it is philosophy but does not have any grasp on material reality. In reality there is nothing special in our brain cells that make them more us than our digestion bacteria. If you go down to the bottom of it, then, your identity, your impression of being one specific being, distinct from other things that are not you can just be considered to be an illusion.

But she lived quite well, without having much of a problem regarding the motor nerves and motor learning, or even balancing her body, the work done by the cerebellum. Amazed yet? You should be!! Cuz if u haven&#39;t you will get shocked <b>(to death)</b> if I tell you that a person of unknown origin (actually <b>I</b> don&#39;t remember his origin) was born with, <b>NO-BRAIN!</b> . Well, not literally, he was born without cerebellum, cerebrum, medulla, pituary gland, fore-brain, mid-brain, hind-brain. All that was left was the membrane-like structure that was kind-of stick to the skull, which literally did all the work that more than 1 billion neuron cells are needed to do. That &quot;membrane&quot; was merely having hundred thousand to a million neurons... You might be wondering that I made all of that up to catch your attention. But I haven&#39;t. This is a property of brain called brain plasticity, where the brain has the capability to compensate for the changes in the environment and the body- which  some people like these possess a lot. <br><br><br>EDIT: I do not take responsibility of the content I just wrote. I saw it on the DNews channel of YouTube. You can watch the video yourself by searching in &quot; what happens if we don&#39;t have cerebellum&quot; or something like that.

By the time your hand is half the way to the fly, the fly is already flying because the eye connection to the brain in the fly is so short that he is seeing your hand in slow motion. Interesting is that we can out smart the fly every time. Knowing that a fly can&#39;t fly backwards and flying to the sides is difficult and slow, we only have to pick a spot about 4 inches in front of the fly to hit and you can swat the fly nearly every time !

Thus it is at least mysterious, since I don&#39;t know what I said. Then I woke up.

The Japanese commander told them to behead him first, and he would run past his comrades in line next to him carrying his own severed head. The number of his own soldiers he passed while running would be spared. Laughing, the Chinese soldiers agreed, thinking this would be an unachievable feat. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 To their surprise and astonishment, the japanese commander completed the run of roughly 20 feet(6 meters), the story goes, and he saved the lives of his fellow soldiers.

A cockroach can get along without its head because its &quot;brain&quot; is spread throughout its body. So it&#39;s &quot;brain&quot; can function its body at least until it dies of starvation. The circuit is NOT broken. Obviously a Human body can not function when that circuit is broken.<br><br>That said, there are parts of the super organism that can function separate of the rest of the super organism that is being functioned by the brain. Bacteria processing bodily waste, outer skin cells adapted to survive on the outside of the super organism, and so on. These do not need a brain but do need the rest of the body to to function at some level to continue to function themselves.<br><br>Technically there is such a thing as &quot;no brainer&quot; however that only applies to any function that does not require actual thought or coordinated nervous response.
