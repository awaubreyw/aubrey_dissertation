If you imagine your kindle as an electronic part, a resistor for example, that is connected to the battery, the electrons just float from the battery&#39;s negatively charged part to the positively charged part until both parts are in balance. When you then recharge it, the power&#39;S source is like another big battery, that attracts the electrons in the previously positively charged part and empties it, while the previously negatively charged part is filled up again. So even recharging it doesn&#39;t make it heavier... In theory. By using your kindle, some parts emit light or heat up or are loosing electrons for something different, so it actually becomes lighter by using it and becomes heavier recharging it.

When powering a circuit (say the charge cycle on your Kindle), you are pushing electrons onto one side of the battery, but removing the same number from the other. Therefore, the device is the same weight before and after. Similarly,we can download GADSBY via WIFI, which has no direct electrical connection and therefore must conserve electrons, which means conserved weight.\n\nI don&#39;t believe this.", "comment_date": "2013-01-08T03:57:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Synikal", "comment_text": "The Great Gatsby clearly has the letter E in almost every sentence.", "comment_date": "2013-01-08T03:54:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suvesia", "comment_text": "you dropped that delicious strawberry...", "comment_date": "2013-01-08T03:24:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Delayed Reality", "comment_text": "I think my mind rebooted", "comment_date": "2013-01-08T03:06:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sushiluv1994", "comment_text": "I am lost.", "comment_date": "2013-01-08T00:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "giuinktse7", "comment_text": "No, you would not have created mass.

If you put an electron in a flash cell the electrical field would cause the same the same positive charge to be stored on the opposing side of the capacitor. The positive charge is the lack of an electron. \n\nHence, putting an electron in a flash device makes an electron leave the device.
