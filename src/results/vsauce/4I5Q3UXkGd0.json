Whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. He is calling us to repent, turn from sin (lying, stealing, lust, hate persons, breaking God&#39;s laws), and turn towards God. God will give a person a new heart when he repents and God will give His Holy Spirit when you ask for it and help you live a holy life. God warns people to turn from sin. Jesus unless we repent we will likewise perish, and the place where people perish would be hell and the lake of fire, but God is not willing that any should perish, but that all come to repentance. Please, repent and believe in Jesus Christ and put your faith in Him and He will never leave you nor forsake you. Pray you to have a wonderful and peaceful and blessed day and the Holy Spirit will lead you into all truth and keep you protected and lead to safety, and if you are sick or are suffering from pain, I command the sickness and pain to go and speak life in your body, soul and spirit, in the Name of Jesus, all glory and honor to Him alone, praise Him and thank Him, Hallleu Yah!

Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on this earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there are only a few cms of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water.<br>-<br>WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don&#39;t try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years.<br>-<br>DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early &#39;90s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don&#39;t know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick. + TRUTH about COVID-19 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_vNWmqWmZc</a> <br>-<br>Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium-size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both sizes of cogs + threads having to have meshed correctly?<br>-<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once.<br>-<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current.<br>-<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full-wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junkyard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full-wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor.<br>-<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING. This website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000s as a Vision of a 10-speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ <a href=\"http://free-energy.yolasite.com/\">http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity.<br>-<br>This is a diagram <a href=\"https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php\">https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php</a> that looks a lot like the wiring of this former \u201cscience experiment\u201d YouTube video if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of overcharging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology<br>-<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages. Or even better, convince the government to start generating it for us, getting rid of the pollution that we put into the air, and the radioactive stuff completely.<br>-<br>Have you ever heard of the MANDELA Effect?

I did the Calculations myuself, using a much more basic thought process, I established that our eyes TOTAL view(As in the total area) on a monitor or rather as a resoloution is 32k, Granted, our eyes dont see in a perfect rectangle, nor in pixels, nor are our eyes digital, but including this information in mind while the total viewing area of our eyes maybe 32k, peripheral vision as in the area that your eye can see at one time(not the total area) would be close to 16k, because we don&#39;t see the entire 32k area, our eyes are not that big(Anime Eyes are unrealistic), so 16k TECHNICALLY, would be the resoloution of our eyes , but then i factor in what you are stating, while our eyes have a periphial vision of 16k, most of that is blured out in favour of the things your immediately focusing on, which would be close to 8k in resolution, but one needs to take into account that i have been accounting for 2 eyes, not 1 eyes, so on a more realistic level 4k is the imediate resoloution of 1 eye, 8k is the total periphial vision of one eyye and 16k is the total viewable area of one eye. In conclusion while 8k Monitors ARE starting to become a thing, there is no real need for one, a 4k 60 hertz monitor ensures you will see the most detail with very little bottlenecks, but hey, I&#39;m keeping things unbelivably simple.", "comment_date": "2018-11-01T00:32:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Electric", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0&amp;t=4m41s\">4:41</a>\r<br>&quot;meat generated imagery&quot; \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2018-10-31T20:23:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vlad Mihai", "comment_text": "Guys help i can&#39;t unsee my nose now", "comment_date": "2018-10-31T18:12:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lekgolo", "comment_text": "So, basically, the video is bullshit.", "comment_date": "2018-10-30T17:48:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yw1971", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0&amp;t=7m33s\">7:33</a> there is Photographic memory.

Really to avoid any artefacting and too-obvious pixellation at all from super-close-up, you&#39;d want 8k SuperHiVision at that screen size (a resolution that&#39;s estimated as being about equal to what your eye can resolve in total, or in fact far more so as you only need that rez across your central retina region, but the screen itself has to extend across your entire field of view and be ready to show full quality if you shift your focus and where your eyes are pointing at any part of itself... ie, 8k should give &quot;retina&quot; rez on the whole of a curved screen, within the POV angle allowed by your eyesockets without your head turning), but from any normal viewing distance 1080p is just fine, and if you wanted to use it as a digital whiteboard or other kind of interactive display, 4k would do the job.<br><br>NB, isn&#39;t the &quot;spatial resolution&quot; bit and the amount of light better described as lens focus, and shutter aperture?", "comment_date": "2018-03-15T19:30:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harsh Verma", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0&amp;t=3m05s\">3:05</a><br> Now I just can&#39;t stop noticing my nose.", "comment_date": "2018-03-15T11:58:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evancraft53", "comment_text": "2018?", "comment_date": "2018-03-14T16:01:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bernoulli", "comment_text": "How many frames per second does the eye had?", "comment_date": "2018-03-14T03:53:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "This Ugly Chicken", "comment_text": "<b>blu-ray</b><br><br><br><br><br><b><i>IMAX?!?!?!</i></b>", "comment_date": "2018-03-14T01:05:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aman Singh Bhadauria", "comment_text": "Gulabi aankhein \ud83d\udd25\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf3\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2018-03-13T12:37:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manpreet Brar", "comment_text": "I see with 100k", "comment_date": "2018-03-13T11:22:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JayZ z", "comment_text": "I see the world in 9999K", "comment_date": "2018-03-13T09:39:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GlorbGuy", "comment_text": "Do you live in London England or London canada", "comment_date": "2018-03-12T13:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "boliussa", "comment_text": "nasty presentation", "comment_date": "2018-03-12T10:35:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Damian K", "comment_text": "144p of course", "comment_date": "2018-03-12T08:22:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lt.Dan", "comment_text": "How did he get inside the White House gates isn&#39;t that off limits to the public", "comment_date": "2018-03-12T06:26:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ThatWTFGuy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0&amp;t=4m02s\">4:02</a> - MIND...

I keep telling astronomer programs to take sidereal years and convert to tropical instead of tropical converted to sidereal. Earth axis precesses, not the stars. The loss can be proven by converting back and forth and watch the numbers change. It&#39;s like a YouTube jump thru Wonder Woman which eventually always gets you into the porn. It is also like Google translating where from english HOUSE to Turkish supposed equivalent can be translated back and it is no longer a HOUSE it&#39;s a garage, then take the new word garage back to Turkish and it changes, and the turkish word back to english and you have a store. Math is the same way where the extended infinitesimal decimals bring error into it. Thus there is more error from tropical to sidereal conversion than sidereal to tropical. Yet these programmers stay traditional method instead of making the less erring method. Most scholars do not know THE FACTOR OF ONE as i will call it in all cycles. You must find THE FACTOR OF ONE to find the true decimal of a cycle. Whether 366.2422 rotations are 365.2422 seasonal year, or 366.2425 rotations are 365.2425 Gregorian years, or 366.256 rotations are 365.256 sidereal years, etc. This factor is in Mars synodic to Mars sidereal, and Venus synodic to Venus sidereal, always THE FACTOR OF ONE or your math figures are wrong. With this method you can extend the decimal to 1000s of places, and even correct the most advanced pi of someone you think is so smart no one questions his current pi because when you do not understand a genius you presume and suppose he is correct and true. People fail to use the test locks, the verification formulas in all things.

If you&#39;ve ever experienced a concussion or have fallen to sleep only to be woken up with the sense that you never actually fell to sleep, that you were essentially robbed of those hours of rest, then you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m talking about.<br><br>If, after I die, the only consciousness I have to perceive existence is gone then to me there would be no difference between the loss of consciousness and the end of the universe.  The same is true for you, if conscious experience does indeed end.<br><br>For this reason I find that ending a plot by killing the viewpoint character or characters is a cheap means to an end, it would do just as well to suck the entire universe into a black hole to end your movie and say, &quot;Everybody&#39;s dead!&quot;<br><br>I absolutely love Darren Aronofsky&#39;s Requiem For A Dream but I loathe his Black Swan for this very reason.  Falling action in a story brings in an acceptable amount of irresolution.<br><br>Horror authors Edgar Allen Poe and H.P. Lovecraft often didn&#39;t understand this principle and, for shock value, would end on a punchline the same way a joke does.  I can&#39;t help but laugh when this happens no matter how horrifying the tale.  I laughed at the end of Black Swan for the same reason---not because I&#39;m irreverent, but because it&#39;s structured the same way a joke is.  A joke with action after the punchline has been delivered is no longer funny.<br><br>Poe&#39;s Black Cat is my favorite story of his for sheer visceral disgust and horror---it&#39;s very well written.  Except for the end, which says, &quot;I had walled the monster up within the tomb!&quot;  What sort of ending is that?  The viewpoint character isn&#39;t dead, but once the big question is resolved it&#39;s like Poe just quit, there is no acceptable falling action and I can&#39;t help but hear a &#39;Badum ching!!&quot; as though Poe were telling a bad joke at a comedy club.  The Tell-Tale Heart is similar in its ending.<br><br>But his Cask of Amontillado is perhaps my favorite just in terms of form.  Here&#39;s the ending to that, &quot;For the half a century no mortal has disturbed them.  In pace requiescat!&quot;  Now that&#39;s an ending.  It brings acceptable, rather than unacceptable, irresolution.  It goes beyond answering the main question, &quot;How is the viewpoint character going to get vengeance and will they succeed.&quot;<br><br>I like H. P. Lovecraft&#39;s &quot;The Music Of Erich Zann&quot; best of all because of the fairy tale like quality the story brings us into an absurd universe and then transports us back into the &quot;real&quot; world in the same manner.  It is quite unlike his other work and I wonder if he was even the original author. <br><br>Acceptable irresolution of a story takes us a step beyond the main conceit and leaves it behind creating a trail of new and unanswered, but not main, questions.  Falling action in The Black Cat and Telltale Heart would see the viewpoint characters being taken into custody (or resisting arrest or any of an infinite number of other things) and those trails don&#39;t have to be resolved because the main draw of the story, or joke, has been understood and resolved.  An amount of irresolution is always needed.  Which is why existence on this plane is so maddening and understood to be a joke.  There is no trail, presumably, no acceptable irresolution taking us into the future.

Dreams are an amalgamation of several thousands of different memory sequences,  while you are dreaming your brain is processing a great deal of data and organizing it, removing broken memories (memories that are corrupted and unreadable) and organizing knowledge. <br><br>In a sense, your subconscious is your automatic brain, and your conscious is your self controlled brain. When you sleep; your conscious self is in line with your subconscious mind which allows you (your brain) to see everything it needs to organize in a graphical representation of your current self world. <br><br>So; what you see with your eyes, is recreated in your brain via neural bursts of energy and chemical sensations, and stored in areas of your brain for later use, your brain then slips into sleep mode, and runs a defrag in order to optimize memory and knowledge, removing useless memories that it no longer needs, and reorganizing your knowledge and thoughts from prior days as either destroy or file.<br><br>if you were able to quantify that fragmented data and create a digital image format of it, much of the information would look like of a huge impossible puzzle; it take someone probably (my best guess) 30 years to put all that information into an actually decipherable visual form. <br><br><br>Now that brings me to my final thought on this Vsauce episode from way back when the difference in the architecture of your brain and the architecture of your computer is your brain runs on a data system of (around my best guess) 10 <del>&gt; 1000+ on a quantum scale and your computer runs a binary system of 0</del>&gt;100 on a binary scale.<br><br>and that&#39;s my bullshit science for you; sources are &quot;Discovery magazine, Popular Science, and Time Magazines pieces on your brain vs your computer, Discovery Specials, and old curiosity like shows from the 90&#39;s.<br><br>Information is highly outdated, and often used and misunderstood, but offers the best analogy between the mind of the human and the mind of a computer.", "comment_date": "2016-12-13T05:07:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lloyd isaiah lashawn family", "comment_text": "please explain the pendulum effect. @vsauce", "comment_date": "2016-12-13T01:49:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlueCassio", "comment_text": "How did you get in the White House lawn?

Unable to give me a definitive answer my professor challenged me to find out and return to our next lecture with the answer, he suggested that my best bet would be asking a digital engineering expert. So after tracking down and scheduling an appointment to meet, the digital engineering expert I&#39;d met up with at a local production company was disappointed to inform me that he did not know the answer. At the conclusion of our meeting the expert referred me to and set me up an appointment with his friend, who also happened to be an optometrist, in order to get to the bottom of this question. With dwindling hope I met with the optometrist during his lunch break, but once again I was told that he could not answer my question. <br>On the day of my next film production lecture I felt like a complete let down for having to run all around town, yet still failing to discover an answer that I could report back to my class and professor. With just about fifteen minutes remaining before class I made a last ditch effort by scouring YouTube, which then led me to watching this Vsauce video. As soon as class commenced my professor instantly put me on the spot about whether or not I followed through on finding an answer to my question. At this opportunity I stood up and gave a presentation for the entire hour and thirty minutes by reenacting the entire lesson this video imparted upon me, along with a lot of bullshitting about the hard work and research that went into me concluding this information.<br>So all-in-all I appreciate the fact that I have the ability to ponder such vague and complex questions, but after a few search inquiries I can come across a short video that explains everything I wanted to know with relatively no effort.<br>Good ol&#39; technology :)", "comment_date": "2016-03-11T07:59:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Madhousegaming 7", "comment_text": "love giving ur vids the thumbs down and telling people to unsubscribe hahahahha just because i can. \u263a", "comment_date": "2016-03-11T05:12:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YeahRightBear", "comment_text": "Other side of the fence at the white house", "comment_date": "2016-03-11T04:09:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tori L", "comment_text": "so many tabs!", "comment_date": "2016-03-10T04:22:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tot", "comment_text": "What would you do if you saw Michael on the street?", "comment_date": "2016-03-08T23:40:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "21EC", "comment_text": "so the human eye resolution is about 24000x24000 res not bad cool.", "comment_date": "2016-03-08T23:13:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Knocking Guy", "comment_text": "I like to knock on things.

None of those things describe resolution.  Resolution is the number of pixels within a display or image sensor.  That&#39;s it.  The size of the sensor has nothing to do with resolution, but it does have something to do with a &quot;cropping&quot; factor as well as how sensitive it is to light (a larger sensor with the same resolution as a smaller sensor will be more sensitive to light).  Amount of light is not a determining factor in resolution, nor is what the millions of pixels are encoding, and how close the subject is also has nothing to do with resolution either... (unless you are speaking in terms of the discernible detail of the subject within the shot , in that case, the closer the subject is, the more detail you&#39;ll be able to see, but the less of the entire subject you&#39;ll be able to see as well).  Finally, you said something true; that at a far enough distance, the detail between different resolutions become indiscernible.  Beyond that, you speak of things for which I know nothing about.  I really don&#39;t understand why you said some of those things though, because they simply are not true.

One key idea left undisclosed that I wanted to cover was this:<br><br>Suppose you want to capture a single spherical 360\u00b0 snapshot photo and preview it using a virtual reality headset that has a pixel density so high that you can\u2019t distinguish the pixels from each other. The pixel density of that ideal headset covering your entire field of vision was discussed already on this video (approx. 576 megapixels). But how many pixels would that spherical photo need to have?<br><br>This is actually relatively simple mathematics. Let\u2019s use those Roger N. Clark\u2019s calculations as a starting point. He calculated the pixel spacing of the human visual acuity to be 0.3 arc-minutes. Since one full circle contains 360 degrees and each degree contains 60 arc minutes, we can calculate that one full circle of pixels contains 360*60/0.3 = 72 000 pixels. From this figure, we can now calculate the surface area of the sphere. The (theoretical) radius of this sphere is 72 000 pixels / (2 * \u03c0), so the surface area is 4 * \u03c0 * (72 000 pixels / (2 * \u03c0)) \u00b2. This gives us a grand total of 1 650 118 450 pixels, or 1 650 megapixels. There\u2019s our answer!<br><br>In those 1 650 megapixels of image data, we would probably reserve one byte (eight bits) of information for each three color channels (red, green &amp; blue), so one raw photo would eat up 4,95 gigabytes of disk space. Almost 5 gigabytes, and that\u2019s just one spherical picture. Suppose you wanted to capture video with this standard, at least 60 frames per second would seem like the way to go. That\u2019s 297 gigabytes of information per second.<br><br>Now think about it: it would require this enormous amount of data just to store one single fleeting moment in time, from a single point in space. Meanwhile, you\u2019re surrounded by data like this around you all the time. It\u2019s just, I\u2019d say it really gives you\u2026 perspective.", "comment_date": "2015-10-01T14:49:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BSTAR BSTAR", "comment_text": "thin hair XD", "comment_date": "2015-09-30T22:04:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MisterFriki", "comment_text": "you are amazing.", "comment_date": "2015-09-30T01:36:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mattmanwow", "comment_text": "You should be a politician because yo go off topic from the actual question so easily its somehow awesome.", "comment_date": "2015-09-29T20:11:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheLouisXXI", "comment_text": "Ok for me the blind spot is everything to the right of me I can&#39;t see out of my right eye", "comment_date": "2015-09-28T17:45:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ard0", "comment_text": "Tooks puid ka t\u00e4na v\u00f5i?    -Kaido", "comment_date": "2015-09-28T15:45:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "X", "comment_text": "lol, &quot;thin hair&quot;", "comment_date": "2015-09-28T00:56:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G\u00e1bor Moln\u00e1r", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0&amp;t=0m20s\">0:20</a><br>POO IN LOO<br>O<br>O<br><br>I<br>N<br><br>L<br>O<br>O", "comment_date": "2015-09-27T20:24:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kirdell Suraz", "comment_text": "thats crap he sais that theirs no evidence of photographic memory in the human brain so please tell me how do i remember what my first remote control car look like and the color ? and that was 19 years back ?", "comment_date": "2015-09-26T23:26:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Szabolcs Horv\u00e1th", "comment_text": "If you are interested 576 megapixels is 32000*18000 on a 16:9 ratio ;)", "comment_date": "2015-09-26T18:16:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Monkey King", "comment_text": "I haven&#39;t been able to have a good lunch in a long time, and now that it is Saturday, and I am watching VSauce, and eating a decent meal, I can confirm my life has been completed.", "comment_date": "2015-09-26T16:44:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hugh Jass", "comment_text": "These videos always end with the meaning of life", "comment_date": "2015-09-26T13:30:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arjun singh", "comment_text": "&quot;But is real life a movie?&quot; -&gt; And here he goes!", "comment_date": "2015-09-26T12:58:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MC", "comment_text": "so basically if we can actually print a picture that our eye saw then it would have a little blank space in it, well that&#39;s crappy.", "comment_date": "2015-09-26T08:07:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dann Quest", "comment_text": "Can someone tell me the res of\u00a0the eye, I don&#39;t want to watch the whole vid", "comment_date": "2015-09-25T20:25:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karolina F\u0105frowicz", "comment_text": "thank u for telling slowly, because i can understand you.

I am just wondering: how many microns is the smallest object that the unassisted human eye can see? You describe the resolution of the eye in camera terms only. On the beach last month (August), I noticed that the dry sand sparkled in the Sun, when the Sun is at about 20\u00b0-30\u00b0 high in the sky and viewed from a certain obtuse angle towards the Sun. I got my pocket microscope out and saw tiny crystals of orange silicates, grey limestones shards, and the clear quartz &quot;gemstones&quot; that was refracting the sunlight causing the sparkles. Quite beautiful in the microscope. The smallest sand particles are said to be about 600 microns small (600/1000th of a mm or 2/3 mm), and I could easily resolve them with my very sharp eyes unassisted. Maybe one micron is too small for any human eye to see? So somewhere between 1-600 microns? Hope that this is an interesting question. Thank you. Agape.

In it, he addresses that during funerals people like to either sum up the deceased&#39;s life either as a sequence of all their failures, or as a near-deified version of the deceased&#39;s life. Usually the latter. He set out in writing his book, Speaker for the Dead, with the idea that during the final end of a person&#39;s life, the only true way to give that person a perfect resolution, a perfect story, is by telling the <i>whole</i> story, all the triumphs, all the failures, all the times of piece, all the inner struggles and strife and conflict and yet all the beauty and little moments of perfection that ultimately culminated in that person&#39;s complete life. Their complete story. So, in an essence, only through true looks at a person&#39;s complete story at the final end of their existance can anyone around them fully realize the size and scope and beauty of the film that would be their life.<br><br>Films such as &quot;Jobs&quot; and &quot;The Social Network&quot; (though not so much on the latter seeing as how the subject isn&#39;t exactly dead!) have done a pretty decent job at looking at both the inner vision and the inner demons of their subjects.

Is there any possible way of finding a mass to temperature changes alone? and given the properties it applies to matter, that being hot air\u00a0rises and cold air sinks etc.\u00a0maybe theres a\u00a0correlation reasonable\u00a0for a brief estimate as to what the MASS of temperature could somewhat look like...

Well... What if there was no previous knowledge?<br>Say, someone invented a teleporter that could teleport you anywhere you wanted to go... How would your brain respond when you got there? (For this example, we&#39;re presuming that the teleporter works both absolutely accurately, so no worries about &quot;mistranslation errors&quot;, and instantaneously). Would you, for a moment, only be able to see a small cone directly in front of you? Would your brain fill in the missing information with random data (perhaps causing kind of a visual &quot;static&quot;)?<br>My guess is that you would just feel extremely disoriented for a moment, and your vision would be extremely blurry for a few seconds, until the brain gathered enough information to put together an actual image... But, maybe there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing, and even if not, it just seems like an interesting question...

Keep em coming!<br>BUT, a point missed here is retinal processing. In the fovea, photoreceptors are crammed close together. However, the resolution of these light receptors - if they were pixels - would still give poorish vision, probably about the minimum driving standard of 6/12. The reason that retinal cones give better than mathematically expected resolution is due to interneuronal processing. You get effects like edge enhancement using summation and suppression of adjacent receptors. Nystagmus (trembling) comes into play and is reminiscent of digital &quot;dithering&quot; which improves audio resolution.", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T15:24:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colton Gardner", "comment_text": "You should make a video about how small things can get.", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T15:17:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ambuj Yadav", "comment_text": "You rocked in Mumbai man....plz next time come to New Delhi too... :)", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T15:10:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZethesTheGamer", "comment_text": "I saw something that said if my eye was a camera it&#39;d have 547 Megapixels", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T15:03:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crafty Prop", "comment_text": "cur leng.", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T14:47:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Gordon", "comment_text": "What if we all sung at once?", "comment_date": "2014-03-13T14:38:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Moses Kaldor", "comment_text": "Good job on the white house.

For example, I was talking with my friends one day, and one of my friends said something, to which all of us laughed, and then my friend turned and kicked me and called me a certain racial stereotype. After this, I stopped in my tracks, having a conscience of consciousness moment, ( Where you realize that you are a human being, with a mind and free will, these often come when you stare at an empty wall for too long.) I don&#39;t know what this is all about, but I think it comes from my brain taking all of it&#39;s past experiences and compiling them into a logically probable &quot;prediction&quot; for lack of a better word, of what the day to come will be like, as I noticed that these come most often after a monotonous, boring day.

Dont stress yourself, just relax and keep staring, do not move your eyes in the slightest, but its normal if they start to close a bit. Sooner or later the image will start to fade away, and whenever you move your eyes slightly (at that point it almost has to happen as the point you were fixated on also faded away) you will suddenly see very strong outlines between any 2 surfaces with significant color difference, similar to a sharpening effect used in image editing programs, and TVs.\u00a0<br>Basically the entire field of view gets so still that the brain tries to filter out everything that stands still, much like it filters out glasses, hair or your nose, which are also just fixed things in your view. That filtering basicaly works by putting a negative of the image you see over your perceptive view so they cancel each other out. But when you slightly move your eyes the image you see and the negative that is supposed to cancel it out dont match anymore and you see these outlines around stuff, because along those outlines the colors dont cancel each other out but instead even add up, while, if you really moved your eyes slightly, the larger surfaces remain largely invisible.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:38:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amiee", "comment_text": "Does he have a degree, if so what in? \u00a0He&#39;s so smart<br>", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:38:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tri Biz", "comment_text": "300 and under club", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:38:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PrimyFritzellz", "comment_text": "the vid wasnt really worth the 3 week wait..", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:38:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AllOfTheHats", "comment_text": "1337th comment", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:38:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fangirl Lili", "comment_text": "ON TIME FOR MY BIRTHDAY. \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18 I MISSED YOU, MICHAEL.<br>", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:38:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mistermystery", "comment_text": "I have been wondering this!", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:38:04Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "jakethekillerz", "comment_text": "See PC gamers 1080p doesnt matter cause our eyes cannot see it.", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:37:53Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sean Tanabe", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4I5Q3UXkGd0&amp;t=5m20s\">5:20</a> look at those tabs", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:37:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VirginEarlyBird", "comment_text": "thumbs up if you did a double thumbs up!", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:37:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Saran", "comment_text": "just eye, not eyes.. how if eyes", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:37:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saul W", "comment_text": "lets goooooooooooo vsauce", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:37:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nareehs", "comment_text": "I would say mine is 144p on a good day.", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:36:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viva la Albe", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not myopic..i make bokeh video with my eyes!", "comment_date": "2014-03-11T01:36:43Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Cole Ragsdale", "comment_text": "U kinda of messed me up with the videos u make.
