So the word &quot;viisaus&quot; has basically the same origin as the English word &quot;wisdom&quot;, and same goes for &quot;viisas&quot; and &quot;wise&quot;. <br><br>But also, it has the same origin as all the other words in Indo-European languages which come from the Indo-European root (which was related to both knowing and seeing) from which this Germanic root comes. <br><br>This includes &quot;wit&quot;, of course, but also the Latin root related to seeing, so : in English, the words &quot;visible&quot;, &quot;vision&quot;, &quot;video&quot;, and many other words, the Romance words for &quot;to see&quot; : Italian &quot;vedere&quot;, Spanish and Portuguese &quot;ver&quot;, French &quot;voir&quot; (past participle -&gt; vu, from which the noun &quot;vue&quot;, from which English &quot;view&quot;), Romanian &quot;vedea&quot;, etc.<br><br>It also includes Ancient Greek \u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u1fb1, which &quot;idea&quot; comes from (the v/w element was dropped in this one), but also, interestingly enough, \u1fd0\u0314\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u1fd0\u0301\u1fb1 (histor\u00ed\u0101, &quot;history&quot;), though it&#39;s harder to see (hehe get it?). <br><br>There&#39;s also Sanskrit \u0935\u0947\u0926 (v\u00e9da, &quot;knowledge&quot;, from which we derived &quot;Vedic&quot;), along with other Sanskrit words from the same root. <br><br>We get the Slavic root related to seeing as well, for example in the word for &quot;to see&quot; : Russian \u0432\u0438\u0301\u0434\u0435\u0442\u044c (v\u00eddet&#39;), Bulgarian \u0432\u0438\u0301\u0434\u044f (v\u00eddja), Polish &quot;widzie\u0107&quot;, and so on.<br><br>That&#39;s just a sneak peak, there are many, many words I didn&#39;t mention, including in some Indo-European languages I didn&#39;t mention, like Albanian or Armenian, or any of the Celtic, Baltic, or Iranian languages...

Die anyway.&quot; It&#39;s sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let&#39;s see if that&#39;s true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, &quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart.&quot; Ever looked with lust? If you have said &quot;Yes&quot; to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we&#39;ve only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That&#39;s not God&#39;s will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: &quot;God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot; Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read.
