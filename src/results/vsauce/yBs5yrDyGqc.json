Top executives have had years of immersion in the logic and conventions of business, so when they speak abstractly, they are simply summarizing the wealth of concrete data in their heads. But frontline employees, who aren\u2019t privy to the underlying meaning, hear only opaque phrases. As a result, the strategies being touted don\u2019t stick.<br>In 1990, a Stanford University graduate student in psychology named Elizabeth Newton illustrated the curse of knowledge by studying a simple game in which she assigned people to one of two roles: \u201ctapper\u201d or \u201clistener.\u201d Each tapper was asked to pick a well-known song, such as \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d and tap out the rhythm on a table. The listener\u2019s job was to guess the song.<br>Over the course of Newton\u2019s experiment, 120 songs were tapped out. Listeners guessed only three of the songs correctly: a success ratio of 2.5%. But before they guessed, Newton asked the tappers to predict the probability that listeners would guess correctly. They predicted 50%. The tappers got their message across one time in 40, but they thought they would get it across one time in two. Why?<br>When a tapper taps, it is impossible for her to avoid hearing the tune playing along to her taps. Meanwhile, all the listener can hear is a kind of bizarre Morse code. Yet the tappers were flabbergasted by how hard the listeners had to work to pick up the tune.<br>The problem is that once we know something\u2014say, the melody of a song\u2014we find it hard to imagine not knowing it. Our knowledge has \u201ccursed\u201d us. We have difficulty sharing it with others, because we can\u2019t readily re-create their state of mind.<br>In the business world, managers and employees, marketers and customers, corporate headquarters and the front line, all rely on ongoing communication but suffer from enormous information imbalances, just like the tappers and listeners.<br>Leaders can thwart the curse of knowledge by \u201ctranslating\u201d their strategies into concrete language. Consider Trader Joe\u2019s, a specialty food chain whose mission is \u201cto bring our customers the best food and beverage values and the information to make informed buying decisions.\u201d That\u2019s the company\u2019s abstract umbrella statement, and it hardly serves to distinguish Trader Joe\u2019s from other retailers. But shopping at Trader Joe\u2019s is nothing like shopping at Wal-Mart, and its aisles are full of inexpensive but exotic foodstuffs like Moroccan simmer sauce and red-pepper soup.<br>Trader Joe\u2019s beats the curse of knowledge and pours meaning into its strategy by using concrete language elsewhere. It touts its reputation as the \u201chome of cheap thrills,\u201d describing its target customer as an \u201cunemployed college professor who drives a very, very used Volvo.\u201d The image is a simplification, obviously; at any given moment, there are probably zero of these \u201ctarget customers\u201d in Trader Joe\u2019s. But because it simplifies a complex reality, the description ensures that all the employees of the organization have a common picture of its customers. Would the professor like the red-pepper soup? Yes.<br>\t<br>\t\t\t", "comment_date": "2013-11-30T16:47:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "E Bach", "comment_text": "LOL At <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBs5yrDyGqc&amp;t=3m56s\">3:56</a>, I thought he was tapping a verse from the Pirates of the Caribbean theme song.", "comment_date": "2013-11-21T05:00:47Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Teri Kiehl", "comment_text": "13:14 wth is it called!?!?!", "comment_date": "2013-11-19T03:24:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WHYY ?", "comment_text": "Hey, I almost got all the elements in little alchemy!!!!!", "comment_date": "2013-11-13T02:51:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1000REMBOY", "comment_text": "i know that feel bro...", "comment_date": "2013-11-01T02:55:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "trickykid3000", "comment_text": "and as always, i didnt get my homework done...", "comment_date": "2013-10-31T06:05:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "metalmattm", "comment_text": "That tapper thing only listed one song i tapped for me, lol.
