So, if a rainbow is relative to the viewer and the light being refracted back towards the person\u2019s eyes is coming from a circular shape, often bisected by the horizon, then the overall \u2018shape\u2019 this would create is a Cone. The \u2018end\u2019 of a cone is arguably it\u2019s point or apex, which in this case is would be somewhere on your retinas.

I think my stepdads house was one of four or five houses up on the mountain at that time. I remember seeing a (bright?) rainbow very nearby in front of me and walked toward it but when I stopped close to the spot where I guessed the end of the rainbow should have been touching the ground it had completely disappeared. I was pretty sure I was close to being \u201cinside\u201d the rainbow. Of course there was no pot of gold (I did kind of looked around lol) but I remember being surprised that I really couldn\u2019t see rainbow the closer I got to it (I did not know why that was back then) and it really wasn\u2019t that far from me.

This isn&#39;t a reflection of a rainbow in the sky (you can tell this because it appears slightly to the side of the bow in the sky). This forms when light reflects off rain and then off the water and into your eyes. It&#39;s essentially the opposite of a reflection bow and is called a reflected rainbow.<br><br>Several other unique and uncommon bows are secondary reflection bows and reflected bows. These are just like the main or &quot;primary&quot; bows around a body of water but this time connected with the second bow. Another bow is a twinned rainbow. Nobody&#39;s sure how this forms. It appears as a usual primary bow but part way up, it splits into a second rainbow with the same brightness and colour order, reconnecting to the the primary at the same mirrored point on the other side of the bow.<br><br>Now for some bows that are always there but usually invisible are the 3rd and 4th order rainbows. Light doesn&#39;t stop reflect inside a raindrop after 2 times. In a first oder bow (the primary), we see a good chunk of the light that entered the drop. With a 2nd order bow, we see the light that escaped after a second reflection. In a 3rd order bow, the same thing happens. We see the escaped light that wasn&#39;t reflected after three reflections. But in the case of this reflection, the light leaves on the opposite side of the drop it entered. So the rainbow will be around the sun, instead of the shadow of your head. The significantly reduced brightness (because so much light has escaped as the primary and secondary bows), this bow is nearly impossible to see. The &quot;zero order glow&quot; caused by the sun (light that just passes through a drop without any reflection) enhances the difficulty of seeing a 3rd order bow. A 4th order bow is even fainter and also circles the sun.<br><br>Also possible are 5th and 6th etc order bows. Like I said, light will just reflecting until there&#39;s none left. 5th and 6th order bows again appear on the opposite side of the sun. But because each bow order seems to get larger,  the 5th and 6th order bows will practically overlap each other and will be overpowered by the 1st and 2nd order bows. 7th and 8th order bows again are around the sun. 9th and 10th order bows are opposite, and so on. Sunlight, believe it or not, is only so bright, but higher orders can be made with exceptionally bright lasers.<br><br>One of the sites shown in the video is the go to site for info on optical phenomena. <a href=\"http://www.atoptics.co.uk/bows.htm\">http://www.atoptics.co.uk/bows.htm</a>", "comment_date": "2016-03-27T04:44:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "robin wang", "comment_text": "Causality speed is constant, so as light, it will just appear to slow down because the density of particles it runs into.", "comment_date": "2016-03-26T06:19:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lawrencium", "comment_text": "I seriously wish you were my high school teacher.

Assume you&#39;re right handed (I&#39;m left handed, by the way). The phone rings. You pick it up with your right hand. Someone asks you a question or gives you some details you need to write down. So you transfer the receiver to your left hand, keeping the earpiece/microphone facing your face, and pick up a pen in your right hand while you write stuff down. Then using your left hand, you put the phone down. What you have failed to notice is that in this operation, your receiver did a complete 360 degree rotation, twisting up the wire. \u00a0The reason the wire always gets more and more twisted is because the action doesn&#39;t vary and average out - you always pick up the phone with your major hand, transfer it to your minor hand and put it down using your minor hand, having added another twist to the cable. \u00a0The solution is, recognise that when you answer the phone, you&#39;re likely to be using your pen, so always pick up the phone with your &quot;wrong&quot; hand.

The two dotted lines parallel to each other is the rainbow, that arc, touching the ground both times. The many dots are rain drops in the air. &quot;A&quot; is sunlight, coming from behind you. The circle at the peak of the rainbow arc is where the refraction of light occurs. &quot;E&quot; is the light reaching your eyeballs, where you then perceive the image as a &quot;Rainbow&quot; And &quot;M&quot; is your shadow, which is at the center of the rainbow. (As Michael said in the video, a rainbow is not an arc, it&#39;s a circle, but since we are usually on the ground when we see a rainbow, it only appears to be an arc).
