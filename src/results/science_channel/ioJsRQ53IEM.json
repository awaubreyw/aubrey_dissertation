O grave, where is thy victory?<br>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.<br>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>God&#39;s love: For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.<br>      For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.<br>     He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. John 3.16-18 <br>God&#39;s plan: John 10:10  The thief (Satan) cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.<br>Man is sinful: All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3.23.<br>        Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.Ezekiel 18.4<br>      Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.Psalm 51.5. <br>Man is separated:The wages of sin is death but the gift of God is ETERNAL LIFE through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6.23<br>      And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: Hebrews 9.27.

Through Him you can know and experience God&#39;s love and plan for your life.) <br>He died in our place. <br>But God commended his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.Romans 5.8. <br>He rose from the dead:<br>    For I delivered unto you first of all  that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br>         And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: <br>1 Corinthians 15.3-4<br>He is the blood sacrifice for our sin: &quot;without the shedding of blood there is no remission&quot;.Heb9.22 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes YE WERE HEALED.1 Peter 2.24.     <br> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes WE ARE HEALED.Isaiah 53.5.   In whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin.Colossians1.14  <br>He is the only way to God:John 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.(God had bridged the gulf which separated us from God by sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross on our place to pay the penalty for our sins.) <br> I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.Luke 13.3,5. <br>We must receive Christ: <br>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1.12.             <br>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,  they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the  children of God: Romans 8.14-16 <br>Confess-Believe-Saved <br>      That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved. Romans 10.9.  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10.13 <br>We receive Christ through faith:  For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2.8-9 When we receive Christ we experience a new birth:  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.John 3.3<br>      Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.  1 Peter 1.23.  (We must individually receive Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord, then we can know and experience God&#39;s love and plan for our lives.)           <br>We receive Christ by personal invitation:          <br>     Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Revelation 3.20 (Receiving Christ involves turning from self to God(repentance) and trusting Christ to come into our lives to forgive our sins and to make us the kind of person He wants us to be. Just to agree intellectually that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for our sins is not enough. We receive Jesus Christ by faith, as an act of the will.  <br>Two lives represented by a.  or  b.? <br>a. Self directed life self on the throne while Christ is outside the life. <br>-interests are directed by self often resulting in discord and frustration.  <br>b. Christ directed life-Christ is in the life and on the throne while self is yielding to Christ<br> -interests are directed by Christ, resulting in harmony with God&#39;s plan.  Which (a,  b) represents your life? Which (a, b)would you like to have represent your life? For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he  hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Corinthians 5.10  <br>      For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Ephesians 5.5<br>      But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death . Revelation 21.8.   <br>And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb&#39;s book of life. Revelation 21.27 ( no sin can enter heaven.) <br>Whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

They produce a creaking sound. But then again it&#39;s space and very cold and could change the properties of the metal making it act in ways we have never seen or tested. Once the temperature stabilized it should remain relatively quiet until changes in the temperature would cause contraction or expansion. Also if the same material was used throughout then the noise should be all over the place and not just in one particular spot. Unless that spot has many missed or loosed bolt and rivets that cause it to move more than other areas as it wasn&#39;t held down tight. I still say something was trying to get in. Why because what is the changes that all the other astronaut all heard the nises on different shuttle and they all had loose nuts and rivets?

SATAN DEFEATED by EW Kenyon More and more believers are recognizing the fact that Satan is defeated as far as the believer is concerned. He was not conquered by the beliver; he was conquered by Christ for the believer in His Substitutionary Work. The Victory Christ wrought belongs to the believer, because we were identified with Christ in His Substitutionary work. Right there in the presence of all the hosts of darkness, Jesus conquered the Prince of Darkness. Collossians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioJsRQ53IEM&amp;t=2m15s\">2:15</a> says, He conquered principalities and powers and made a shew of them openly. Now this is what I want you to notice: This was an Eternal victory. Satan was eternally broken, conquered. Did you notice how Peter puts it? 1 Peter 5:8 &quot;He goes about as a roaring lion, whom resist steadfast in the faith. Our combat has been fought and won. There isn&#39;t any battle for you to fight except the battle of faith. What does that mean? You are to win all your victories with Words. You learn the Words of this Wonderful Book, and with Words, you will conquer the enemy. You see your combat is not against flesh and blood, as the Spirit tells us in Ephesians 6:12, but it is against the defeated principalities and powers. These principalities and powers have all been conquered. Their defeat is spoken of in Hebrews 9:12 as an Eternal Redemption from them. You are Eternally set free. They are eternally whipped, conquered. You get your liberty by remembering these words and acting accordingly. Can&#39;t you see what it means? That satan knows he is whipped but he doesn&#39;t want you to know it. He wants to keep you in ignorance of it.

By saying there are ufos and now opening up a so called new office for sighting, that people are capturing on phone camera and seeing just for that reason. But calling it Unidentified Phenomena. Like that change anything. And they already had that office. Just letting it be known now. Look at it this way. There&#39;s only so much you can put in a closet, before it starts spilling out.  Because many are snapping pictures and are getting recording. Of all types of things. When I say thing&#39;s. I mean crafts of different sorts. People are even seeing weird creatures lately and getting pictures of it. There is only so much you can hide. Until there&#39;s to many, to hide. We are in the endtimes. No one wants to hear that. Regardless if you do or don&#39;t. We are and everything is going to enhance. So get your armor on because there is a war coming like no other. With seen and (unseen.) Will you be ready. Jesus is the way the truth and life. Believe in him and call upon Jesus knowing He died for our sins. He is our only true protection, from the evils, are all around us. And the day He drops the vail. Sorry to say it this way, but there&#39;s going to be a lot of people wearing brown pants on that day. Or die from a heart attack. Just saying, many have absolutely no idea what is all  around them. Man may think they know everything. But they know nothing. And the little bit they know about entities or other type creatures. They&#39;re not going to share with you. Well got to go.

Through Him you can know and experience God&#39;s love and plan for your life. <br>He died in our place. <br>But God commended his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.Romans 5.8. <br>He rose from the dead:<br>    For I delivered unto you first of all  that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;<br>         And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: 1 Corinthians 15.3-4<br>He is the blood sacrifice for our sin: &quot;without the shedding of blood there is no remission&quot;.Heb9.22Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes YE WERE HEALED.1 Peter 2.24.     <br> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes WE ARE HEALED.Isaiah 53.5.   In whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sin.Colossians1.14  <br>He is the only way to God:John 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. We must individually receive Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord, then we can know and experience God&#39;s love and plan for our lives.<br> I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.Luke 13.3,5. <br>Spiritual rebirth: Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.John 3.3<br>      Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.  1 Peter 1.23. <br>We must receive Christ: <br>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1.12.             For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,  they are the sons of God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the  children of God: Romans 8.14-16 <br>Confess-Believe-Saved <br>      That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved. Romans 10.9.  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10.13 <br>Saved by grace:For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast. Ephesians 2.8-9   Therefore being justified by faith, we have  peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ: Romans 5.1           <br>Personally invite the LordJesus to come into your heart:                 <br>     Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me. Revelation 3.20                            <br>    For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he  hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Corinthians 5.10  <br>      For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Ephesians 5.5<br>      But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death .

John 6.54.                         <br>    Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: John 11.25-26<br>       Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,<br>      In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.<br>     For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.<br>    So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. 1 Corinthians 15.51-54<br>(The whole earth will be controlled by the Mark of the Beast.)       Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin  be revealed, the son of perdition;<br>       Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshiped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God. 2 Thessalonians 2.3-4<br>         (Please do not take the mark of the beast on your right hand hand and in your forehead to buy and sell.

There have been crashed craft. There have been material and bodies recovered. There has been a certain amount of reverse engineering that has allowed some of these craft, or some components, to be duplicated. And there is some group of people that may or may not be associated with government at this point that have this knowledge. They have been attempting to conceal this knowledge. People in high level government have very little, if any, valid information about this. It has been the subject of disinformation in order to deflect attention and create confusion so the truth doesn\u2019t come out. \u201d \u2015 Edgar D. Mitchell, The Way of the Explorer: An Apollo Astronaut&#39;s Journey Through the Material and Mystical World  <br><br>AFFIDAVIT (1) My name is Thomas Jefferson Dubose (2) My address is: XXXXXXXXXX (3) I retired from the U.S. Air force in 1959 with the rank of Brigadier General. (4) In July 1947, I was stationed at Fort Worth Army Air Field [later Carswell Air Force Base] in Fort Worth, Texas. I served as Chief of Staff to Major General Roger Ramey, Commander, Eighth Air Force. I had the rank of Colonel. (5) In early July, I received a phone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, Deputy Commander, Strategic Air Command. He asked what we knew about the object which had been recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, as reported in the press. I called Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the Roswell Army Air Field, and directed him to send the material in a sealed container to me at Fort Worth. I so informed Maj. Gen. McMullen. (6) After the plane from Roswell arrived with the material, I asked the Base Commander, Col. Al Clark, to take possession of the material and to personally transport it in a B-26 to Maj. Gen. McMullen in Washington, D.C. I notified Maj. Gen. McMullen, and he told me he would send the material by personal courier on his plane to Benjamin Chidlaw, Commanding General of the Air Material Command at Wright Field [later Wright Patterson AFB]. The entire operation was conducted under the strictest secrecy. (7) The material shown in the photographs taken in Maj. Gen. Ramey\u2019s office was a weather balloon. The weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press. (8) I have not been paid or given anything of value to make this statement, which is the truth to the best of my recollection. Signed: T. J. Dubose Date: 9/16/91 Signature witnessed by: Linda R.

Except for the weird part I cant resolve. I had redubdant systems and using nitrox mix and high intensity cave diver light. As I approached 120 with my dive buddy, I was looking down to where it went completelt dark below us. I suddenly heard 3 very evenly spaced  &quot;BOOMS&quot; coming from the depth about 1.5 seconds apart. I could feel them ad if they were about to reverberatw in mt bones. I loojed to my patner to signal and it was immediately clear he did not hear  thing. I then got hit again with three more even a bit louder and I then was overwhelmed with a sense that I was being warned away. I signaled to my buddy who again heard nothing which made me very much feel I was specifically being targeted ad I was about 15 feet deeper than he was and literally on the edge of the blackness. I signaled for us to ascend, thumbs up which must be obeyed when anyone in a group dive signals it but as I moved toward his position to begin ascending, I  made a quick glance with my light behibd me again, and I swear I caught a glimpse  of bluish reddish and I&#39;ll say orangy lights move quickly through the darkness below me and away from me. Now I was troubled and back on the boat after our multiple decompression stops, he had heard nor seen anything. I never returned to diving there again. I asked every diver I knew and no one could say theyve had a similar experience. So..my determination was that nitrox micro bubbles had popped in my inner ear twice and then in my optic nerve, but the mystery is that the booms were so evenly spaced and that I felt the  immense heavy bass of them in my body.

They were baptized in water for the removal of sins and filled with the Holy Ghost. Here&#39;s why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead. That&#39;s what Acts 2:38 is. <br>We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD. <br>We can&#39;t come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don&#39;t be cursed. <br>One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away. <br>Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. <br>The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ&#39;s Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. <br>The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church. <br>It&#39;s better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction. <br>Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle&#39;s doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. <br>Don&#39;t get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS and the other is a WORK OF FAITH.\u00a0 Titus <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioJsRQ53IEM&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>, They profess that they know God; but in WORKS they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.<br>If you believe in this message, be blessed by God in helping to spread it in the name of Jesus Christ so people can get saved the right way.

Maybe the ET pilot thought that Yang, wearing his spacesuit, would then open the hatch and would see the ET craft?  Possibly, if Yang had done that, he would have seen the ET UFO with its hatch open and inviting him to float over and into the ET craft!  Once there, he might have entered a small airlock which, after being pressurized, would allow him to enter the ET UFO and remove his helmet.  There, he might have been able to make some sort of official contact with one of the many ET races that regularly visit our solar system from the other inhabited star systems surrounding ours.  I&#39;m wondering if Yang&#39;s space capsule had some sort window and, if so and he looked out of it, did he SEE an ET craft nearby?  If he did, he was probably instructed prior to his launch to get some video of it and keep quiet about it after he landed.  Our US astronauts are also given the same instructions although I&#39;m sure NASA will deny that.  Don&#39;t forget that NASA, while giving the impression of being a civilian space program, is actually part of the Department of Defense and they take their orders from them.<br><br>This very short video will provide you with some real answers as to how <br>genuine ET UFOs work.

Started to &quot;knock&quot; at his ship. There is this phenomena that happen with the senses, specifically the acoustic sense, or the sense of hearing, that happens when the body has been on a particular height or altitude for a long time, then suddenly would be exposed to a different altitude. The water Inside the tubes of the ear would shift and behave differently by perceiving sound waves differently. A perfect example is that, when someone is living on a mountain, then suddenly that person travels on a vehicle to descend to lower lands, it&#39;s as if, it feels as though something is clogging the ear or something is about to pop. But that is a different kind of fluid shift since the person is descending thus when the phenomena happens, the sound waves are muffled out by the shifting of the fluid within the ear. In the case of the Astronaut, he is ascending, thus, the shifting of the fluid is different, and instead of muffling the sound, it gets amplified.....having less gravity, and being on a field that is so silent, can also amplify sounds that he heard.", "comment_date": "2021-07-13T23:47:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M San", "comment_text": "Meh, with such complex aircrafts its probably just something engineers haven&#39;t accounted for when designing it.
