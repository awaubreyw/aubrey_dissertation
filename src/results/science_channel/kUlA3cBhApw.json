Whether you <br>will go there and 2. If you find you&#39;re not on your way there, I&#39;ll tell you how to get there.<br><br>Only two kinds of people get to Heaven: perfect people, and forgiven sinners.<br><br>What is perfect? Well, not stealing regardless of how insignificant it may seem, not saying a single evil word against anyone - not to mention God sees our thought life. And like a judge in court, a penalty has to be paid when evil is done and laws are broken (e.g. if a murderer was let off in court there would be uproar so how much more God)?<br><br>In short - we arent perfect, at all. And rather than Heaven, God, if giving us justice, will have to make us pay for our crimes by death and eternal damnation in an everlasting fire and torment. THAT\u2019s how much God hates sin.<br><br>BUT:<br>There is a way that we can be saved. AND completely forgiven. Jesus - the Son of God - came down to live a perfect life without sin, conquering all evil and the devil&#39;s sinful, lustful traps that so easily ensnare us. Jesus overcame all of that, and was then sentenced to death on a cross.<br><br>While on the cross, God poured out the anger and wrath of sin on His Son - Jesus took OUR fine of damnation in our place. That\u2019s how much He loves us. Unbearable pain and being separated from God. EVERY single evil thought, word or deed that doesnt line up with God&#39; perfection, every sin you ever have/will commit knowingly or unknowingly, Jesus took the complete, undiluted wrath for. <br><br>And, like a fine in court, Jesus paying for it means that we can go free. Not just free, but we can experience God&#39;s love and be completely forgiven and saved from Hell as all punishment was carried on the cross and crucified there for all who believe. Instead, we can live immortally and eternally in Heaven.<br><br>After His death, Jesus rose again on the third day, demonstrating His sovereignty and power and victory over not just the sins of this life, but DEATH.<br><br>GOD HAS VICTORY OVER DEATH.<br><br>Soon Jesus will return and those who died believing in Him will RISE from their graves and go to Heaven, and those who rejected His salvation, message and teachings will suffer Hell to pay their deserved fines for all eternity without a second chance.<br><br>This is your chance now.<br><br>He wants you to repent (turn away from your sin and pursue God&#39;s perfect intent for your life, striving in the opposite direction). <br><br>It\u2019s not only about escaping damnation, it\u2019s entering God\u2019s healing as well. God has a plan for your life, a plan that involves you being recreated into His perfect moral image AGAIN as we were before the sin in the garden. He loves you and wants to cleanse you - He will give you the strength. Now we can walk in His strength, experiencing His love, being taught what it means to be part of His family and too be given victory over sin and death. <br><br>He wants you to have faith in Him, letting Him take the wheel of your life (dont forget, when you&#39;re doing God&#39;s will you&#39;re following perfect love - following Him you can be certain that you are never doing the wrong thing- imagine how cleansing that feels).<br><br>What if I still sin when Ive accepted Christ&#39;s death and resurrection on my behalf?<br><br>Thats why Christ died. For your SIN. When God looks at you, striving towards Him or even falling, He sees the righteous life of Christ covering you you in place of your current, sinful reality. For those who strive to turn from sin, regardless of the pitfalls, God sees Jesus&#39;s life in place of your inability, and His blood so that yours will never have to be shed for your sin.<br><br>Religion = rules to be saved <br><br>The gospel = Christ saved us already we just have to believe it by faith alone in Christ alone. If you lack faith (as I did before), pray. He will make it strong in time. Trust Him as you would trust those close to you. He created you and knows you inside out. <br><br>Sound opposite? Thanks to our natural sinful nature, it likely does, but God knows our weakness and struggles and pitfalls with sin. THAT&#39;S why He wrestled (and won against) every temptation YOU ever faced. Just pray to God, tell Him you are struggling and are unsure - God can and will work with even the slightest desire within you to follow Him and be free from sin.<br>Ask Him to make you willing - if you are willing to be made willing, pray for it, simply shut your eyes and talk to Him.<br><br>When Satan knows people have left His camp, He won\u2019t take it lying down, He often tries harder with more trials and temptations. But Satan cannot do anything beyond what God permits, He will only allow things that will strengthen you or bring you closer to Him if you cling to Him and trust in the promises of His word.<br><br>Where do I start to learn about God&#39;s plan and His promises to me? Well, these Bible relate directly to Christ&#39;s life and our redemption, check out Matthew (or Luke if you want a more detailed account). Do it in stages and try and imagine the events and miracles as they really happened - the Bible is a true account after all.<br><br>And when and note it says WHEN, you struggle and fall on this lifelong process, know you can pray for forgiveness, dust yourself off again and get up because Jesus already bore our guilt and shame. remember that Jesus is the ultimate foundation, the reason we are given Heaven in the first place. <br><br>If you lack faith (as i did for a long time) pray. He desires to give strength and faith to His children in time when they ask Him.<br><br>If you want to let Jesus into your life, even to help you to take the first step, then read through this prayer here to get the gist of it and then just say it - trust God and give it all to Him because He has the - perfect - master plan. If you take a step - just a step - towards Him, He will take a step towards you.<br><br>NOTE: YOU ARE NEVER TOO SINFUL THAT GOD CANNOT BRING YOU BACK HOME.<br><br>Dear God, I know that I am a sinner and there is nothing that I can do to save myself. I confess my complete helplessness to forgive my own sin or to work my way to heaven. <br>At this moment I trust Christ alone as the One who bore my sin when He died on the cross. I believe that He did all that will ever be necessary for me to stand in your holy presence. I thank you that Christ was raised from the dead as a guarantee of my own resurrection. <br>As best as I can, I now transfer my trust to Him. <br>I am grateful that He has promised to receive me despite my many sins and failures.
