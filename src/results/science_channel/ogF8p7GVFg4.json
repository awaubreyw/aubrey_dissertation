However the drones claimed that they had done all the work and the comb belonged to them not the bees. <br>They brought their case to court before judge wasp, who knew something about both parties and addressed them follows:&quot;the plaintiffs and defendants are so much alike  in shape and color that the rights to the ownership of the comb are indeed questionable, and the case has been properly brought before me. Therefore, I order each party take a hive to itself and build a new comb so the lawful proprietors of the property in dispute may be determined from the shape of the cells and the taste of the honey &quot;. The bees readily assented to the wasp&#39;s plan but the drones declined. As a result the wasp declared that it is now clear who made the comb and who cannot make it. The court Grant&#39;s the honey to the bees.
