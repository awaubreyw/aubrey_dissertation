Humanity does not understand the concept of synchronization: The planet Earth has complex ecosystems. The development of complex intelligence destroys the resources of the planet to sustain itself, preventing the evolution of human form into a higher natural order that permits knowledge of the universe to become possible. The force that created the universe designed into it the ability of the continuation of the collective of the level of complex intelligence to migrate to a new planet to continue in social and spiritual evolution. The concept of this synchronicity has become replaced by the singular trust that God provides. This has become corrupted into a come what may attitude that has deteriorated the ability to achieve the natural life cycle of the planet of its origin. When a planet naturally declines in the ability to sustain the complex intelligent life forms upon it, there is a development of natural purpose to individual and collective existence that is fulfilled. Aliens are an integral part of the evolution of a developing intelligence into a higher state of being. Jesus the Christ had evolved in the absolute humility to have drawn in the channeling of an inter-universe being. This type of being is a component of the God force, capable of traversing through parallel universes. In Christian scripture, who is this man, that even the wind and sea obey him.? How is it possible for a human to channel such divine energy to affect the physical reality of the planet itself? The physical reality of the universe itself. Jesus evolved humanity as an entire collective entity, defining miracles that defied possibility. He did not fail that resulted in his crucifixion, he pondered the contradiction of human form to evolve,signaling a respect for miracles, yet an unwillingness to move beyond a planet that collapses. The object in the Kuiper Belt may have been put there by alien intelligence as the signal of an anomaly in an otherwise dormant region of space known for specific types of celestial objects. The probe there that went inoperable that came back online was the same as nuclear missile silos where the launch systems went inoperable as well. These beings were indicating with this object in the Kuiper Belt that aliens used between themselves that humanity had achieved a knowledge of technology that could not reconcile planetary synchronicity. An orb, spinning as a planet does, without ecosystems or indigenous life. Oumuamua was of the same.A non-random fabricated asteroid that demonstrated acceleration beyond explanation as it exited the solar system. We are encountering a very old and advanced life form that travels between universes. These beings are trying to point that out. The Earth is a technological society that is evolving into the knowledge of intelligent control over the physical reality: A reassurance from these beings of exceptional spiritual power that is apart from any subversion to the one natural order of the universe that is the concept of the God force. The weaponization of outer space concerns these life forms. The inability of humanity to move beyond the limitations of the adversity in the sacrifice of planetary synchronicity has revealed the inability to comprehend how to extend the trust in higher life forms that will make that to be possible. The unity with other intelligent life in the universe has become sacrificed by the stasis of a world that cannot evolve. Jesus gave it his best shot: A highly evolved soul capable of human form that could channel the divinity of miracles to help humanity achieve the future so desperately needed to be able to evolve. This universe was created by the collective of these beings channeling the divinity to make that manifestation to be possible for synchronicity to be defined without subversion or a lack of comprehension interfering. These beings, when jeopardized by the use of weapons in space, channel the trust towards an inter-universe being for guidance. A technological universe, a created universe drawn into being as this Big Bang, and an inter-universe being powerful enough to affect the structure of this universe itself. Three universes, all evolving at the same time. Wake up, humanity, and dispense with weaponry as the solution. Planetary synchronicity requires evolving into peace.

But not likely. <br>Most likely, it&#39;s a big hunk of iron and is spinning because it&#39;s become magnecticly charged from contact with space dust. <br>The light produced is simply electrostatic discharge ....<br>They should have never flown out to it . Very fortunate not to have lost that probe. <br>Hey NASA, there are at least 7 planetoids out in the belt.<br>Why didn&#39;t you go out to one of those?  <br>If any one is out there, that is were they would be.

These things are good and profitable unto men.<br><br>Galatians 3:23-25 KJV<br>23\u00a0But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.<br>24\u00a0Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.<br>25\u00a0But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.<br><br>( We\u2019re not under the law so no longer under the curse of sin cause we\u2019re Justified by Jesus through Faith Alone)<br><br>Ephesians 1:13-14 KJV<br>13\u00a0In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,<br>14\u00a0Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.<br><br>Ephesians 2:8-9 KJV<br>8\u00a0For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>9\u00a0Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br><br>Titus 3:5 KJV<br>5\u00a0Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;<br>6\u00a0Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;<br>7\u00a0That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.<br><br>Romans 8:15 KJV<br>15\u00a0For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.<br><br>When you believe in you heart on the Death, Burial, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ (The Finished Works/Blood) you are saved brothers and sisters for all of eternity (Eternal Security is Yours)<br><br>Romans 8:38-39 KJV<br>38\u00a0For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,<br>39\u00a0Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br><br>Nothing can ever take you away from our <br>Lord Jesus Christ when you believe in your heart. NOTHING<br>NOT YOUR FUTURE PRIDE<br>NOT YOUR PRESENT LUST<br>NOT YOUR FUTURE LUST<br>NOTHING MEANS NOTHING<br><br>Thank you Jesus Christ for this promise you gave me and all who believe in your blood<br><br>When I learned I was sealed with the Holy Spirit (Eternal Security) I was so happy, for almost my whole life (30 years of it) I believed a lie that I could lose my salvation by my bad works. Cause of that belief I walked away from the Lord a few times cause I thought I couldn\u2019t measure up, so what\u2019s the point. So now I got proper doctrine, and now the truth of his love makes me want to do more for God cause he\u2019s done so much for me. It also makes me want to grow in my relationship with Christ way more. Truly the greatest gift given to us was Justification through his blood. So now i can go and do good works cause of the the love God showed me. We\u2019re all called to be ministers of the gospel. <br><br>I pray this helps You or Someone Else get a little closer to Jesus Christ and get clarity on what it takes to be Saved by Faith in the finished works of Jesus Christ<br><br>Jesus is returning soon<br>Come as you are", "comment_date": "2022-01-02T04:15:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Apocraphon tripp", "comment_text": "Couldnt the gravity issue work in the opposite?

Earth has already been hijacked. <br><br>\ud83d\ude09We need to be liberated from this slave planet and from our captors... Unfortunately most of the inhabitants of this planet is suffering from cognitive dissonance and Stockholm syndrome.<br><br>The Moon is a Draco Reptilian Space Station...<br><br>Ask yourself why is there 34 Dragon statues that surround the City of London. Why is there also a Obelisk in every city on the planet. It&#39;s the phallus of the Dragon, the actual word is derived from Basilisk. Which means King of the Serpents. In the Vatican they have St. Peters Basilica where there are three Dragon statues and Obelisks. <br><br>ALIEN ARCHONS HAVE BEEN RULING THE SURFACE OF PLANET SINCE BEFORE THE &quot;BUY BULL&quot; The IllumiNazis are but a predecessor of an older and even more cruel order. They&#39;ve been running this planet since the dawn of time...Dragons aren&#39;t some mythological being...The Draco Reptilians came from the Alpha Draconis star system out of the Draco Constellation... They were know as the Atlanteans, Satan, Baphomet, Archons, Draconian&#39;s, in the bible they were known as the Seraphim, the Burning Ones/Serpents also the Nephilim or Elohim, the fallen angels, those who were casted out from the heavens. Both words are plural and feminine, meaning there were many gods and were androgynous. The Sumerians knew them as the Anunnaki... Anakim in Hebrew means giant...Because they are very tall 7ft-15ft and have shapeshifting abilities. In the Indian culture they were known as the Naga. Dracula in Latin means Dragon, The Order of the Dracul able to shift physically into other creatures or into the aether via the quantum field.<br><br>The Mayans called them Quezatcoatl, and Kukulcan the Feathered Serpent King and incorporated their images of dragons in their pyramids ... There are dragon statues all over the world, throughout the ages...<br>The coat of arms for the city of London is two Dragons holding a red shield, which in German is Rothschild. There are 33 Dragon statues in the City of London to quell consciousness. The slaying of a Dragon by St. George. The Muslims knew them as Dajjal or Djinn or Genies... After your three wishes your soul is theirs to keep... They were also known to the Buddhist monks as the Brotherhood of Two dragons... The Red Dragons in the east and the Yellow in the west... Same goes for the native American Indians all the Aboriginals knew them as the Brotherhood of the Snake... The Egyptian knew them as Horus, Anubis and Amen Ra.... That&#39;s why every religion says amen after every prayer cause they are paying homage to Satan Baphomet/ Draco Reptoids... Santa Claus is actually Satan&#39;s Claws both wearing red, both come from the fire, both have minions working feverishly. All religions and holidays are based on satanic doctrines and pagan dogmas. And if you don&#39;t believe me than you&#39;re being quite draconian about it.<br><br>Basilisk in Latin means King of the Serpents, as in St Peters Basilica where there lies two Dragon Statues in the Vatican as well as Obelisks, the phallus of the Dragon that is why there is at least few obelisks in every city on the planet the Freemasons put them there throughout history in order to control consciousness...The Chinese, Japanese, India,  Indonesians, Mayans, Aztecs, Incas all worship the Dragon in antiquity... There are Gargoyles adorn every church and cathedral.... The Watchers...

in a centrifugal chamber is inversely proportional to the size of the chamber. so obviously this doesn&#39;t discount the feasibility of simulating gravity with fictitious forces. you just need to make the spinning spacecraft much bigger than this corny little carousel in her lab. she&#39;s also not even standing perpendicular to the axis of rotation, which is... duh? no shit you&#39;re gonna get nauseous standing at a 45 degree angle. you&#39;re also still subject to earth&#39;s gravity in this dumb experiment, so your vestibular system senses that as a vector component. you need to be in space; standing perpendicular to the axis of rotation; and in a very large spinning chamber such that the difference between the radius at the level of your foot and that at the level of your head is negligible.<br><br>the reason you get nauseous is because your head is spinning much faster than your feet, due to the lower radius. equal amount of angular momentum times less distance to cover to make 1 rotation = faster angular motion relative to your feet. the nausea is proportional to the ratio thereof. so if you&#39;re in a tiny chamber whose diameter is only double your height, your head will be spinning at unbelievable speeds, rotating instead of revolving about the center, since it&#39;s IN the center. say it&#39;s slightly wider than that. now your head is no longer right in the center but it&#39;s still way closer to the center than your feet. say the radius of the chamber is 8 feet and you&#39;re 6 feet tall. well now the radius of the circle traversed by your head is 2 feet and the radius of the circle traversed by your feet is 8 feet. therefore the ratio is 4, which is an extreme ratio.<br><br>now imagine the radius of the chamber is 50 feet, something more realistic for a contemporary spacecraft. the radius of the circle traversed by your head is 44 feet, and that of the circle traversed by your feet is 50 feet. same difference of 6, equal to your height, but the ratio is only 1.136. now imagine we&#39;re doing real long-distance space travel. after all, aside from conducting experiments to answer these very questions of practicality, we have no reason to even build a centrifugal chamber in a spaceship if it&#39;s not being used for very long-distance, probably interstellar travel but at the very least travel to the outer planetary region. in that case it&#39;s more likely the chamber would have a radius of 100 feet or more.<br><br>most futurist models like the dyson ring envisioned a chamber with a radius of many, many miles, because obviously that would be the most livable situation. they imagined this not just as a spacecraft for astronauts to fly in but an actual home, a moving colony or an ark that could carry entire populations to other solar systems, not arriving until perhaps 10 generations have been born and died on the ring. so for all practical purposes, an artificial planet. you know, kinda like the video game halo. obviously it&#39;s not realistic that humans could construct such things until we have a lot of space infrastructure. in particular, the equivalent of shipyards and dry docks in permanent orbit. maybe a space elevator. but getting to that point doesn&#39;t require figuring out &quot;artificial gravity.&quot; artificial gravity is only necessary for extremely long spaceflights. a shipyard satellite could be built in low earth orbit without anyone spending more than a month in space.<br><br>so realistically speaking it&#39;s probably more likely that we&#39;ll start building spacecraft IN space before we start sending manned missions to the far reaches of the solar system and beyond. in other words, we won&#39;t run into the artificial gravity problem until after we have the technology to construct massive space arks larger than modern cruise ships or aircraft carriers. that&#39;s not just because it&#39;s not worth sending manned spacecraft past neptune if you can&#39;t build a giant centrifugal chamber into them. it&#39;s also because there are serious limits to the kinds of spacecraft that can escape earth. the velocities required to get from the ground to the thermosphere are immense. it&#39;s just not realistic for a rocket to carry a full crew and life support and experiments AND enough fuel to escape earth&#39;s pull AND enough to get back home.<br><br>to start traveling between planets in any meaningful sense we will need new kinds of spacecraft that are much more efficient, and can afford to be much more efficient because they don&#39;t need the immense burst of work to get from stationary on the ground into orbit. once we have docks in space we can build much larger spacecraft that are &quot;born&quot; in space, craft that don&#39;t need to escape earth&#39;s intense surface gravity. they&#39;ll require much less energy to reach the same momentum if they launch from orbit instead of on earth. a space elevator is often seen as a realistic way of getting this started, because it obviates the need for a reentry vehicle. you&#39;d just return to orbit, dock your craft at the shipyard, then take the adjoined space elevator back to earth&#39;s surface, on foot.<br><br>so even pretending artificial gravity wasn&#39;t a problem, this is the direction any spacefaring civilization is going to go anyway. and it just happens to be the direction that enables enormous ships of exactly the kind necessary to produce artificial gravity. if ships are gonna be built in space anyway, it&#39;ll be much more realistic to build them to such sizes that they can support a 500-foot diameter centrifuge. obviously building most things in space is harder than building them on earth. the vacuum creates just as many new problems as the weightlessness solves. but building such craft on earth is not an option in the first place because they would be too big to escape earth with rocket propulsion technology, even with nuclear propulsion actually.<br><br>the best we could do is build most of the small parts on earth and then ferry them up to a dry dock in space where they&#39;re assembled into the kind of massive, extremely aerodynamically inefficient structure that could never make it through earth&#39;s atmosphere in one piece, but would have the best chance of bringing human populations to deep space. with that being the case it&#39;s extremely unlikely that humans will ever use centrifuges smaller than 100ft diameters for anything except experiments on simulating gravity with fictitious forces, or on the coriolis effect on physiology.", "comment_date": "2021-10-20T10:32:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GGasfalt", "comment_text": "OH yeah ? can you feel earth spinning... noo... so if the object is big enough we wouln not have the same issues that woman had ,", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T18:30:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "isaac morrison", "comment_text": "The sooner we realize that we are not the brightest,  but the dummy on the block, the sooner we could move forward.", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T15:31:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Cahalan", "comment_text": "A slow spinning satellite, able to encompass the enigmatic forces required for sustained life..

At around the 5 min mark, in a rotating environment you would be standing and living on the SIDES of an object, NOT in the center. So that sideways force would be DOWN to you, you would NOT be fighting against any sideways momentum because there would be none, and objects would NOT bend to the side but go straight DOWN just like in real gravity. Motion sickness is dependent on the size relation between you and whatever your on, so if the object is not much bigger then you then your going to get sick, BUT if the craft was say the size of State then there would be NO motion sickness, in fact you more then likely wouldn&#39;t even be able to tell it was spinning AT ALL. In a spinning environment on earth you end up with TWO forces on you, Gravity pulling you down and the spinning force pushing you sideways, the human body wasn&#39;t meant to cope with that. But in space on a spinning craft you would have only ONE, the spinning force pushing you down just like gravity on earth. Also, the larger the object is, the slower it would need to spin in order to generate 1G of gravity, so an object miles or tens of miles across would only need to spin once or twice every few hours and a human person wouldn&#39;t even notice it. Another thing is that humans DO NOT NEED exactly 1G of gravity to live comfortably, something around 60%-75% earth gravity would be sufficient for humans to live on with VERY little if any effect on them, so the space craft would need to spin even slower. So this argument that humans are far away from creating spinning craft is absurd. We could do it TOMORROW if we wanted to and had an easier way of getting the materials into space to build something that large. Plus a large caft could have its living quarters stationed closer to the outer edges where the gravity would be closer to earth&#39;s and areas for storage or work closer to the center where gravity would be lower, making working and moving large amounts of materials or objects easier.", "comment_date": "2021-10-02T15:04:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Titanium Beard", "comment_text": "so those aliens in the spinning delaware aren&#39;t that bright.   why didn&#39;t they just get an astroroid to crash into the NASA probe?

They were baptized in the water and of the spirit. Here&#39;s why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled and rising again from the dead. That&#39;s what Acts 2:38 is. <br>We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD. <br>We can&#39;t come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don&#39;t be cursed. <br>One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match-up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away. <br>Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. <br>The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ&#39;s Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. <br>The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church. <br>It&#39;s better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction. <br>Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, And they continued steadfastly in the apostle&#39;s doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. <br>Don&#39;t get Titus 3:5 mixed up with James 2:14-26, about WORKS. One is a WORK of your OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS OR GOOD DEEDS and the other is a WORK OF FAITH.\u00a0 Titus <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OU58Ya2-rpY&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>, They profess that they know God; but in WORKS they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.<br> If you believe in this message, help spread it in the name of Jesus Christ so people can get saved the right way.

supposed to be living inside of my house<br><br>Lusphur is sulphur Yellow and white sulphur and gold and silver   yellow silver  so so in order to do fast and light travel in order to do high end reactors in order to do particle assembly   you need electric life intelligent sentient electrics<br><br><br><br>so humans thought that they could make electric and that they could get humans to support them   Like once they where in power it would be to late so <br><br><br>humans basically one here and basically was not actually the person that was supposed to be in the White House yet he insisted that he was in fact Starling or something trying to get the name basically you going to humans would refuse to let him use the name   <br><br><br>so well    so this became A war where onbe person was going rages to riches he was trying to do star line was a 1.7 little size   person  yellow silver white hair person <br><br><br>A man tried to use starlines name to get into the white house then he tryed too kill the real person that was star line so now that person who really has nothing more then saying that hes lucifer and now has no hair <br><br>so well there 70 years old and about too die then in death they will be punished <br><br>when you look around and you see people without her this is because they are part of a group that basically attempted to kill the real Lored  StarLine <br><br>and where trying to use starline life forms to force another man who had yellow hair too lose his hair he was try6ing to Be starline in existince though was not the person or invintor so this is paridox <br><br>and you you can&#39;t force yourself to be in the White House as someone who you&#39;re not which is exactly what they&#39;re doing and trying to change the White Star line White House into the Bush house the big business house<br><br>this would cause A pardox  becuse no one would let bush into that house and its no bush Bush would say that he invented the brush and that&#39;s how he got the White House nothing to do with the White House has to do with mining and smelting and my farms and vessels and you try and call all the white vessels sjip jos[ph  biships so this is pardox <br><br>so basically it&#39;s one homeless person who basically has basically and basically trying to be boy guy in the white house so i dont know what will happen now what they where doing is impossible man someone who&#39;s trying to do the easy way trying to just force his way in well he&#39;s not really that real person he&#39;s doing it easy way that&#39;s not the way this is Phil or basically the person who would be so it be very obvious and clear that he&#39;s an impostor<br><br>so <br><br><br>This is why humans have stunted growth because one man who now has no hair balding men without men men without her to try and take over   and there going to be punished when they died  with others so well there 70 trying to take over when they were twenty then they try to take over when they were 44 basically I fixed my name except not when I fixed my name when they were 44 from the point of 1944    <br><br><br>44 actually means the first four lines and the first four light sphere systems     <br><br><br>though it  is 4 L      Lusphur Lored Lite LestLSI    and Luse Lite Lore  Line 4 letter of 4 names Star so though not 44     so i was hiding that my name was LL Lusphur Lite <br><br>so  Lored   LO Light sphere Lore meaning past     though EL   LO    and LOE     Lite sphere energy so inventor of stabilized energy so they where trying to say they wherer my parents and i dont have parents Sulphur didn&#39;t have parents and io refused to call rodny my father so another failed attempt at saying some one else was Lucifer after rick bsuh had lost his hair <br><br>\r<br> \r<br>so trying to use the most well known and forbidden name so the liute sphere at the center of this system so humans picked A fight with that so they don&#39;t want people to know what this is about\r<br>\r<br>\r<br><br><br>so they would  chilling out of 11 I got my Homeland Security ID basically and the group basically snapped my neck killing me temporary I woke up on the floor drooling and then they would try and insist   I was Brian briley while simultaneously trying to use my Homeland Security iD  <br><br>I&#39;m trying to say that they or one of them was actually disappeared although my Homeland Security ID had my photo and also had the date it was given to me and also my birth year<br><br>and because I&#39;m a particle and lifeform Venter basically even handling or even having that idea is basically death sentence for any one of my life ones that isn&#39;t me and while some people might think well how would you know of course other entities and existence itself is going to know which one is actually there like form and enter in human form<br><br><br>so well very moment it started and basically just it&#39;s like being dead before you even realize that you&#39;re dead I say I actually thought about it and realistically one man was already in deep trouble had already been trying to basically use the name and basically have been told to stop several different times and he thought that if he got the idea and then he thought got into the White House and then he thought that if he took over it be too late and how hard is it to kill a small person<br><br><br><br>though i mean 7 lines of life 7 too 14 Galaxy the same person would basically think that this was their takeover move like a golden ticket that just landed in their lap and basically it&#39;s instant death and basically thousands of years and trillions of years punishment and then they thought that they could try and make it look like Lucifer was bad person by being bad themselves so it&#39;s this long stupid thing basically a bunch of people being really horrible<br><br><br>so relax there 70 year old and clinging to life trying to convince people and stuff like that trying to force the truth force deception it&#39;d be trying maybe saying that they&#39;re trying to force the truth when they&#39;re actually trying to force deception and basically they&#39;re about to die they got a lot further when they were younger<br><br>so and they angered 7 too 14 lines of life and tryed to contriol and opress there own life form type <br><br>many people would think that being life on veteran human form or flash like what&#39;s the difference between the real person and say someone else and while the difference is that one was born in 1944 and it&#39;s stuck in time and space and the other one by existence itself would know and see and have been tracking this whole time and making sure that that person stays a lot and has not lost his hair  <br><br><br>and other people have ben trying to yell and make people hear and basically how crazy people who are scientists and other people like that so the translator will try and   so like I said they&#39;re trying to to discredit science and technology and even trying to say that there&#39;s no sphere at the center of this Galaxy<br><br>or that I was a crazy child and basically they spoke for the Lord  and not me who is the Lored of light or Lusphur so there is A verification validation process that once it started basically the actual person would be found validated and of course this small group again with trying to force other people to say that they were actually valid people though eventually it says they died that would stop<br><br>so there trying to live longer <br><br><br>and basically at this time they just basically been trying to hurt me as much as they possibly can   and trying to hurt everyone else as much as they can so it is boyt guy men so its just 16 men or 3 really so there going to be dying soon <br><br><br>as soon as one hair  removed man dies there are 20 other hair removed men though there not as bad as one of then though the light sphere is going to be colecting them and punishing them so <br><br><br>second plane everything some men taught that it was going to be the Germans always gonna be coming after them or it was the government or it was the Chinese or the Mexicans or some group realize it actually lights sphere at the center of the Galaxy<br>that is going to punish these hair removed men as soon as they die <br><br><br>I mean basically pretty much as soon as these men said that David Lord basically caught the attention many life forms and passengers here at the Galaxy itself<br><br>so it knows what it is and what it isnt so <br><br>well they made A chose they where told to stop they didnt realize whos name they where using so its really going to hurt for them and there si nothing anyone or anything can do about it <br><br>so sigh shrug they made A chose and there anything well they know that there&#39;s nothing they can do about it so they die there basically though they tried to get humans and lifelong types to try and save them but there was no saving    then  <br><br>they upset the light sphere at the center of the system like that large sphere so oh well its and there&#39;s nothing that they can it&#39;s nothing anyone I&#39;m

We will also see the asteroid Apophis on approach before it&#39;s flyby in April 2029.<br><br>The universe is composed of three compartments. While alive in the flesh we are in that portion that is of the lake of fire, sheol. The physical aspect of our existence is composed of five dimensions, though we are also spirit in nature. There is our 3-D of dimensions known to all. <br><br>There is the fifth dimension known as the higgsfield. It is the structure of dark matter and dark energy. This dimension is a granulated quantum tunnel wormhole. This dimension in it\u2019s various forms generates the effects of electromagnetism, electrical fields, gravity, mass, inertia and ALL the laws of physics.<br><br>The three dimensions of our 3-D existence are encased within time, which is time space, and within time space, there is the higgsfield. On this level is an existence of chaos or entropy, and degeneration. However, the order of things that comes into our universe comes from the higher dimensions called hyperspace, or in scriptural terms, the spirit dimensions. <br><br>These higher dimensions are composed of dimensions from the sixth to the twelfth dimensions called either the spirit dimensions or hyperspace. Our local universe is an enclosed envelope as a bubble, accounting for the curvature of space time. There are an infinite number of other universes, like bubbles coming off of bubbles. The second compartment containing the spirit dimensions of hyperspace has evil entities which have existed for many eons of linear time. Their intention is to ABORT all mankind. <br><br>Our 3-D existence is a hologram. From the perspective of the higher dimensions, our 3-D existence is an illusion, as a holographic universe or bubble. We can relate to a high definition picture on a television accept this is projecting our reality. So on this realm or level, we are actually a \u201cprojection \u201c from the higher dimensional plane, of the second realm. <br><br>So when we look at the solidness of our surroundings from our body, the animals, trees, rocks, planets the sun etc...  all that we physically know, is created by higher dimensional space time or spirit dimensions. So there is a granularity to the dimension of time, just as there is granularity or pixels on your television screen. This is pixilated time space, imbedded within the pixilated higgsfield that IS a quantum tunnel wormhole.<br><br>So our world is of these first five lower dimensions. We can watch a three dimensional picture, or a video of a four dimensional video meaning the pictures can change in a hologram, yet we are actually in a fifth dimensional holographic world space. In history the Hindu\u2019s speak of this, as did the Mayan\u2019s or illusion. The fourth dimension of time itself is literally manufactured. So from the higher dimensional plane of the spirit or time space, it doesn\u2019t exist from that perspective. <br><br>The highest dimension which is the third compartment, is the eternal now, where all that was, IS, all that is, IS, and all that will be, IS. This is the thirteenth dimension. All the Masonic organizations mention this. All the highest levels of the ancient druids, shamans, all know of this. The 13th dimension is beyond all the dimensions of the spirit dimensions or hyper space. Everything there is of infinite knowledge, infinite omniscience, beyond the infinite bubbles or universes of time space that exist. <br><br>There is an ancient galactic war,  against those that follow satan. They have avitared mankind, bred specific classes of mankind, that can be easily broken by reikian mind control, and are demonically possessed. They put each inbred generation through sex magic blood sacrifice demonic worship ritual to place curses on them, for ever greater demonic power. Indeed they feed off of the fear from the chaos they create. Having spiritual possession, these people are as wetwear to rule this world. These people hold most of the highest positions in all the institutions of mankind. These spirits are transdimensinal evil entities that have always been among mankind for eons and exist in hyper space or the spirit dimensions. <br><br>These spirit beings have minions that exist in our universe. They come from specific places and star systems in our universe. There is an awareness of the Orion nebula and the belt of Orion, specifically the region of Sirus A and Sirus B  because of these beings which are from this region of our galaxy. These beings came here as the ancient ones that brought technologies to mankind, messed with mankind\u2019s genetics. There were the 200 that came to mount Hermon written of in scripture known as the Nephillim that mingled their seed with the seed of mankind. Their offspring became the raphim. Not being created with a spirit from God, they remain in the spirit realm roaming on earth to possess the souls of mankind.<br><br>There are also those from the Draco system, known as amphibious Draco reptilians, at the top of their power structure. So these UFO\u2019s are not unidentified at all. The Sumerian tablets are writings about them, indicating very long life spans. The bible tells of them, many ancient books tell of them. These are the last days of secular history, and these ancient writings are about to be revealed as they have been recently discovered but not yet released.<br><br>The highest levels of Masonic groups, the highest levels of the three lettered agencies, the highest levels of the Vatican, and all those at the highest levels of every government on earth and every institution of mankind, are well aware of this.  All the secret agencies on earth, all of these are in collaboration with these beings. Sabotean Satanists. Their plan is to steal, kill and destroy, and to abort all mankind.   <br><br>In 1954, the treaty of Greneda was established between the globalists within the US government and these beings, to exchange people for technologies. At the same time, contrary to the US constitution for the separation of church and state, Christian religions agreed to be placed under their control, for the tax free status that has kept religions silent, every time the globalists moved against their freedoms that otherwise would maintain the ability to speak out against laws that steal kill and destroy societies right to stand up for what is scriptural. <br><br>Among the many plans of this synagogue of Satan, is to use all manner of means to destroy man\u2019s ability to communicate with God in the spirit, and replace it with communication by the mind. So toxic food and GMO food is being used, fluoridation is used, dangerous adjuvents in vaccines are used, and all media is used to steer world perception, and to cut off the magnitie particles in the pineal gland. <br><br>This gland is connected to the chord of living waters to the soul in the mid section, the solar plexus. They want to cut off the connection of our physical body on this plane, to our spiritual body we call our soul that exists in hyper space or the spirit dimensions. It can be disconnected if you damage that portion of the brain. This literally turns people into the undead. We would be as a biological machine only, and not the spiritual being connected to our physical body, using the five senses to interact with this world. <br><br>Because of our dual nature, being of the physical and the spiritual dimensions, we can literally by our thoughts, by our intensions and by our KNOWLEDGE of reality, have the ability to CHANGE and CREATE REALITY. That makes us Godlike, because a portion of us is that seed that IS of God. <br><br>We are made of three aspects. The seed that makes us and our spirit that IS God, our souls that makes us as individuals that is also separate from our physical body, and our physical body that currently has a relatively short physical life span. <br><br>Why they hate us is because we are the children, the descendents that will transition from mortal beings, to immortal beings. We will have a portion of omniscience and a portion of omnipotence to literally change and create reality. It is understood that we are of the angelic beings that interacted with our ancestors all those generations ago, that came out of Egypt, guided by God in a manner which has never been done before in mankind\u2019s history. <br><br>What is coming now in these last days is for the restoration of all things, as it was before the fall of Lucifer in heaven, the war in heaven, and the removal of all evil that exists of those that fell from heaven with him.  God\u2019s glory will fill the whole earth.", "comment_date": "2021-07-12T13:17:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hey Brother", "comment_text": "That&#39;s what happens when you have neuropsychologist studying gravity. First of all for the experiment to be remotely valid it would have to be conducted in zero gravity. On earth you have two forces acting on your body when you&#39;re spinning. The &quot;normal&quot; everyday gravity pulling you downward and the centripetal force pushing you away from the axis. Coriolis effect was present only because the diameter of the spinning object was too small. You need an object that will complete one revolution in a few hours not every six seconds. Her experiment is pointless. Then she talks about vomiting in space and how disastrous it would be. If you have spin gravity it would be no more disastrous than vomiting on earth. Vomit would fall to the ground you&#39;re standing on. Just because you&#39;re standing inside a spinning structure in space it would not float away. Same spin gravity pushing you to the floor would push it down as well. <br><br>There is one valid point however. If you have a cylindrical object (a large tube or pipe) inside of which you&#39;re creating spin gravity or artificial gravity by spinning the cylinder the gravity would decrease the farther from the edge of the cylinder you went. So if there is 1G at ground level, if you built an apartment building inside such a space habitat the gravity would be less in the 5th floor than on ground level. And it would continue to decrease the closer to the axis (middle of the cylinder) you would get. If you reached the center of the cylinder you would become weightless and get stuck there. And if the cylinder was completely smooth on the inside and you took a fast motorcycle and race it in the opposite direction of the spin and could reach the same speed as the rotational speed of the cylinder you would eventually become weightless, because you would counteract the spin effect - you&#39;d be stuck in the same spot on the cylinder while it spins underneath you making you weightless for a split second, then you would lose speed since you&#39;re wheels have no traction and fall back down. Could be a really cool sport racing inside of a space habitat. <br><br>Another weird thing would be that by looking up you&#39;d see your neighbors hanging upside down right above you. But you&#39;d need a good pair of binoculars because they would be miles above you in a realistic setting. The diameter of the cylinder would need to be miles. Otherwise everyone would get sick. It&#39;s actually not that difficult to calculate how wide the cylinder would have to be. Otherwise the difference in gravity by your head and at your feet would be too big, since you&#39;re head is lets say 6 foot of the ground the gravity there would be a little less than at your feet. That&#39;s why you need a large ratio between average human height and the diameter of the habitat so the difference is negligible and it would not be detected. Theoretically if you had a 10 foot diameter (and you wouldn&#39;t get sick immediately) your head would reach the center of the room/object and become weightless while the rest of your body would experience different kinds of gravity. If that&#39;s not vomit inducing I don&#39;t know what is. <br><br>But in the end I&#39;d like to remind this neuropsychologist that earth spins. And very fast at that. Yet we don&#39;t experience any sickness because of it. So clearly we can tolerate spin. It&#39;s all about ratios, speed and revolutions.", "comment_date": "2021-07-12T10:14:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Burken Productions", "comment_text": "No new missions?!

Meh. The speculation that low-gravity aliens could be blobs with tentacles is no more than a scientific guess. (Low-grav lifeforms might have a wide range of body plans, just as much or more than our Earth-gravity lifeforms do.) Until we find (or they find) alien lifeforms, we won&#39;t know. The video was posted 2021-06-09. Four days later, I&#39;d guess that rock hasn&#39;t changed orbit to pursue our probe or come to invade Earth. Chances are, it&#39;s an asteroid spinning around, iwith no sneaky, hostile aliens inside. So far, humans seem to be the only ones thinking about being sneaky and hostile. Could say a lot about humans. Thing is, we have zero real idea of what real aliens might think and feel and do or what they might look like, or if they are at all compatible with Earth or Earth life. Maybe they like someplace else better, if they are anywhere around here. Maybe they&#39;ve scanned our outgoing signals and have sense enough to stay away from such a primitive, hostile species, at least unless we can ever outgrow our more idiotic fear-and-hate tendencies and act in a mature, responsible, less trigger happy way.

An actual spacecraft with an artificial gravity habitat would not show anything spinning from the outside or would be counter spinning very slowly as the radiation shields would be at least 95% of the mass.
