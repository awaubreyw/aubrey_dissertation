NASA thinks they are right. But when we look at the many horizontal layers that we find everywhere on our planet, we clearly see the effect of a repeating cataclysm. These disasters are mentioned in ancient books like the Mahabharata from India and the Popol Vuh from the Mayans and others. They tell us about a cycle of seven disasters that separate the world eras. Certainly, a cycle of regularly recurring global disasters cannot be caused by asteroid impacts or volcanic eruptions. The only possible cause is another celestial body, a planet, orbiting our sun in an eccentric orbit. Then it is close to the sun for a short period and after the crossing at a very high speed it disappears into the universe for a long time. Planet 9 exists, but it seems invisible. These disasters cause a huge tidal wave of seawater that washes over land &quot;above the highest mountains.&quot; At the end it covers the earth with a layer of wet mud, a mixture of sand, clay, lime, fossils of marine and terrestrial animals and small and larger meteorites. The Northerns hemisphere is covered wich a layer of ice that fell down &quot;in blocks as great as mountains&quot;.  These disasters  also create a cycle of civilizations. To learn much more about the recurring flood cycle, the re-creation of civilizations and its chronology and ancient high technology, read the e-book: &quot;Planet 9 = Nibiru&quot;. It can be read on any computer, tablet or smartphone.
