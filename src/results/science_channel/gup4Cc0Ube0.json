Every point of new space made by more pair conversions, allowed more space and vacuum energy that allowed more pair conversions to pop up.  Soon pair conversion was not a single Big Bang event, but an explosion of pair conversions as space ballooned up exponentially.

The antimatter particles are exactly equal in mass and number to the matter particles and the result is no net residual of matter left over.\r<br>\r<br>Running the universe back in time is not the same for energy and matter as assumed in all these models!\r<br>Think of a candle burning (like star we see today) the <b>ENERGY</b> goes back to a very small point BUT\r<br>the <b>MATTER</b> does not! The candle gets bigger until it reaches a maximum mass and then <b>STOPS!</b>\r<br>\r<br>Stars must by the second law do the same they can only go back to the point of maximum hydrogen and that is their minimum entropy state!\r<br>\r<br>That means the real Big Bang was first an expansion of space and energy with no mass to very nearly the size we observe today then the creation of stars in their lowest entropy state or maximum hydrogen fuel state.

This solves the starlight time problem if that event took place about 6000 years ago on day 4 of the creation after God had stretched forth the heavens and filled it with wave energy. It means the history of the stars we observe is real and does go back billions of years calculated by the distance but it could all have occurred 6000 years ago. It also answers why Adam could see the stars on the sixth day.\r<br>\r<br>With the discovery of gravity waves we also know space is elastic and this could explain the apparent acceleration of space as an elastic medium expanding like a spring.

It is establishing a religion of &#39;humanism&#39; with many conflicts of interest in resulting political science and money benefits to them. Not only the above&#39;s examples of needed do-or-die precision, biological structures have it too to the tune of 10^450 to 10^600 each. [that is ten with corresponding zeros behind it] These are mathematical impossibilities. Again. Evidence of intelligent design. Many PhD mathematicians consider 10^50 is the start of impossibility. These chance values go beyond the 10^80 number of atomic particles of the universe. The theory of evolution uses the chance-argument such as the appendix and whale hips being &#39;evidence&#39; for evolution. However, once intelligent design points are interjected, this chance argument put forth by evolutionist, it drops to a 50/50 chance proposal. Therefore, the intelligent design proponents has a legit point with their mathematical impossibility evidence. Don&#39;t be a double standard person with selective biased skepticism.    We are a creation folks. Not a slow evolution. The Creator&#39;s name is Jesus Christ. He offers a free gift of forever-life if you believe His work on the cross and rising from the dead was for YOU by faith. No works are necessary. The Gospel, the good news, is unique to all of the wrong-God religions and of all of the Christian cults. It works with human nature, not against. Just what an all-loving and knowing God would do. Do it today. Take the free gift of forever life.", "comment_date": "2021-10-28T15:34:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cheang Leng", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOioRdk8pvc&amp;t=1s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOioRdk8pvc&amp;t=1s</a>", "comment_date": "2021-10-28T08:18:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "imran shah", "comment_text": "This Big Bang is the biggest proof that there\u2019s God things don\u2019t just happens unless something or someone makes it happen", "comment_date": "2021-10-28T08:06:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "isaac pahl", "comment_text": "This video said nothing about what triggered the big bang", "comment_date": "2021-10-27T02:37:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Foster", "comment_text": "Can we start putting the word <b>theory</b> behind big bang again?

That\u2019s definitely true, but what science usually doesn\u2019t talk about is the process of actually experiencing these feelings. You can look at a chemical formula for dopamine, but actually experiencing it is entirely different. I believe our self awareness may be due to a living soul that is an intrinsic property of the universe. I think the brain kind of acts like radio receivers that can take this soul in from another plane of existence. That\u2019s why when people use drugs, they have out of body experiences and feel things that can\u2019t possibly be explained rationally. I think you\u2019re messing with the brain so the way it influences the soul gets funky on drugs and you FEEL funky because of this, being the soul itself. <br><br><br>We are literally the universe talking to itself in these comments. We all agree that we think and feel, but you can\u2019t explain a feeling, it\u2019s just something that we conceptualize and therefore exists in this reality.

And in the creation of yourselves, and the fact that animals are scattered (through the earth), are signs for those of assured faith. And in the alternation of night and day, and that fact that Allah sends down sustenance from the sky, and revives therewith the earth after its death, and in the change of the winds, are signs for those who are wise&quot; (45:3-5).<br><br>Big Bang?<br><br>The Qur&#39;an says that &quot;the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before We clove them asunder&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=21m30s\">21:30</a>). Following this big explosion, Allah &quot;turned to the sky, and it had been (as) smoke. He said to it and to the earth: &#39;Come together, willingly or unwillingly.&#39; They said: &#39;We come (together) in willing obedience&#39;&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=41m11s\">41:11</a>). Thus the elements and what was to become the planets and stars began to cool, come together, and form into shape, following the natural laws that Allah established in the universe.<br><br>The Qur&#39;an further states that Allah created the sun, the moon, and the planets, each with their own individual courses or orbits. &quot;It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=21m33s\">21:33</a>).<br><br>Expansion of Universe<br><br>&quot;The heavens, We have built them with power. And verily, We are expanding it&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=51m47s\">51:47</a>). There has been some historical debate among Muslim scholars about the precise meaning of this verse, since knowledge of the universe&#39;s expansion was only recently discovered.<br><br>Six Days?<br><br>The Qur&#39;an states that &quot;Allah created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six days&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=7m54s\">7:54</a>). While on the surface this might seem similar to the account related in the Bible, there are some important distinctions.<br><br>The verses that mention &quot;six days&quot; use the Arabic word &quot;youm&quot; (day). This word appears several other times in the Qur&#39;an, each denoting a different measurement of time. In one case, the measure of a day is equated with 50,000 years (70:4), whereas another verse states that &quot;a day in the sight of your Lord is like 1,000 years of your reckoning&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=22m47s\">22:47</a>). The word &quot;youm&quot; is thus understood, within the Qur&#39;an, to be a long period of time -- an era or eon. Therefore, Muslims interpret the description of a &quot;six day&quot; creation as six distinct periods or eons. The length of these periods is not precisely defined, nor are the specific developments that took place during each period.<br><br>After completing the Creation, the Qur&#39;an describes that Allah &quot;settled Himself upon the Throne&quot; (57:4) to oversee His work. A distinct point is made to counter the Biblical idea of a day of rest: &quot;We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=50m38s\">50:38</a>).<br><br>Allah is never &quot;done&quot; with His work, because the process of creation is ongoing. Each new child who is born, every seed that sprouts into a sapling, every new species that appears on earth, is part of the ongoing process of Allah&#39;s creation. &quot;He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then established Himself on the Throne. He knows what enters within the heart of the earth, and what comes forth out of it, what comes down from heaven, and what mounts up to it. And He is with you wherever you may be. And Allah sees well all that you do&quot; (57:4).<br><br>The Qur&#39;anic account of creation is in line with modern scientific thought about the development of the universe and life on earth. Muslims acknowledge that life developed over a long period of time, but see Allah&#39;s power behind it all. Descriptions of creation in the Qur&#39;an are set in context to remind the readers of Allah&#39;s majesty and wisdom. &quot;What is the matter with you, that you are not conscious of Allah&#39;s majesty, seeing that it is He Who has created you in diverse stages? See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another, and made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun as a (glorious) lamp? And Allah has produced you from the earth, growing (gradually)&quot; (71:13-17).<br><br>Life Came From Water<br><br>The Qur&#39;an describes that Allah &quot;made from water every living thing&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=21m30s\">21:30</a>). Another verse describes how &quot;Allah has created every animal from water. Of them are some that creep on their bellies, some that walk on two legs, and some that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills, for truly Allah has power over all things&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=24m45s\">24:45</a>). These verses support the scientific theory that life began in the Earth&#39;s oceans.<br><br>Creation of Adam &amp; Eve<br><br>While Islam recognizes the general idea of the development of life in stages, over a period of time, human beings are considered as a special act of creation. Islam teaches that human beings are a unique life form that was created by Allah in a special way, with unique gifts and abilities unlike any other: a soul and conscience, knowledge, and free will. In short, Muslims do not believe that human beings randomly evolved from apes. The life of human beings began with the creation of two people, a male and a female named Adam and Hawwa (Eve).<br><br>The Qur&#39;an describes how Allah created Adam: &quot;We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape...&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=15m26s\">15:26</a>). And, &quot;He began the creation of man from clay, and made his progeny from a quintessence of fluid&quot; (32:7-8). Thus, human beings have a fundamental attachment to the earth.<br><br>While the creation of Eve is not described in detail, the Qur&#39;an does make it clear that a &quot;mate&quot; was created with Adam, from the same nature and soul. &quot;It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her in love&quot; (7:189).

I don&#39;t know. And are we alone in the universe? Yes! How humans got here, no one knows but evolution is just another theory but taught as fact. And being truthful to the question of are we alone? The obvious answer is Yes.  Why? because we are alone, the chances of Earth being duplicated and life-forming anywhere else is a billion to one, probably more than a billion. We do not know of any kind of life anywhere outside our own atmosphere, yet we tend to teach things like alien abductions and UFOs as being real when all we have a few blurred images and no evidence, so are we alone? Shit yeh! As for a big bang? Why not just say that happened as God farted and now we got all this? That would make more sense as we know we fart methane and that would explain a lot eg the reason space smells like burnt steak? Nice presentation though but you&#39;re 100% wrong about all this started from a Big Bang, what fuelled this Big Bang? What was the ignition?

The measurement problem is that we can only measure between 2 points in one dimension of space and one of time time in any single act of measurement, so we cannot measure the total value of the energy we can only deduce it. What we must do is use our understanding to apply the result from one dimension and extrapolate what the total energy generated within the system must be. We must also apply the very fundamental law of physics (and karma) cause and effect (for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction) and combine it with the reality of what the inequality that solves the double slit experiment proves, that energy is CREATED and propagates out in waves. This shows that it is not in fact that energy is conserved but that the initial value of energy detected along one dimension is conserved. It is always propagated with the same value in all directions but detected along one dimension which for total E (TE) is TE=E.\u039b the \u039b is \u039b=13.2521402919^2t also linked to the number of dimension (13 like a rubik&#39;s cube) 13 to the power of time by 2 gives us the wave propagating out in all possible directions in positive and negative time, time cannot be 1 because time only becomes detectable with separation or stretch in the fabric and that minimum stretch is \u0127 so we have 4.pi.\u0127. To twice the power of time because the energy detected is also propagated back into negative (antimatter) time from the initial source of the wave (and again backwards from every point/particle that is passed in the field but this propagates inwards so is immediately cancelled out). In summary: The fundamental building block of spacetime has 13 spacial dimensions (like a rubik&#39;s cube) so with every increment in conscious time the oscillation emanating from the centre of that block is propagated out in 13 directions to the power of twice the measured time.<br><br>This is also consistent with the proof of the Reimann hypothesis s=-tx.+tx=0 the total value of energy E at any point x is always the total energy arriving then propagated in positive time and negative time.<br><br>At the quantum point 0 the spherical field particle is the source of the wave and every propagation out from that point in dimensionless numbers has time as 1 which is the radius. That is until another force acts upon some part of the wave, in the field that force is \u03c0^p otherwise known as curvature and p being the total pressure caused by the angle at which energy hits curvature.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps now physicists can start to embrace the new physics revealed by the double slit experiment and understand the urgency. The first law of thermodynamics is wrong, it is a mistake made due to the measurement problem (we can only measure between 2 points in one dimension of space and time)\u00a0 Einstein&#39;s Relativity predicted white holes that generate their own energy and matter, yet 100 years later after almost every other prediction of Relativity has been verified physicists are still using an old model of stars as using up a finite supply of energy, models that do not add up (multiple anomalies).<br><br>New mathematics and evidence show OUR SUN IS A WHITE HOLE generating it&#39;s own energy as heat/light and matter (ejected as solar winds). The inequality that solves the double slit experiment proves what the interference pattern suggested, that energy is created all the time, the 1st law of thermodynamics and the measurement problem has blinded physicists from the reality. The full Genuine Theory of Everything has been solved but it is facing a wall of silence and/or misunderstanding. It is backed with the highest quality peer reviewed experiment data and robust mathematics.<br><br>Elsewhere, Scientists have found evidence that the sun goes nova (mini supernova) every 12,000 years usually causing mass extinctions, the evidence indicates the last one that happened 12,000 years ago wiped out the woolly mammoths and Neanderthals.

(Courtesy: NASA)<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>In 1916, Albert Einstein formulated his General Theory of Relativity that indicated that the universe must be either expanding or contracting.\u00a0 Confirmation of the expanding-universe theory finally came in 1929 in the hands of the well known American astronomer Edwin Hubble.<br><br>By observing redshifts[2]\u00a0in the light wavelengths emitted by galaxies, Hubble found that galaxies were not fixed in their position; instead, they were actually moving away from us with speeds proportional to their distance from earth (Hubble&#39;s Law). \u00a0The only explanation for this observation was that the universe had to be expanding. \u00a0Hubble\u2019s discovery is regarded as one of the greatest in the history of astronomy. \u00a0In 1929, he published the velocity-time relation which is the basis of modern cosmology. \u00a0In the years to come, with further observations, the expanding-universe theory was accepted by scientists and astronomers alike.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc<br><br>With the Hooker Telescope, Hubble discovered that the galaxies were moving away us. \u00a0Above are photos of known galaxies. \u00a0(Courtesy: NASA)<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>Yet, astonishingly well before telescopes were even invented and well before Hubble published his Law, Prophet Muhammad used to recite a verse of the Quran to his companions that ultimately stated that the universe is expanding.<br><br>\u201cAnd the heaven We created with might, and indeed We are (its) expander.\u201d (Quran 51:47)<br><br>At the time of the revelation of the Quran, the word \u201cspace\u201d was not known, and people used the word \u201cheaven\u201d to refer to what lies above the Earth. \u00a0In the above verse, the word \u201cheaven\u201d is referring to space and the known universe. \u00a0The verse points out that space, and thus the universe, happens to be expanding, just as Hubble\u2019s Law states.<br><br>That the Quran mentioned such a fact centuries before the invention of the first telescope, at a time when there was primitive knowledge in science, is considered remarkable. \u00a0This is more so considering that, like many people in his time, Prophet Muhammad happened to be illiterate and simply could not have been aware of such facts by himself. \u00a0Could it be that he had truly received divine revelation from the Creator and Originator of the universe?<br><br>The Big Bang Theory<br><br>Soon after Hubble\u00a0published his theory, he went on to discover that not only were galaxies moving away from the Earth, but were also moving away from one another. \u00a0This meant that the universe happened to be expanding in every direction, in the same way a balloon expands when filled with air. \u00a0Hubble\u2019s new findings placed the foundations for the Big Bang theory.<br><br>The Big Bang theory states that around 12-15 billion years ago the universe came into existence from one single extremely hot and dense point, and that something triggered the explosion of this point that brought about the beginning of the universe. \u00a0The universe, since then, has been expanding from this single point. \u00a0<br><br>Later, in 1965,\u00a0radio astronomers\u00a0Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson made a Noble Prize winning discovery that confirmed the Big Bang theory. \u00a0Prior to their discovery, the theory implied that if the single point from which the universe came into existence was initially extremely hot, then remnants of this heat should be found. \u00a0This remnant heat is exactly what Penzias and Wilson found.\u00a0 In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered a 2.725 degree Kelvin Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) that spreads through the universe.\u00a0 Thus, it was understood that the radiation found was a remnant of the initial stages of the Big Bang.\u00a0 Presently, the Big Bang theory is accepted by the vast majority of scientists and astronomers.<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>\ufffc<br><br>A microwave map of the leftover from the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe. (Courtesy: NASA)<br><br>\u00a0<br><br>It is mentioned in the Quran:<br><br>\u201cHe (God) is the Originator of the heavens and the earth\u2026\u201d (Quran 6:101)<br><br>\u201cIs not He who created the heavens and the earth Able to create the likes of them?\u00a0 Yes; and He is the Knowing Creator. His command is only when He intends a thing that He says to it, \u2018Be,\u2019 and it is.\u201d (Quran 36:81-82)<br><br>The above verses prove that the universe had a beginning, that God was behind its creation, and all that God needs to do inorder to create is to say \u201cBe,\u201d and it is. \u00a0Could this be an explanation as to what triggered off the explosion that brought about the beginning of the universe?<br><br>The Quran also mentions:<br><br>\u201cHave those who disbelieved not considered that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, then We separated them, and made from water every living thing? \u00a0Then will they not believe?\u201d (Quran 21:30)<br><br>Muslim scholars who have explained the previous verse mention that the heavens and earth were once one, and then God caused them to separate and form into the seven heavens and Earth. \u00a0Yet, due to the limitations of science and technology at the time of the revelation of the Quran (and for centuries to follow), no scholar was able to give much detail about how exactly the heavens and earth were created.\u00a0 What the scholars could explain was the precise meaning of each word in Arabic in the verse, as well as the overall meaning of the verse.<br><br>In the previous verse, the Arabic words\u00a0ratq\u00a0and\u00a0fataq\u00a0are used.\u00a0 The word\u00a0ratq\u00a0can be translated into \u201centity\u201d \u201csewn to\u201d \u201cjoined together\u201d or \u201cclosed up\u201d. \u00a0The meaning of these translations all circulate around something that is mixed and that has a separate and distinct existence. \u00a0The verb\u00a0fataq\u00a0is translated into \u201cWe unstitched\u201d \u201cWe clove them asunder\u201d \u201cWe separated\u201d or \u201cWe have opened them\u201d. \u00a0These meanings imply that something comes into being by an action of splitting or tearing apart. \u00a0The sprouting of a seed from the soil is a good example of a similar illustration of the meaning of the verb\u00a0fataq.<br><br>With the introduction of the Big Bang theory, it soon became clear to Muslim scholars that the details mentioned with regards to the theory go identically hand in hand with the description of the creation of the universe in verse 30 of chapter 21 of the Quran. \u00a0The theory states that all the matter in the universe came into existence from one single extremely hot and dense point; that exploded and brought about the beginning of the universe, matches what is mentioned in the verse that the heaven and Earth (thus the universe) where once joined together, and \u00a0then split apart.\u00a0 Once again, the only possible explanation is that Prophet Muhammad had truly received divine revelation from God, The Creator and Originator of the universe.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-05-08T16:46:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maurice Alexander", "comment_text": "God Is Real Man...", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T19:26:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omar Elghoul", "comment_text": "They concluded that nothing triggered the bang.

Peer through a modern microscope into the amazing intricacy of molecules and atoms. And what do we see? This\u200b\u2014that in the stupendously large, as well as in the minutely small, yes, in all the physical universe\u2014\u200bthere is order, beauty and design. And where we see design, what do we conclude? Does not the Bible indicate the answer, at Hebrews 3:4?\u200b\u2014\u201cOf course, every house is constructed by someone, but he that constructed all things is God.\u201d<br><br>And what about order? It was the God-fearing scientist Sir Isaac Newton who first noted that things in the universe were moving from order to disorder. This led to the conclusion that, unless there is purposeful intervention by some outside force, every physical transformation in the world about us must be accompanied by a loss in design. The original design is breaking down. In the first place, then, Someone must have designed, created and put things in order. Without that Designer\u2019s intervention, order will keep on breaking down.<br><br>That an intelligent Designer brought forth the universe is in harmony with what some scientists call the \u201cbig-bang\u201d theory of creation. In recent years this theory has gained ascendancy over the \u201csteady-state\u201d theory, which claims that the universe has existed eternally, is without beginning. But we do not have to rely on the shifting sands of modern scientific theory to prove that there is a Creator. For the Creator himself makes clear who and what he is: \u201cThis is what Jehovah has said, . . . \u2018I myself have made the earth and have created even man upon it. I\u200b\u2014my own hands have stretched out the heavens, and all the army of them I have commanded.\u2019\u201d (Isa. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=45m11s\">45:11</a>, 12) The evidence of his creatorship is to be observed and marveled at in so many things that we see around us.<br><br>\u201cI . . . HAVE CREATED EVEN MAN\u201d<br><br>No doubt, at some time or another, we have all fondled the tiny fingers of an infant\u200b\u2014so delicate, so beautifully formed, so precious\u2014\u200bso much more refined than animal claws! And no doubt we have reflected on how that baby\u2019s small life got started from a mother\u2019s egg the size of a pin point, by union with a father\u2019s sperm far too small to be seen by the unaided eye. Yes, we all had a tiny beginning, in an egg cell that divided and divided, and kept on dividing, till finally the more than 10,000,000,000,000 cells that make up the adult human \u201cknew\u201d when to leave off dividing.<br><br>The entire process of conception and selective growth is marvelous beyond our comprehension. But it is not beyond the comprehension of God, for he is its Author. As King David said: \u201cMy bones were not hidden from you when I was made in secret. . . . Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, and in your book all its parts were down in writing.\u201d Yes, it is according to the \u201cblueprint\u201d made by a loving Creator that we were formed, given a marvelous body and endowed with moral attributes and qualities designed to keep our lives in balance and to make living a constant delight. So we have every reason to join David in his melodious words uttered 3,000 years ago: \u201cO Jehovah, you have searched through me, and you know me. . . . You kept me screened off in the belly of my mother. I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, as my soul is very well aware.\u201d\u200b\u2014Ps. 139:1, 13-16.<br><br>There is no end to the wonders built into God\u2019s creation, man. How can some claim that life started by blind chance, and that man evolved from the amoeba by a series of accidents? In the infinitesimal human cell there are the ladderlike DNA molecules, each programmed for that particular individual, the same messages of life being written in each multiplying cell. These tell which cells must go to make up the eyes, the nose, the tongue, the ears, the teeth, the skin, the organs and all other body parts. They make sure that the \u201ckind\u201d is distinctly human, not ape or dog or any other lower animal. They spell out the inheritable characteristics of the individual. The specialized parts that come out of this growth process do indeed bespeak a brilliant Designer!<br><br>MAN\u2019S MIND<br><br>Unquestionably the most amazing part of God\u2019s earthly creation, man, is the brain, in which is centered the mind. The brain makes rapid growth, reaching three quarters of its adult weight in the first two years of life. No wonder that our toddlers are full of curiosity and questions: \u2018Who made the sky? the birds? the cat? the flowers? Who made me?\u2019 Why, even at that early age, the youngster has observed that things about him have makers. He concludes, therefore, that all things had a Maker. Why is it that so many adults have strayed from such logical reasoning?<br><br>The brain itself is a marvel of living electronics. Literally thousands of scientists may work for years in producing and programming a computer suited to a particular field. Yet they must concede that, if they produced a computer to match the capacity and versatility of the human brain, they would need a multistory skyscraper to house it all. Yet the three-pound human brain, small enough to hold in one hand, is fully equipped to take care of its own programming, and to handle every field essential to human living. Moreover, as it picks up its messages from the senses of sight, hearing, touch, taste and smell, and triggers the speech and actions of its owner, it serves on a plane that no man-made computer will ever be able to attain. And what computer will ever operate from a heart exercising love, human kindness, thankfulness, appreciation? What computer will ever think, reason, explain, or worship its Maker?<br><br>In contemplation of man\u2019s marvelous makeup, and of all the created world about us, concerning God\u2019s visible works, we can say with Job: \u201cLook! These are the fringes of his ways, and what a whisper of a matter has been heard of him!\u201d (Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=26m14s\">26:14</a>) But we do not need to stop at hearing only a whisper concerning our Creator.

If we use our balloon example for time for example it takes longer to blow a balloon up but shorter time to deflate a balloon, if we figure out that there is a correlation between the (expansion and destruction of our universe) and time  (ie balloon of universe expands and pops 20 times/ threshold of time) that would mean that when time goes backwards at an accelerated rated after reaching the threshold (there would be a decrease in the amount of balloon expansionions and explosions. if the concept of time having a threshold is true we could assume that when time reverses it could lead to a universe with a different set of laws as compared to our universe. A universe composed of a faster speed of movement which can be incromprehendable for us to imagine. Particles will literally start moving faster than the speed of light .this all will cause a buildup in reactions which will be too great of a reaction causing time itself(not the universe) to implode. Thus causing a state of;<br>either  \u201cstraight up static\u201d nothing will happen, (this goes on for however long the threshold of time is in the negative direction, eventually after the loop of static concludes) time will move back in the forwards direction and cause another Big Bang (in time) which will goes on through time and all the static time and particles was kept in the reverse of time, will go forwards and thus restart the universe. <br>Thank y\u2019all for listening if this made sense ok if I\u2019m just stupid ok no one truly knows how this world works.

Basically stating that something came out of nothing, because there was no matter before the elements were mixed together. In other words, God states in the book of genesis \u201cNow the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God...God said, \u201cLet there be light,\u201d and there was light.\u201d It shows you how the Big Bang theory, aliens, more theories, etc. are all just scientific terms that have already taken place within the Bible.

I was really an undeniable atheist/unbeliever, until I tried Christianity out because I was afraid of death; but then I realized that it wasn\u2019t about me being afraid of death anymore, but about how God loved mankind so much that he gave his only Son so that if anyone believes in him shall have eternal life. It made me wonder; why would God sacrifice himself for the sake of such incompetent, imperfect, morally wrong, corrupted human beings who might not even care about Him? The answer was so simple, which I had struggled for so many years, the answer is because He loves us.

However, experimental physics tells us that whenever matter is created from energy, such a reaction also produces\u00a0antimatter. Antimatter has similar properties to matter, except the charges of the particles are reversed. (So whereas a proton has a positive charge, an antiproton has a negative charge.) Any reaction where energy is transformed into matter produces an exactly equal amount of antimatter; there are no known exceptions.<br>The big bang (which has no matter to begin with, only energy) should have produced exactly equal amounts of matter and antimatter, and that should be what we see today. But we do not. The visible universe is comprised almost entirely of matter\u2014with only trace amounts of antimatter anywhere.<br><br>This devastating problem for the big bang is actually consistent with biblical creation; it is a design feature. God created the universe to be essentially matter only\u2014and it\u2019s a good thing He did. When matter and antimatter come together, they violently destroy each other. If the universe had equal amounts of matter and antimatter (as the big bang requires), life would not be possible.<br><br>Missing Population III Stars<br><br>The big-bang model by itself can only account for the existence of the three lightest elements (hydrogen, helium, and trace amounts of lithium). This leaves about 90 or so of the other naturally occurring elements to be explained. Since the conditions in the big bang are not right to form these heavier elements (as big-bang supporters readily concede), secular astronomers believe that stars have produced the remaining elements by nuclear fusion in the core. This is thought to occur in the final stages of a massive star as it explodes (a supernova). The explosion then distributes the heavier elements into space. Second- and third-generation stars are thus \u201ccontaminated\u201d with small amounts of these heavier elements.<br><br>If this story were true, then the\u00a0first\u00a0stars would have been comprised of only the three lightest elements (since these would have been the only elements in existence initially). Some such stars3 should still be around today since their potential life span is calculated to exceed the (big bang) age of the universe. Such stars would be called \u201cPopulation III\u201d stars.4\u00a0Amazingly (to those who believe in the big bang), Population III stars have not been found anywhere. All known stars have at least trace amounts of heavy elements in them. It is amazing to think that our galaxy alone is estimated to have over 100 billion stars in it, yet not one star has been discovered that is comprised of only the three lightest elements.", "comment_date": "2020-08-19T14:56:46Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "BangtanGrapes", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gup4Cc0Ube0&amp;t=0m12s\">0:12</a> Yall see that dark space around the big bang before it started expanding?

However, actually, we don&#39;t know how small of a dot that this, &quot;thing,&quot; was. The explosion occurred. How it occurred could be different than imagined. The universe is filled with a lot of tremendously different stuff. Yet, it could have become or developed into an overall homogeneous area when taking into account, all of space time. This what we see in black holes, now tends to support (philosophy, not quantum mechanics) the idea, that from the smallest and most primordial materials/energies/strings, the tiniest and most basic of whatever was there at the time, may have simply been an amalgamation of both the largest and at the same time, the smallest black hole that has ever existed. The beginning was a long time forming. (I suspect that even if there are multiverses, fundamental quantum mechanics may be the same for each of the many universes or aka: multiverse(s). Having come from a black hole, we have only to look at small, medium and large black holes that exist and that we are finding now, and sort of, &quot;Map,&quot; their complete composition and also their motion to extrapolate how the first big black hole functioned. It of course worked apparently with less elemental particles than we have now, although we don&#39;t know that but we think that because of the study of various kinds of stars and their destruction and formation and reformation and collission and how elements within are then changed during the &quot;chemistry experiement&quot; of each start studied, producing more and more of certain elements via the actions and interactions of various atoms or even molecules and therefore observing the creation of newer and more complex elements (although, the more complex, the more unstable they appears and short-lived with some elements lasting a small fraction of a second. Since we don&#39;t have a complete handle on black holes, as yet, we can&#39;t rule out a different way of making certain elements that could possibly exist within the black hole.<br><br>How powerful? Well, what are those ejection rays called? It&#39;s the Black Hole&#39;s version of a laser gun, apparently jutting out in two directions as once, generally opposite one another. (Newton just woke up when he heard the word opposite). That is pretty powerful.<br><br>Obviously once &quot;stuff&quot; reached a mass of about 3X the sun or a little smaller or larger, when it was the first and only stuff in existence, the very first thing that started to happen was that the &quot;stuff&quot; complied with a lot of Einstein&#39;s theories and the other theories since then of quantum mechanics. Since the beginning started space time, we have said, we have also noted that, &quot;something,&quot; was going on before the BB or whatever happened to create the universe that we now see along with its past, and that something has a name. But listening to the physicists talk about the, &quot;beginning.&quot; they are a bit less certain in what it was that was happening, but it was, &quot;pre-space Time.&quot; (Oh good. Another one for the Glossary of Astronomy: PST, which stands for: &quot;Pre-Space Time.&quot; So what was going on in Pre Space Time? (PST)? Possibly the same things that we have examples in front of us now. Except there was no visible light; no stars; hence no galaxies; no exo-planets; no planets; no left over space junk from collisions; no giant dwards. no black holes; no quasars; nothing really in explosive motion. No space-filling gasses. Instead, there was what ever existed before all of it wandered around in space eventually finding one source of magnetic draw that tended to move everything towards it. The development of the first black hole.<br><br>Further, the black hole not only developed magnetism, it pulled in everything (or almost everything, if some &quot;stuff,&quot; with no magnetic attraction at all existed, but this has to do later with dark matter and energy of a different type; this however doesn&#39;t need to exist at all for this model.<br><br>As everything, all stuff, was pulled into the first EH Event Horizon, it was possibly changed, possibly not, or change is some, but not all cases in basic composition of what it was. But all stuff drawn in was subject to magnetic pull.<br><br>The swirling motion that we now see in black holes, likely existed in this first black hole with travel to the black hole being like we see it now. Over time (Pre Space Time), there was only one place in the universe that had Space Time, &quot;warped,&quot; in the overall fabric of space time and that would be the original black hole.<br><br>Of course as all the material and energy were gradually drawn into the OBH (Original Black Hole) its power increased. This afforded this object or thing more power and more reach. This continued until all the material that had been floating around in space (except possible anti-matter or certain dark material that doesn&#39;t have an ability to be influenced in any way by magnetic pull, if such thing exists...yes, with that or those exceptions, everntually everything that was (is and will be) was pulled into the OBH.<br><br>I would like to add the concept of layering to this model. I believe it is possible that as items moved more and more slowly towards the center of the black hole (or within a warped tube shape &quot;thing,&quot; or OBH, the material became deposited with other like materials. No matter how dense the OBH got; no matter the temperature changes because of increasing magnetism and density, still, like energy and like matter tended to group together, since they had equal attraction to the magnetic center of the black hole, that portion which has or had the most pull or magnetism. Huge quantities of same, in fact.<br><br>Chemistry continued to occur under the rules of both physics and quantum mechanics. The speed and speed change of material being pullled into the OBH has a hame: BHT or &quot;Black Hole Time&quot;. Black hole time includes the law that both remain the same and change. Explained by scientists as they enumerated the qualities of the EH or Event Horizon, There was a discussion not only of the point of no return, but the continued &quot;I&quot; or &quot;Information&quot; that continued on its path into the black hole via the spirals that are seen, as the OBH &quot;vacuumed,&quot; or, &quot;pulled,&quot; energy and material that lay around the universe was run into by chance or purpose, by the OBH. The job of the OBH was really just to collect. And collect it did. and it kept collecting and kept spiraling in its interior and became more dense and perhaps hotter as well, until something called &quot;BHM&quot; &quot;Black Hole Mechanics&quot; played out until this ongoing process developed a, &quot;Black Hole Terminus&quot; or a &quot;BHF&quot; (Black Hole   or Black Hole Fuse, or a condtion of &quot;BHI&quot;, &quot;Black Hole Ignition&quot;. The status of the Black Hole Terminus and its mechanics while not known, may be like a Black Hole Trigger. (Also a &quot;BHT&quot;. About the time that the Black Hole Terminus is reached, with full reorgainization of materials reached, energy included, some force created the BHT, or Black Hole Trigger. This started the so-called BB or Big Bang. At this point, Black Hole Time, or Black Hole Development Time reached the end of the road of this form of occurrence. The SBHC (&quot;Sudden Black Hole Change&quot;) began as a result of this trigger which is a part of quantum mechanics that presently cannot be recreated experimentally. Perhaps it was the opposite of what is known presently about ignition; perhaps not. Then there became the Black Hole Sudden Change and that which had been going on eternally, to that point changed what was happening. The Big Bang or its equivalent happened.<br><br>Space time and Space Chemical Change Time began at just about the same time.<br><br>LO PBB BHM - (Left-over-post Big Bang Black Hole Material) - It is in this first critical moments of the Original Black Hole Change (OBHC) that a material formed inside of the OBH (Original Black Hole) that was so dense and so magnetic, that it escaped the black hole to roam the universe in an &quot;ejection.&quot; This material resulted in small, medium and Large Black Hole material, which eventually became their own black holes.<br><br>Further, Black Hole Dark Matter, also was ejected from the OBH, explaining what approximately 80% or the remaining matter and energy is, that makes up the composition of the Universe.<br><br>Clearly, if any of the above model, which I&#39;ve been thinking about philosophically is true, there is not only little doubt, there is no doubt that the unification of quantum mechanics and really, Newtonian physics; and the many other theories are seen as unified. Anything unexplained was created during the OBH and or during the OBHT Original Black Hole Trigger (and its subsequent results) at the time of the BB, which itself has a time: Big Bang Time, or the time that it took for the Big Bang to occur, before all &quot;stuff&quot; slowed down enough for true, &quot;Space Time,&quot; to begin and to be seen, observed, measured on an anomaly called, &quot;Earth,&quot; by the persons who occupy it at present.<br><br>Alex Ford (07/18/2020)", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T20:41:13Z", "likes_count": 50}, {"comment_by": "Charles Rooks", "comment_text": "That colored boys eyes all bulged out kills me.", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T18:57:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SANDZ KICKZ", "comment_text": "An how is it posible that everything moving away from us if the andromeda galaxy is going to collide with us eventually", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T09:44:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kumar C", "comment_text": "Kumpfu panda", "comment_date": "2020-07-18T03:30:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Light", "comment_text": "&quot;Have those who disbelieved not considered that the skies and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing?

Some argued it had always existed: that it was \u201cinfinitely old.\u201d This agreed with the worldview of ancient philosophers and then-current atheism. On the other hand, there were logical reasons to think the universe could not be \u201cinfinitely old,\u201d such as causality. For most of history, there was no empirical evidence proving the universe had an objective \u201cbeginning.\u201d Atheism particularly held to the idea of an \u201cinfinitely old\u201d universe as a reason to dismiss God as unnecessary.<br><br>This situation changed drastically in the first half of the twentieth century, as several discoveries were made leading to the formation of the Big Bang theory. Over several decades, those who preferred the idea of an eternal universe made many attempts to explain away hard evidence, but to no avail. The result was secular science lending tremendous support to the creation account of the Bible.<br><br>Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, published in 1916, suggested the universe either had to be constantly expanding or constantly contracting. So, Einstein added a \u201ccosmological constant\u201d to his equations, for no other reason than to maintain the possibility of a static, eternal universe. Einstein later called this the \u201cbiggest blunder\u201d of his career.<br><br>The work of Edwin Hubble in the 1920s proved the universe is expanding. This finding contradicted Einstein\u2019s cosmological constant and left non-believing astrophysicists unhappy. Their discomfort was made even worse with the contributions of Georges Lema\u00eetre, a Roman Catholic priest and astronomer. Lema\u00eetre noted that the combination of general relativity theory and Hubble\u2019s discoveries implies a beginning. If the universe is currently expanding, then at some time in the past, the entire universe would have been contained in some infinitesimally small point. This idea is foundational to the Big Bang theory.<br><br>Over the next several decades, physicists tried to salvage the eternality of the universe by proposing everything from the Milne model (1935) to the steady state theory (1948). In many (if not most) cases, these models were proposed explicitly because the implications of a non-eternal universe were \u201ctoo religious.\u201d<br><br>The year 1964 brought about the Nobel Prize-winning discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation\u2014something predicted by the earliest Big Bang theorists in the 1940s. For all intents and purposes, that discovery made the \u201cbeginning\u201d of the universe an inescapable fact of modern science. The question was no longer \u201cdid the universe have a beginning?\u201d but \u201chow did the universe begin?\u201d<br><br>Evidence for the Big Bang, regardless of how one interprets it, is a stunning example of science and theology intersecting. According to objective, empirical science, all space, time, and energy came into existence together in a single moment: a \u201cbeginning.\u201d Before the Big Bang, there was no time. There was no space. Then, suddenly, an exceedingly dense, incredibly hot, infinitesimal ball of something\u2014everything\u2014appeared somewhere, somehow for reasons unknown and began to expand rapidly with our whole universe inside of it. If true, the Big Bang theory all but confirms the view espoused by Judeo-Christianity for thousands of years.<br><br>Astrophysicist Dr. Robert Jastrow phrased it this way in his book God and the Astronomers (New York: W.W. Norton, 1978, p. 116): \u201cFor the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries.\u201d<br><br>Why? Because, as Jastrow explained in a subsequent interview, \u201cAstronomers now find they have painted themselves into a corner because they have proven, by their own methods, that the world began abruptly in an act of creation to which you can trace the seeds of every star, every planet, every living thing in this cosmos and on the earth. . . . That there are what I or anyone would call supernatural forces at work is now, I think, a scientifically proven fact\u201d (\u201cA Scientist Caught Between Two Faiths: Interview with Robert Jastrow,\u201d Christianity Today, August 6, 1982, pp. 15, 18).<br><br>It\u2019s important to note that, prior to these discoveries, disbelief in God was tied closely to the idea of an eternal, un-caused and un-created universe. Afterwards, however, non-believers began to claim that these advances in science actually disproved God. What had always been interpreted as clear support for a Creator\u2014and resisted for that very reason\u2014almost overnight turned into the claim that atheists had been right all along.<br><br>This attitude, unfortunately, led to a corresponding reaction from the creationist community. Just as many astrophysicists felt that the expanding universe theory was a ploy to inject religion into science, many Christians have come to feel that the Big Bang is an effort to undermine the biblical account of creation. Other Christians, however, feel that the Big Bang is consistent with the Bible\u2019s account and welcome such compelling evidence for the creation of the universe.<br><br>With that said, it is important to understand that the Big Bang theory is just that\u2014a theory. The exact nature or cause of that \u201cbeginning\u201d has not been explicitly proved by empirical science, nor can it be.<br><br>If Christians are to have an objection to the Big Bang theory, it should only be in the atheistic presuppositions that often go along with it. The idea itself\u2014that the universe came into existence in an instantaneous expansion from an infinitely small point\u2014is compatible with an orthodox view of creation. Scripture only says that God created (Genesis 1:1); it does not specify how. The fact that non-believers were so opposed to the Big Bang theory, on religious grounds, speaks to how powerfully it supports the Genesis account.<br>Both I and J were used interchangeably by scribes to express the sound of both the vowel and the consonant.

The black hole was so massive that is was absorbing so much matter and it just couldn&#39;t take anymore and thus it exploded.

They are stuck with equations, observations &amp; demonstrations. They attempt to say that by making backward extrapolstion of the process of accelerated expanding universe, their maths tells them that the universe gets reduced to a point smaller than an atom!

As material and/or matter condensed the gravitational force compressing them increased. At one point in time as material reached their flashpoint there would have been explosions. However these explosions were contained by an extremely strong gravitational force. Much like a black hole, the gravitational force was so much that not even light could escape it. Once everything reached its flashpoint and gravitational force increased, as material was sucked in by gravity the singularity was formed. Eventually even the singularity would reach its flash point, that would be the trigger for the big bang. Upon reaching it\u2019s flashpoint all matter now can overcome the strong gravitational force and is spread and scattered throughout our visible universe. There are black holes out there today. Who is to say that in the middle of this black hole is not a singularity waiting to form another big bang and another universe.

Alam niyo lahat ng bagay na nakikita natin o hindi nakikita ay likha ng Dios yan hindi nalang yan basta basta biglang lumitaw o sumabog nalang.

Dahil may taong nag iisip kung paano makakagawa ng kape at gumagawa ng kape kaya ka nagkaroon ng kape. Hindi yon basta basta lilitaw, kahit na ipagtabi tabi mo yung asukal, gatas at kape sa isang tabi kahit na maghintay ka ng isang libong taon hindi ka naman magkakaroon ng kape kung ipagtatabi mo lang sila sa sulok eh kaya may taong gagalaw o mag iisip para gumawa ng isang kape.
