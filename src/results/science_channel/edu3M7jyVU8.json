Models of gravitation are known to be crude approximations. They break down completely as scale decreases below the subatomic level, which is the whole foundation of string theory, and the search for a grand unified theory, one which reconciles quantum mechanics with general relativity, finding a model that explains one force that finds expression in the four fundamental forces. Problem with black holes, as well as Dark Matter, is that we extrapolate a broken theory out to extreme scales and then make additional models on top of those. Instead of acknowledging that these models are insufficient, we cover them with newspaper and gaslight ourselves. <br>Another issue is stellar mechanics. We truly don\u2019t know how stars function, despite the appearance of absolute confidence in mainstream astrophysics. There are a number of competing models in fact, all of which lead to very different circumstances around the life cycles and potential supernova events they undergo at the end of these cycles. Professor Pierre Robataille with YT channel Sky Scholar has some great information on this. <br>Yet another issue are neutron stars. They violate accepted laws of physics both in their proposed creation and inner mechanics. Yet neutron stars are a foundational aspect to the formation of supposed black holes. <br>There are many other grave issues with modern astrophysics, most important IMO is the notion of cosmic redshift having been disproven as a gauge of distance by professor Halton Arp in the 80s/90s. This is why I left the field years ago, it\u2019s become polluted with ad hoc theory masquerading as absolute fact, and the unwillingness of scientists to acknowledge these serious deficits is downright offensive. <br>It\u2019s not an easy field to study, since we have no laboratories large enough to really examine and test all these models, but we do need to be honest about how little we actually know, and about our current limitations.", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T17:21:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "David Campos", "comment_text": "I&#39;m betting that Supermassive Black Holes are left over from other Big Bangs, not our Big Bang.", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T16:49:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eco Smith", "comment_text": "they come from Muse albums...just the one album", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T16:09:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Neerav Trivedi", "comment_text": "I wonder if our universe is far older than 13.8 billion years?", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T16:09:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Justin Yi-Riley", "comment_text": "Saw this guy from Neil deGrasse Tysons show StarTalk", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T16:03:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TK Skagen", "comment_text": "Why was it Today (12, May 2022) that my local news just found out/released that our Galaxy (Milky Way) has a Black Hole at it&#39;s center?<br>Thanks to this Channel (and others) I have known for at least 6 Months!<br>Not to mention that the Andromeda Galaxy is CURRENTLY colliding with our Milky Way...", "comment_date": "2022-05-12T15:56:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jay", "comment_text": "When a white dwarf collapses, we get a neutron star.
