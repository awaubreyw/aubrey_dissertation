Maybe not the first drink, maybe not the second, but the odds would be quite high you&#39;d drink in something that would wreck you.    The returns from the still could be amplified by placing non-combustibles into a fire to heat them (rocks, primarily) and placing those in the well under the plastic.  This extra thermal energy will supplement the UV radiation from the sun and heat more water, more quickly, producing more vapor, which produces more condensate, which produces more distilled water.   Of course for that you&#39;d need a fire.  Finding rocks (the darker the better) and leaving them in the sun, and then transferring them under the plastic is probably the next best thing.<br><br>Another passive way to do it is to put the cellophane over leaves.

In that heat and the exercise needed to setup survival, you definitely would easily at least 4 2 Liters of water per day. So, with 8 hours of daylight, this means you need at least 4 of those Solar Sills. Or a single one that is bigger.<br><br><br>If you need a solar sill in real life, you probably won&#39;t have 1 ton of duct tape available or clear plastic.<br><br><br><br><br>His Solar Sill design could probably been improved a lot. Here is what I&#39;d do:<br><br><br>#1 - Digging by hand is not the most best idea in town. So...<br>Go to nearby forest, grab something hard, wide, and flat.<br>Basically, you want an &quot;improvised shovel head&quot;.<br>That &quot;tool&quot; has these benefits:<br>- Dig faster, saving precious time.<br>- Dig more efficiently, wasting less calories and body water on the digging task.<br>- Avoid hurting your hand on random hard things in the sand like say a seashell or a little sharp rock.<br>- Reduce risks of sand between finger &amp; nail, reducing odds of infection.<br><br><br>#2 - While you are at it, also grab not only some stones, but sticks, branches, and foliage or moss.<br>If you find thick clay, that is good too. Make sure it is clay, not mud.<br><br>If you can find stuff that it as black as possible, grab that too. Rocks, black soil, bark.<br>Not black mushrooms or plants, though, unless you are sure they are not poisonous.<br>If you find a lot of very &quot;spongy or fibrous&quot; moss, especially if black or very dark, grab that too.<br><br><br>If you got clay, quickly spread some on you.  Arms, legs, back, face.<br>That helps repelling insect bites.<br>Acts as a primitive sunscreen to greatly prevent sunburns.<br>Dirt might also work a little but nowhere near as well.<br><br><br>Don&#39;t bring everything in one go. Digging is hard work, you will have to<br>take many &quot;breaks&quot; and gathering then bringing back more materials<br>while you are &quot;taking 5&quot; in order to catch your breath will be a much<br>better use of your time of than doing nothing.<br><br><br><br><br>#3 - Look at the shape of the beach and choose the best possible spot.<br><br>Also look at how the sun is moving.<br>You want to dig the hole a a place where the beach elevation is the lowest possible.<br>This means less deep digging, saves time and effort.\r<br>You also want a spot that is the hottest big spot possible.<br>Thus, a spot where the &quot;inside the sand&quot; sea water traveled a little bit through the sand before<br>reaching your spot, thus making that water a little bit warmer than ocean water already.<br>Meaning, it will evaporate a bit quicker. Every little bit helps!<br>Also, put it away from the forest, so that sunlight will shine on the sill for as many hours as possible.<br>And on the most white patch of beach possible. The hottest things are, the best it works.<br><br><br>#4 - Make your plastic sheet.<br>Without a plastic sheet or impermeable sheet you&#39;re basically screwed, just go try to find water.<br>Your plastic sheet needs to be a square not a rectangle.<br>Don&#39;t make it too big, for it would end up being very unwieldy to manipulate, especially if it is windy.<br>If you have lots you can plan to make several Solar sills instead, but your 1st one should be done ASAP.<br>You can always improve on the design later on.<br>So, for your first one, yeah duct tape the plastic like he did.<br>Note that am opaque BLACK plastic sheet will work wonders better than a clear one.<br>This about letting about at least 6 to 9 inches all around your hole, for the plastic sheet<br>to overlap. So compute your hole size vs sheet size.<br><br><br>#5 - Dig the hole quite big.<br>At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuj_NnymqMg&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a> we can see that his hole didn&#39;t remain all that big at all, the sides caving in.<br>What you <b>don&#39;t</b> want to do is dig it so deep that you end up with several inches of water deep:<br>The &quot;too big amount&quot; of water means it would remain cold for too long slowing down evaporation rate.<br>What you want to do is maximize the surface area of sunlight.<br>At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuj_NnymqMg&amp;t=1m58s\">1:58</a> you see he made it about 2 feet wide.<br>Make it as big as your plastic sheet, maybe 4 feet on a side.<br>Also, avoid doing something like what you see at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zuj_NnymqMg&amp;t=3m13s\">3:13</a>, letting sand on top. Brush that off!<br>Because any shadow means reduced solar sill efficiency.<br><br>Don&#39;t dig too deep: you want maybe one inch of water in there.<br>Don&#39;t dig too shallow either: <b>some</b> sand will inevitably fall back in no matter what,<br>and you do not want  it to fall back in  so much that it would completely cover the water.<br>Sand is a pretty good insulator, so you,d end up with a much slower solar sill.<br><br><br>#5 - Use sticks and branches and some rocks and clay (if you have) to basically make<br>a &quot;reinforcement wall&quot; all around your hole. This will avoid the sand in the sides of the hole<br>all slowly ending up all collapsed back in, reducing the effective &quot;sill working area&quot;.<br>If you use clay, DO NOT USE IT EVERYWHERE! Clay would prevent &quot;new&quot; water from coming it.<br>Leave the spot from which it seems the most water comes from 100% without clay.<br>Also, make sure your sticks and branches don&#39;t poke vertically, otherwise they <b>will</b> end up<br><br>ripping your plastic sheet. Then all your efforts will be ruined.<br>If you got a black plastic sheet then getting some black material for the bottom is not important.<br>If not, and you found some black material, cover the bottom of your hole with it.<br>Black material absorbs more sunrays than clear colors, and thus more energy converted<br>to infrared =  much hotter inside the &quot;tent&quot; = you get more evaporation!<br>If you got mossy fibrous stuff, put some inside too.<br>Spongy material will suck the water inside it and thus expose<br>a LOT MORE of &quot;total surface area&quot; to the air = you get more evaporation!<br><br><br>#6 - Place sheet over hole, solidify in place using stones.<br>If you&#39;ve got clay, first make a big flat &quot;cement ring&quot; all around your hole.<br>Otherwise just use firmly packed wet sand.<br>This will &quot;seal&quot; much better the inside of the sill, this none of the precious <br>water vapor will escape and get lost = more water for you!<br>Check where the bottom-most part of the sheet is, make sure nothing touches the sheet,<br>and place your water container  recipient right under that spot.<br>Finish closing the hole.<br><br><br>While you work, unless it is dangerous (jellyfishes, corals, etc.),<br>regularly go take a quick dip in the ocean water. Then put back some more clay on you.<br>At worst, use water from your dug hole to splash face and armpits to lower body temperature.<br>The last thing you want is to get an insulation. Falling unconscious in the sun is not a good idea.<br>Similarly, don&#39;t try to rush digging the hole as fast as you can. Do it methodically, at a<br>reasonable pace. The last thing you want to do is overheat yourself. Also, working too hard<br>would make you breath a lot faster than necessary, ending up wasting a lot more of your<br>precious body water. Take breaks, go into the shade of the forest or a quick dip in the ocean,<br>basically keep yourself COOL.<br><br><br><br><br>Properly built, a single Solar Sill can produce a lot more water than what he got.", "comment_date": "2019-12-05T04:36:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Z M", "comment_text": "I really love the difference of the personality and mindset between these two.

The super-strong waterproof tape! That can instantly patch, bond, seal, and repair! Flex tape is no ordinary tape; its triple thick adhesive virtually welds itself to the surface, instantly stopping the toughest leaks. Leaky pipes can cause major damage, but Flex Tape grips on tight and bonds instantly! Plus, Flex Tape\u2019s powerful adhesive is so strong, it even works underwater! Now you can repair leaks in pools and spas in water without draining them! Flex Tape is perfect for marine, campers and RVs! Flex Tape is super strong, and once it&#39;s on, it holds on tight! And for emergency auto repair, Flex Tape keeps its grip, even in the toughest conditions! Big storms can cause big damage, but Flex Tape comes super wide, so you can easily patch large holes. To show the power of Flex Tape, I sawed this boat in half! And repaired it with only Flex Tape! Not only does Flex Tape\u2019s powerful adhesive hold the boat together, but it creates a super strong water tight seal, so the inside is completly dry! Yee-doggy! Just cut, peel, stick and seal!
