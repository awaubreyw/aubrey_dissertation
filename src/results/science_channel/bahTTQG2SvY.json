Trillions of dollars with every type of detector you can think off and we are still yet to find any hard evidence that it exists. Not to mention the mathematics that imply it&#39;s existence are parameters that are assumed, exaggerated or just added to fit. There is a strong belief within the scientific community that Dark Matter and Dark Energy may not even exist. Furthermore, a recent paper submitted to the journal Nature purposes the math can be solved and explained without the need of dark matter or energy. I think we are chasing something thats not there. New math and scientific discoveries can open the door to a proper explanation without having to resort to exotic forms of matter that require even more exotic circumstances to even be plausible.", "comment_date": "2017-04-18T18:17:41Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "San Samman", "comment_text": "I honestly don&#39;t think like the scientists I think that dark matter isn&#39;t what we thing or even isn&#39;t real there is no proof .
