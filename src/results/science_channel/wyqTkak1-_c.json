People of african descent have the most. people of NON african has the LEAST melanin (which means less protection from the sun) MELANIN is condensed sunlight, no spf cream, sunscreen will help you ur gonna need the real stuff, NEUROMELANIN. Which african/black people have the most of. very few black people will combust, mostly its just people who simply lack melanin which is a shield for the suns harmful rays. without it we all burn, but luckily god created beings to place here with the protection built in. I see why so many people are racist and mean to me growing up because of how dark i am, deep down they know i have melanin and some are jealous but so what.  A Nice sized bunch of people on the planet either have little to almost no melanin, they have no protection think of melanin like antivirus software, and the sunrays is the virus. melanated bodies have avg/norton etc.. Lack of melanin people are you using a computer with no updates and no virus protection. so the sun hit u enuff, its too hot,and u have little to almost no melanin U WILL COMBUST. literally light on fire as this sun gets hotter and hotter, i go outside for long periods and my skin is fine but thats only due to the 85 percent sub saharan african in me that grants me (and many others with sufficient melanin). why do you think they try to block the sun with the weird fake lookin clouds, its to keep themselves alive YOU would do the same.  All these racist rednecks i see who turn super red in the sun they will combust indefintely at some point cause the sun is gettin so damn hot, and the protection from the rays is NIL with people of non african descent. and the people who rule this world is defintely not the melanated people", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T16:22:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris kronus", "comment_text": "That boy frank reptullian", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T04:19:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CreeperFury", "comment_text": "Victims in Fire Force be like: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyqTkak1-_c&amp;t=00m42s\">00:42</a>", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T20:31:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bethlehem Eisenhour", "comment_text": "No wound?", "comment_date": "2022-07-09T20:21:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Hopkins", "comment_text": "This is weird because I cannot find this guy anywhere to follow up on what happened", "comment_date": "2022-06-20T19:36:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TRILLION CROWNS", "comment_text": "the power of the soul!!! we have no idea what is possible", "comment_date": "2022-05-26T08:07:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Defenseman61913", "comment_text": "Good lord, people are fucking stupid.

Some scholars deny it just like Benjamin Redford and some of them have become so fully convinced that he devoted his life to interpreting it like Larry E. Arnold who wrote a book about the phenomenon called Ablaze !. He spent 30 years looking into the phenomenon.<br># Following are the qualities that combine many self-combustion situations?<br>According to coverage conducted by the British Medical Journal in 1936, there is a set of qualities appeared in most of these cases, namely:<br>1. Victims are alcoholics<br>2. Most of them are elderly women<br>3. The hands and feet are separated from the victim&#39;s body<br>4. Smelly is caused by the victims<br><br>\u00a0(Source)<br><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2086687/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2086687/</a> Some explanations for this case<br>Most of the scientific explanations mentioned in the nineteenth century to explain this phenomenon tend to have an external cause of ignition with elevated alcohol content in the blood, as an alcoholic who smoked a cigarette or sat next to a primitive lamp or candle.<br>Some believers in the paranormal tended to interpret it as something supernatural produced by hidden forces and has no scientific explanation!<br>Critics have the same explanation:<br>Biologist and criminal investigator (Mark Penek) has done a simple experiment. Bring a piece of cotton and fill it with alcohol and burn it. The outer layer is burned while the inside is not burned and the reason is that there is no oxygen inside to help in the combustion process to make the interpretation of alcohol does not seem logical.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Wick\">#Wick</a> effect<br>There is an explanation that some consider acceptable, but not as an explanation of alcohol, which is the effect of wick. When a source of ignition approaches the victim&#39;s body at high temperature, the fat under his body burns like a candle. This process takes a lot of time and it is painful and slow and there is no severe fire, but fat burns slowly. There are cases that have been interpreted in this way, such as the case of the Oregon killer in 1991 and the Leeds case in 1963. (Source)<br>The interpretation of Brian G. Ford<br>Brian G. Ford has turned to a clearer explanation because of alcoholism. (Brian J. Ford) says that alcoholism with a low carbohydrate diet makes the body produce acetone, a highly combustible compound.<br>The Greek scientist Pinos Papas is one of a group of small scientists who believe that our body is a nuclear reactor. The source of energy in our body is a series of nuclear reactions that occur at the cellular level. The defect in that process leads to the phenomenon of self-combustion!<br><br>There are more insane interpretations that we can not enumerate, but the multitude of interpretations gives only one meaning; not one of them is a definitive interpretation of that phenomenon or else it is the only explanation. Or, as some say, each case has its own interpretation! What makes self-combustion different from ordinary combustion?<br>You may have risked that these are normal cases of combustion and that the whole phenomenon does not exist, and investigators have guessed this. But the normal combustion is by burning the place where the victim is and then burning it. But in cases of self-combustion victims are only the ones who burn. But in the case of Henry Thomas was burnt personally and his feet burned but his gorge remained intact! Making the fire started from the inside.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Continued\">#Continued</a><br>(Source)<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontain_human_combustion\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontain_human_combustion</a><br>Burning George Mott<br>George Mott, a retired firefighter, was burned in 1986 with only 3 pounds left of his bones. In his room only George and his bed were burned.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Continued\">#Continued</a><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Source\">#Source</a><br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontain_human_combustion\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontain_human_combustion</a><br>In 2002, Adele and her family were in the car on the beach in Belgium, then her thigh started to burn, and a blue flame of fire came out of her pocket. But Adele was rescued quickly and this was the image of her thigh after the fire - at the top -. This case has not been reached for the cause of the fire in a conclusive manner, but some consider it the definitive evidence of the existence of the phenomenon of self-combustion. The criminal investigation could not confirm that the fire began inside Adele&#39;s body but could not explain why it started.<br><br>Rejecting the phenomenon completely<br>As we mentioned at the beginning, Benjamin Redford and others dozens reject the phenomenon completely and have reasonable views on this matter. Why does not this happen very often? What causes the imbalance in the body&#39;s interactions, as the proponents of the phenomenon claim, rarely occurs? What is the definitive evidence of this phenomenon? Why are all these conflicting interpretations conflicting? The scientific phenomenon has a clear scientific explanation or at least a clear scientific description. All of this is a case of fire. That&#39;s it.<br>Conclusion<br>Self-incineration cases remain one of the strangest causes of death that have not been interpreted conclusively. Some try to interpret them scientifically and some try to interpret them paranormal and others deny them completely. But what is certain, that this phenomenon occurs from time to time for someone and for some reason!<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23is\">#is</a> over<br>If you liked the search, subscribe to my channel and thank you", "comment_date": "2018-06-18T06:56:32Z", "likes_count": 28}, {"comment_by": "Artyom Galstyan", "comment_text": "sounds like a bullshit", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T14:34:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan Koblinski", "comment_text": "As psychic I am sensing.........there was Witch behind this.........in South Vietnam.
