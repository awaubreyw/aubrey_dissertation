Rabbits would pop out of the ground  and were then herded to the corner of the paddock. The chicken wire was closed around the &quot;fluffy bunnies&quot; and the slaughter would begin. 100&#39;s at a time!  THUD! THUD! They got a bounty for each rabbit the killed. Rabbits, like on Okunoshima, are an introduced species and they eat everything and  destroy pasture land. They are vermin and  farmers and the Australian Government  have been trying to kill them off for over 100+ years. Like the Queensland Cane Toad we have not been entirely  successful. At least they are not as ugly as the Cane Toad and will not send you cationic with  their bodily secretions. Rabbits were introduced by a British &quot;gentleman&quot; settler in the 1800&#39;s so he could continue his weekend  past time of shooting rabbits for sport. He left the colony , leaving behind his effing rabbits, after they denuded his land and his neighbours land and at the suggestion of his angry armed neighbours.
