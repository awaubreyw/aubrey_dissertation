[{"comment_by": "Ron S", "comment_text": "&quot;Anchors in Time&quot; is a handsome new book documenting the work of Dominic Di Mare who pioneered dimensional weaving in the 1960s and forged new sculptural directions with cast paper in the 1970s. He received further acclaim from the 1970s through the 1990s for expanding the use of mixed media in intimate sculptures: first by combining knotted linen with clay, and later by combining wood branches with delicate feathers, beads, paper, and horsehair.
