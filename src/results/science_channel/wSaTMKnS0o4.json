[{"comment_by": "Stuart Leslie", "comment_text": "THIS BIRD IS NOT MIMICKING A CAR ALARM! This is a variation on the lyrebirds natural call which is heard all over their range. They were making electronic sounds before there were electronics. This is a captive bird which is why it mimics human sounds. Extensive investigation has NEVER found a wild bird mimicking human made sounds. The fact that they can mimic all sorts of machines shows what superb vocal equipment they have, but only birds raised in captivity have ever mimicked machines and this is a very young bird which does not have the full range of natural sounds to incorporate into it&#39;s repertoire. In the wild a mature lyrebird has scores of calls at his command and weaves them together in improvised song, seldom repeating any but a few core sequences.", "comment_date": "2022-06-15T07:11:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deeler", "comment_text": "My guy said kookaburrow instead of kookaburra", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T06:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omerhas Quinto", "comment_text": "Thanks heaps. &lt;3", "comment_date": "2019-09-27T23:43:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AUSSIE", "comment_text": "Talk talk talk...
