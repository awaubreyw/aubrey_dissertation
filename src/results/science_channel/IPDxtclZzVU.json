Uncontrollable swimming exhausts the body as the organs shut down.<br>2. The drift wood isn&#39;t a door, but a 50Ib door frame. Add the separate weights of Jack and Rose, they couldn&#39;t stay on together. The difference in weight mattered and the Mythbusters didn&#39;t consider that. The space was there for both of them, but the weight was the troublesome part.<br>3. Rose was an upper-class lady with her life made for her (thus no reason for her to know survival skills) and Jack was a third-class uneducated amateur artist; they didn&#39;t have the luxury of the internet or advanced degrees in science to construct the buoyancy device the Mythbusters used to increase their own buoyancy. We&#39;re taking about people from 1912 vs. scientists in the 21st Century.<br>4. If they did try to alternate who was on the driftwood, their bodies still couldn&#39;t accommodate fast enough for them both to survive.

You start to lose dexterity immediately, but may be able to make larger motions. (One sailor described not being able to tie on a lifejacket due to this dexterity loss). You need to use this time to get your body in a position where your airway will stay open/out of the water, even after your muscles stop supporting your weight (As Rose did by getting on the door, and as Jack did by attempting the same). It is good to let your arms freeze to a surface to hold you up (as Jack did by holding Rose&#39;s hand once he realized it was too difficult for him to get on the door).<br><br><br>Minute 10- minute 60: You try to conserve heat while keeping your head above water, and as much of you out of the water as possible, but you can barely move. You would not be able to grip onto the door or use your core muscles to stabilize the door. Having a lifejacket on will actually help you conserve heat at this point. So will holding hands. Rose deciding to turn over and lay on her back was wise, as it kept her airway further from the waves. <br><br><br>Minute 61: Death or unconsciousness if you&#39;re lucky.<br><br><br>It took them a couple minutes to even find the door... I don&#39;t think they had time to figure out the life jacket thing before they became physically incapable of getting back on the door. Staying in the freezing water to tie the life jacket on actually decreases both of their chances at survival. Jack had a stable position leaning on the door that kept his airway clear for breathing. That is the best thing he could&#39;ve done. If he had instead been tinkering around trying to tie on a life jacket, or worse trying to squeeze onto the door with Rose that was clearly imbalanced and easy to flip, he would most likely have been in a less stable position and possibly underwater when he lost the ability to move his arms and legs, and it would&#39;ve been too late for him to climb back to the door edge. <br><br><br>Source: <a href=\"http://www.shipwrite.bc.ca/Chilling_truth.htm\">http://www.shipwrite.bc.ca/Chilling_truth.htm</a>", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T20:18:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A1.", "comment_text": "MGTOW", "comment_date": "2019-08-17T20:14:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "hueyandmo", "comment_text": "I also like how James Cameron said that Jack would&#39;ve died no matter what to further the story.

I still dont think its enough to save both of them.<br>Any thought ?", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T14:01:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Randomstuff2019", "comment_text": "2000 thousand freakin rooms and only ONE door", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T04:26:43Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Randomstuff2019", "comment_text": "Legit only part of titanic I\u2019ve ever seen", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T04:26:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiffa Alaniz", "comment_text": "She was selfish is what it was they gave up way to easily i mean in reality if the stupid rich would have sucked it up and people weren\u2019t ass holes almost everybody should have survived", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T02:32:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Micro", "comment_text": "&quot;Sharing is caring&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T09:02:58Z", "likes_count": 49}, {"comment_by": "Dozo 3434", "comment_text": "It was more than likely harder than how they did it those people were freezing and they weren\u2019t", "comment_date": "2019-04-11T02:52:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "snap", "comment_text": "Well that was a spoiler", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T14:55:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041d\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432", "comment_text": "if Jack had survived, people would enjoy without feeling the tragedy", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T12:07:10Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Linda Bishop", "comment_text": "Dunno, but if the silly bitch had stayed in the lifeboat, he wouldn t have been shot at, chased, maybe Andrews would have given the lifejacket to Jack instead of Rose, he might still have found the door and could have met her in NY.!", "comment_date": "2019-04-10T07:15:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bronyferien minuet", "comment_text": "People keep talking like they had to make the movie a certain way, are you people fucking stupid or something?

The problem in that scene was getting onto to it. Now if the water is at 0 degrees (32 for the Americans), or near 0, as obviously, it is not frozen, then it would take anywhere between 15 - 30 minutes to become delirious, then unconscious. Obviously, your body will not wait till you&#39;re sitting in freezing cold water for fifteen minutes to shut down; it happens gradually. So by the time that they had gotten to the door, they would have already been nearly delirious, since Jack had lost consciousness only minutes later. Therefore, they wouldn&#39;t have been able to think about buoyancy. Also, taking into account the struggle that it took for the MythBusters to get on the door, in perfectly good conditions, neither of them would have been able to get onto that door while half frozen, and in water. In fact, this is proven to be true in the movie when it takes all of both Jack&#39;s and Rose&#39;s strength just to lift Rose onto the door. So yes, the door could probably hold the both of them, but the conditions were way different. And besides, let&#39;s not forget this is a story; the writer wrote it how he wanted to write it. If he wanted Jack dead, then Jack would have died, regardless of how big the door was. If Jack had lived, this movie may not have gotten as much popularity as it had.

It takes quite a bit of strength, time and physical coordination to untie, remove, position and retie a lifejacket, especially when both your hands are totally numb, your muscles have only 10 minutes before completely seizing up because they depend on being a minimum temperature to work, and your heart is weakened for that same reason yet its job is even further increased because the cold is literally congealing all your body fluids.<br>2.  Both Jack and Rose probably only had the energy, time and mobility for one attempt to get onto the raft.  Rose was successful.  Jack sadly not.  How much more sad would it have been if they&#39;d somehow got the lifebelt tied onto the raft and created enough buoyancy but Jack simply didn&#39;t have the strength or mobility left to climb onto it?!  And how scary it must therefore have been for Rose getting OFF that raft to swim to the dead officer and blow his whistle for rescue - one chance and one chance only, with a very limited timeframe, to survive!<br>3. So much for successfully &#39;holding it steady&#39; in daylight, in warmer waters, with no drifting wreckage or thrashing, panicking people on either side...see point 2; they only had one chance to make it work.  Maybe Jack just didn&#39;t want to risk Rose&#39;s life like that on his account.<br>4. All bodies and their limits of endurance are slightly different.  Without the insulation of a lifejacket it may have been that both Rose&#39;s and Jack&#39;s bodies would have given out before the lifeboat got to them, even if they had both been on the raft and even if their core temperatures hadn&#39;t yet dropped to a temperature at which it was certainly impossible to survive - as happened to many atop collapsible B and in collapsible A.  The deciding factor in that kind of cold is the amount of body fat (provides some insulation) and the strength of a person&#39;s heart - not everyone has an equally strong heart or an equal percentage of body fat.  Again, how sad would it have been if Rose had seen the boat coming back, turned to Jack and simply found him frozen beside her?!  And in climbing off the raft to get to the whistle she dislodged his body which sank as a dead-weight, as it did in the film, thus eliminating all chance of his revival and survival.  Part of me thinks this might actually have been a better way to show his death - to show how utterly unavoidable it was.<br>5. Technically over 1,500 deaths were needless, not just Jack&#39;s!  Had they stopped for the night, had they not tried to slow down and just turned hard over when they saw the iceberg, had there been enough lifeboats and better lifeboat procedures, had someone woken up the operator on the Californian just in case he could detect something across the ether when they saw odd stuff happening with a ship on the horizon - or even put the apprentice operator (who was awake and seeing everything) on in his plce, they would have heard the distress calls and steamed to the rescue.<br>6. You can hardly blame Jack and Rose for not thinking of doing that when they were so spent and probably foggy-brained, amid a panicking throng where the panic probably rubbed off and it took all they had to stay calm and focussed.", "comment_date": "2017-10-31T07:37:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dolly Shorts", "comment_text": "Omg", "comment_date": "2017-10-30T22:52:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elliott F\u00e4lt", "comment_text": "Keep in mind that Jack and Rose didn&#39;t weigh as much as them two", "comment_date": "2017-10-30T15:15:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simon Lambourne", "comment_text": "It&#39;s just an myth!", "comment_date": "2017-10-30T12:40:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FunFei4 Ever", "comment_text": "My lolo was one of the survivors!<br>He&#39;s 105 years old now!", "comment_date": "2017-10-29T22:23:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarah G", "comment_text": "If rose had stayed on the lifeboat, then Jack would have had the door to himself and survived to meet Rose on the Carpathia.", "comment_date": "2017-10-29T03:13:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kate Ivey", "comment_text": "Umm they probably were both so freezing cold their minds became muddled and slow, unable to think at full capacity.

He would have never found that door if rose wasn&#39;t with him bc she gave him the motivation to do something to save her. He would have probably been in one spot like the others and rose would&#39;ve been on her way to the Carpathia.
