Dream interpretation is the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for an underlying message. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology.[2]<br><br>Dreams mainly occur in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of sleep\u2014when brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake. REM sleep is revealed by continuous movements of the eyes during sleep. At times, dreams may occur during other stages of sleep. However, these dreams tend to be much less vivid or memorable.[3] The length of a dream can vary; they may last for a few seconds, or approximately 20\u201330 minutes.[3] People are more likely to remember the dream if they are awakened during the REM phase. The average person has three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven;[4] however, most dreams are immediately or quickly forgotten.[5] Dreams tend to last longer as the night progresses. During a full eight-hour night sleep, most dreams occur in the typical two hours of REM.[6] Dreams related to waking-life experiences are associated with REM theta activity, which suggests that emotional memory processing takes place in REM sleep.[7]<br>Opinions about the meaning of dreams have varied and shifted through time and culture. Many endorse the Freudian theory of dreams \u2013 that dreams reveal insight into hidden desires and emotions.[qualify evidence] Other prominent theories include those suggesting that dreams assist in memory formation, problem solving, or simply are a product of random brain activation.[8]<br>Sigmund Freud, who developed the psychological discipline of psychoanalysis, wrote extensively about dream theories and their interpretations in the early 1900s.[9] He explained dreams as manifestations of one&#39;s deepest desires and anxieties, often relating to repressed childhood memories or obsessions. Furthermore, he believed that virtually every dream topic, regardless of its content, represented the release of sexual tension.[10] In The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), Freud developed a psychological technique to interpret dreams and devised a series of guidelines to understand the symbols and motifs that appear in our dreams. In modern times, dreams have been seen as a connection to the unconscious mind. They range from normal and ordinary to overly surreal and bizarre. Dreams can have varying natures, such as being frightening, exciting, magical, melancholic, adventurous, or sexual. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-aware.[11] Dreams can at times make a creative thought occur to the person or give a sense of inspiration.[12]<br>Your welcome", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T08:29:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shira Cremeans", "comment_text": "The zealous quail naively mate because farmer respectively measure versus a faithful brand. organic, earsplitting bath", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T02:41:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Diaz", "comment_text": "What about that gold trim on the bird on the ball?", "comment_date": "2020-12-30T05:49:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan", "comment_text": "Definitely made in a sweat shop", "comment_date": "2020-12-30T03:33:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan", "comment_text": "Why the fuck do they use the term \u201crubber ball\u201d it\u2019s a damn basketball", "comment_date": "2020-12-30T03:30:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Afro Thunder", "comment_text": "This was pretty amazing", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T06:17:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Learning K-12 Edu Channel", "comment_text": "Cool", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T14:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher BF1", "comment_text": "I\u2019m not sure I totally believe this factory is in America or the workers are getting paid a fair wage.. what can you do?
