Thanks to this video I found the best: Rommelsbacher !<br>The cheap chinese crap might work but thermostat is crap. It&#39;s not thermally linked to the plate and the current causes the thermostat to warm up. Thus it&#39;s more like a timed on/off switch.<br>The traditionel hot plate is perfect for use at the table whether it&#39;s dumplings &quot;\u00e6bleskiver&quot;/ebleskiver, waffles or just to keep something warm. For that use induction cookers is not ideal because of the noisy fan. A cozy click once in a while is perfectly acceptable. <br>The wattage for the travel hot plate is on the tiny side though. 500w is quite slow. Might have been sufficient for induction but IMHO on the quite slow side for cast iron burners. I ended up buying the AK 2099 - at 2000w it&#39;s quite quick. Made in Germany - quality wise there&#39;s no comparison with cheaper chinese alternatives.

A underworld populated w/ lower social level differences caused by a failure in the management of socialism. I have very strong evidence that the proportion of predicting a positive social future is less than no difference from a negative social future. The evidence shows that the future holds gorilla war fare and civil wars created by the confounding social level variables that the Federal &amp;  States has managed. A bias strategy in the immoral conditions of not pertaining a equal economic flow in managing socialism, causing discrimination and a epidemic rise of homelessness in need of rehabilitation in society. <br>Sure, we all have lazy family members, shit heads, careless and diligent. <br>The bias profile is inevitable, there will always be a statistical standard deviation between the nature of human behavior. <br>The &quot;ethical&quot; social standard response is prejudice and the standard deviation shows evidence that the empathy is less than no difference from managing a flow in the economy (all economy). In reasoning, it is immoral to biasly discriminate all type of levels in society, for we all are a fixed compounds in a functional element in society. Although it is ethically accepted in society to discriminate the lower society as a preference of freewill to the conjunction of the following law of science; philosophy &amp; psychology, so it is validated to be moral &amp; ethical to discriminate lower society as a cultural response in social levels. <br>To consider a flow in the economy of social functionalism. We must empathize and adapt the behavior nature in our species and potentially eradicate the segrigated differences in social levels, empathy must be a fixed response in the culture of human behavior. <br>To conclude the measures in reasoning for managing a positive future. We must consider the nature of lower society behavior and intuitively employ the behavior in economic stability. When discriminated, the segrigated biasism has strong evidence to predict no difference in social management failures. When empathy is implied as a fixed response in human behavior, the management considers the difference in lower society and empathize the behavior implied towards economic functionalism, we can predict a difference in a positive social management. <br>As a response to the analysis,&quot;Vote in the reasoning of creating jobs for all social levels.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-11-24T03:06:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RAM", "comment_text": "Can you make a video on how tractor wheels are made??", "comment_date": "2019-11-24T03:02:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaskadia Jackass Watch", "comment_text": "Most hotels ban hot plates in rooms.", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T23:49:46Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "AMERICANREBEL !", "comment_text": "Cool man!", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T23:20:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MasterX", "comment_text": "You can tell Brooke Moore&#39;s age is catching up with him in his voice, This dude is a legend and his voice is so perfect for how its made.
