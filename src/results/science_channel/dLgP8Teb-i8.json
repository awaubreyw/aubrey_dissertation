Will you interview the first Bulgarian<br>cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov, who is currently 79 years old, or will make an episode<br>of his space mission ,,Soyuz 33\u201d which almost killed him in space in 1979? The<br>astronaut Georgi Ivanov has spoken many times about the damage to the engines<br>of the space capsule and the premature termination of the Soviet space mission<br>&quot;Soyuz 33&quot;, which saved his life. The Bulgarian national television<br>made many films about him and you can see them on youtube .\u00a0 The space capsule and space suit of Georgi<br>Ivanov are in the aviation museum in Plovdiv. I will leave a link to the cosmonaut<br>Georgi Ivanov&#39;s Facebook if you decide to contact him. The cosmonaut Georgi<br>Ivanov is a very kind person and he will be really happy to hear from you.<br>Also, will there be an episode about the space \u00a0mission ,,Soyuz TM-5\u201d of the Bulgarian<br>cosmonaut Alexander Alexandrov?<br><br><br><br><br>link to the cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov&#39;s Facebook if you decide<br>to contact him \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Georgi.Ivanov.Kosmonavt/\">https://www.facebook.com/Georgi.Ivanov.Kosmonavt/</a><br><br><br><br><br>link to the cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov Wikipedia page; \u00a0<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Ivanov_(cosmonaut)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgi_Ivanov_(cosmonaut)</a><br><br><br><br><br>link to the<br>cosmonaut Alexander Alexandrov Wikipedia page;\u00a0<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Panayotov_Aleksandrov\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Panayotov_Aleksandrov</a>", "comment_date": "2020-04-25T20:52:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tuhin Debnath", "comment_text": "i m an astronaut", "comment_date": "2018-11-10T11:43:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MightyMatt28", "comment_text": "So they show us a Reenactment, instead of showing us the real footage.
