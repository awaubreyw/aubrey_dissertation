The air is prevented from reaching the lips (or skin, if its in cream). While the more expensive creams use natural oils and expensive ingredients, the cheap products use synthetic mineral oil because it doesn&#39;t go rancid over time when sitting on the supermarket shelf. Its inclusion is to protect the company from financial loss and has nothing to do with skin benefits.
