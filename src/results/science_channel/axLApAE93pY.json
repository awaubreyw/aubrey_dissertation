This plasma is what black holes are made of. All orbits in our universe are created as single masses of this plasma because it is able to create shapes. They are optically invisible because they only release gamma rays.<br>This object was spinning and was getting ready to be two, completely tidally locked objects orbiting each other. This didn&#39;t happen because the mass was too small and it froze before it separated. An example of two completely tidally locked objects that did separate is Pluto and its moon Charon. They were bigger masses so they completed the tidally locked separation. Even our moon is tidally locked with the Earth but this separation was due to a collision that cut through the quark plasma disk creating our unusually large moon. Our planet kept spinning but matter that made the moon was part of the disk that was cut so it simply created a mass that always faced the Earth as it orbits it. <br>This is also how Saturn&#39;s rings were formed except Saturn had an uneventful life from Jupiter protecting it so the quark plasma disk that was orbiting Saturn cooled as the rings with some moons between some of the disks.", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T15:22:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Debra Kleid", "comment_text": "Watching the planets orbit around the sun and Mercury was making me dizzy he was going around so fast. <br>It\u2019s amazing what we have been able to accomplish so far.
