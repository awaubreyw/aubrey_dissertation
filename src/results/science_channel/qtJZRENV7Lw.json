While an artist preference can be a factor, the choice of brush is primarily dependent on the medium you are planning to use. A general rule of thumb is to use a synthetic brush with synthetic mediums. And a natural brush with natural mediums. However, it is also important to understand that both natural and synthetic brushes use a wide range of materials for the bristles of the brush. Each produces different results. This is where preference comes into play. Once you gain a basic understanding of how different brushes behave with different mediums, then you can learn to use those brushes to produce different effects in your work. Weather you are an artist or a craftsman, take the time to learn about the different sizes, shapes and materials used is brushes. Learn how each behaves with the mediums you enjoy using. Once you do, you will be one step closer to mastering your art or craft. And don&#39;t stop there, there are many more tools than just brushes.
