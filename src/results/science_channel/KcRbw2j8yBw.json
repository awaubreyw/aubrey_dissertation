Flying straight down at a planet you&#39;re orbiting will do nothing but alter your orbit, making it more elliptical, decreasing your perigee and increasing your apogee so to speak. This is why rockets dont fly straight up to space. They fly out the atmosphere, spin over to one side then increase their horizontal velocity in respect to the earth.

And in that book there is offered an alternative pattern and Mechanics of this field. The book claims that there is are direct and clear proofs for all of those claims, and those are included in the book... The book is this - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0851MWT7S/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_i_.EXDEbQGRKXSN\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0851MWT7S/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_i_.EXDEbQGRKXSN</a><br>If you go to Amazon and enter &#39;george warehouseman&#39;, it will lead you to that book.
