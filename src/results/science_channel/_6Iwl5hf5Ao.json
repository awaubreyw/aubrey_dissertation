BOTH astronauts would have had to have been onboard, yet the stationary camera set on the moon&#39;s surface about 50 yards from the LEM pans UPWARD to follow the LEM&#39;s ascension.   HOW did that stationary camera pan upward on its own, since there were no humans on the surface to man it?   How would a camera in 1972 KNOW that the object in focus was rising if not for someone physically following the object upward?   Did NASA spend money on a remote controlled camera they were going to use once and leave behind forever?  Seems highly unlikely and wasteful if that were true, and a camera that moved that smoothly on its own back in 1972 would have been one expensive piece of hardware.
