I was stunned to see the date of this show. High energy physics and the developments that have been made in understanding quantum physics ,make your show essentially obsolete. You talk about the impossibility of traveling great distances of space without even mentioning the possibility of the use of worm holes, the use of gravitational drives, and many many many other advances that have been re-assessed and been found to be quite possible to execute. 51 minutes into your show -you are still essentially listing reasons why we will never run into intelligent life or even life in our galaxy SolarSystem universe\u2026 anywhere. There are 160 billion ?? ( quoting Jet Propulsion from a clip I saw) planets in our galaxy alone. It seems somewhat arrogant to think we would be the only place intelligent life would evolve. I do believe that any race of beings able to reach us would be so far advanced that they would understand us. They would probably be able to communicate without words.
