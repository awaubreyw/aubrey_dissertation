They are then processed there and turned into biomass pellets, all of which uses energy. This huge shipment is then driven in carbon-emitting vehicles to a port from where it is shipped across the Atlantic OCEAN to England, which, uh, emits tons of carbon, yeah? Then we English burn it up in a couple of days, emitting even more carbon, yeah? And today this is considered green. When I was young in the 80s the green movement used to fight massive corporations which spewed toxic chemicals into the environment.
