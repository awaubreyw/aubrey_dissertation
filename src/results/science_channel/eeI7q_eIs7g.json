Do you think your a good person? Yes ? How many lies have you told in your life, have you stolen something, even if it\u2019s little ? Have you ever used Gods name in vain ? Jesus said whoever looks at a women to lust for her has committed adultery with her in his heart, have you look with lust? I\u2019m sure we have broken these commandments. So by your own admission via your conscious you have admitted to being a lying thieving blasphemous adulterer at heart do you still think your a good person ? You have to stand before God on judgment day, now if He judges you by those Ten Commandments do you think you\u2019ll be innocent or guilty? Sin is so serious to God that He gives us capital punishment, death for our sins. The Bible says for the wages of sin is death, we earn death because we sin against God. But God provided a way out of hell. God &quot;Jesus&quot; in the flesh lived a perfect sinless life and paid our fine we owed God from our sins by suffering and dying on the<br>cross. And on the third day He rose from the grave and defeated death, it was impossible that death could hold Him. And if you want to be saved you must repent of all your sins &quot;which means turn from them&quot;and not live a hypocritical life which means you say, I&#39;m a Christian but still lie, steal and fornicate, and you must trust alone in Jesus not in good works or you being a good person and the Bible says God will give you everlasting life. \u201cIf we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.\u201d  \u202d\u202d1 John\u202c \u202d1:9 Please think about your eternity, you can enter it at any moment. Love you bro. Please think about your eternity. Love you bro, please think about your eternity.

They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in \u201cadvanced\u201d countries.\r<br>\r<br>The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.\r<br>\r<br>If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.\r<br>\r<br>We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can\u2019t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.\r<br>\r<br>In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.\r<br>\r<br>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF MODERN LEFTISM\r<br>\r<br>Almost everyone will agree that we live in a deeply troubled society. One of the most widespread manifestations of the craziness of our world is leftism, so a discussion of the psychology of leftism can serve as an introduction to the discussion of the problems of modern society in general.", "comment_date": "2022-04-16T04:27:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brizzle711", "comment_text": "I think it\u2019s crazy how someone or some people came up with machines to do such niche things like this.", "comment_date": "2022-04-16T04:18:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "As-if If-as", "comment_text": "The closest shave is silly since ingrown hairs suck.

God is holy, and completely sinless. Because of our sins, we are separated from the one who created the heaven and the earth (in six days, and rested on the 7th and sanctified it to be a holy day).<br><br>There&#39;s GREAT NEWS. Hear the gospel:<br>Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried, and rose on the third day, to save you from the detriment of your sins. <br><br>In order to receive the beautiful gift of eternal salvation, you have to BELIEVE in the gospel. You have to believe and put all of your faith in Jesus Christ and what he did for you, for me, and humanity on that very cross. John 3:16 King James Version of the Holy Bible states, &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him will not perish, but shall receive everlasting life.&quot; God truely loves you and He keeps His promise, His Word remian the same yesterday, today, and forever. <br><br>Without believing in the gospel and  accepting Jesus Christ into your hearts, your souls will not enter into Heaven. You will be casted into hell for eternity. Eternal life is where your souls will go into the afterlife when you pass, and there are only two places, Heaven and hell. Please DO NOT reject Jesus.<br><br>He truely loves you. He gave his entire life for you, every single moment of mockery, abuse, slander, and persecution that led up to him being cruxified on that cross, he thought about you. Me. Your entire family, your neighbors, your communities, ALL of humanity. <br><br>Please believe and repent from your sins immediately, turn back to Christ and live a life pleasing to God.

On Judgment Day, will you be found to be guilty or innocent of breaking His commandments?<br><br>Perhaps you think that God is good, and will therefore overlook your sins. But it is His goodness that will make sure that murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, etc. receive justice. He would be a corrupt Judge if He turned a blind eye to injustice. Have you kept the Commandments?<br><br>The Bible says that the Law is perfect. It commands you to be perfect (Matthew 5:48). Are you perfect (in thought, word, and deed)? Will you make it to Heaven? You may say that you are still good, but God says you&#39;re not (see Psalm 14:2-3). So one of you is lying, and the Scriptures tell us that it is impossible for God to lie. Remember that all liars will be cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 21:8). God&#39;s Law demands justice, and the penalty for sinning against Him is death and Hell. Listen carefully if you want to live.<br><br>God Himself made a way where His justice and His goodness could meet. We broke the Law, but He became a man to pay the fine. Jesus suffered and died on the cross to satisfy the Law. God can forgive us and grant us the gift of everlasting life! But you may still think that you can (from now on) keep the Ten Commandments. But isn&#39;t it true that the best of us have lied, stolen, lusted, hated, failed to love God above all else, and failed to love our neighbor as ourselves?<br><br>How can we then, live a &quot;good&quot; life if we have already sinned against God? At best we are reformed liars and thieves . . . but still Lawbreakers. Think of it this way - would you sell one of your eyes for a million dollars? Would you sell both for $50 million? I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t. Your eyes are priceless, yet they are merely the windows of your soul. What then must your life (soul) be worth? With these thoughts in mind, what would be a fair price to pay for everlasting life? It is utterly without price. Yet, if we trust in our own goodness to enter Heaven, we are saying to God, &quot;I should enter Heaven because I have done good - I have earned my way in.&quot;<br><br>Imagine if you wanted to give me a brand new (very expensive) car, but I said, &quot;I can&#39;t take it! I feel embarrassed receiving such a gift . . . here&#39;s 10 cents for it.&quot; I&#39;m sure you would be very insulted by such a pathetic offer of payment. Besides, if I pay for it, it is no longer a gift, it&#39;s a purchase . . . it&#39;s mine by right.<br><br>When we talk of entering Heaven by being good, by trying to keep the Ten Commandments etc., we are tossing God 10 cents of &quot;self-righteousness,&quot; which is a terrible insult to Him, in the light of His sacrifice. The only thing we can do is humble ourselves, repent of our sins, and receive the gift by trusting Jesus Christ alone. Almighty God demonstrated how much He loves you when Jesus suffered for you on the cross. If you want to trust in your own goodness, then you are saying His agonizing death on the cross was in vain. The Bible says, &quot;For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.&quot; You cannot earn a gift.<br><br>When Jesus said to &quot;believe&quot; on Him, He was saying we should have faith in Him, in the same way you would trust a parachute to save you when you jump from a plane. You don&#39;t merely believe in the parachute - you put it on. Please don&#39;t &quot;jump&quot; without Jesus. If you die in your sins there is no second chance. God will give you justice, and you will end up in Hell forever. Any troubles you have at present are dwarfed by the trouble you are in with your Creator. His wrath abides upon you (John 3:36). God doesn&#39;t want you to go to Hell. Neither do you want to go there, so confess your sins to God right now, put your trust in Jesus to save you, and you will pass from death to life. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. (See John 14:21). Your obedience to God is the proof of your love. Have faith in God, He will never fail you.<br><br>Pray something like this:<br><br>&quot;Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is &#39;The way, the truth, and the life.&#39;&quot; Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus&#39; name I pray. Amen.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"http://needgod.com/\">needgod.com</a>", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T17:10:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "big bob 169", "comment_text": "As a young plastic model builder, I used one of my father&#39;s new blades and then managed to put it back on top for his next shave.
