We\u2019re in a cycle where every few hundred years, we are \u201creset\u201d. At some point, \u201ccanned food\u201d is made available to the public, like its a new idea. Most canned foods have enough preservatives to stay \u201cfresh\u201d for tens of thousands of years. The only thing \u201cfresh\u201d is the expiration stamp...and that can\u2019t even be confirmed considering this isn\u2019t even the only 2022 (or any other year for that matter) we\u2019ve experienced. There\u2019s several underground bunkers in Canada (\u201ccanned-duh\u201d) packed with acres, literally miles of warehouses with this shit stacked hundreds high. Canned food isn\u2019t the only ancient idea passed off as \u2018new age\u2019 either...apply this shit to electricity and micro chips and we\u2019ve literally had an internet before...", "comment_date": "2022-04-27T03:11:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Huff", "comment_text": "You can\u2019t beat Keystones meat", "comment_date": "2022-04-25T11:03:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Scoop of Science", "comment_text": "Those cans expire very soon, this is a reminder to them soon!", "comment_date": "2022-04-25T06:07:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brian Rigsby", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p40gaCou2Qs&amp;t=1m47s\">1:47</a> excuse me?

Trust me, no you don&#39;t. LOL. I survived on Keystone for years back when I didn&#39;t have a kitchen and refrigeration. I&#39;ve had the ground beef, shredded pork, chicken and turkey. The pork is by far the best and makes great pulled pork in a pinch, but when you open up a can, it&#39;s the nastiest looking stuff. The fat is congealed on top, and yes...it smells close to cat food. But I wonder...maybe cat food just smells like canned meat. After all, there are no seasonings in cat food, and there&#39;s only a salt cube in Keystone. Once you get in the pan and get it cooking, it smells like...meat! Again, the pork is great, I&#39;ve done stir frys with it. The chicken is great for soup but I find it too soft. I prefer the turkey, which has a much meatier mouth feel. I&#39;ve done turkey tetrazzini and it comes out great. Now, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the ground beef. depending on your palate, you&#39;ll see this as a plus or huge minus. The Brothers Green channel did a &quot;Taco Bell&quot; at home video. I hated it. They were disingenuous bc it was basically a video for your run-of-the-mill American taco night. They didn&#39;t go for the Taco Bell signature flavor. They used REAL, FRESH beef. WRONG MOVE. Fresh beef does not yield the same texture we all know and love from TB. Keystone&#39;s canned beef is OMG PERFECT. I remember when I used it for the first time with TB&#39;s seasoning, I almost lost my dang mind it was so good. Now the word &quot;fresh&quot; is an oxymoron here, but imagine that meat hot, fresh off the stove in a burrito? You can&#39;t get that at TB, which makes Keystone so damn important in my Taco Night.  Now, as I said, this could be a huge minus, but this should let you know what you&#39;re getting with Keystone&#39;s ground beef. It&#39;s great in chili and quick spaghetti sauce. I would NOT use this for more involved recipes like lasagna, the beef crumbles are very small. My issue with Keystone is that it is insanely expensive. I would only use it if: Like in the past when I had no kitchen or refrigeration. It was just me and my trusty electric skillet. Quick meal emergencies - keep it for those desperate pinches. Emergency/prepper kits. Camping. Quick meal kits like Chicken-, Turkey-, Hamburger Helper.<br><br>If you are like me, weak willed, and lack of thawed meat at dinner hurts your wallet bc no meat = carryout, then Keystone is for you. I buy it to allow myself NO EXCUSES for delivery or eating out because after delivery and tip, you could have bought another meal. For us carnivores that just need meat after sundown, this is a budget-saver.<br><br>I never tried the shredded beef as it never appealed to me in case anyone&#39;s curious.", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T08:21:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MyEyesBled", "comment_text": "They scrape rotting shards of meat together from slaughterhouse floors, then grind it up, mix it with chemicals, cook it in the can,  slap a label on it then give it to you to slurp up like a fly with a straw.", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T04:50:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ste Shar", "comment_text": "cooked in metal aluminium. not good", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T04:14:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bharat Pant", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t it dangerous to cook meat in a sealed can?
