Because most of us are not use to their headlights getting foggy. Reason being we still remember when we had glass headlights they almost never got foggy unless they had water inside. OK why does your headlights get foggy or oxidized?<br>Before we answer that question we need to understand the nature of the plastic headlights. First to beginning the plastic the lens are made from is porous so the manufacturer has to seal them for them to stay looking crystal clear over a long period of time. Now we know that we that you will be better able to understand the break down. Imagine if you will a vehicle in traffic moving at 60 to 80 mph. The cars in front of you are propelling debris from their rear tires at these high velocity onto the front of your vehicle where your headlights are located. This debris is basically sand, small rocks, dirt and petroleum. So it like your headlights are getting sand blasting everyday your drive your vehicle. Eventually what happens is some of the rocks will break or chip the sealer of the headlights. Then the dirt, acid rain and petroleum set into these cracks which are then cooked by the UV rays of the sun.<br>This cook up as I call it is the perfect condition for the breakdown of the sealer on your plastic headlights. These rip in the sealer gets bigger and more noticeable with time and eventually one day you notice your headlights are foggy or hazy. Another way you might realize you have oxidized headlights is  while driving at night you might be wondering whether or not your headlights are ON or OFF because your dramatic reduction of your light projection caused by your oxidized headlight lens. Oxidized lens can look cloudy, hazy, whitish in color or yellow and in some cases they feel rough to the touch. However the good thing is that these foggy, oxidized headlights can be fixed very easily without breaking your bank.&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-10-14T20:05:01Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Pedro", "comment_text": "Anyone know who is this manufacturer?", "comment_date": "2016-09-30T19:06:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hal Main", "comment_text": "Good video", "comment_date": "2016-08-28T20:29:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brent Hoadley", "comment_text": "all made In Mexico", "comment_date": "2016-04-30T16:33:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wil Cadianza", "comment_text": "how to convert glass headlights to this? my vehicle is slightly outdated and I have difficulty in purchasing the clear headlight. maybe they do not produce clear heheadlight for my vehicle", "comment_date": "2016-03-22T03:13:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BIG SHAQ", "comment_text": "What car uses those lights?
