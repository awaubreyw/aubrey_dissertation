It is a common misconception that we destroy forests for paper and lumber for construction. Usually, natural forests are not suitable for such practices, since we need specific trees with enough pulp content or hard straight wood for construction. We cut trees and plant trees at an increased volume each year. No one is worried that we will run out of potatoes if we want more potatoes. We eat more of them and in turn more will be planted. It is the same with trees. When you see deforestation in some countries, forest is not cut for lumber, since it is useless but rather burned to make way for farming. And there is a practice of clearcutting which can be bad for environment but today most regulated countries have knowledge how to do clearcutting to benefit the environment not to harm it. like encouraging specific types of trees or making way for grazing pastures where wildlife can eat. In short modern worry about trees is unfounded and more of a propaganda. If you want to see more forests, go buy more paper.", "comment_date": "2022-06-17T10:15:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "little black", "comment_text": "This demonstrates how human massively destroy trees for nothing.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T17:26:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrBanzoid", "comment_text": "Useless information time.
