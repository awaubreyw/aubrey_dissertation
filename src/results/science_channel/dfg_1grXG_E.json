That there some big brain, ugh boss we should upload another Mythbusters JR... I subscribed for verity, I subscribed to support one of my favorite channels to watch! What I cant support, is stealing Adam Savage away from Tested one or my favorite channels here on YouTube with some amazing content that he does. To make him mentor a bunch of 10 year olds who dont know the difference between moon and the sun yet. And on top of that, some how get  Robert Lee who voice acted mythbusters to come back and make the show bearable at best, the only reason I&#39;m able to listen or watch these clips is that Adam savage is there and his sexy mug kind makes me forget about the rest of the horrible show going on in the background, and secondly Robert Lee soothing voice brings me back to old science channel days. Such an icon living. I want to sit here and say maybe this time it be something else, maybe this time itll be mythbusters throw back. But I cant, i cant lie to myself any longer. Unsubscribe....
