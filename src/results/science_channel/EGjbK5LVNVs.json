In other words, it\u2019s the essence of all existence and non-existence \u2013 the ultimate creative force behind planets, stars, nebulae, people, animals, trees, fish, birds, and all phenomena, manifest or latent. All matter and intelligence are simply waves or ripples manifesting to and from this core source. Consciousness (enlightenment) is itself the actual creator of everything that exists now, ever existed in the past, or will exist in the future \u2013 right down to the minutest particles of dust \u2013 each being an individual ripple or wave.\u00a0The big difference between chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo and most other conventional prayers is that instead of depending on a \u2018middleman\u2019 to connect us to our state of inner enlightenment, we\u2019re able to do it ourselves. That\u2019s because chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo allows us to tap directly into our enlightened state by way of this self-produced sound vibration.\u00a0\u2018Who or What Is God?\u2019 If we compare the concept of God being a separate entity that is forever watching down on us, to the teachings of Nichiren, it makes more sense to me that the true omnipotence, omniscience and omnipresence of what most people perceive to be God, is the fantastic state of enlightenment that exists within each of us. Some say that God is an entity that\u2019s beyond physical matter \u2013 I think that the vast amount of information continuously being conveyed via electromagnetic waves in today\u2019s world gives us proof of how an invisible state of God could indeed exist.\u00a0For example, it\u2019s now widely known that specific data relayed by way of electromagnetic waves has the potential to help bring about extraordinary and powerful effects \u2013 including an instant global awareness of something or a mass emotional reaction. It\u2019s also common knowledge that these invisible waves can easily be used to detonate a bomb or to enable NASA to control the movements of a robot as far away as the Moon or Mars \u2013 none of which is possible without a receiver to decode the information that\u2019s being transmitted. Without the receiver, the data would remain impotent. In a very similar way, we need to have our own \u2018receiver\u2019 switched on so that we can activate a clear and precise understanding of our own life, all other life and what everything else in existence is.\u00a0Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day helps us to achieve this because it allows us to reach the core of our enlightenment and keep it switched on. That\u2019s because Myoho-Renge-Kyo represents the identity of what scientists now refer to as the unified field of consciousnesses.\u00a0To break it down \u2013 Myoho represents the Law of manifestation and latency (Nature) and consists of two alternating states. For example, the state of Myo is where everything in life that\u2019s not obvious to us exists \u2013 including our stored memories when we\u2019re not thinking about them \u2013 our hidden potential and inner emotions whenever they\u2019re dormant \u2013 our desires, our fears, our wisdom, happiness, karma \u2013 and more importantly, our enlightenment.\u00a0The other state, ho, is where everything in Life exists whenever it becomes evident to us, such as when a thought pops up from within our memory \u2013 whenever we experience or express our emotions \u2013 or whenever a good or bad cause manifests as an effect from our karma. When anything becomes apparent, it merely means that it\u2019s come out of the state of Myo (dormancy/latency) and into a state of ho (manifestation). It\u2019s the difference between consciousness and unconsciousness, being awake or asleep, or knowing and not knowing.\u00a0The second law \u2013 Renge \u2013 Ren meaning cause and ge meaning effect, governs and controls the functions of Myoho \u2013 these two laws of Myoho and Renge, not only function together simultaneously but also underlie all spiritual and physical existence.\u00a0The final and third part of the tri-combination \u2013 Kyo, is the Law which allows Myoho to integrate with Renge \u2013 or vice versa. It\u2019s the great, invisible thread of energy that fuses and connects all Life and matter \u2013 as well as the past, present and future. It\u2019s also sometimes termed the Universal Law of Communication \u2013 perhaps it could even be compared with the string theory that many scientists now suspect exists.\u00a0Just as the cells in our body, our thoughts, feelings and everything else is continually fluctuating within us \u2013 all that exists in the world around us and beyond is also in a constant state of flux \u2013 constantly controlled by these three fundamental laws. In fact, more things are going back and forth between the two states of Myo and ho in a single moment than it would ever be possible to calculate or describe. And it doesn\u2019t matter how big or small, famous or trivial anything or anyone may appear to be, everything that\u2019s ever existed in the past, exists now or will exist in the future, exists only because of the workings of the Laws \u2018Myoho-Renge-Kyo\u2019 \u2013 the basis of the four fundamental forces, and if they didn\u2019t function, neither we nor anything else could go on existing. That\u2019s because all forms of existence, including the seasons, day, night, birth, death and so on, are moving forward in an ongoing flow of continuation \u2013 rhythmically reverting back and forth between the two fundamental states of Myo and ho in absolute accordance with Renge \u2013 and by way of Kyo. Even stars are dying and being reborn under the workings of what the combination \u2018Myoho-Renge-Kyo\u2019 represents.\u00a0Nam, or Namu \u2013 which mean the same thing, are vibrational passwords or keys that allow us to reach deep into our life and fuse with or become one with \u2018Myoho-Renge-Kyo\u2019.\u00a0On a more personal level, nothing ever happens by chance or coincidence, it\u2019s the causes that we\u2019ve made in our past, or are presently making, that determine how these laws function uniquely in each of our lives \u2013 as well as the environment from moment to moment. By facing east, in harmony with the direction that the Earth is spinning, and chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo for a minimum of, let\u2019s say, ten minutes daily to start with, any of us can experience actual proof of its positive effects in our lives \u2013 even if it only makes us feel good on the inside, there will be a definite positive effect. That\u2019s because we\u2019re able to pierce through the thickest layers of our karma and activate our inherent Buddha Nature (our enlightened state). By so doing, we\u2019re then able to bring forth the wisdom and good fortune that we need to challenge, overcome and change our adverse circumstances \u2013 turn them into positive ones \u2013 or manifest and gain even greater fulfilment in our daily lives from our accumulated good karma. This also allows us to bring forth the wisdom that can free us from the ignorance and stupidity that\u2019s preventing us from accepting and being proud of the person that we indeed are \u2013 regardless of our race, colour, gender or sexuality. We\u2019re also able to see and understand our circumstances and the environment far more clearly, as well as attract and connect with any needed external beneficial forces and situations. As I\u2019ve already mentioned, everything is subject to the law of Cause and Effect \u2013 the \u2018actual-proof-strength\u2019 resulting from chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo always depends on our determination, sincerity and dedication.\u00a0For example, the levels of difference could be compared to making a sound on a piano, creating a melody, producing a great song, and so on. Something else that\u2019s very important to always respect and acknowledge is that the Law (or if you prefer God) is in everyone and everything.\u00a0NB: There are frightening and disturbing sounds, and there are tranquil and relaxing sounds. It\u2019s the emotional result of any noise or sound that can trigger off a mood or even instantly change one. When chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo each day, we are producing a sound vibration that\u2019s the password to our true inner-self \u2013 this soon becomes apparent when you start reassessing your views on various things \u2013 such as your fears and desires etc. The best way to get the desired result when chanting is not to view things conventionally \u2013 rather than reaching out to an external source, we need to reach into our own lives and bring our needs and desires to fruition from within \u2013 including the good fortune and strength to achieve any help that we may need.\u00a0Chanting Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo also reaches out externally and draws us towards, or draws towards us, what we need to make us happy from our environment.
