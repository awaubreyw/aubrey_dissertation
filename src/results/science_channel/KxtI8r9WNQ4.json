I should hope that the people who produced this video know that the Serpent Mound is far older than the Fort Ancient tribes of 1000 years ago. Local history as well as a growing number of archeologists around the world speculate that it&#39;s dated to at least the 3rd century BC and possibly older. There&#39;s been evidence of rebuilding, so it&#39;s entirely possible the Fort Ancient people did some work. But it should also be noted that immediately over the cliff from the head of the serpent there is also a rock jutting out from the cliffside that eerily resembles that of a snake. It coincidentally lines up with the solstice and is a little more difficult for the human species top manipulate. It&#39;s thought the serpent mound was built because of that cliff rock, and the alignment opens up more questions.

So that top formation (also you are forgetting about two formations that jet off the skull that are fins) you are talking about in this video could also be the blow hole personifying the map of the Arctic passage and how there is food once you get to the other side coast of the Arctic.  I like how it really looks like it is a depiction of a skeleton on top a hill/cliff that would be the body.  I really hope it might also be the entrance to a salt cave that leads to the Great Lakes or at least how they could build one by dissolving salt but I&#39;m not getting my hopes up.
