I spent the time waiting by playing arkanoid and smoking outside. This shop was different from others, the building had a reputation of being haunted and people didn&#39;t really trust the meat, but salty and firm were the dumplings so prosperous and suspicious the store remained. When they called my order number i dropped my cigarette where i stood and left with the dumplings before it could hit the ground.\r<br>So warm and moist they were, the box was a small heaven for my hands as i walked through the crisp fall night. It had frozen the night before, it might again soon. Tiny daggers hit my nostrils when all i wanted was more of the savory smell from the box. Fine threadlike hints of scent hit my nostrils like honey buttered feathers against my body during a caning. I couldn&#39;t help it, I wanted a bigger whiff. I stopped beneath a flickering light and pried the lid upward. It slowly released itself with a puff of moist steam. There they were, 8 beautiful shumai tender and waiting. I couldn&#39;t bear to expose them to the elements any longer than the brief moment it took for my eyes to make my stomach jealous of my tongue&#39;s proximity to my brain which gloated heavily about the experience. I shut the lid and continued onward. A small chill went across me, i felt suddenly alone.\r<br>Several streets passed and my forearms weren&#39;t getting heat from the box anymore, my time was running out. If they cooled off they would become a repulsive mess. It&#39;s a canonical sin but i opened the box just one more time, just to check on them, maybe fill my nose again. Ahh. There they were, 7 perfect shumai with the tiniest beads of sweat on them. Soon, dumplings, soon. I closed the box and started to walk again before a sound that i&#39;ve been ignoring caught up with me. My hair stood on end and my eyes searched every dark corner, for i didn&#39;t feel alone anymore.\r<br>I ordered 9 shumai and i just confirmed the status of 7 juicy and prime dumplings swollen with flavor begging to be bitten lightly into so they might burst outward. I sort of remember feeling the weight of the box when i got it and i&#39;m sure it&#39;s the same as it is now, i&#39;ve just been somewhat distracted with my surroundings. It&#39;s cold, it&#39;s dark, there are inconsistent amounts of cars and bikes parked in different areas and i really am not sure of my way around here but i&#39;m sure the bus station is in this direction. As i wait at this intersection the wind blows my jacket around and the thin cardstock of the box began to flap. I crossed the street quickly and ducked into a nearby alcove that once served as the entrance to a disco. Flashes of memories washed over me as the neon lights tried to keep things lit.\r<br>The box was warm, I used the flickering half dead light above me to check on the remaining dumplings. Ahh, beautiful. Four ripe and slightly sticky shumai. A small slice of heaven.\r<br>I panicked. I panicked a lot longer than i&#39;d like to admit and it wasn&#39;t a very show-y sort of panic, i just froze in place clutching the box with every fiber of my being yet without causing the box to bend or deform in any way. I clutched the air around the box so hard i cramped in both sides but i didn&#39;t notice because i was hyperventilating. \r<br>It&#39;s true, the restaurant that sells these incredible nodules of joy is located inside of a subdivided building that once was a mortuary, but the mortuary&#39;s gone so there&#39;s no problem right? Even if dead guys occupied the space of where my decadent pods of savory texture were created, that&#39;s nothing right? They wouldn&#39;t be mad at me about it? Right?!\r<br>My watch glowed in a window and i caught the time halfway through scaring myself to death and noticed i was late. If i got to the bus i&#39;d be okay and i&#39;d be fine and we&#39;d eat these 4 dumplings and everyone would have a good time okay? okay.\r Something near me made a flapping noise.<br>I sprinted. I might have cried a little but i do know i screamed once when someone came outside to walk their dog and most people in this city didn&#39;t have dogs that big and i couldn&#39;t clear it. I sprinted and when i was out of breath i jogged the rest of the way to the bus stop. I dropped the box on the bench and i dropped my butt on the ground and i dropped my head at a bad angle on the side of the bench so i was slightly underneath the bench clutching my head being angry at everything in the world when the bus stopped. \r<br>I composed myself and felt sane and part of society again, the cold artificial lights and the sneers from the passengers on board assured me that my torment was over. I hope in my thrashing and wailing i didn&#39;t mess up the dumplings though. As i approached the bus i opened the box and found no shumai, not one glamorous morsel. \r<br>I shrieked for more than a little while and dropped the box, it fell upside down and my bag fell on it and i ran to the bus that had already closed it&#39;s doors and begun driving away. I tripped and lost my balance and the bus turned the corner leaving me in the dark under a dim amber lamp illuminating the haunted box. In a fit of frightened rage i kicked my bag off of the box and the box flipped over and landed open, and that is when I saw it...  I saw...  9 shumai, stuck to the bottom of the lid.", "comment_date": "2021-01-01T05:54:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gingergargoyle", "comment_text": "You should specify that these are Chinese Dumplings, as there are several different types of dumplings - some with no filling at all!", "comment_date": "2020-12-29T18:44:55Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Mc Sween", "comment_text": "You just know that they got a whole set of ppe just for this video.
