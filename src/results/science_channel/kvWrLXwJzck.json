People, think about how everything works, think about how you got here and why? Nothing religious just heart and mind, could you understand what this world offers and how to better a life and a life of your own?

Life is amazing its something that doesn&#39;t make sense but also something you believe in. Look at the wall beside you or your ceiling? No, look at your phone? Your phone is everyone&#39;s daily routine we need to get out of it, again it&#39;s the mindset. Look at the stars, the sky, the moon, the sun. Your dreams affect you in more ways than you think, your dreams are more powerful than thoughts, dreams can be feelings, or something that you want or need. Look out your window and take it in that you only have experienced 0.2 percent of life you could have lived, and it can be taken away without warning.

Or maybe your brand of choice is Minute Maid or Simply Orange or Florida\u2019s Natural. Either way, I can ask the same question. Why is the taste and flavor so consistent? Why is it that the Minute Maid never tastes like the Tropicana, but always tastes like its own unique beverage?<br><br>Generally speaking, beverages that taste consistently the same follow recipes. They\u2019re things like Coca Cola or Pepsi or a Starbucks Frappuccino. When you make orange juice at home, each batch tastes a little different depending on the oranges you made it from. I hope you\u2019re hearing warning bells in your head right about now.<br>The reason your store bought orange juice is so consistently flavorful has more to do with chemistry than nature.<br>Making OJ should be pretty simple. Pick oranges. Squeeze them. Put the juice in a carton and voil\u00e0!<br>But actually, there is an important stage in between that is an open secret in the OJ industry. After the oranges are squeezed, the juice is stored in giant holding tanks and, critically, the oxygen is removed from them. That essentially allows the liquid to keep (for up to a year) without spoiling\u2013 but that liquid that we think of as orange juice tastes nothing like the Tropicana OJ that comes out of the carton. (source)<br><br>When the juice is stripped of oxygen it is also stripped of flavor providing chemicals. Juice companies therefore hire flavor and fragrance companies, the same ones that formulate perfumes for Dior and Calvin Klein, to engineer flavor packs to add back to the juice to make it taste fresh. Flavor packs aren\u2019t listed as an ingredient on the label because technically they are derived from orange essence and oil. Yet those in the industry will tell you that the flavor packs, whether made for reconstituted or pasteurized orange juice, resemble nothing found in nature. The packs added to juice earmarked for the North American market tend to contain high amounts of ethyl butyrate, a chemical in the fragrance of fresh squeezed orange juice that, juice companies have discovered, Americans favor. Mexicans and Brazilians have a different palate. Flavor packs fabricated for juice geared to these markets therefore highlight different chemicals, the decanals say, or terpene compounds such as valencine.<br>The formulas vary to give a brand\u2019s trademark taste. If you\u2019re discerning you may have noticed Minute Maid has a candy like orange flavor. That\u2019s largely due to the flavor pack Coca-Cola has chosen for it. Some companies have even been known to request a flavor pack that mimics the taste of a popular competitor, creating a \u201chall of mirrors\u201d of flavor packs. Despite the multiple interpretations of a freshly squeezed orange on the market, most flavor packs have a shared source of inspiration: a Florida Valencia orange in spring. (source)<br><br>WHY AREN\u2019T THESE FLAVOR PACKS LISTED AS INGREDIENTS?<br>Good question! As with all industrial foods, it\u2019s because of our convoluted labeling laws. You see, these \u201cflavor packs are made from orange by-products \u2014 even though these \u2018by-products\u2019 are so chemically manipulated that they hardly qualify as \u2018by-products\u2019 any more.\u201d (source) Since they\u2019re made from by-products that originated in oranges, they can be added to the orange juice without being considered an \u201cingredient,\u201d despite the fact that they are chemically altered.<br>SO, WHAT SHOULD YOU DO ABOUT IT?<br>First off, I must ask: Why are you drinking juice?? Juice removed from the fruit is just concentrated fructose without any of the naturally-occurring fiber, pectin, and other goodies that make eating a whole fruit good for you. Did you know, for example, that it takes 6-8 medium sized apples to make just 1 cup of apple juice? You probably wouldn\u2019t be able to eat 6-8 medium apples in a single sitting. (I know I can barely eat one!) But you can casually throw back a cup of apple juice, and you would probably be willing to return for seconds. That\u2019s why fruit juice is dangerous. It\u2019s far too easy to consume far too much sugar.", "comment_date": "2019-10-28T21:17:06Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Randy Sue", "comment_text": "Nobody else notice the stole Walmart cart", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T02:07:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Xander Vuorela", "comment_text": "What where is the 80&#39;s film?
