DMX 512 is the standard cable/signal used in many type of automated lighting, LED, Moving Heads, smoke/fog machines Etc.. This is also the same signal that is used by people that make those really cool Christmas light setups on their house that flash to music.", "comment_date": "2018-03-02T09:24:37Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "DanielTech", "comment_text": "How named this lens , that catch 60 led beams to a single beam?

But I have to give ETC a lot of credit, they&#39;ve done a lot in recent years to make it easier to re-use older Source Four bodies and swap the lamp out for LEDs.  That&#39;s going to make LED adoption much easier and happen a lot faster than it would if they just waited for people to invest in all LED specials.", "comment_date": "2016-10-28T01:49:44Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Guy's Sound and Light", "comment_text": "ETC Lighting for the win!", "comment_date": "2016-09-07T16:08:47Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "Chinanu Okoli", "comment_text": "THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!
