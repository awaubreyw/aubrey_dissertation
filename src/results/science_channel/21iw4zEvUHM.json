If you were on a ground floor or first level then the window is your only hope, but the guy once he realizes the door is a no go will immediately go to the windows so you are hoping that bracing the door bought you enough time to escape from the room before they got to the window, AND that you are out of eyesight, because if the guy sees you running, well you are in the same predicament as before. That&#39;s the thing, this strategy being used is not going to work. You won&#39;t escape. HOWEVER Barricading a door is not a bad idea.

The doors we have here is mostly NOT made of plywood (thin layers of wood stuck together), but rather one whole solid, thick piece of wood. Trying to break such a door by pure force is pointless without some kind of tool, like an axe, and even then the door would likely take some time to get down. <br>    I learned about this difference personally between a Swedish door and a door on Amerikan TV shows, when the bathroom door broke down (refused to react to handle and so got completely stuck). I tried not only to kick it but also an full out body tackle. <br>    I got more hurt than the door did from when I bounced off from that solid force of a door. And even after that I decided to turn my back to the door, take some support from opposite wall to said door (the bathroom connected to a narrow hallway thankfully) and kicked out. I then continued to kick out for a good 20-ish minutes. The damn door took no damage whatsoever. <br>    In a game I&#39;m pretty certain this door would be put in as that impossible boss that is more of a joke then an serious boss.<br>    In the end I had to sacrifice my library card to pend up the lock. That was fun to explain on the next trip to the library.<br><br><br>Of course this says nothing regarding if or if not you could barricade a door in Sweden with the furniture in a room.
