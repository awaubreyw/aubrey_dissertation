Its so informative and helpful. However I would like to add one such thing that nowadays optical fibers are a common name in life science and microbiology field too. There is one such company in USA world Precision Instruments is tirelessly working on this aspect and came up with a full range of optical fibers that basically fulfill the needs of a researchers. Please have a visit at our site and take a look at the product itself. We appreciate your valuable comments.
