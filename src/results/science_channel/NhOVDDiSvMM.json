If anything the very space time that your body exists in will harmonically expand as it falls into the curve caused by the ridiculous mass effect imposed by the star. Thing I cant stand about the modern scientist(s) is Group Think. No one thinks for themselves any more. I have multiple science degrees and I am glad I earned them later in life because it was impossible to brain wash me. As far as being ripped apart? No. Will you still exist in a living state, no, however the information that makes you you will live on in the atomic structure of the star, so you aren&#39;t deleted, you are functionally eliminated as your atoms will eventually be curved into the abyss of space time thus eliminating individual biological system functions. And I am highly challenging the modern fud that black holes have an infinitely dense singularity. This makes no sense and the equations, which I have reviewed are theoretical at best. A black hole must have a physical information storage mechanism otherwise they would not increase in size and mass as they consume more information. Another wonderful FUD of modern internet physicists is this notion of infinite singularity b.s.  If a black hole simply packed all information that falls into it, into some infinitely dense point, then why does the S. Radius of the hole increase over time as it consume more stuff? Unless it is pooping out of a white hole in dimension X only then would that make sense if a black hole could consume another black hole and stay the same exact size. If this were the case then all black holes in all of the universe would be the same exact size.  Black holes have a surface just like a neutron star and you can bet its so incredibly dense than a mountain range would be the size of a quark or less. A black hole is simply a Neutron star running in high octane. Its a neutron star that was pushed just past the point of light being able to escape. Add a little more mass and you cross the rubicon. You can betcha sweet ass if you got slammed onto the surface of a black hole you are gonna spin tightly packed on top of everything else that makes that thing a thing for the next 2 trillion years.", "comment_date": "2021-01-28T07:46:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikey Jackson", "comment_text": "Mikey", "comment_date": "2021-01-27T21:27:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WolfPlayzRx [Official]", "comment_text": "What if You&#39;re On Between Of Two Neutron Stars?", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T07:20:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stifly", "comment_text": "The thumbnail looks like the Guy is dabbing<br>What a savage meme soldier", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T03:11:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SnoopyDoo", "comment_text": "So why am I watching this just before I go to bed?", "comment_date": "2021-01-21T20:33:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "29 Neutron Supawish Tumrongwittayapak", "comment_text": "My name is neutron lol", "comment_date": "2021-01-05T06:19:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "whayne longjhonsondanglesmoore", "comment_text": "Conjecture makes your head wobble", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T00:00:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "infinitytoinfinitysquaredbitch", "comment_text": "If you could drop an object from just 1 meter above a neutron star, it would hit the surface at ~900 miles per SECOND.", "comment_date": "2020-12-30T00:32:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CheezyBoi", "comment_text": "NOOOOOOOO  CHUUUUUUUUUCK", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T18:08:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J.L.

Gravity presses the material in on itself so tightly that protons and electrons combine to make neutrons, yielding the name &quot;neutron star. They are so dense that a sugar cube sized lump of material from a neutron star would have a weight of approximately 1 billion metric tons (equivalent to the weight of Everest mountain). Inside a neutron star, there&#39;s a delicate balance between the tremendous gravity of the star, and the degeneracy pressure of the neutrons. The neutron star&#39;s density also gives it very high\u00a0surface gravity, more than 200 billion times that of\u00a0Earth. Neutron stars have an\u00a0escape velocity of 150,000 km/s which is half the\u00a0speed of light. The neutron star&#39;s gravity accelerates infalling matter to tremendous speed. The force of its impact would likely destroy the object&#39;s component atoms, rendering all the matter identical, to the rest of the neutron star matter. If an object were to fall from a height of one meter on a neutron star, it would reach the ground at 7.200.000 kilometers per hour.<br>\u2022 Starquake and Gama Rays Burst<br>The crust is composed of broken-up atoms of iron with a sea of\u00a0electrons\u00a0flowing through the gaps between them. This crust is extremely hard and very smooth (with maximum surface irregularities of ~5\u00a0mm), due to the extreme gravitational field. About a kilometer below the surface, neutrons and any surviving protons are squeezed together so close that they organize themselves into some really odd structures such as sheets, cylinders and others. This inner crust of neutron star, which was called nuclear pasta because of the resemblance of spaghetti and lasagna, could be 10 billion times stronger than steel and possibly the strongest material in the universe. Due to either its ultra-strong interior\u00a0magnetic fields or spindown, an unimaginably massive quake occurs by ripping the immensely strong crust of neutron star only one centimeter in lenght in a tenth of a second. It realeses much more energy in a form of gama rays into the space through that one centimeter crack than the Sun emits in 150,000 years. But the inconceivably powerful gravitaional field of a neutron star reconstructs its surface and covers the crack in a blink of an eye. The largest recorded quake was equivalent to a magnitude 23. Had it occurred within a distance of 10 light years from Earth, the quake could have triggered a mass extinction on Earth.<br>\u2022 Surface Heat<br>Neutron stars are extremely hot and have a surface temperature of around 1.000.000 C degrees. Anything approaching a neutron star too close immidiately evaporates.<br>\u2022 Electromagnetic Field <br>Neutron stars are characterized by their extremely powerful magnetic fields. These magnetic fields are from hundred millions to quadrillions (magnetar) of times more powerful than\u00a0the field surrounding Earth. The magnetic field of a magnetar would be lethal even at a distance of 1000\u00a0km. The strong magnetic forces would start to squeeze the electron orbits in all the atoms in your body. The molecules that make up your body are only able to hold together when they are made from normal shaped atoms. So once the atomic orbitals got sufficiently distorted, their chemistry would change dramatically and these molecules would start to fall apart. And your body would be reduced to a dusty, incoherent mess.<br>\u2022 Electromagnetic radiation<br>Most of the light generated by a neutron star is in the form of gama and X rays due to its extreme surface heat, high electromagnetic field and matter acceretion from a near companion. The strong magnetic fields combined with rapid rotation create an awesome generator that can produce electric potential differences of quadrillions of volts. Such voltages, which are 30 million times greater than those of lightning bolts, create deadly blizzards of high energy particles. These high-energy particles (protons and electrons) produce beams of radiation from radio through gamma-ray energies emanating from the poles of the magnetic field. Like a rotating lighthouse beam, the radiation can be observed as a pulsing source of radiation. The pulsar in the Crab Nebula has been observed to pulse in almost every wavelength\u2014radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray. A few dozen pulsars are observed to pulse in X-rays and six are seen to pulse in gamma-rays.<br>\u2022 Rotation<br>Neutron stars are the fastest rotating objects in the universe. The fastest-spinning neutron star known, which is 15 kilometres in diameter, is\u00a0rotating at a rate of 716 times a second or 43,000\u00a0revolutions per minute, giving nearly a quarter the\u00a0speed of light (75.000 km/s) at the surface of equator.<br>A neutron star wouldn&#39;t be able to hold itself together at such a high speed rotation if it weren&#39;t its tremendous gravitational force.", "comment_date": "2019-05-22T11:15:26Z", "likes_count": 37}, {"comment_by": "karto robox", "comment_text": "Rip my dummy T-T", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T04:48:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "polyrhythmia", "comment_text": "To be able to hit the target would be exceedingly difficult given the small size .", "comment_date": "2019-05-19T17:41:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nexus", "comment_text": "Maybe if i train there i would be even able to defeat ui goku", "comment_date": "2019-05-13T17:40:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ed Speece", "comment_text": "If the gravity is so intense, why are there irregularities on the surface?", "comment_date": "2019-05-12T22:50:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel DeVito", "comment_text": "To be honest, I find pulsars and magnetars more fascinating than anything in the Universe.

With regard to the opening comment about &quot;a little stone sized piece of neutron star matter,&quot; there was no reference point given as to the weight of the material. That&#39;s all relative: WHERE would it weigh 100 million metric tons? On Earth?<br><br>Say it is on Earth... The next comment, that the matter would fall right through your hand, is incorrect, as that much mass would not only be attracted to the Earth, but would also attract YOU to it, and the Earth to it. It wouldn&#39;t simply &quot;fall through your hand;&quot; It would pull you into it as well. And the Earth&#39;s rotation would actually be disrupted, as it&#39;s center of gravity would be offset due to the addition of such incredible mass on it&#39;s surface. The Earth would begin to wobble about it&#39;s offset CG. This would also disrupt the orbit of the Moon.<br><br>Bottom line: This was a terrible explanation/analogy.<br><br>2. With regard to the atomized body of the crash test dummy, the elongated stream of atoms would NOT &quot;impact the surface&quot; of the neutron star at 100k miles/second, causing a huge burst of energy equivalent to &#39;x&#39; number of nuclear bombs; Instead, it would enter into an orbit around the neutron star in a manner much like material falling into a black hole forms an accretion disc around it. It would take some time for the atoms to reach the actual surface of the neutron star, and when they did, there would be little fanfare, as there would be absolutely NO impact like that described in the video. The atoms wouldn&#39;t even impact the surface at the same time; They would all be spread out around the neutron star, and strike the surface at different times<br><br>So in short, this information is bogus. It&#39;s Fake Science, where the objects and numbers being discussed are real, but the described interactions between those objects are contrary to the laws of physics, totally made up, and over-dramatized for effect.
