If I had a fuel source burning from combustion or fusion, and then it looses its main source.. it goes out and begins to cool and collapse? Then a black hole is a star that collapsed and CHANGED STATE to a galactic liquid. The reason everything spins around and orbits at light speed is because, a gas being pulled into a liquid in a vacuum will be displaced. Gravity and repelling forces at the same time. But as you know, massive gravity slows down time, causing cooling of the spinning materials, this causes liquid rivers of fuel to pour into the hole, which goes down by the way, the impact in solace time is so heavy of a footprint, that it literally makes a hole (orbit hole) like a plastic or felt sheet would with a bowling ball on top of itself.", "comment_date": "2022-05-09T10:30:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VanessLife Tag Force Special! :*", "comment_text": "Gas moves fast.
