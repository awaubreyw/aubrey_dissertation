The Pope never spoke out about the atrocities, even though informed.  <b>The French and Bolshevik revolutions infuriated Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18, and that is why both Russia and France were attacked.  1798, the French Revolution ended the Bible&#39;s for told 1260 years of complete subjugation of the world, including the death penalty for observing the Sabbath (which is not (sun)day) and for Biblical festivals, like Passover(538AD was the beginning of the death decree, by Roman Consul(Emperor Justinian).</b>  The UK also had a secret they wanted hidden by the fog of WW2. <b>Turkey and Arab States are where Gog and Magog are of the Bible&#39;s Ezekiel 38, and surrounded by seas(Walid Shoebat), which to be driven in to as per the Bible&#39;s description.  Turkey is also directly north of Israel, and where the bible calls the &quot;seat of Satan&quot;. Constantinople(Roman Emperor Constantine&#39;s city, now Istanbul, Turkey) was headquarters of Rome in the past. Rosh means head, but just because Russia sounds like the Hebrew word for head, doesn&#39;t mean it is the head(Rosh) of Gog and Magog.  They are not even in the same Country.  Gog Magog war comes after the 1000 years of peace on earth.</b> A sovereign city is under attack in Florida USA, by an American Governor Ron Desantis, for speaking about Biblical matters. <b>He talks how it is waking people up, and must stop.  This is war over knowing God. The US claims to believe in Democracy and has in God we trust on money, but are attacking God.</b>  80% of US money has been printed in the last couple years, with the stock market just better than the drop of the great depression of 1929 and still falling.  <b>NATO must be broken up, and is the greatest obstacle to peace in the world.  The time is quickly approaching for all nations to take control of oppressive business holdings of NATO Countries, as enemies of you and the world.</b>  Take away their terror production ability.  <b>NATO changed the name of Ukraine&#39;s Capital from a Russian word to some thing else. Refused to talk peace. US Senator Jim Risch on video says,&quot;we can not let this end&quot;, when reffering to the Ukraine war.  Stockpiles of NATO weapons were found in bunkers in Ukraine.  The evidence to invade Iraq, still has not been given, or Syria. NATO nations have military bases around the world(800+). They are masters of deception, and misdirecting anger.</b>  Revelation 18:6,24. <b>The church claims they are the new Jerusalem, and the Vatican represents God&#39;s temple, so the Pope is the one sitting in the (false) temple with 666 on his crown and the sign of the religion and empire in his hand(the cross).</b>  US Senator Lindsay Graham said that Ukraine&#39;s war is the US war, and that the year 2017 would be the year of offense(wow). That was before this so called invasion.  US&#39;s Mike Pompeo also said that the war would start in 2017.  <b>President Donald J. Trump said over 3 1/2 years ago that the US would soon be at war with Russia and China.</b>  Christian networks, behind the scenes are fomenting a war against China, using false attacks on Taiwan.  These people are totally evil. <b>NATO is the military arm of the beast system. (M.O.B. (cross/X) on flag). People pledge an allegiance to its supposed ideals. Bow to what the image(cross/2crossed swords of Islam/X of Rome) represents or die.  Catechism of the Catholic Church say no &quot;buy or sell&quot; or greeting to any who leaves the cross(Church). Those who don&#39;t accept it, have fire rain down from heaven in the sight of men.</b>  Remember this! No man has greater love than this, that he give his life for his friends.  <b>Joe Biden now says, that the weapon stockpiles in Ukraine were there preemptively for when Russia attacked Ukraine.  So when the offensive attack came that Lindsay Graham, Mike Pomeo and Donald Trump were talking about in advance. Russia entered Ukraine because weaponization in Ukraine against Russia and because of killing of so called Russian separatists and sympathizers. NATO Countries are stealing Russian assets claiming on account of the war, but it seams to be the other way around.  NATO was attacking Russians in Ukraine and militarizing for an all out assault.  The West would not negotiate with Putin to prevent the escalation.  So seaze NATO property, confiscate their money in your Country, stop their monetary transactions and send them packing.</b>  Do to them, what they were doing.  <b>Why does the Roman Empire and Church(called Roman Catholic Church) exist, when the Bible in Revelation 17,18 says it is evil and responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth?  Verse 6 of chapter 18 of Revelation says to pay her back double for what she has done to others.</b>  Is Donald Trump a prophet, or was he just ahead of schedule proclaiming wars with Russia and China?  <b>Think!</b>  The war with China hasn&#39;t even started yet, but it was Trump saying that the corona virus started in China.  <b>He thought he could get you to start a war through that, but it is not China spraying your cities just before outbreaks.</b> Look up, see spraying!  <b>Taiwan has no embassies, as it is not a Country, but a part of China, as openly acknowledged till recently(accept Lithuania, which is going to be used to start war on Russia and China).</b>  Trump authorized &quot;operation warp speed&quot; to force vaccinate by military force.  He authorized death by poison gas, electrocution and firing squad to the already authorized lethal injection. <b>America you are fighting for your life, don&#39;t choose cowardice, as the world counts on you!</b>  The world collectively belongs to all mankind.  <b>It is greedy people who try to usurp the resources and control.</b>  All people deserve dignity and their fair share. <b>This is not NATO helping Ukraine, but a NATO take over of Ukraine and war on Russia. Ukraine was part of Russia.(Russian language and history being hidden).</b> Biden stopped 3 gas pipelines and all exploration in Alaska, but didn&#39;t even envite the largest electric car company to an electric vehicle fair. US future walkers?  <b>How many nations of the world will be attacked by an alliance that the Bible calls satanic before people realize it must be stopped?</b>  Revelation 18:4 &quot;Get out of her my people&quot;   NATO-Rome/UK attacking Acts2:44. <b>Taking a righteous stand is never easy, and God says no COWARDS will inherit his Kingdom.</b> Research Boris Johnston&#39;s &quot; plan A&quot;, corona virus deaths not working, WAR!  <b>New vaccines for new variants, with out testing and very quickly, how?</b>  Prince Charles was recorded hugging the Pope and congratulating him on his war.  What war?  British Royals own video. <b>NATO is planning to go to war with the Solomon Islands if they militarize, but Russia had no right to defend themselves from the NATO aggressors militarizing Ukraine with the goal of destroying Russia, and attacking Russian loyalists(NATO only defensive lol).</b> Carefully Share this information and pray for Russia and Ukraine, and <b>clear browser and site history!</b>    Sweden/Finland extremely militarized with M.O.B. on equipment and on Russia&#39;s border. <b>Think!  Remember the German Nazis?</b>  German tanks in Ukraine and Lithuania.  <b>When media disallows commenting is because of deception.  Unbiased media that hides opinions(how can that be possible?)</b>  2400+ Nazis(Nazi tattoos) surrender to Russia in Ukraine.  <b>NATO is headed for a trap that they will not be able to get out of. US President admits, behind the NATO proxy war. Unless the US people stop what is happening, get out of the US, get out of the US!</b>  Roman Catholic Joe Biden is making moves, like Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler.  <b>Rome and cronies attacking businesses and products.</b> Think!  Corona/monkey pox(they&#39;re changing the name)/leopard pox/*heat lockdowns* about to arrive world wide compliments of Rome/UK. <b>UK saying the culling of ALL domestic animals coming(Pharaoh like control, bow or die).</b>  2 US billionaires say US dollar collapse and civil war coming. <b>(G7 ban Russian gold to prop up their fiat currencies, based on faith, but not faith in God, 2Corinthians4:4)</b>  The great reset before being hijacked by Nazi billionaires was that every man will have property including his own fig tree and grape vines(obviously a dwelling), which became the you won&#39;t own any thing and you&#39;ll be happy.  <b>These are the guys attacking Russia and Ukraine(like WW2).</b> <br> Stallenburg admits NATO was providing Ukraine heavy weapons for a long time(NATO, defensive?). <b>Bitcoin=gold backed decentralized, Church/State digital currency=faith backed, centralized/enslavement 2023.</b> The UK imported a king from Germany @WW2 to marry the British Queen and take her last name, fooling the masses. <b>WW3=WW2=Rome&#39;s war on Acts2:44. Select, copy, paste, email and print, and repeat.</b> NATO has Russian weapons. <b>Leaders of Ukraine military, foreign.  The war was going to be a distraction from the G7 digital dollar of 2014, 2017, but failed to arrive then, but will arrive 2023. Russian gold banned, to protect fiat $. I&#39;m not Russian, so quit attacking them!  Rome starting WW3 to hide expos\u00e9.  *WW1=WWincome tax, think!</b> Angola, Japan = Rome.

Chapman&#39;s Products are distributed across Canada.[4]<br><br>The company was the first dairy products company in Ontario to have its own wastewater treatment plant. They have been recognized by their industry and by the Province of Ontario for their ecological leadership. David and Penny Chapman&#39;s son, Ashley, currently runs the business.[2] <br><br>In 1973, David and Penny Chapman purchased the Creamery in Markdale, Ontario, a village just south of Georgian Bay. The company started out as a small creamery with four employees and two trucks.[4]<br><br>In 2001, a distribution center was opened New Brunswick to better serve Chapman&#39;s Atlantic Canada.[5]<br><br>On September 4, 2009, a major fire gutted the Chapman&#39;s creamery. No employees were hurt in the blaze. Chapman&#39;s had been using a smaller plant since the fire.[6]<br><br>On September 4, 2010 they opened its new facility on the anniversary of the destruction of the old plant. The smaller plant was converted into a nut facility, while the addition of the new plant became a nut-free facility (the larger of the two plants is about quadruple the size of the old one) allowed the hiring of 50 to 100 new employees.[7] <br><br>Productions centred in Markdale, with two plants located in the town, the 65,000 square feet (6,000 m2) smaller plant is a nut facility, while the larger 150,000 square feet (14,000 m2) plant is nut-free. The company also operates a 140,000 sq ft (13,000 m2) distribution centre south of town on Highway 10. There is another distribution centre in Hampton, New Brunswick to serve the Atlantic provinces.
