They are all spheroidal.   Paraboloid detectors are used where the mirror is itself movable.  Spheroidal mirrors like these are used where the mirror is fixed, but the receiver is mobile (or, like the 200ft wall mirror shown, with multiple receivers/microphones).  The demonstration would have been much more successful had they realised that  - as she was almost certainly nowhere near the &quot;focal point&quot; she claimed.<br><br>The rationale for this comes down to basic physics.  It is nicely set out in a contemporary publication to which  Professor WS Tucker himself contributed: &quot;The Theory of Anti-Aircraft Sound Location and Detection&quot; published in 1932.<br><br>The revised and updated version (published May 2017) of &quot;Echoes from the Sky&quot; by the late Richard N Scarth is highly recommended for the historical background to these structures.", "comment_date": "2018-03-04T22:49:02Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "SupaEMT134", "comment_text": "Okay, I <i>definitely</i> need to date her.
