Namely when after a fake coin is detected, an infrared retinal scan of the subject is made as well as a detailed AI-based facial analysis conducted to determine if the subject is a thief with the intention of stealing or merely unwittingly having deposited the fake coin he or she did not know they inserted. If the analysis confirms the subject is a thief, an 92.6 terawatt laser canon is immediately deployed and the subject is vaporized, body, cloths, and all, leaving no trace of them.

It detects the weight of the coin because of the featherweight it uses as a scale. Not what image is struck on the coin. I had a friend in the 8th grade and we tried it. We found some sheets of metal the same thickness as a quarter. Well, first we weighed a quarter on a scale and it weighed exactly 0.200 ounces. So we took that quarter, put it on the metal sheet, got a marker and drew circles on the metal sheet using the real quarter as a template.The fake coins we cut from the metal all weighed 0.205 ounces. We didn&#39;t think that that minute difference would matter. We just wanted to try this first so we cut only 40 to start with. We go to the bowling alley by his house that has an arcade in it as well as vending machines. When we tried our quarters, they spit out right away all the time. So we thought that maybe the 0.005 ounces more of our coins mattered. So we rode our bikes back to his house and filed them down on his dad&#39;s electric sander to exactly 0.200 ounces. When we got back to the arcade, they worked perfectly every time just like real quarters. In both the vending machines and the video games. We were elated! So when we ran out of our quarters, we went back to his house to make more. From each sheet of metal we were able to make 80 &quot;quarters.&quot; Each sheet of metal cost $1.25 back then. This was back in the 1980s through the 1990s. Of course we couldn&#39;t use them in stores but we had all the free play on the video games and all the free snacks and pop we wanted from the vending machines. But we were smart. We didn&#39;t keep it all to ourselves. We told our friends and kids at school and made money off of them. We sold 80 of our quarters for $5. So they could buy $20 of stuff from vending machines or play video games. They sold well.

The video gets the crucial part wrong.<br>The one that we used did not need any light sensors and there is definitely no &quot;electromagnets&quot;. Most coins do not use magnetic metals so there is no reason use electromagnet on them.<br>Instead what they do is they use a coil and THE COIN BECOMES THE CORE OF THE ELECTROMAGNET for a very brief moment (how cool is that?)<br>The coin falls through a chute at a known speed and while it falls it is subjected to eddy currents at a known distance from the coil. While the coin is falling, the field generates eddy currents and this causes the entire setup to act as a transformer and draw current from coil power supply. The current draw is measured and given as a signal and strength of that signal over time is used to identify coins. The plot will depend on the dimensions of the coin (larger coins take more time to pass) and different alloys and thickness of the coin will result in a different strength of the signal. Some countries use coins with multiple bands of different alloys and this makes identification especially easy/reliable. Also, the worst coins are ones that are not round (for example octagonal outside or square holes in it) as they tend to generate slightly different signals when passing through the sensor.<br>Props to the animator!", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T22:11:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "[[[ *Dragonier* ]]]", "comment_text": "Don\u2019t you hate it when you\u2019re at a vending machine and this happens <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AkcWjB0UBE&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a>", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T22:03:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swaggy Shark", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AkcWjB0UBE&amp;t=1m49s\">1:49</a> cap", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T21:40:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JoshAndBooze", "comment_text": "This is so American in every way", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T21:31:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammad Abuirsheid", "comment_text": "That stuck snack laser thing is a blessing.<br><br>I once had a Snickers bar, and a bag of takis stuck in the vending machine, it refunded both, then I dropped a bottle of water on them and I got $3 worth of snacks for 50 cents.

Many memories of helping him clean and repair machines, filling them, and counting and rolling up coins while we were driving to the next location.   Plus moving machines in and out of locations, often up and down narrow stairs.  Don&#39;t miss that part.  <br>   The previous version of the coin acceptor/rejector and counter is a masterwork of electromechanical design.    First the coin goes through the ACMR  (All Coin Mechanical Rejector) It sorted the coins by size and weight to put them into different chutes by denomination, and passed them by a magnet to detect steel slugs.   It even had a mechanism that checked for the milling on the edges of the quarters and dimes.       <br>   Once the ACMR sorted and accepted them they went into chutes that counted each coin and transmitted pulses of current to the totalizer.   A nickel sent one pulse, a dime two, and so on.  Once enough total accumulated, it unlocked the rest of the machine to dispense a candy bar or whatever.  SImple machines only allowed a single price across all selections, more complicated ones allowed multiple prices.  Once an item got vended, the totalizer deducted the price, then dispensed change (mostly nickels, but later dimes and nickels )into the coin return chute until the totalizer counted back down to zero.    The change tubes had a clever design to replenish them with nickels and dimes, and when full, divert them to the coin box.  <br>   If a coin was off weight or the milling was missing from the quarters or dimes, they diverted it to the coin return chute.   Coins that were bent, and slugs that were ferrous or had holes in the middle (washers) got trapped in the ACMR, and you had to press the coin return lever that dumped everything into the coin return chute, and told the totalizer to return all accumulated value.    (that was one of the tricks for when you didn&#39;t have a dime for a pay phone, you put a quarter into the candy machine and then pressed coin return, and you got back nickels and dimes.) <br>   These coin mechanisms were complicated and needed to be kept clean and lubricated properly. We would routinely carry a couple of spare coin mechanisms to replace ones that had gotten sticky or jammed a lot.  You could adjust them to be loose or tight in the tolerances of the coins, but tuning it tight meant that worn coins would be rejected because they were light and thinner, and irritating to legit customers.", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T03:22:36Z", "likes_count": 692}, {"comment_by": "Lucas_GamingYT", "comment_text": "every time the machine split apart to look at the details, l thought it was exploding", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T03:20:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JuicyMangoes", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AkcWjB0UBE&amp;t=1m48s\">1:48</a> thats a damn lie and you know it!", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T03:16:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RobloxSky1337", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AkcWjB0UBE&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a>  I personally don\u2019t like the Chinese gover-<br>My Chinese vending machine :", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T03:15:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fukk.Spooky", "comment_text": "Vending machine lore", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T03:14:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RobloxSky1337", "comment_text": "Props to the camera guy for filming", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T03:13:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SuperCosmicChaos", "comment_text": "why dose it not work with soda then, always steals my money!", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T03:11:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kyllo", "comment_text": "I love quick answers with relevant bonus content after!", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T02:47:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trent Roussel", "comment_text": "Who else high", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T02:35:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trent Roussel", "comment_text": "Wow", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T02:35:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Sheehan", "comment_text": "What if I only have dollar bills? \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T02:27:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beemanblake", "comment_text": "Did u see the doritos were called chips demons?", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T02:14:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "carr3942", "comment_text": "Avengers level animation", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T02:11:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DreamScape", "comment_text": "i always just wondered why they don&#39;t make the glass a dome shape so the snack never touches the glass to begin with", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T02:03:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fisher Zhao", "comment_text": "Time to make a Vending Machine Lore", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T01:50:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pixel man", "comment_text": "Vending machine lore", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T01:41:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frederick Kriesel", "comment_text": "By detecting if the person is a bitch.", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T01:38:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrick McCarthy", "comment_text": "I spent a quarter at a soda machine and got ripped off, so I called the number on the machine to complain, I was sent a coupon for a free 2 liter, I came out ahead on that deal.", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T01:22:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexius Corylus", "comment_text": "I hope 3d animator got a snack at least for his work", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T01:17:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aqeel Ali", "comment_text": "The animation made this the most interesting video I\u2019ve watched all year \ud83e\udee1", "comment_date": "2022-06-06T01:08:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "neubro 144", "comment_text": "Or any identical looking foreign coins worth less that tricked the machine.

And the laser mechanism depicted would do nothing to detect if a coin is fake. There&#39;s no way for it to measure the size of the coin. That type of mechanism is for counting. It works just like one of those laser trip beams from a security system. There&#39;s a laser that shines on a detector and when coins roll past, they block the laser, and the detector counts how many times the laser is blocked and thus how many coins rolled past. I speak from 4 years experience as an electrical engineer. And from a hobby level interest in point of sale systems. Weird interest, I know lol. But good science channels get you interested in weird things. Laminar flow, anyone?<br><br>Using their vague &quot;magnets and lasers&quot; explanation, I could describe how a blu-ray player works. &quot;How does a blu-ray player work?

At the time, he had done this because the snack had gotten stuck near the bottom, but just out of reach so it\u2019s justifiable until I came by at that moment. <br><br>This is where I had a eureka moment. I told my friend I can help him get more friends if he\u2019s willing to listen. He said sure and asked me the idea. <br><br>I told him that if we combined our pens together using a rubber end to hold it together in the middle and manipulate it the same way he had done, we could get free snacks. He agreed.<br><br>And boy, oh boy, we had free snacks for DAYS. While we only were able to get snacks of the first and second rows and an occasional third, that was still a lot, so much so that we just gave it away for free at one point. <br><br>We had our few close calls and did caught once by a teacher, but she never reported us in and we never got by security cameras because of the location of the vending machine. <br><br>But thanks to COVID, we only spent half the year doing this and my school probably never noticed.", "comment_date": "2021-06-30T01:15:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nater K", "comment_text": "&quot;The machine deciphers coins with pinpoint accuracy.&quot;<br><br>Me: <b>Tries inserting dollar bill for the 7th time, only to have it rejected because there is an atom-sized crease on one of the corners</b>", "comment_date": "2021-06-30T01:02:14Z", "likes_count": 3979}, {"comment_by": "ManyFaceImpressions", "comment_text": "Me rn: <b>thinking about the Mr Krabs coin vending machine flashback</b> <br>Also me: &quot;So that was a f*<b>***</b> lie?!&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-06-30T00:55:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "x8nis", "comment_text": "This is a lot dramatic than it actually is", "comment_date": "2021-06-30T00:25:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BlackflameRBLX", "comment_text": "The vending machines are getting smarter", "comment_date": "2021-06-29T23:59:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "San P", "comment_text": "Who ever knew that this would be more interesting than learning science", "comment_date": "2021-06-29T23:44:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dwayne Sewell", "comment_text": "If Any of y\u2019all ever see me successfully rob a vending machine , blame this video.", "comment_date": "2021-06-29T23:41:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The ndingo show", "comment_text": "When your snack is stuck in between the metal rings your screwed", "comment_date": "2021-06-29T23:31:19Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Mincrafter", "comment_text": "when the vending machine does it go back to shape like bumble bee", "comment_date": "2021-06-29T23:29:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MACKS FAN", "comment_text": "That didn&#39;t tell me a thing.

Vending-machine interventions that stimulate low-calorie choices can therefore play a role in improving the healthfulness of the food environment landscape. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of four vending-machine interventions, varying in level of intrusiveness, on consumers\u2019 choices, consumers\u2019 acceptance of such interventions, and consumers\u2019 evaluations of the choice they made. In a between-subjects design experiment (N = 206), respondents were asked to purchase a snack and a beverage from a vending machine. In addition to a no-intervention condition, four types of incrementally intrusive interventions were implemented: calorie labelling, increasing accessibility of low-calorie choices, increasing prices of high-calorie choices, and restricting availability of high-calorie choices. A post-choice questionnaire included items concerning intervention acceptance, and assortment and choice evaluations. Compared to the no-intervention condition, the most intrusive intervention (i.e. restricting availability of high-calorie choices) led to more low-calorie choices (39% vs. 78%), while less intrusive interventions (i.e. calorie labelling, increasing accessibility of low-calorie choices, and increasing prices of high-calorie choices) did not. Intervention acceptance and choice evaluations were equally high across the four intervention types. Overall, the results suggest that restricting high-calorie options is a promising route to stimulate healthier choices from vending machines. As such, the present study provides intervention opportunities in the combat against obesity for governments and their potential allies, such as food manufacturers and the food service industry.", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T07:36:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "olerode", "comment_text": "Me: <b>Inserts fake coin</b><br>vending machine: <b>detects</b><br>Me again: <b>used axe to break</b><br>Mall: <b>sorry were closed</b><br><br><br><br><b>INSERT TITANIC SOUND</b>", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T06:18:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eesa Gaming", "comment_text": "Did anyone else feel like shouting <b><i>&quot;Nerd!&quot;</i></b> throughout the video?", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T06:17:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Eesa Gaming", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AkcWjB0UBE&amp;t=1m56s\">1:56</a><br><br><b><i>And he waddled away.

There were a series of cradles which the coin would fall through or get caught in and rotated (flipped) on through the process. For coins that had ridges there were  wire pickers. They would detect ridges on the coins and accept or reject them.<br>Nickles would go through the first rocker device (used for quarters) and travel down to the nickle rocker. After it met that test it would roll down a small ramp to the nickle &quot;bouncing block&quot;. If it was a good nickle and being heavy enough it would bounce a certain distance and be accepted. If it was not a nickle it would be rejected. <br>The old coin changers did not have an escrow system. If you put your money in and the product was out that you wanted you had to choose another. You could not get your money back.<br>The old soft drink machines had 7watt white Christmas tree bulbs for their &quot;sold out&quot; lights. These bulbs would last about 2 weeks and burn out. LED lights came on the scene a couple of decades later.<br>People would salt the vending machines to get free money or drinks. Putting salt in a milk cartoon and filling it with water and pouring it down the coin slot would drive a vending machine crazy. Most times it will jackpot drinks out as fast as you could pull them out.<br>I remember one time someone squirted some can insulating foam in the dollar bill accepter.
