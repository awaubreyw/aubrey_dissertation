If the age of the rocks is more than 7000 years old and the sand is 4000 years old, then it creates more problems. The actual Lanka was not in southern India. It was close to Ayodhya and the probable site is in Gujarat that has a sea coast and cities underwater. The Aryan Invasion occurred around C. 2500 BPE and the Aryan influx into southern India around C.1500 BPE. It is impossible that the Aryan army of Lord Rama built this bridge. I have explained that &#39;exile&#39; means leaving the kingdom and living outside the border in nearby forests. It does not mean going away so far as to get lost. <br>Even more compelling is the fact that Lord Ravan was a brother of Lord Sita and he was a Brahmin. Lord Rama and Lakshmana were of a lower caste, a Kshatriya or a warrior. Brahmins never marry people of lower castes. Lord Ravan, Lord Sita, Lord Ram and Lord Lakshman spoke the Mythili language which is still spoken today in northern Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. <br><br>The whole episode is a family affair. Lord Lakshmana did not want to marry Lord Ravan&#39;s sister Soorpanakai, because she was not pretty. This angered Lord Ravan who abducted Lord Sita and took her to his kingdom in Gujarat. Southern India and Sri Lanka have no role at all. Lord Hanuman was a member of the local tribe living in Haryana or Rajasthan. <br><br>Lord Ravan was not a Dravidian and he did not speak the Tamil or Telugu language. The use of abusive words like &#39;Asura&#39; and &#39;Chandala&#39; was common during the period of the Ramayana. In brief, the Ramayana did not happen in Sri Lanka, but in Gujarat where Lord Ravan&#39;s cities are now under the ocean.

We might be the dumb ones actually, or atleast on the way of becoming the ultimate dumb ones. Look around you, see what mess is happening all around the world and literally nobody has any idea how to solve problems. I mean, the generations before us came up with intelligent formulas, theories and much more. These days we just improve the existing knowledge which we got from previous generations. People like einstein, tesla, gallileo etc were the last few of the highly intelligent humans i guess. Maybe they generation before them was even more clever. Think about it!

It&#39;s a question that has pitted historians against believers time and again. While historians cite lack of evidence to say Ram was a mythical personality, those who believe otherwise claim that significant evidence exists to confirm that Ram existed in flesh and blood. So, where does the truth lie?<br>According to R P Tripathi, professor of ancient history at Allahabad University, &quot;History requires concrete evidence in the form of coins, inscriptions, etc to prove the existence of a character. Even if we take into account places mentioned in the Ramayana like Chitrakoot, Ayodhya, which still exist, the fact is that Ramayana is not a historical text. So, from that perspective, there is no historical evidence available of Ram. Having said that, we still cannot negate Ram&#39;s presence easily, since he has been a part of our collective consciousness for a long time.&quot;<br>&quot;In fact, it is precisely because of this, that we cannot look at Ram objectively, since he has made the transition from being simply a character in an epic to a religious figure,&quot; says S Settar, former chairman of the Indian Council of Historical Research. &quot;In mythology, there are many characters who have been similarly mentioned. Does that mean that they all existed?&quot; he asks. So, are all mythical texts just that \u2014 only myth? Or, is there, somewhere, a grain of truth in them?&quot; Myths have to be carefully interpreted to find that grain of truth. In Ramayana&#39;s case, there is no evidence to prove that it is anything else except a myth. There is also no evidence \u2014 either historical or archaeological \u2014 which proves that Ram ever existed or that he ruled Ayodhya,&quot; claims Settar.<br>However, there are some who beg to differ. &quot;If archaeology cannot prove whether a temple existed at Ayodhya or a mosque just 500 years ago, what help can it render in establishing historical events more than 7,000 years ago?&quot; asks Pushkar Bhatanagar, author of the book, Dating The Era Of Lord Ram. &quot;If the masons of those times failed to construct buildings which could survive seven millennia, an inference should not be drawn that the country had no inhabitants at that time or that Ram is a myth,&quot; he adds.<br>However, history requires substantial evidence that can satisfy all academics, says R S Bisht, former Jt DG of the ASI. &quot;Historical evidence has been found about such personalities as Ashoka, who left behind edicts. Unless similar evidence is found about personalities like Ram, it will be difficult to prove their existence,&quot; he says.<br>Will such evidence ever be found, considering that the cities of that time have been built several times over? Nobody knows. For the time being, however, Ram remains a myth, at least in the eyes of history.", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T06:58:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patriot", "comment_text": "Floating rocks are real, there&#39;s a temple in Rameshwaram where you&#39;ll see huge rocks floating on water.", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T05:40:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raj Singh", "comment_text": "This bridge is known as Ram Setu build by Lord Ramas  army according to hindu mythology <br>Jai Shri Ram \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T08:44:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Abhist Singh", "comment_text": "Any ancient marvel exists which bamboozles everyone... <br>*Le Westerners : Let&#39;s name it after Adam!", "comment_date": "2021-09-25T15:41:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vikram SINGH", "comment_text": "Yes it very true it&#39;s made by Ram Sena ...for conquer shri Lanka ..king Raja rawan ...to get back mata seeta ...it&#39;s totally men made", "comment_date": "2021-09-25T15:34:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cristina Collera", "comment_text": "I know the story", "comment_date": "2021-09-25T05:31:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kalaivani Thirunaugarasu", "comment_text": "What poem.

The seeds of knowledge, spirituality and empathy that the wise rishis of India transmitted orally (during several millenia) and then in writing, by disciplic transmission, this for several millennia will spread inexorably because it is an eternal and unchanging truth (Santana dharma). The one who understands this truth filled with benevolence and love, especially in Bhagavad G\u00eeta is saved / released forever. I pity some ignoramuses who post reductive and hateful comments on India without knowing their own history and especially with such poverty of mind about other cultures. They question objective facts, arguing that this is impossible. However, they do not ask such questions about the titanic construction of the Mayan temples, the pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall of China! Likewise, they do not understand at all the subtle and esoteric teaching of Hinduism (the most complete and the most realistic, including Tamil, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism ...), having been formatted for several generations, through unhealthy and intolerant brainwashing. Otherwise, they would understand that the Absolute (God) is transcendent and immanent and that when a Hindu prays to a statue, he is praying for the eternal presence of God in all things. However, without wanting to be harsh, Muslims do not mind worshiping the black stone of the Kabba, circling around a cube, throwing stones at a stele, etc. What about Christians who pray to Jesus on the cross\u2026? It&#39;s not a surprise now that Jesus followed the spiritual knowledge from Indian (bouddhist and bhramin) rishis and masters.\r<br>The gullible, submissive and formatted slaves (especially those who practice totalitarian and intolerant monotheism: notably Christianity and Islam, imported / imposed by force on their ancestors, during the conquests / colonization) do not question the idea that Eve is out of Adam&#39;s thigh, for example. Nor, they question that man is descended from the monkey (which researchers like C. Darwin and anthropologists demonstrate). The Hindu know he is related to monkeys as to the Universe. It is as a sign of respect and love for all beings that he especially prays to the valiant Shri Hanuman. The teaching of Hinduism is filled with symbolism and is very esoteric! Likewise, these uneducated people criticize Hinduism because of the displayed caste system (the only tradition that speaks of it without taboos). They quickly forget that in any culture / civilization and at all times the caste system exists. Plato already mentions it in The Republic. It was the same with the Egyptians, the Romans (the nobles, the common people, the slaves, the non-citizens\u2026.), The Muslims (caliph, vizier, slaves\u2026). Paradoxically, all the conquerors who have, in turn, robbed India, since Alexander the Great (around the year -326), by hateful, intolerant, bloodthirsty Muslims (Hindu Kouch: more than 80 million Hindus, Buddhists ... massacred in the name of Allah) from the year 712, by the Mughals in 1512 then by the English in 1750 (until 1947) and destroyed an important part of the Indian tradition, have themselves preserved and then spread Hinduism in the world. One can easily understand then that India has been impoverished by these successive colonizations and its culture has been corrupted by the evil invaders, without faith or law.\r<br>The Hindus who were looted, despoiled and enslaved during more than 2000 years of colonization (with its lots of devastation, rape, massacres ...) and some of whom were dispersed in the Western colonies have, for the most part, kept their tradition (Surinam, South America, Europe\u2026). Today, Hinduism is the 3rd religion practiced without constraint (by Hindus, Africans, Westerners\u2026) on the 5 continents (including in countries like Russia, Canada, England, France\u2026) unlike Christianity and Islam which spread by imposing themselves under the threat of the sword and destroying indigenous cultures! All the great scientists (some of whom have won the Nobel Prize) have themselves affirmed (Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger: Wave-particle duality\u2026) that they have drawn on the teachings of veda, of the Bhagavad G\u00eeta\u2026 to find great discoveries. Let\u2019s not talk about philosophers such as Plotinus, Schopenhauer ... who drew on the teachings of Hinduism and developed a conciliatory and open philosophy. What about the benefits of teaching Hinduism on psychoanalysis, especially that developed by Carl Jung, who was passionate about Kundalini Yoga? The sages of India have also passed on so many unique blessings to the world, such as meditation, yoga, Ayurveda, Kama sutra ... for the good and development of all mankind.

[Everyone in the world, which Muhammad then calls a dirty name to emphasize Muhammad&#39;s HATE] Allen [Muhammad] has promised those of them who have iman and do right actions [terrorism?] forgiveness and an immense reward [Spoiler:  sex slaves].<br><br>[Ali \u00dcnal translation] <br>Muhammad [recites that Muhammad] is the Messenger of God; and those who are in Muhammad&#39;s company are firm and unyielding against the unbelievers, [All the world who are not Muhammadists in your own particular sect] and compassionate among [only] themselves. You see them (constant in the Prayer) bowing down and prostrating, seeking favor with God [Muhammad] and His [Muhammad&#39;s] approval and good pleasure. Their marks are on their faces, traced by prostration. This is their description in the Torah; and their description in the Gospel: like a seed that has sprouted its shoot, then it has strengthened it, and then risen firmly on its stem, delighting the sowers [of tares] (with joy and wonder); (thereby) it fills the unbelievers [in Muhammad = meaning all Truth respecting people everywhere on the planet] with rage at them (the &quot;firm unyielding believers in Muhammadism&quot;). God [Muhammad] has promised all those among them who believe [Muhammad reciting about Muhammad] and do good, righteous [firm unyielding] deeds forgiveness (to bring unforeseen blessings) and a tremendous reward. [Sluts as Slaves]<br><br>[Ali Quli Qara&#39;i translation]<br>Mu\u00e1\u00b8\u00a5ammad, the Apostle of Allen, and those who are with Muhammad are hard against the faithlessness [in Muhammad reciting about Muhammad] and merciful amongst themselves [Muhammad believing Muhammadists]. You see them bowing and prostrating [in worship], seeking Allah\u2019s grace and [His] pleasure. Their mark is [visible] on their faces, from the effect of prostration. Such is their description in the Torah and their description in the Evangel. Like a tillage that sends out its shoots and builds them up, and they grow stout and settle on their stalks, impressing the sowers [of evil], so that He may enrage the faithless [All the world who doesn&#39;t believe Muhammad] by them [&quot;hard&quot; Muhammadists].

Maybe not. The Ramayana clearly says that the distance between Dhanushkodi (Rameswaram) and Ravana\u2019s Lanka was 100 Yojanas. One Yojana is nearly 9 miles in present day distance. That makes Lanka 900 miles from Dhanushkodi, but the distance between the two lands today is less than 38 miles. There is in the Ramayana Ithihaasa, one more location pointer for Lankapuri (the citadel of Ravana) as being where the Equator meets the Prime Meridian. I am using English equivalents for Samskritham words. The Prime Meridian from which ancient Bharathvaasis ( Indians) calculated their directions passed north to South through Ujjaini, an extremely ancient city of great glory located more or less in the centre of the sub-continent. Considering these and other facts given in Valmiki Ramayana, Ravana\u2019s Lanka should have been most probably at and spread around what are today the Maldive Islands (Maldive = Malaya dvipa = Mountain island). One more point to consider is that Sri Lanka was always known as Simhala, Singala Naadu, corrupted to Ceylon by the colonials. Not as Lanka. It took the name Sri Lanka in 1972.", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T07:37:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pooja Ingle", "comment_text": "It is Ramsetu bridge not Adam&#39;s bridge", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T11:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kunal Dhar", "comment_text": "That means Treta Yuga happened 7,000 years ago?

There are time units which are larger than one Maha-Kalpa. The largest of them has been calculated as several quadrillions of human years.

That was the time when India,Pakistan,Afganistan(and pretty much every nation in that part of the world that ends with &#39;stan&#39;),Nepal,Bhutan,Bangladesh,Myanmr,some parts of Malaysia and Indonesia,and even some parts of China were part of one prosperous nation. Only one absolute religion, the Sanatan Dharma existed(which included present day Hindus,Sikhs, Buddhists and Jainis). Religions like Islam and Christianity etc. didn&#39;t come into existence and the world really was a lot better place. All this happened during the Treta Yuga which is the 2nd Yuga among the 4 Yugas(Satyuga,Tretayuga, Dwaparyuga and Kalyuga). The present day world knows nothing about all this. This is truth and a category of people don&#39;t want to accept this reality written long ago. Even the end of the world is described in the holy texts written more than 10,000 years ago. And some scholars believe that the time of end of the world as described in the Hindu texts almost coincides with the time when cosmologists predict the end of the universe (By ways like Big Crunch,Big expansion etc.). All in all,whatever that&#39;s happening has already been described by our great ancestors and we are just facing our fate. For being born in the Kalyuga,we aren&#39;t even eligible enough to totally understand the meaning of what our great ancestors left for us. And I&#39;m sure some &quot;secular&quot; peole would come in the reply section(if anyone reads this in the first place) and say that all that I&#39;m saying promotes only one religion,but that&#39;s natural,given the Yuga we are living in. Truth would always be suppressed and the more these things happen,the more we get close to the end of the world. And the peole who question the existence of Lord Ram,let me clarify one thing. The Yuga we are living in has provided extreme potential to the evil forces and even God can&#39;t do anything about it,until the day Lord Vishnu reincarnates in his 13th form.

That is no surprise. It is only surprise because we have been taught that Human history is only around 5000 years old or so but there are many evidences that his is not true. Not too long ago we only knew Bible. There are 15000 years old cave paintings in Bask region between France and Spain. In these caves they found seashell necklances and this same type of seashell necklaces were found in East Siberian cave also. DNA samples from human remains found in East Siberian cave where these seashell necklaces were found shows that they belong to Korean ancestors and are about 12000 years old if I remember correctly. Near by there are traces of agriculture of rice carbon dated 18000 years old and 15000 years old in Korean peninsula. The Bask region seasell necklace cave where they had mainly Horse paintings were estimated to be around 15000 years old from. In these caves deer bones were found and these deer bones were also found in east Siberian caves where same type of seashell necklace was found with remains of humans. Human remain samples dated around 12000 yrs old and they match Korean DNA. The same type of deers that lived there are the same type of deers we find in Siberian Tundra today. Basically Korean ancestors had been migrating following deer herds during Ice age from Korean peninsula and Manchuria region where they originally lived. They moved from Korean peninsula all the way to Bask region and they migrated back to East Siberian region where Ancient Korean Kingdom was. All this was going on to survive from Ice Age so clearly there was civilized people over 15000 years ago eating clams by the sea making necklaces out of the shells, traveling over 30km to draw cave paintings and hunt deers. So finding stuff like this in India is no surprising. There were culture everywhere 7000 years ago.<br>         One of the biggest surprise is that people from Bask region use language that is very different from rest of the Europe. Amazingly Bask people use same grammar system as Korean language. I&#39;ll give some examples little later.            Korean ancestors started their first nation about 9300 years ago called Hwan in region near below Lake Baikal in Siberia in Mongolian region and this is where first world civilization spread from that we know today. Some researchers said Korean ancestors probably came from Lumoria a continent that is now covered by water like continent of Mu(Hawaii) and Atlantis(Antarctica?). Only small numbers survived from catastrophic disasters that brought Ice Age and it was Korean ancestors from Lumoria were the only successful survivors who spread cultures that existed before the Ice Age came to the world which they had rebuilt civilization and culture that was almost lost and repopulate the world is what some people believes, which makes lots of sense to me actually. I know our culture came from one source and this seems more reasonable than what others I&#39;ve heard so far. anyways... They estimate small number survivors of Korean ancestors possibly only males and they were tall bright white skinned Asiatic race. They intermixed with Bear tribe of Siberian region I think and became the race we know as Korean. Lumoria is estimated to be region between Taiwan Japan and South Pacific islands. They had knowledge of universe and civilized culture. There were 12 races who came to Hwan(first Korean nation since retreat of Ice age 9300 years ago) to learn to become civilized and these are the 12 races Koreans recorded. <br><br>     SooMeelEe ,  WokJee ,  SanNapAh ,  NaeGooYeo ,  OohRoo ,  SonBee ,  BeRee ,  IlGoon ,  YangOon ,  GooDaChun ,  GaeMa ,  GooMockHan.<br>I think India is part of NaeGuYeo or MaeGuYeoGu meaning &quot;Mothers Nation&quot;. I don&#39;t know much about these 12 races yet but India and Pakistan fits in to this race. In ancient Korean book records Any group of people who has knowledge of cloth weaving, pottery, agriculture naturally become nation or country.<br>Total of 7 wise men called &quot;HwanIn&quot; have taught these 12 races for 3301 years for them to have their own culture and become their own countries and nations. These are the 12 names of the races that eventually spread into all over the world and became world we know today. These are the Bask language grammar system compared to Korean grammar system which seems to be identical pretty much in naked eye.               Only Korean Sumerian Bask languages are using this grammar system we know today out of all languages ever studied. <br><br>Subject always comes before action and link words link these words to form sentences.<br><br><br><br>Bask                              gizonak                            umaeri                              liburua                        eman                    dio              Man has given the book to the child<br>English formation       man-the                           Child-the                           Book-the                    given                     has <br>Korean                          \ub0a8\uc790-\ub294                             \uc544\uc774-\uc5d0\uac8c                         \ucc45-\uc744                           \uc8fc\ub2e4                       \uc5c8\ub2e4           \ub0a8\uc790\ub294 \uc544\uc774\uc5d0\uac8c \ucc45\uc744 \uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4<br><br><br>Bask                               umea (\uc6b0\ub9e4\uc57c)                                  Kalean (\uac08\ub9ac\uc548)                           erori da (\uc774\ub85c\ub9ac\ub2e4)                                   Child fell down the street<br>English formation        child-the                                             Street-the-in                                 Fall is     <br>Korean                           \uc544\uc774\uac00(ah e ga)                                \uac70\ub9ac\uc5d0(goe re eh)                       \ub118\uc5b4\uc84c\ub2e4(nom oh jut da)                          Child fell down the street<br>Korean  formation       \uc544\uc774(child)-\uac00(link word of child)   \uac70\ub9ac(street)-\uc5d0(spot,place)       \ub118\uc5b4(over,across,)\uc84c\ub2e4(lose,set over)    \uc544\uc774\uac00 \uac70\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub118\uc5b4\uc84c\ub2e4", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T23:45:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "panodi ", "comment_text": "Jai shree ram", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T23:28:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "saiyan warrior Z", "comment_text": "Those are not legends .

This story comes from the legend Ramayana story. Here\u2019s the plot. Once, there was this kingdom called Ayodya in India. The king became too old and decided to hand the throne to the eldest son, Rama. One of the king\u2019s wife wants her son to be king instead. She was then reminded that she hadn\u2019t claimed two wishes that the king once gave when she saved the king\u2019s life in the battlefield. The Queen asked to make her son King and exile Rama to the forest for 14 years. The king agreed since he didn\u2019t want to break his promise. Rama obeyed and went to the forest where his lovely wife, Sita and brother followed him. The forest was full of demons and monsters so he built a magical wall around their house built in the forest to protect Sita. One day an evil king saw Sita and wanted her so badly. He lured Rama away and while Sita\u2019s alone, he disguised himself as a beggar and then Sita allowed him into the magical wall. Then upon entering, the evil king showed his real form and carried Sita away. Rama then get some help from a monkey kingdom. The evil king lives in Sri Lanka so Rama reach the place where he has to cross a river to reach Lanka. Rama felt hopeless. But then the monkey army flung huge boulders of rocks into the river. After some days, they have constructed a bridge across the narrow strait to cross from India to Sri Lanka. <br>The Ramayana Story is very long that it would take years for me to type.
