In  the  documentary,  he claims  that  time  is  running  out  for  Earth  and  if  humanity  is  to  survive climate  change,  asteroid  strikes,  epidemics  and  overpopulation  we  will need  to  leave  our  planet  and  venture  further  afield.  In  the  landmark series,  Prof.  Hawking  and  his  former  student  Christophe  Galfard  will travel  the  world  to  find  out  how  humans  could  live  in  outer  space. Humans,  according  to  him,  will  need  to  colonize  another  planet  within one  hundred  years  to  ensure  their  survival.  (\u201cTomorrow\u2019s World  returns to  BBC  with  startling  warning  from  Stephen  Hawking\u2014we  must  leave Earth,\u201d  The Telegraph, 2 May 2017). Stephen  Hawking  is  considered  a  legendary  physicist  of  the  modern age.  He  gained  worldwide  fame  after  publication  of  his  book  A  Brief History of Time  in  1988.  The  above  declaration  by  Prof.  Hawking  is a  scientific  warning  for  all  human  beings.  As  far  as  colonizing  other planets  is  concerned,  it  seems  to  be  science  fiction  in  the  light  of  current knowledge.  However,  the  end  of  the  present  world  has  now  become  a scientific reality which will surely come to pass. It is strange that  this fact is present in the Quran  in  the  form  of  a  religious  warning. According  to  religious  history,  the  monarchs of  ancient  Egypt  were  called  Pharaohs. Historical evidence shows that the Pharaoh Thutmose  II  ruled  Egypt  about  15th  century BC.  It  was  in  this  period  that  the  Prophet Moses  was  born.  At  that  time,  Memphis  was the  capital  of  Egypt.  The  Prophet  Moses  went to  Pharaoh\u2019s  court  and  conveyed  to  him  the divine  message  which  God  Almighty  had  sent him  with.  This  story  of  Moses  and  Pharaoh appears in detail in both the Bible and the Quran. The present world is a world of trial, and for a certain period God has kept the realities hidden in the realms of the unseen. On the Day of Judgement, this curtain would be torn asunder. According  to  the  Quran,  part  of  the  message  given  to  Moses  to  deliver to  Pharaoh  was:  \u201cThe  Hour  is  coming.  But  I  choose  to  keep  it  hidden,  so that  every  human  being  may  be  recompensed  in  accordance  with  his labours.\u201d Prof.  Hawking and other scientists  have  earlier  also  made  such remarks. If the world we live in is reaching its end, then this is not great news. The greater  news  is  that  when  this  world  comes  to  an  end,  another  ideal world  is  going  to  come  into  existence.  The  Maker  of  the  next  world will  not  be  a  human  being,  but  God  the  Creator  Himself.  In  the  world to  come,  only  those  persons  will  find  entry  who  qualified  themselves for  it  in  the  first  world.  People  will  be  selected from  entire  human  history  and  settled  in  the All evidence points to the fact that the age of the present world is nearing the end and the age of the second world will begin very soon. world hereafter, which in religious literature is  called  Paradise.  Now,  the  time  has  come  for every  person  to  prepare  himself  and  develop his  personality    so  that  he  can  be  held  a deserving candidate for Paradise. According  to  the  creation plan  of  God,  the present  earth  is  like  a  nursery  where  human beings  are  meant  to  be  tested.  The  person who  gives  proof  of  noble  conduct  and  sublime character\u2014which  is  appropriate  for  the  society  of  Paradise\u2014will  be chosen  to  settle in the eternal world of the Hereafter.  This eternal world is a person\u2019s true abode. All  evidence  points  to  the  fact  that  the  age  of  the  first  world  is  nearing the  end  and  the  age  of  the  second  world  will  begin  very  soon.  At  this juncture,  the  Quran  is  calling  all  mankind  in  these  words:  \u201cAnd  vie  with one  another  for  your  Lord\u2019s  forgiveness  and  for  a  Paradise  as  vast as  the  heavens  and the  earth,  which has been  prepared  for the  Godfearing.\u201d  (3: 133) The  present  world  is  a  world  of  trial,  and  for  a  certain period  God  has kept  the  realities  hidden  in  the  realms  of  the  unseen.  On  the  Day  of Judgement,  this  curtain  would  be  torn  asunder.  Thereafter,  the  second phase  of  man\u2019s  life  would  start,  when  everybody  would  be  judged according to their deeds in the present world. <a href=\"http://www.cpsglobal.org/\">www.cpsglobal.org</a>", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T14:27:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "john p", "comment_text": "That last one gave me goosebumps of realization.
