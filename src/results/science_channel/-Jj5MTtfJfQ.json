This brings back memories of my uncle Morgan, I have never seen anyone eat as much food as that man on a Veterans Day BBQ, or any type of day or BBQ really. He lived most of his life fixing broken down cars in Clinton, Missouri, and not a bad mechanic by any means, but by his late 40s he had gained one or two pounds too many and couldn&#39;t keep up with the job. I suppose there was a lot of stretching and reaching going on around big engines like that and it took a toll on his large body, forcing him to retire early. It was in the 80s but I remember it as if it was yesterday how he ate a whole family serving of egg salad and I don&#39;t even dare to guess how many pounds of rib-eye steak, big pieces of bread, a few sausages, probably even a burger or two, all in one sitting. He used to tell everybody to to finish their desserts faster before he&#39;d take it from them and eat it, but I think that was probably just his way of kidding around! He later moved to Kansas City where he lived the rest of his days up until his death in 2002.
