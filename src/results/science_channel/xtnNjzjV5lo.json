My dog was vomiting, diarrhea, rough hair and shedding bad. Brought my dog to 3 vets spent $3000 to have him prescribed special &quot;pre-digest food&quot;. When that didn&#39;t work I spend $2000 more bringing him to the university of Minnesota where they prescribed him another food saying he had a &quot;soft stomach&quot;. When that failed I went to youtube and researched raw diet and was lucky to have a neighbor that sells it! It changed his life within days his hair got soft stopped shedding as much was energetic and had great stools! Now he only pukes if he eats too much uncooked bone that I give him to clean his teeth.  He has been on raw now for 4 years without any problems. My neighbor is putting his dog down tomorrow and won&#39;t even give him a chance on raw which is why I&#39;m writing this. I REALLY want people to be aware about how dried dog food absorbs all the water from animal&#39;s organs and ruins them. You will notice they stop drinking about 80% of their daily water because they don&#39;t get dehydrated on raw.  Walmart sells food in tubes and so does Coborns if you have them. I use this in combination of Titan red or blue. Please do your dog a favor and make the switch. Don&#39;t let money thieving vets rob you blind and prescribe your dog garbage so they can earn monthly fees for the prescription.  The bacteria BS is complete rubbish. Dogs are natural raw meat hunters scavenging anything they can find in the wild and I put raw steaks for myself on my counter and break eggs daily and have never been sick. I personally enjoy sushi and even was on a sashimi diet for a while. It&#39;s just a scare tactic. Just switch slowly so your dog can adjust from bad to good food. Thank you if you make the switch I appreciate you caring for your animal, unlike my neighbor :(", "comment_date": "2022-02-08T23:56:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "x808drifter", "comment_text": "Love to see people\u2019s reactions when they find out that long term studies have found regular joe blow dog food is just as good.<br><br>Zero difference across the lifetime of your dog.", "comment_date": "2022-01-01T19:36:48Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Dannon", "comment_text": "rename this to &quot;how to give your dogs the shits&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-12-29T11:01:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Victor Hrmt", "comment_text": "Are you sure this is the PET FOOD?", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T11:28:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nunya nunya", "comment_text": "yep... rich people still feed thier dogs better than I will ever eat.", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T07:22:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ben Trainor", "comment_text": "Ridiculous", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T10:04:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wayne Ho", "comment_text": "Lavish.", "comment_date": "2021-12-10T21:07:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BK-201", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtnNjzjV5lo&amp;t=1m46s\">1:46</a> Why don&#39;t they use the Chicken breast?
