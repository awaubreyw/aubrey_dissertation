Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated under the guise of a typhus epidemic and now under a corona virus /monkey pox pandemic.  It is not Russia or China spraying American skies in parallel lines.  It is not China or Russia venting gases to take your breath away in your dwellings.  You need a radiation detector and an air quality monitor with logging.  It usually happens at night while you sleep and you probably don&#39;t even know.  Vaccines(Computer vaccines) hide information from you.  When you think that they are talking about real viruses, they are actually taking about electronic generated information that they must suppress by forcing a computer anti virus signature that looks for information and deletes it from your view. NATO is the military arm of Revelation17,18, and is about to start a war with China, saying they attacked Taiwan.  Taiwan until very recently was acknowledged by the majority of all nations of the world as being part of China.  Taiwan has no embassy, as they are not a Country.  It was just recently changed on US documents in order to start the coming war.  The US has just passed a law similar to the one during WW2, to supply endless weapons to Taiwan.  WW2 China was attacked from Taiwan after it&#39;s invasion by Japan.  Donald Trump told 3.5years in advance how the US would soon be waging war with Russia and China.  This is all staged by Rome.  The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State of Rome Italy.  He rules over the soon to be ten Nations of the Roman Empire.  The Country is the smallest in the world, and has its own flag and representatives in the UN, and other political bodies.  The Pope rules the Roman Catholic Church, but also the nations that the Church rides.  The Pope has 666 on his crown in Latin(vicarivs filii dei).  The ten nations have split in to two divisions, which each division will have 5 Kingdoms.  Empires in the Bible are referred to as beasts, and Rome&#39;s image to represent it is the cross or X, which symbolizes the ten Kingdoms of Rome and their religious beliefs.  God refers to this Church State alliance as being responsible for all those exterminated from the earth and history testifies to this.  God says,&quot;get out of this organization before its collapse and destruction, or you will be destroyed with her&quot;. Revelation 18:4 Get out of her &quot;MY PEOPLE!&quot;  Ukraine killed NAZI Pow&#39;s because they were talking.  Revealing their NAZI affiliations.  The Red Cross is part of the Roman system masquerading as an aid organization, but is military intelligence.  It has the (M.O.B.) mark of the beast as it&#39;s emblem.   Ukraine was part of the Russian Federation until a Western backed coup in 2014, which forensic evidence told a different story than video evidence, so there was  a conspiracy.  Western media changed the name of the Ukraine Capital from a Russian name to some thing else.  The Russian language, history and culture were hidden and suppressed.  Those with out blue arm bands would be put to death by Ukrainian forces run by foreigners.  Zellensky says that Ukraine will become a Catholic State under the Pope, and that is why Roman Catholics Nancy Palosi and Joe Biden are supporting the war against Ukraine and Russia.  Imagine Germany flying in to PEI(Prince Edward Island) Canada against Canada&#39;s wishes and saying they will supply them with unlimited arms to fight Canada.  Eighty five percent of the people of PEI don&#39;t want to separate.  Then Germany says that Canada is flying over PEI&#39;s air space, and makes the world think that Canada is violating PEI. Germany sends military jets of theirs and Japan&#39;s to escort a woman to PEI to stir this up, a long with 5 aircraft carrier battle groups. Imagine that!  Or what if this happened to Alaska?  Well this is happening, but not to PEI, but to Taiwan and China.  Taiwan is part of China.  Taiwan has no embassies, as they are not a Country, just like PEI is not a Country, but part of Canada.  It was not Germany, but backed by NATO.  The Pope&#39;s terror squad. The US and Japan are militarizing an Island near Taiwan, but NATO said they would attack the Soloman Islands if they militarize.(not if they attack, just militarizing) These wars are to hide Revelation 17,18&#39;s identity, and to distract you from the 1918/WW2 like genocide.  Comments are being edited by G7 Nations.(security reasons). Truth can stand on it&#39;s own two feet, but lies have to be propped up. Bitcoin is gold backed decentralized, where as the new Church/State digital currency 2023 will be centralized and backed by cow farts and faith.  That is why G7 governments are so concerned with cow farts, as they need to control the money supply.  The digital currency was going to arrive in 2014, then 2017, then 2020 and now 2023 Executive Order 14067 sec#4 to control buying and selling.  WW1 was when the universal income tax was started as a &quot;temporary&quot; measure because of the war, which was to expire after the war.  What the G7/NATO did to Russia, cutting off it&#39;s use of the monetary system, will happen to individuals soon. 85% of Taiwanese want to remain a part of China, but that does not stop Rome from fomenting an other war to distract people from it being publicly exposed as fraud.  All the fraudulent leaders must keep Rome propped up to keep their own deceptive systems a float. In the West, there is a lot of corrupt media pretending that Taiwan is it&#39;s own Country and China wants to absorb it. Religious people say follow God, but in Revelation 17,18 God says that the Church leader that rides the Roman Empire is responsible for all those exterminated from the earth.  God tells you there, what the leaders are wearing, Scarlet(Cardinals) and purple(Bishops).  Church and State got together and passed laws in the past that only people married in Churches be declared legally married, which is a sign in Revelation 18.  People are following Satan as if God.  Why tax exempt(Cowardly officials) The virus is information, and a variant is variation of information, and new name =different avenue of attack.   A vaccination is a forced computer vaccination.  Remember the US law that companies above 100 people had to vaccinate their entire workforce?  This was just to destroy businesses.  Once you know the 1984 doublespeak, then you will know what is happening. There are two viruses.  *One</b> is information that attacks the crown(government/royals), exposing their fraud, and computer anti virus definitions that automatically delete the information from your view.  <b>Two</b> the second is a so called virus that attacks humans with signs of sneezing, head pain and breathlessness, like when a person is radiated or gassed. Hitler exterminated using the guise of a typhus epidemic, where he gased people, causing them to sneeze and eventually die(zyklon b, causing suffocation).  Look in to the sky and you will see planes spraying the sky in parallel patterns, just before an outbreak. Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 people for Rome, with exterminations under the guise of a typhus epidemic and war on Acts2:44(communism). Rome is Revelation / Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  Read, and research it!  Man can live for ever, but it is being hide from you, by people who want to dominate and suppress you.  There are already technologies to heat and power cars and houses with out requiring any fuel. You can start a car with a key lawfully, but you can also break the car and hot wire it.  Technology is under attack, because people are learning about the lies, so Rome is causing unjustified attacks. <br>Technology is  being exploited to do things that are not lawfully designed to do, and then people attack tech because it is doing some thing it is not supposed to.  The government forces technogy to be breached by law enforcement, and then exploited for evil ends.  Church/State combine is now working to attack the very fabrication of electronic devices.  They are trying to shut down microprocessor production.  Why did Nancy Pelosi by military escort breach a sovereign Nation&#39;s land where the microprocessor&#39;s are made?  Think!  The Pope and Adolf Hitler now proven to have colluded in WW2 exterminations. Take a look at Taiwan and you can see what they did to Russia happening again.  We are living in an open air prison, where they kill in the name of God by duped ignorant people for the Protestant and Catholic legs of the Roman Empire.  Look at early 15th century Magna Carta documents where it talks how Rome will pay back for the wholesale slaughter of populations.  It says to lock them down then go in and exterminate.  \u200bIt was done under the guise of a typhus epidemic by Austrian/German Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler during WW2, and now they are doing it under a corona virus pandemic/ monkey pox pandemic. On his radio show, Alex Jones called on Donald J Trump to issue mass death warrants for Americans with no time to wait for the Justice system.  Trump authorized death by electrocution, firing squad and poison gas to the already used lethal injection(vaccine by military nurses).  Russia built and controls the nuclear power plant and would not bomb themselves. Britain training Ukrainians in Britain to hate and kill Russians. Gog Magog war comes after 1000years peace(Revelation 20:7,8).  May be the world missed the 1000 years of peace because of all the wars in the last Century including two world wars. Scott Ritter confirms US and UK committing war crimes in Ukraine.  Are NATO forces going to attack China from an Island near Taiwan?

We pay taxes and aren&#39;t even allowed to know what its being spent on?(black projects)Everyone&#39;s In LALA land and continue to let our leaders fuck us. Why do laws only apply to the average people living honest lived. Why are celebrities and Ceos and world leaders so into pedophilia. Why do pope&#39;s want to mess with little boys?

In the remote past, there was once a specific extraterrestrial presence in the Amazon which developed a very enlightened culture on that continent. Many grand cities and libraries once were. In the late 1930&#39;s, when extraterrestrial technologies first began to be covertly exploited by governments and corporations, Nikola Tesla, Guglielmo Marconi, and other scientists within that social circle, sought this same fabled &quot;city of enlightenment&quot; within the jungles. They desired that the technologies which they were aware of or developing at the time be used for the benefit of all mankind. The rest of the decision-makers in the world at the time thought otherwise, especially the Nazi regime, the first modern institution to achieve breakthroughs in the reproduction of alien vehicles. Parts of the Amazon remain today a safe-haven for all those invested in bettering humankind and this planet that we share. In addition to Neuschwabenland, Tesla &amp; Marconi&#39;s groups&#39; settlement in what remained of the ancient &amp; enlightened network of Amazonian cities also qualifies as a modern-era &quot;breakaway civilization&quot;. I believe that Neil Armstrong sought out this presence in the Amazon, because he was looking for like-minded people. Whether he found them, I don&#39;t think so.

Despite the efforts of any person, we cannot earn our way to heaven. Romans 3:23 says: &quot;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,&quot;. Anyone can examine themselves and know that even though, yes, sometimes we can do good, we also do evil at times. We commit moral crimes, and we rebel against God, which the Bible calls sin. We lie, we steal, we blaspheme God, and we can lust and have hate for our brother in our hearts. These are just some of the sins more than likely every person on earth has committed. God is loving, holy and merciful among other attributes but He is also just, perfectly just. Like any crime, sin has to be punished. If God did not punish sin, then He would be unjust. He would be corrupt. Someone has to take the punishment. Romans 6:23 says: &quot;For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.&quot;. This is talking about spiritual death, not physical death; if you die in your sins then you go to hell. There is good evidence that humans have souls. Near-death experiences are one of those evidences. There is a part of you that lives on past your physical body.\u00a0\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 God sent His only Son to earth about 2000 years ago, His Son is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is the promised Savior of the world. He fulfilled hundreds of prophecies by coming to and being in our world. Jesus was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life and was crucified on the cross as a payment for our sins. God poured out His wrath on Jesus in our place, meaning the justice of God is satisfied and sin is punished. While we were still at enmity with God, God still wants to save us, Romans 5:8 says: &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;. Three days after Jesus was crucified, He rose again proving that His payment was enough and that He was who He said He was, the Son of God. There is real-world evidence for the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This is not just a nice story.<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Scripture tells us to repent, to put our trust in Jesus, and to follow Him as Lord. Repentance means a change of mind which means to turn from a life following sin to a life following Christ. Salvation is a free gift and it cannot be earned. No one can be perfectly moral on their own, it is impossible. This is the only way to be in the presence of God in heaven. It is important to reiterate that we cannot save ourselves; it is the gift of God for one to be saved. God is rich in mercy and ready to forgive, cry out to Him, be sincere when coming to God, this is not a flippant thing. Repent and place your trust in Jesus Christ alone, today is the day of salvation. Ephesians 2:8-9 says: &quot;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.&quot;. Salvation is a gift.\u00a0<br><br>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 There is no other way, Jesus Himself said that He is the way, the truth and the life and no one comes to the Father but through Him. Jesus is not just a way, a truth or a life. Romans 10:9 says: &quot;That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T07:03:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "civil war", "comment_text": "Spell Neil A backwards and see what it says", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T06:22:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samokojin", "comment_text": "Neil A", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T05:41:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ninja Sushi", "comment_text": "This sounds like Indiana Jones 4.", "comment_date": "2022-08-09T04:04:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ninja Sushi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mppf7AdlV10&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a> sounds like he made it up.

Bring humanity to the place it was always meant to be with the focus if caring for this beautiful planet and all it has to offer us and the rest of life on Earth to sustain its place in the cosmos as a contributing civilization to the good of all in the Universe. God created everything seen known and unknown, lest we forget. Our purpose of what life was meant to be has been corrupted destroying humanity, pitting us against each other, destroying this earth and what it has to offer. To those who have corrupted will continue to corrupt and lead by evil ways and means until we all wake up and make the change. Ancient finds like this need to be found to understand what life was to be if not for the thousands of years WE have allowed it to grow and eventually take over, creating money, greed, poverty, all the things that evil thrives and grows on. So yes, I hope they find this library so that this place we find ourselves in can be reversed in the blink of an eye and Gaia and the life it hosts can live in peace and prosperity off of what she has to offer and sustain all life.

Apollo 15 had to orbit the round global earth before heading to the moon.<br><br>JAMES IRWIN&#39;S TESTIMONY<br><br>   Jim [James Irwin] felt God\u2019s love and presence in a powerful way out there.  Though separated from home by 215,000 miles, he sensed a nearness and presence of God that he never anticipated.  Some other Apollo astronauts also had spiritual experiences during their missions, but Irwin knew the God of the Bible personally.  In the midst of their hectic schedule, he had time to briefly quote his favorite Bible verse, Psalm 121:1, I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.  It was particularly fitting against the massive hills of the Apennine Mountains and canyons of Hadley Rille, but we must hasten to verse 2, which gives the answer to the question: My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.  Graciously deferring to the hard-working ground crew back on Earth, Jim appended, \u201cbut of course we get quite a bit from Houston, too.\u201d  Several times when problems arose deploying experiments, he prayed for help.  Almost immediately, ideas would come to mind that worked.  He describes some of these moments:<br>It was almost like a revelation.  God was telling me what to do.  I never asked Houston because I knew there would be a delay.  I didn\u2019t have time for Houston to get an answer to me; I needed an immediate answer.  I could see several logical ways to go about solving these mechanical problems, but I wanted to know the best way.  I prayed, and immediately I knew the answer.  I am not talking about some vague sense of direction.  There was this supernatural sensation of His presence.  If I needed Him I could call on Him, call on His power.  (To Rule the Night,p. 19)<br>He describes the sensation of looking up at home:<br>In the three days of exploration, there were a couple of times when I actually looked up to see the earth\u2014and it was a difficult maneuver in that bulky suit; you had to grab onto something to hold yourself steady and then lean back as far as you could.  That beautiful, warm living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart.  Seeing this has to change a man, has to make a man appreciate the creation of God and the love of God.  (Ibid., p. 60.).<br>   On August 2, 1971, just before returning to earth, James Irwin&#39;s fellow astronaut, Mission Commander Colonel David R. Scott, placed a Bible from his church on the Lunar Roving Vehicle&#39;s dashboard control panel, the only one ever left on the moon where it remains today in the moon&#39;s Sea of Showers between Hadley Rille and the Apennine Mountains.<br>&quot;Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 5:1).&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-07-25T00:05:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Conely King", "comment_text": "Moon landing hoax..<br><br>ET Plejarens / Billy Meier know it all!<br><br>Billy: <br>We have indeed already spoken at various times about the American Moon-landing swindle.<br><br>In this regard, I have now also spoken with an American who was visiting here.<br><br>He was not in agreement with that which I told him regarding your explanation concerning this matter.<br><br>It was his opinion that a swindle is completely impossible, because the aforementioned Moon-landing project had employed at least 100,000 humans, who most certainly had not kept silent, even if it were their duty to do so.<br><br>At least a whole number of them would have talked or not held their tongues due to certain grounds.<br><br>What is your opinion on that?<br><br>Quetzal<br><br>1.  As we have already explained several times, the Americans\u2019 Apollo-11 Moon-landing on July 20th, 1969 did not take place, because everything was a great designed swindle, through which the entire world was fooled.<br><br>2. Also it was not so that 100,000 or more people were involved in the fraud or simply informed about it, rather a total of precisely 37 persons who were involved in that.<br><br>3. This small number was responsible for nothing trickling through, and the criminal-fraud enterprise actually could be kept secret up until the present day and this would also be the case in the future, in spite of the fact that very many anomalies in regard to the photographs and videos will be discovered by critical people and will continue to be discovered.<br><br>4. The lie will therefore continue to be sustained, and indeed in spite of the provable and clear evidence of the anomalies, which prove the falsification of the Moon-landing.<br><br>5. Further to say is, that the Moon-landing swindle is also connected to murder, and indeed in the respect that in spite of the duty of silence of those involved, a great number cannot be silent, respectively, could not be silent, which led, and will further lead, to arranged \u201caccidents\u201d and \u201cillnesses\u201d with fatal consequences, until the last involved person is no longer alive whose silence is not securely established.<br><br>6. Remaining alive are only those who are hypnotically bound with their Moon-landing lies, so they themselves believe that the Moon-landing actually was realized, or at least that they have thereby cooperated.<br><br>Billy: But then how is it with the Moon-rover and the landing devices and so forth, which were supposed to have been left behind on the Moon?<br><br>Quetzal<br><br>7. These are actually to be found on the Moon, whereby however these were left behind from a later Moon-landing on the Earth\u2019s satellite.<br><br>Billy: Therefore the Yanks were indeed on the Moon.<br><br>Quetzal<br><br>8. Naturally, however not on the claimed point in time of July 20th, 1969.<br><br>9. In that time the mendaciously propagated and nonexistent Moon-landing was a pure political manoeuvre of the Americans, ostensibly to trump the Soviet Union in the so-called space race, to practically anticipate this and thereby to be the winner and more powerful, which was supposed to serve as a deterrent military action in regard to the Soviet Union supposedly fearing the Americans.<br><br>Billy Hence the gigantic fraud of the alleged Moon-landing.<br><br>Quetzal<br><br>10. That is correct.<br><br>Billy And, will the truth ever come to light?<br><br>Quetzal<br><br>11. That would hardly be the case because the entire fraud is played in such a way that the discovery of the truth has practically as good as no chance.<br><br>12. Also the provable contradictions of all kinds which can be allocated by the photographs and videos would bear no fruit for the acknowledgement of the truth.<br><br>Billy: In the same way as with Roswell, where the spaceship crashed.<br><br>Quetzal<br><br>13. That is also true, because in this case hardly a possibility exists that the secret activities will one day come to the light of truth and the humans will be enlightened about the actual truth.<br><br>14. Quite the opposite \u2013 the future will prove that the responsible ones in America will always invent new lies in order to shroud and deny the truth about the Roswell case.<br><br>The smoking gun right here on their guilty faces!

Here\u2019s why.<br><br>Armstrong will always be the \u2018first\u2019 man on the moon. A tremendous privilege to be the representative of humankind in that event. He carefully prepared and chose his words then as likely has done whenever speaking publicly ever since setting foot on the moon. Being that person changed him because he was now \u201cthe one\u201d, most distinguished among the others who were also very much distinguished, to reach that pinnacle of achievement. So I imagine that he would forever after choose his words carefully when speaking publicly. <br><br>The key here in this speech is that he chose to say \u201cone of\u201d and \u201clayers\u201d. Take for example an orange. It seems to have 3 protective layers covering the flesh of the fruit. The rind, that inner soft pale orange/yellowish layer and the membrane-like covering that holds the orange \u201cslices\u201d together. Using no special approach to change the nature of the orange (think GMO) one cannot remove either of the two inner layers before removing the outermost rind. <br><br>The outermost layer there protects the fruit during handling so that it can\u2019t be consumed or subject to erosion easily on the branch. It\u2019s an example of nature\u2019s \u2018takeaway\u2019 and store away packaging. One might also say that the outermost rind is there primarily for greater sustenance to a group of living creatures, both animal and human. What then are the protective layers of \u201ctruth\u201d and why shouldn\u2019t truth be available for consumption immediately by all living things? And what is the nature of the protective layers how and why did they form? Is it perhaps that like the orange, even truth needs a number of protective layers?<br><br>I would say that by using reasoning the outermost layers are man made. Some with good reason and intention, for instance keeping the truth from children until they\u2019ve reached a certain level of basic understanding and emotional security to be able to handle the truth and then to use it correctly and wisely. Similarly, some truths are foundational for later understanding of other truths. If one is spiritual one would recognize that in the existence of nature and the intelligence behind our existence there is the same recognition that we are but children when placed against the wonders of the universe that still has many, if not infinitely more, undiscovered truths. We therefore need to achieve knowledge of the truth, say enlightenment, over time when we are both ready and capable to use it. But if the foundational truths are withheld or undiscovered then like a house of cards will all subsequent truths then be applied, with a great degree of instability that is easily shaken despite their truthful nature.<br><br>Going back to the human layer of truth protectiveness of the outermost layer. As fallible beings with tendency towards ignorance, selfishness, hate and the resulting ill intention, these layers are not not there to protect us but are there for some truth\u2019s to be \u201ckept\u201d from us but held by those who wish to use its knowledge for reasons of self interest.<br><br>Therefore, the only conclusion I can come up with for what one of the interviewees call his \u201ccryptic language\u201d is that it\u2019s not that cryptic. Removing one layer means the outermost layer and the outermost layer is of human design. If the human layer that protects the truth needs hope for it\u2019s removal it\u2019s because it\u2019s not protective to those who seek or need it, it\u2019s because it\u2019s protected only to be used by those who guard it. And what truth can be more foundational than evidence of the existence of other higher intelligence.<br><br>Put another way, this man with his unique experience and intellect has seen and knows things that make it clear to him that humankind is being kept in the dark about certain truths by people for reasons that, objectively speaking, are not within their rights to withhold.", "comment_date": "2022-07-23T15:41:20Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Shane Gagnon", "comment_text": "&#39;&#39;science Channel&#39;&#39; ... - Believe Neil Armstrong or anyone went to the moon, crossing the deadly Van Allen Belt ...", "comment_date": "2022-07-23T13:09:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean Donoghue", "comment_text": "Well what immediately jumps out at me is the obvious fanfare around this expedition.

Ancient Babylonians collected a lot of gold as mentioned in many of the ancient tablets found so definitely the Ancient library and the mountain of gold they collect should be around the Euphrates river. for those who don&#39;t know what the books in the library contain, are mostly things like the creation of iron weapons, a lot of books on construction example the knowledge on how to construct an ark was from these books(used by Noah) and maybe even the pyramid structures, also there should be things about magic &amp; black magic cuz you know tower of babel was also created from the pieces of knowledge of these books and even cultivation/farming technique was inscribed which explains the unusual farming techniques found in Gobekli tepe which is said to be the first signs of life after the ice age or post-biblical-flood ( again Noah also a Babylonian). so I guess that is all and hope countries don&#39;t wage for these gold and library.

Did they ask him to accompany them or at the least ask if they could make a copy of the so called map to the Golden Library?... I think the layers, Armstrong speaks of that we need to uncover, are what scientists have said over the years about human beings evolution &amp; how ancient civilizations were so inferior compared to recent times. This also spills over to the education systems of many countries... We know that Armstrong, Aldrin &amp; the other astronaut not only saw lights but were followed by other types of craft. So we can assume, with confidence, that those lost 2mins were them being told what not to talk about over the line from that point on. Even the news crews were told not ask about things that they had seen while in space... If this library hasn&#39;t been found, I think it will be. There&#39;s probably been secret expeditions to find this. We need hope that the Smithsonian doesn&#39;t get to it before anyone else cuz we know they like to destroy certain artifacts from the past esp if it doesn&#39;t line up with the belief system of how humans came to be. I mean look at how many giant skeletons they&#39;ve destroyed, that even go with mankind&#39;s history. It&#39;s in the Bible but they wanna destroy it SMDH...

NASA, pentagon, the highest echelons of scientists and millionaire elites of the world that only represents if perhaps 1% of the world&#39;s population already know it but they will not show all the images of Voyager 1 and 2 to the rest of humanity as such as they have done with other transcendental news of the cosmos, such as the existence of alien life and superior to us, shamelessly manipulating that information and in order &quot;supposedly&quot; not to create world chaos but as always &quot;NASA, pentagon, scientific elites and elites millionaires of the world that only represents 1% of the world population &quot;treats 99% of humanity as if we were garbage or without importance that we do not deserve such spatial information of world interest. Likewise, I suggest that we force the great elites of scientists and millionaires, pentagon, and also NASA to tell us or keep us informed with the truth about the latest updated astronomy news, including the interaction for several years that human beings already have with beings. smart from other worlds and other galaxies. And also ask all those elites of scientists and millionaires what security or survival measures they are taking seriously in order to keep alive all human beings on other worlds in other galaxies that are not Andromeda or the Milky Way. This can be achieved by uniting protests worldwide to uncover the mysteries of Area 51 and supporting the collective Anonymous, self-styled &#39;hacktivists&#39;, or cyberactivists and also the information provided by Juli\u00e1n Assange who is a programmer, journalist and Internet activist . Since all of us who were born in this world are human beings and we have the same rights and duties to be informed and to remain alive, including our descendants, even if they are in other worlds of other galaxies that are not the Andromeda galaxy or the Milky Way. that cataclysmic events are approaching in them. Likewise, I inform you that the human being must stop being selfish, ill-intentioned, conceited, believing himself to be the only rational or intelligent being in the universe and neither should one think that some catastrophic asteroid or meteorite is going to destroy humanity or life on the land or part of it. That it was by chance that the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska-Siberia-RUSSIA airspace on 06/30/1908; What if it really happened is that the 10,000-year-old Black Knight extraterrestrial artifact that orbits between the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired a beam of energy to prevent further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile approaches or orbit close to it. He also reported that it is false that the dinosaurs were extinguished by a huge meteorite or asteroid that collided with the earth and the oil came or is the product of that extinction. What DOES really happen is that the aliens were modifying the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order so that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem. And scientifically or technically, oil exists before the dinosaurs or since the planet earth was formed since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Oil in Rock or Crack and buried at high depths the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of oil crack due to high temperature and pressure under the earth or at the bottom of the sea this becomes liquid or molten also as is the case of iron at the level of the earth&#39;s surface or in mountains and away from the core of the earth it is in iron form solid instead in the center of the iron-nickel earth is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that are there creating the famous magnetic field that protects us from the gamma radiation and neutrons that come of space especially the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is a product of the extinction of the dinosaurs then I ask, is it perhaps that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or purebred dinosaurs lived only in the North Sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids, planets that contain iron, gold, liquid diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; also petroleum in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of oil in rock or crack are in the U.S.A and the technology to melt or exploit it was transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have huge amounts of crack or oil in rock; The reserves of petroleum in stone or crack of the U.S.A exceed the reserves of liquid petroleum that VENEZUELA and OPEC countries have. There will always be only wars: &quot;conventional as all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will later come to this in order either to unjustly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia and China since there is more old or elderly population alive than young people. AND THE OTHER REALITY OR TRUTH IS THE CATACLISMIC DAMAGE OF EVERYTHING REPORTED AT THE BEGINNING OR BEGINNING OF THIS INFORMATION WRITING AND REQUESTING THE GREAT POWERS OF USA, RUSSIA, CHINA, ISRAEL, ETC, ALSO TO THE GREAT ELITES OF MILLIONS, PENTAGON, ELITES.

The life forms of these planets differ from being Seven-foot Giants to five-foot beings with high intellect.  Now the third planet has the largest population and is the most volatile.  A number of communities of MonMicallics on this Planet are at War.\r<br>A union was formed on the grounds of having common enemies of the many MonMicallics communities.  This union formed the MonMicallics Empire.  Like most Empires, they didn\u2019t just want to run the planet this Empire wanted to run the solar system.  Over the next decades, the Empire grew to control most of the goods and services around this solar system.\r<br>Most of the TonMicallics from the closest planet liked the Empires Peace Keepers that kept the conflicts on their planet to a minimum.  There are two main assemblies of TonMicallics that are mostly at peace with each other.  Some communities wanted to grow their relations with the MonMicallics Empire to help their economy grow.  They see the peace the Empire brings to this once chaotic planet.\r<br>The PonMicallics keep to themselves, but after the MonMicallics Empire investigated colonizing their planet, they had to act.  The Empire was overconfident and thought the PonMicallics would be easy to subdue.  After their first landing, the Empire thought that they would land a battlecruiser, but the PonMicallics were prepared. \r<br>No, they didn\u2019t bomb the craft. The PonMicallics had bio-engineered workers that they turned into soldiers.  These soldiers took the battlecruiser and killed all on board with ease.  The MonMicallics Empire took these actions as acts of War.  The Empire was driven back to their planet, but this Solar system was never the same.\r<br>The Bio-Soldiers that the PonMicallics crated at first as workers with the ability to learn did learn a lot from this War.  These soldiers kept the peace by imprisoning criminals and all who rebelled against their order.  A Moon of the PonMicallics planet was cold but sufficient to hold a number of prisoners.  A group of prisoners from the Empire started to form a union with other prisoners from all three planets.\r<br>The few Care Takers of this Prison Moon didn\u2019t see a reason to mind about prisoners working well together.  Over the next year, these prisoners started a person-to-person relay by the willing pilots that carried goods to the moon. There was a monthly transport from the planet to each prison camp on this moon.\r<br>The united prisoners couldn\u2019t join any of the other camps before a craft was available to ship these united prisoners away.  The craft that the prisoners acquired was a science environmental craft that was suited for long-term passengers.  The prisoners took the craft out of the solar system to a far-off system in the Milky Way.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>I Must Escape\r<br>I got to get out of this prison I\u2019ve, we all have been unjustly imprisoned.  I try to remember my ball-playing days.  I was running left and right, catching and throwing the ball. Not dropping it, no never.  I have good hands, but I loved running.  I would aim each throw for the green shirts.\r<br>Our rivals had red shirts.  They can\u2019t touch the ball.  We ran side by side with each other but never touching.  The ball was in the air we knew where it was going.  The fastest runner would reach the ball.  The first one of us that saw it first, got it.  I didn\u2019t like being the chaser. \r<br>Our prison is full of comrades, and adversaries that I try to become allies with.  Most of the prisoners just want to get home, but fear the Bio-Soldiers.  I hear there is a plan to escape.  I\u2019m told to wait and make friends with once foes.  I try to remember good times, but my last game comes to mind.   I was looking; the ball hit my eye first.\r<br>A new teammate that I wasn\u2019t looking to have the ball, threw it to me. I didn\u2019t jump for it.  He never threw a high ball again.  He plays a good ball game that I just watch now.  My vision in one eye hasn\u2019t come clear.  An old player recruited me to be a city runner.  I have to remember that I love running and then I ran to deliver packages.\r<br>The crowded prison has become less lonely now, but we all want to get out.  I have befriended two MonMicallics that at times can upset me.  They run and jump in a small room that I can just take a few steps around.  We get scolded in the big room for running.  The MonMicallics are scolded often.  I feel for them.\r<br>The PonMicallics were few.  The few that were at this camp stayed to themselves.  I watched them more these days.  They seemed more alive.  The other TonMicallics stayed out of trouble.  Unlikely teams of prisoners were forming around me.  I just watched and waited. \r<br>This morning there was a ruckus.  I stayed in line and followed the way.  We boarded a craft.  I didn\u2019t know what was happening.  I just stayed in line and hoped for an escape.  \r<br>The PonMicallics established a science craft that has three environments that suited each of us.  I stayed in line and followed the way.  The craft left the solar system and it was announced to make preparations for high-speed travel.  We all were given the proper medications, and half of us chose to sleep.  The PonMicallics have a hard time staying asleep at these speeds.\r<br>Most of the TonMicallics stayed awake in case of trouble.  The MonMicallics that stayed awake were the most trouble on this five-year trip.  I didn\u2019t have trouble being awake, and I didn\u2019t cause trouble either.  I read a lot and learned a lot on this trip to an inhabited planet with the three atmospheres we need to live.\r<br>\tIn an unlikely reality, these prisoners are to prepare the Earth\u2019s inhabitants for the arrival of the Micallic Peacekeepers\u2026 <br><a href=\"https://thenewmars.wordpress.com/\">https://thenewmars.wordpress.com/</a>", "comment_date": "2021-09-07T19:47:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EliwazMoonites", "comment_text": "Recalls reading a book by a monk that spoke of many caves hidden all over that contain ancient tech in them.

The last is sustainable, the first not so much. R Carlson while examining the Great Pyramid on Giza plateau. His math shows a correlation of time &amp; space built into its design. He expands the pyramid to a ratio, the pyramid then represents one polar radius of earth. It begs the question, if this was part of its purpose then must we also expand all features of the pyramid as well. The known entrance is on west face of the pyramid. I&#39;m not sure how high up from the base or soccle is the doorway. For illustration purposes lets say its 50 feet up from the base. Once the pyramid is expanded to Carlson&#39;s formula then that pyramid if representing one polar radius, the base now sits at the equator and the apex is touching a pole, If its representing the south polar radius then with its base resting upon the equator then that doorway if using 50 feet : 43,200, is situated in the State of Amazonia, almost dead center. 50&#39; x 43,200 = 2,160,000 feet, divided by 5283 ft = 408.85 miles. South of the equator or north if measuring the northern polar radius. I&#39;m not sure of the height of the actual entrance in the pyramid.
