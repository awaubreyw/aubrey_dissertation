Each and every atom with a temperature above the absolute zero glows. Every atom within ourselves and within the earth glows, just like the sun glows. The infrared 3D image of the earth glows in all directions, even the infrared 3D image of ourselves. We actually control the present moment creation of this image as we control the muscles in our bodies with our minds. Our past never ceases to exist, rather it leaves us as infrared photons travelling in all directions. Some of those infrared photons are glowing straight towards the center of the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. Each and every photon of whatever energy level, which is travelling straight towards the center of our supermassive black hole, it gets sucked straight into the singularity, sort of as a momentaty picture of the entire universe. The 3D image of the entire universe is falling into itself at the center of every single black hole in the universe. The photons of the universe that are not travelling straight at but close towards, they smear out on the event horizon and must somehow spiral down towards the singularity. And then there are all the photons that somehow get pulled around but don&#39;t fall in, but rather spirals outwards into the rest of the universe. And then there is matter. But it somehow seems like every black hole has a point of view of the hole universe that constantly gets sucked in. Maybe the photons, the 3d image of our universe become solid matter inside all the black holes?

Try to see it this less dirty cheap dramatic way:<br>Black holes are crystallization points in the universe which allow mass to cluster and form galaxies. Without those black holes mass would be much more evenly distributed throughout dark space and BECAUSE of the lack of them the whole universe would be probably a MUCH darker space. Black holes are like a dirt particle in the air which allows a snow crystal to form a condensation point which attracts mass and stir it up well in those large structures known as galaxy, kneading, compressing and churning the mass of stars and many ex-stars which produced all the heavier elements into what we know as planets in solar system, making life even just possible BECAUSE of their presence.<br>But our stupid and short-sighted attitude as human beings, not to mention the sensationalist nature of our media we just focus on their negative destructive side of them were I focus more on their, in IMHO, essential existence for us and other most likely life existing throughout the universe. As essential as most likely every higher life (beyond microbes, not to mention possible intelligent life) needs as requirement on a planet a stabilizing force to keep the rotation axis of a planet stable to allow long enough stable conditions to evolve beyond primitive forms of life like our moon. Most exo-planets we will find in the goldilock zones of other stars might have the chance to develop simple life, maybe even up to some alge or even plant life. But a moon as stabilizer for higher forms is as important as a black hole to compressing and mixing the original hydrogen and helium from the first stars from the origin of the universe to make any heavier element even possible.<br>I just say black holes deserve a better PR then this cheap freak circus PR the media and even their scientists which explore them give them. Maybe, the universe allows it, we live long enough to grow up, we can see them in that more appreciative light they deserve in my opinion.<br>With those jets they produce you might even able to call them to some degree a recycling stations as they not consume everything but after ripping matter apart throwing some back into the surrounding space.", "comment_date": "2020-05-11T22:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mahesh Mahesh", "comment_text": "Yeah the biggest problem with the black holes is PR problem.....", "comment_date": "2020-05-06T01:54:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Osama Janjuha", "comment_text": "Creator is perfect", "comment_date": "2020-05-05T10:05:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "F James", "comment_text": "You guys shortened the presentation....why??", "comment_date": "2020-05-05T05:24:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Resltess Gaming", "comment_text": "i&#39;d love to see their reaction to TON 618", "comment_date": "2020-05-02T11:55:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kenneth", "comment_text": "Supermassive black holes rare?
