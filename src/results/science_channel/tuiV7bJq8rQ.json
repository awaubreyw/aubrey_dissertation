Give us a little bit more credit than that.We ( the people of this world) can listen to the truth without freaking out in a panic.Not  everyone&#39;s going to panic when they realize we&#39;re being lied to.<br>I feel that the reason society is  very desperate and are in a panic( these days especially, )  is because we know were being lied to. Something feels wrong.<br>We can&#39;t trust our own country, and others  can&#39;t trust there&#39;s.That than gives the people in each county anxiety.<br>Are we the children waiting to be told that Santa is not real,and the parents (which is our government (  in each county are making choices when they can be honest with us about there lies .It&#39;s like a cheating partner in a relationship...and the husband ( for example ) is waiting for the right time to be honest with his wife and vise versa.Or unfortunately will never be honest with his wife and  family ( Family being a metaphor for our leaders) Our family in our country our liars.<br>That&#39;s why the world is unhealthy.<br>There is another way to look at it that&#39;s even more sinister,and it&#39;s accurate. I don&#39;t think the governments in each country don&#39;t want to tell the people (about other intelligent life form etc,) because they think we&#39;re going to panic ( that&#39;s just a reason to justify their filthy lies.)They don&#39;t want to be honest because they want control over the people.<br>The governments in each country want to continue to have control over the people like they&#39;ve been doing for years.The governments in each country feel if they were honest with the people about other intelligent life form etc that they would lose that grip on us that control.<br>Another thing to point out is they won&#39;t admit  that ( the true reason why the government&#39;s of each country won&#39;t be honest) They have to demonize us  ,( blame the  people of the country as a threat ).  Like we (society pose a threat because we may panic.) Notice how they point the finger at society (us the people) like we would cause revolutions riots and craziness. <br>The government&#39;s of each country in the world have known about intelligent life form for many years. They have collected bodies they have collected crafts yet they don&#39;t want to  tell us things of that nature ( be  honest with the people of the world) because of control. Control over the people in whatever ways they&#39;re thinking. If they were honest about other life form that would completely change the world. They want to keep the world mundane and boring so we follow along like puppets.<br>Why would another smelly man with a suit and tie keep me from seeing and experiencing such amazement in my life.Another human being no better than you or I is keeping you and I from seeing things in this life that would inspire so much in  people .It would open are eyes to such amazement ! Why should you miss out? Miss  and be kept from the most important thing you should know before your life is over. Instead you just get to follow the script they want you to follow before you die.The government&#39;s have already prepared a script for you and I to follow.They had it prepared for you even  before you were alive.Before you came out of your mom&#39;s belly was  a script waiting for you to learn when you got older ( the one they prepared for you, not the truth) Keeping the wonders of the world from you <br>Instead  of seeing the wonders of the world , the truth , and being educated , which would change your whole moral structure and would prepare you properly, rather they had written and prepared a movie script for you so you could learn and play the roll of a character.However the character had been misinformed and learning a part he or she would play based on what they had chosen for him or her. ( Him or her   being you and I in this world )<br> Even if your smart and realize this ,..just think of what they have kept from you and I ,...that would completely change the course of your life.<br>You see many people just  live the life they want you to live , play the part in the script they have written for you ( so you need not think for yourself so much... Control !!!! Like I said . The movie they have written for you.<br> That&#39;s is disgusting.!<br>Think about what you&#39;re being kept ( I don&#39;t think  people realize to what degree this  has changed you and your children&#39;s life,and your children&#39;s children life....and so on.) Its been happening for years.<br>Libraries of ancient knowledge was burned to the ground many years ago ( on purpose) so we could never know the truth.After the  librarys of ancient knowledge were  destroyed  that held such important , amazing, and truthful information (  secrets we can&#39;t understand today)  in  it&#39;s place came the curse of the white man&#39;s religion (Christianity etc) History was  <a href=\"http://rewritten.man/\">rewritten.Man</a> had rewrote history according to his  liking ( to shape people the way they wanted.) What better way to do that than to rewrite history  to shape are morals and standard and values.  From there our beliefs were born .( Beliefs from false history. ) The ultimate control.!  Now we can fight wars in the name of God, kill women and children in the name of God etc.First you need the people to believe in the history you want.Than it&#39;s passed on from generation to generation , family to family. They filled in there script for you . Now  we only have glimpses of the past ,but we know nothing of the true past ( history) In its place came religion .....and so on<br> If you could experience and see other intelligent beings ...see their spaceships and their engineering wouldn&#39;t that be such a rush.!Think about it.? If you could wake up and go to a museum and see a real alien body and things we&#39;ve collected over the years , wouldn&#39;t  that just completely change things.Thats what they are afraid of. That&#39;s why you always feel heavy and  controlled (like animals  in a pen being kept alive ) but not being fed  the right things that would open up our spirits and minds.<br>Many  people in mainstream society ( especially western culture) are just fine with the lies. They are in denial .Some people like to follow that script that was written for them before they were born. They just want to believe in the lies, ,Mabey it&#39;s easier for them. And that&#39;s why the world feels so controlled, suffocated, heavy, phony and down.We are following a dull act..Many people are tired of this movie They want to move on, they don&#39;t want to keep watching the same movie over and over again. (especially a ridiculous one full of lies ) control ,is deceiving, is very narrow and keeps you in the pig pen. Right where they want you.<br> The pre-recorded history they had written before you came out of your mom&#39;s stomach.(like Christianity or religion.) It feels like we&#39;re all just going by the script they wrote for us. &quot;Here is your script, this is the way you&#39;re going to act ,this is the way history is, we have written it for you, we have filled in the pages for your life.<br>And people are so stupid they follow that. Why should some other suit and tie keep me from seeing such wonders in life ?That&#39;s why people wake up depressed all the time because there&#39;s never any progress..., you&#39;re never going anywhere spiritually in your mind because you&#39;re being kept from all the beautiful wonders in the world ,and you&#39;re going by the script they have written for you.Oh  that&#39;s creepy!!!! . And its becoming more obvious and obvious..<br>We don&#39;t want to play that part anymore, we don&#39;t want to teach our children false history, we want to see the exciting truth, were  bored of that movie you&#39;ve written for us ( and unfortunately  passed it on to  many generations.) &quot; Here you .... You just came out of your mom&#39;s stomach so we&#39;ll just leave this here  for you to read when you get a little older&quot; <br>Many  misinformed and uninformed people actually believe it. When you do that you&#39;re actually supporting the government&#39;s lies.<br>Society does not understand that when you follow religion etc , then the government is satisfied( even if they aren&#39;t religious themselves ) they are happy that you believe in all that because  morally you can kill in the name of God and wars and other things. The government is just laughing at people. No wonder they think we&#39;re <a href=\"http://children.no/\">children.No</a> wonder the government keeps the truth from us.<br>Society has  been  buying and living  their lies for years.( Christianity ,religion,  etc) buying the script they prepared for you. Stop buying their script and stop passing it onto your children. You&#39;re only hurting people,pleasing the government and keeping the government happy. It&#39;s like a book that keeps getting passed around and passed around. Don&#39;t support that anymore and you might just know the truth one <a href=\"http://day.you/\">day.You</a> might get to see the beautiful wonders of the world that you&#39;ve been missing. But you&#39;re not going to do it this way.Wake up people! And don&#39;t support their lies they have written for you.", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T09:44:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T.

They even had images of such a satellite and such images are CLASSIFIED! Hence, FBI raid.  There is a theoretical distance / altitude at which a geosynchronous satellite is also a Sun synchronous satellite; this location is optimal for constant images of current daylight observations 24/7 spanning the earth.

Now the telescope is pointed at the sky but who is to say that somebody got bored and started looking around with a very powerful telescope to see what else was going on around them. The other possibility was they did in fact see an inbound planet or brown dwarf star coming in from the sun&#39;s angle. Many stories and photos have surfaced about Planet X but to date there is no solid proof. Nevertheless there is &quot;something&quot; in the solar system that scientists have discovered is causing perturbations in the orbit of every planet in our solar system. At some point it will become observable with the naked eye and then the cat is out of the bag. Of course &quot;they&quot; want you to keep doing your job and keep the economy running for as long as possible. What if &quot;they&quot; know what&#39;s coming and so they want everyone locked up and indoors to keep it a secret for as long as possible. Why they can print any amount of fiat currency and ruin the economy because they know it won&#39;t matter when this inbound whatever becomes visible to the naked eye. Science notes the earths magnetic field is waning, the poles are shifting, and an uptick in weather anomalies , along with vulcanism is increasing in frequency.

When, I was living in the sticks in Ireland. I was travelling home one night when I saw a big fire which was unusual as it was pissing down with rain which is fairly standard weather for Irelands west coast. My car was pulled over by the Irish Defence forces army as I pulled up to a road block there where some Irish Police the &quot;Garda&quot; there as well. The odd thing was that the soldiers had Scottish, Welsh, English accents. very usual to have that in the Irish defence forces but not unheard of but the large number of them made it odd. There were also guys with Irish regional accents so I didn&#39;t think much more on it. anyway. I was questioned by a very well spoken English guy in a captains uniform in the Irish Defence forces  with an Irish sergeant for a few minutes. where I was going? my name? where I lived? etc.. He told me that there was a small plane crash and that I would have to around the long way. I then tried to engage him in conversation as I lived in England as a Kid from 11 to 17 and asked him where he was from and it was unusual to see somebody from England in the Irish defence forces. He politely ignored me and told me to hop back in my car so I did didn&#39;t think anything of it and headed the long was home. I looked at the RTE News and news papers for over a month. Not a single mention of a small plane crash anywhere.

(70 years after Dr. Velikovksy wrote he had found standing flash frozen mammoths with Greens still fresh in their stomachs) mainstream science now acting suprised admits Greenland was flash frozen in the blink of an eye. And even the great Doggerland was the equivalent of the Sahara a little more than 12,000 years ago. This was and is going to be caused by the break down in elasticity in the Earths lava layer causing a sudden 10-20 degree jerk in the matter of seconds! Sending the Oceans at infathomable speeds into the mainlands. I plan on moving inland in the next decade as there is just no telling which way the jerk is going to happen and any shore lines are at risk. This is why every human civilization has a flood based origin story no matter where you go in the world, this is Why Antarica used to have rainforests! This will happen by 2050 but most likely 99% chance by 2046! This is because of the fact the Reversal is an exponentially increasing process and the closer to it we get the more drastic the changes such as volcanism, earthquakes, lightning/plasma storms like never seen before. <br><br>Even Einstein signed onto this theory, as all the true scientists agreed their had to be a reocurring disaster before the commies/fascists took over our sciences in the 40s and 50s. What I can tell you is that by the next 10-15 years you will not be able to go outside for more than 10-20 minutes or even less without receiving severe UV burns as our Magnetic Shield will fall to critical levels.

The dream goes as follows:<br><br>The Parker Solar Probe was orbiting around the Sun for many years, until one day, it sent back an information to NASA&#39;s JPL, which upon analysing it, gave a huge terrible shock to NASA Scientists. In the report, NASA administration said that the Sun is breathing it&#39;s last breath. They even said that the Sun will expand into a &quot;Red Giant Ball&quot; within 3 to 4 hours, increasing the surface temperature of Earth to 75\u2103 and will remain in that form for 4 hours atleast, and then will finally contract into a &quot;White Dwarf&quot;. But unfortunately, they have no time to take precautions against it. The water will evaporate &amp; the flora will burn out eventually due to extreme heat. So the government alerted the residents to stay in their home for atleast 8 hours and informed them not to venture out of their house under any circumstances.<br><br>After about 3 hours or so, the surface temperature of Earth started to increase gradually, finally reaching upto 75\u2103. The brightness of the sun also got elevated, reaching it&#39;s extreme limit, so bright that the other houses &amp; buildings were becoming impossible to figure out. The moment we tried to look outside, the brightness cinged our eyes painfully. The transmission lines, metal electric poles &amp; the A.C. transformers became red hot to conduct any electricity further &amp; the flora catched fire. So the electricity was cut off then &amp; there. The walls of our house were even impossible to touch. The water stored in our roof tank started to boil out. The boiling sound was very loud, as if someone was bubbling air under very high pressure through water. Some sealed water tanks even started bursting as if the LPG cylinders were bursting out. The feeling was like we were facing the World War 3.<br><br>This havoc continued for 4 hours and then the temperature as well as the brightness slowly started dripping down. The temperature returned to normal after about 6 hours. And then it became possible for us to venture out of our house. The moment we ventured out, the scenery we saw was impossible to either describe or explain. The sky was dark. All the flora were converted into black ash. The transmission lines melted down. There was no sign of any life except us. We even ventured to the Mahanadi river near our house. But there was nothing left to explain. The sand bed turned black and there was no single drop of water to be traced. Everything was destroyed. The remnants of the blasted water tank were strewn all over the road. The solar panels melted down. The hydroelectric dams stopped working as there was no water to rotate the turbines. The windmills were dead as no wind was blowing. So there was no source to generate electricity. There was no food left to eat.<br><br>When we looked towards the sky, we saw that the outer Helium layer of the sun escaped the gravitational pull of the Sun&#39;s core. So what remained is the &quot;Bluish-White Dwarf&quot; or more specifically, the &quot;Bluish-White Orb&quot;, which is the Sun&#39;s Hydrogen Core. The moon was faintly visible. But the surrounding became lighted as if the moon was shining. This light was given out by the &quot;Bluish-White Dwarf&quot;.<br><br>All that remains is the palpitating heart within us to either die forever or survive.

It&#39;s a beautiful area.  When Sunspot was closed down suddenly, all kinds of rumors flew around here, because the FBI refused to tell the public anything  and our local Sheriff was angry about that so told the press that even he was kept in the dark.  <br>Several months later, after the FBI investigation, the public was told that an employee was using the internet at Sunspot for child porn.  Sickening.  When that employee feared they were onto him he panicked and started trying to place ideas into everyone else&#39;s head that they had a security problem and there was a serial killer in the area looking to execute someone.  That&#39;s when the head of Sunspot suddenly, immediately shut Sunspot down, sending the folks who work there home without telling them why, and the FBI shows up in their Blackhawks.
