God doesn&#39;t simply forgive when we repent; He removes our sin completely. Scripture is full of commands for us to love each other and overlook faults. We are reminded that love \u201ckeeps no record of wrongs\u201d (1 Cor. 13 : 5) and that we should be ready to forgive one another \u201cjust as in Christ God forgave you\u201d (Eph. 4 : 32).       <br><br>I am deeply grateful that God turns off the scoreboard when I fail. Again He doesn\u2019t simply forgive when we repent; He removes our sin as far as the east is from the west (Psalm 103 : 12). That is AMAZING!! With God, forgiveness means that our sin is out of sight and out of mind. Start living a life of pure forgiveness of others, as our Lord so graciously forgives by first acknowledging that you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross, His death, burial and resurrection. You will then be sealed in salvation, and your life will be forever changed!   <br><br>Please find joy in praying the following prayer with me...Dear Lord Jesus, thank You for not holding my sins against me and for granting me a second chance. Help me today to forgive others just as You have so freely forgiven me. Please give me grace to extend forgiveness to those around around me. This I pray and give thanks in Your Mighty Mighty name, Amen!     May God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2018-11-07T05:22:14Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "YoyoCuber", "comment_text": "Weird flex but ok", "comment_date": "2018-11-07T02:31:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NiggaNiggaNi", "comment_text": "weird flex but ok.", "comment_date": "2018-11-07T00:05:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael", "comment_text": "seems like a lot of work for bowling alleys", "comment_date": "2018-11-06T21:32:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kaloznyk", "comment_text": "was there a cut with it??/ why did it start with stuff already put in", "comment_date": "2018-11-06T21:21:01Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Koki", "comment_text": "Why is the video cut off in the beginning?", "comment_date": "2018-11-06T20:31:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zegodor", "comment_text": "OMG thank you I&#39;ve always wanted one of these", "comment_date": "2018-11-06T20:15:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "John", "comment_text": "Wow. somebody thought of all this and I can&#39;t even think to warm up car up in the winter before work.
