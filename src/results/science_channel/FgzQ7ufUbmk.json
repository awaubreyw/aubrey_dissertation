The only thing I&#39;m worried about is the last generation. They will have the greatest impact, though. Good news! There is an Earth-like planet called Kepler 22b! It is 2.4 times the diameter on Earth, and can be suitable for living, as what the scientists stated. It is located in the &quot;Goldilocks zone&quot; which is a habitable zone. Bad news is, it is 600 million light years away. But don&#39;t be confused, light years is different from Earth years. Light years is actually the measured distance in example, it takes 8 minutes for the sun&#39;s light to reach Earth.
