This (along with the archers sight picture) creates what is known as the &quot;archers paradox&quot;  The arrow shaft WILL be (and MUST NEEDS BE) severely bent/flexed as it is launched to get past the riser and then it will go through a cycle of harmonic flexing.  At some point this flexing will be reduced to describe a path narrow enough to pass through the axe-head eyes  BUT not until after it has slowed down enough that the fight path begins to drop at an ever increasing curve.  So the ONLY hope you have is to pre-align the openings along a known and well described trajectory.  Given modern bows and a well enclosed indoor range I could do this in ten  practice shots with eight or more cameras and a day to analyze and then\u00a0 and then one actual &quot;attempt&quot; should do  But if I posted it on youtube you would only see the successful one shot attempt  because I&#39;m just that much better than Odysseus and adam savage combined", "comment_date": "2019-06-09T19:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greek Fire", "comment_text": "Except that the axes were supposed to be moving.", "comment_date": "2019-06-08T16:01:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sunrise zone", "comment_text": "odysseus was a veteran fighter and an expert archer.he used his bow under pressure in fight.not in laboratory conditions.ofc he could do it", "comment_date": "2019-06-07T20:13:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Je", "comment_text": "Odysseus is shakingz", "comment_date": "2019-06-07T16:56:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Williams", "comment_text": "calling Bull shit on this! , , , Odysseus arrow shot was with an old fashioned bow! no matter of the ficticiousness!", "comment_date": "2019-06-07T16:46:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scott Rich", "comment_text": "Axes don&#39;t have rings at the top.

The average draw weight of a classical longbow is believed to somewhere near an astounding 175lbs. Historians as well as scientists are baffled at how they were used effectively but they were. The longbow they tried would have been no where near that strength as they were pulling it pretty easily. The compound bow they used was  probably around 100lb if not lower. So assuming that Odysseus&#39;s &quot;bow which no man besides himself posessesd the strength to draw&quot; is at least as strong as the average for a classical English longbow. Then the force and therefore speed of the arrow would have been almost doubled from even the compound bow. As the original fictitous bow was supposedly impossible to draw for anyone weaker than Odysseus, we can assume that it was far stronger than 175lb and would then would send the arrow far faster. According to physics the gravitational pull exerted on the arrow stays the same while the forward momentum is increased, this effectively means that the arrow has less drop over a greater distance. It flies straighter. Taking into account that it was a fictional weapon, this is still not an accurate depiction of how the arrow would have traveled in that fictional situation. For a man capable of drawing a bow with such Power this shot would have been far easier because there would have been little to know arrow drop.", "comment_date": "2019-05-18T22:15:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luca", "comment_text": "<b>Homerus has left the chat</b>", "comment_date": "2019-05-18T19:26:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Smith", "comment_text": "Drop the kids.
