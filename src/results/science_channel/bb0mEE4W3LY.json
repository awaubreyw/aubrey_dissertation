[{"comment_by": "Mark Heffron", "comment_text": "This is my idea of what dark energy is:\r<br>I suspect that there are countless big bangs in the universe or multiverse, as many big bangs, or white holes, as there are black holes; they are the opposite ends of wormholes. You just connect the dots (the &quot;singularities&quot;), and you have no singularities, just a transition, a cause and an effect, as you find everywhere in the macrocosmic world. I subscribe to Lee Smolin&#39;s idea, that every time a collapsing black hole creates a new universe within its event horizon, the initial conditions of that Big Bang cause that universe to either successfully evolve, or fail and become chaotic. It&#39;s the natural selection of worlds. I also came up with the idea that if the event horizon of the black hole, which has all the information about the energy which entered it (a la Hawking), actually holographically projects the new offspring  universe within, which Professor Leonard Susskind has suggested,  that this could explain what Dark Energy is. When the black hole in the parent universe is absorbing new energy, this causes the event horizon to expand, so that the universe inside the black hole expands with the new energy feeding it. In this scenario, the &quot;parent&quot; universe is constantly &quot;feeding&quot; the baby universe and causing it to grow.  Of course when the parent universe&#39;s black hole (like an umbilical wormhole) stops feeding the new universe, and Hawking radiation starts depleting its energy, this would cause the offspring universe to contract and shrink in size, until it might eventually collapse back into the parent universe. I also like the metaphor of the parent and child; it has &quot;elegance&quot; and symmetry. It is usually binary star systems which cause the creation of black holes. One star feeds upon the other, gets &quot;pregnant&quot; as it were, when it collapses into a black hole and gives birth to a new baby universe, and then keeps feeding the baby universe with new energy it gathers from its surroundings. What happens inside super-massive black holes or merging black holes is a different matter. \r<br>Also, if the geometry of  string theory holds true, the collapse of the black hole might reach the transitional point of a 6-dimensional Calibi-Yau manifold, and that&#39;s how the collapsing energy squeezes out into a new dimension as a white hole. Maybe even new universes require a good Mom, with a healthy umbilical cord, to be successful.", "comment_date": "2022-02-12T19:33:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Greatermaxim", "comment_text": "You ain&#39;t seen nothing yet means we came from something.", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T10:22:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eugen Willerding", "comment_text": "In the following I want to give a simple explanation for the necessity of an accelerated expansion in a gravitational structure-forming system.<br><br>We assume a flat (Euclidean) universe today. Geometrically flat in Einstein&#39;s theory means an expanding &quot;zero-energy universe&quot; in the dynamical picture of Newtonian gravity. In such a homogeneous universe, the sum of the kinetic energy of expansion and the gravitational potential energy is simply zero. The old Einstein-deSitter model had this property and at the same time defined a so-called critical density. In such a homogeneous universe, the rate of expansion becomes slower and slower. There is no sign of any accelerated expansion.<br><br>In contrast, in an inhomogeneous universe all things are different. In Newton&#39;s picture there is now, in addition to the kinetic energy of the space expansion, also a kinetic energy of the moving galaxies relative to the expanding space (proper motion). And next to the negative potential gravitational energy of the homogeneously expanding space there is also an ever increasing negative potential energy of the growing galaxy clusters. But since we are in a zero energy universe (postulate!), the sum of the two parts must also be zero. But that means: The stronger the negative gravitational potential energy of the galaxy clusters, the faster the kinetic energy of the expansion of the space and the proper movement of the individual constituents must increase! And that results in what we called accelerated expansion of the universe !! The &quot;dark energy&quot; is the gravitational potential energy of the densifying galaxy clusters, which is getting stronger and stronger. The accelerated expansion has nothing to do with a &quot;cosmological constant&quot; - explained by a &quot;vacuum energy&quot;. <br><br>One can also make a prediction within this classical picture: Since the gravitational potential energy in the galaxy clusters increases disproportionately, we expect not only an accelerated expansion, but even an &quot;accelerated accelerated expansion&quot;. And the so-called w-parameter of the equation of state was not w = -1 (cosmological &quot;constant&quot;) at the beginning of the expansion, but w = -2/3. Later on the value  dropped and is now certainly lower than w = -1! This must mean dark energy is getting stronger as the cosmos grows older.<br><br>My conclusion: &quot;In the end, the theory decides what is observable - not the observer.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-09-03T15:53:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "martin smith", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve just come up with a hypothesis for dark energy, when a sphere is rotated the part coming towards you appears to expand, whilst the part moving away appears to contract, likewise in the Universe there are two main systems that have contracting &amp; expanding space-time, that of Black Holes &amp; the Universe as a whole respectively, my idea is that these are the two &quot;Poles&quot; of a rotating hyper-dimensional Universe.
