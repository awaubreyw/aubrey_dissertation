As light goes from here to some nearby galaxy, the light is moving at speed \u201cc\u201d relative to that<br>galaxy, so it seems from earth to be going at \u201cc\u201d plus the recession speed of the galaxy.

We know we are not seeing what it was like 46.5 billion years ago, since time and it didn\u2019t exist then!<br>Imagine you had 25 people standing in 5 lines of 5 to represent the singularity, then free space grew by 1 metre between each of them so they would now all be a metre apart. The middle did not move faster than the edges because none of the people actually moved in free space. There was relative velocity between the people but no real velocity since none of them had actually moved through free space. If originally the 25 people were standing on black crosses, they would still be standing on the same black crosses after the expansion. Each person had a zero displacement, therefore zero velocity. Whichever person was the observer, they would see all the other people going away from them, the people furthest from them would have had the biggest relative velocity to them. Imagine you were a person at the end of one of these lines of 5 people. The nearest person to you would have moved an extra 1 metre from you while the person at the other end of the line would have moved 4 metres from you. If you now imagined there were millions of people and they all moved an extra metre apart due to the expansion of free space between each of them how the furthest person could have had a RELATIVE velocity exceeding the speed of light. This also explains why the edge of our Observable Universe is about 46.5 billion light years away even though the Universe is only 13.8 billion years old. The most distant galaxies didn\u2019t have to move faster than the speed of light in a vacuum, it was free space expanding the space-time away from us faster than the speed of light that enabled them to be that far away.", "comment_date": "2022-05-01T17:55:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ajesh S", "comment_text": "so if we calculated the age and size of universe by pointing our telescopes  to the farthest object possible,so that &quot;13.8&quot;  number is just age of our observable universe right?then what about the whole universe? does it make any sense to say  13.8 is just age of our* observbale universe\ud83e\udd72", "comment_date": "2022-04-26T16:58:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1.2M views", "comment_text": "Chapter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVJRS4oZ5ak&amp;t=51m47s\">51:47</a>] It is We who built the universe with &#39;great&#39; might; and verily, it is We who are STEADILY EXPANDING &#39;it&#39;- Quran", "comment_date": "2022-04-25T08:00:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "nathan macyk", "comment_text": "Is there any reason we can\u2019t just send a a telescope through the edge of the observable universe I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s just a hard wall", "comment_date": "2022-04-25T03:33:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeff A", "comment_text": "In the Quran, it tells that the universe is expanding, how can man that live in a desert 1400 years ago know that? something you all to think about", "comment_date": "2022-04-23T15:51:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammad Anas Khairulnizam Only", "comment_text": "If a ring type telescope to look like magnifying glass, nice right?

So a spotlight centred in GNZ11 would be full of galaxies 46.5 billion LY in the direction of the earth but a much smaller distance in the direction away from earth. Also, given that humanity is only 120,000 years old, it is highly likely that a civilization has formed in GNZ11 or a neighbouring galaxy which has developed a telescope with similar capabilities to hubble. If they look away from earth how far can they see? My guess is that they can only see 400 million LY + expansion.

For those who want to change physics forever, read on:   <br><br>Cosmic Redshift happens because Photons loose energy over time due to EM Wave Dispersion, not Universe Expansion! <br><br>Gravitational Redshift occurs because the vacuum pressure of the EM &quot;field&quot; is higher near massive bodies. The mass density of EM Kinetic Dipole Particles in the &quot;EM Field&quot; is more dense near massive particles due to dipole coalescence.  Coalescence is a kinetic process when collisions between EM Dipoles result in a higher migration of dipoles toward more dense dipoles regions of the vacuum due to local dipole drag conditions.<br><br>Photons get physically compressed in higher density / higher pressure EM fields and thus blue shift as they travel into the denser EM field near &quot;Earth&quot;...<br><br>Photons Redshift as they go into regions of space with less EM &quot;field&quot; Kinetic Dipole Mass Density.  The smaller density / vacuum pressure in deep space allows photons to physically expand, the wavelength gets larger.<br> <br>The EM Kinetic Dipole Particle is an actual solid 100% elastic particle about 10(-35) meters in length and it has a mass of about 10^(-93) kg per dipole.  There are about 10^(72) EMG Kinetic Dipole Particle per cubic meter of vacuum on Earths surface.  The actual mass of the Vacuum on earths surface is about 10^(-21) kg/cubic meter.  This is dark matter / energy!  <br><br>These Kinetic Dipoles collide in the vacuum at an  RMS speed of &quot;c&quot;.  They collide with you at &quot;c&quot; and exchange momentum with the dipoles that make up your elementary particles!  There is a NET momentum transfer along the EM Kinetic Dipole Mass Density Gradient or &quot;down&quot;.  This is gravity!  No spacetime needed!<br><br>The EM field is a Bose Gas of Bo\u017ceons (EMG &quot;field&quot; Kinetic Dipole Particle).  The given name &quot;Bo\u017ceon&quot; means &quot;God Particle&quot; in Polish, the ethnicity of the conceiver of the actual EM Dipole.

There are about 10^(62) EMG dipoles flowing inside one electron.  There are about 10^(57) dipoles flowing inside one &quot;green&quot; Photon.  Yes Photons have a small mass.<br><br>The person responsible for Kinetic Dipole Theory (KD Theory) is a person that helped launch the first and last humans to the Moon!<br><br>John W. Boze was the IBM DDAS Telemetry Network Controller in the Firing Room at KSC for Apollo 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 and Skylab 2, 3, and 4.  He later helped build Space Shuttle Flight Computers at IBM Owego along with the father of SpaceX/NASA Astronaut Doug Hurley.   He knew Wernher von Braun and Alan Shepard.  They knew gravity was a EM field phenomena but had rockets to launch so skipped the research, back then! <br><br>BUT In the 1990s NASA researched antigravity with researcher Ning Li.  They were successful in 1999.  The project went black under the name &quot;AC Gravity LLC&quot; and it went to skunkworks.  The UAPs on the News are in fact Skunkworks EM Compression Drives or AntiGravity Drives on Drones.  They uses spinning liquid superconductors pulsed with RF to compress the local  quantum level EM Field gas around the drone increasing local vacuum pressure.  This EM Vacuum pressure can be controlled about the craft and thus provide steerable propulsion.  You can see the EM field lines coming out of the UFO/UAP against the clouds.  It has a wavelength of about 1 meter, the natural frequency of the kinetically colliding EM dipoles in vacuum on earths surface, ~~~75Mhz !!!<br><br>The mass of an elementary particle is the number of Bo\u017ceons X the Mass of a Single Bo\u017ceon (~~~10^(-93) kg.  A &quot;green&quot; Photon has a mass of 10^(-36) kg.  Yes photons have mass.  <br><br>The speed of light is simply the Terminal Velocity of a Massive Photon in the Quantum Gas of the Massive EM G Field that occupies the Vacuum.<br><br>The fine structure &quot;constant&quot; simply is Ratio of the Terminal Velocity of a Photon travelling in the Low EM Dipole Mass Density Regions of the Vacuum COMPARED TO the Terminal Velocity of an Electron in the High EM Dipole Mass Density Regions inside the Atom.  This constant can change if your local galactic EM Dipole Mass Density changes, and it is different everywhere.  This is dark matter/energy!<br><br>All Photons loose Energy due to EM Wave Dispersion to the EM field of dipoles.  This is better called EM Dipole Dispersion.    Photons loose dipoles over time by evaporation.  The EM dipoles get kinetically kicked out of the photon and into the quantum dipole gas that fills the vacuum (EM Field).  <br><br>A Gamma photon looses all its dipoles in about 50 billion years.  Meaning a Gamma photo emitted 50 billion years ago will slowly evaporate loosing dipoles 1 at a time to the EM Field.  As the Photon looses energy it EXPANDS in size meaning its wavelength gets bigger.  This is what causes cosmic redshift.  Eventually the dipole falls apart in the microwave range (max photon size) and becomes the CMBR.   The CMBR is evaporated photons.  <br><br>The visible universe is due  to photons evaporating in 50 billion years NOT EXPANSION!  The universe is basically in steady state!  for 1000 billion plus years!<br><br>Gamma photons, with mass of swirling EMG dipoles, evaporates over time, expands, and when the dipole density inside the photon approaches the dipole density of the vacuum the photon simple falls apart into dipole compression and polarization waves in the EM field called the CMBR!<br><br>The Planck constant gives us both the momentum of a photon and its Gas Compression Constant OR how many dipoles are compressed/liquified inside the particle!

As a Photon expanse in size its surface area gets larger exposing it to even more evaporation!  Microwave photons evaporate almost instantly then disperse into simple polarized compression waves.  <br><br>Gravity Waves are dipole compression waves.  Nothing to do with space or time!  Sound waves in space.  All EM waves are sound waves in the EM Dipole &quot;quantum Bose gas&quot;<br><br>The visible universe is governed by photon evaporation, not expansion.<br><br>The Hubble Constant actually measures Photon Evaporation, not expansion.

This process is carried out by the Almighty of the Universe based on the Nature of Reality of the Active Planets. These systems serve a variety of time limit functional needs of planets and living beings. Several factors in time limit functions need to be considered based on the functional behavior of non living things when activated and living things. All elements of non-living things in the Universe are having two functional behavior of minus and plus and require activation to perform its time limit function. Every element in the seven universes is made of Jabiga atoms (living electro molecule and living nucleus dust) and Ronos (electromagnetic force). All atoms of an element are not the same but all the atoms have minus and plus sense. Atoms of different elements are having different kinds of behavior and have different kinds of time limit functions. Jabiga atoms of different elements which are normally related to each other can join hands when time limit activation is normal to form a new force or to create a new component. If not related to each other it takes avatar as a destructive force with abnormal time limit creates natural calamities which could not be controlled by human. There are two fundamental forces namely Jabiga and Ronos forces with four avatars. Jabiga forces with plus and minus characters and Ronos forces with plus and minus characters are involved in keeping stable Jabiga atoms. Ronos electromagnetic force helps for keeping Jabiga atoms stable. Another fundamental gravity force disturbs the time limit function of Jabiga atom to some extent<br>Earthians View: According to study by Earthians \u2018When solar system was born 4-6 billion years ago only 6 percentage of potentially inhabitable planets that will ever form in the universe existed, which means 92 percent of more earth like world yet to be born.\u201d Earthians accepted that Earth planet is not flat but just like a ball rotating, that there is a vast dark force, Earthians studied about the shining stars and heavenly bodies and also named some planets and stars. Earthians creating horoscope and calculating the fate of human being based on the planetary movements and stars. Earthian accepts that there are seven human beings with similar face structure. Earthians cannot deny that they appeared on the Earth without parental sexual functions. There is Universal power that no one can see or feel the power or predict the time limit function of the Almighty.\r<br>\u2022\tThere are about 300 Active planets in seven universes. Just like Earth Planet there are one planet in Haloma Universe, one planet in Rajsival Universe and one planet in Hindoma Universe. All the three planets are identical to the Earth Planet, and Bindra (mold) is just like Earthians, but mass of the three planets may vary. \r<br>\u2022\tTime limit functions (Life time) are blessed by the Almighty to all living beings of active planes in the universes based on the nature of Active Planets.
