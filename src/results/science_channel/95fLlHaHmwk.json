Venus&#39;s scorching conditions could never have been Earth-like, because Earth is not scorching like Venus. And it never can!<br><br>If the quantity of CO2 on Venus (219,000x that on Earth) has not changed much in the last 4 billion years, then it would&#39;ve had runaway greenhouse warming at the beginning of that massive atmosphere. Runaway greenhouse warming is not dependent upon initial temperature (and you&#39;re suggesting it was Earth-like at 91 atmospheres of CO2). And based on the current estimate of +10% for every billion years, Sol was 0.62x as bright as it is today. Even with this reduced sunlight, Venus was still receiving 20% more sunlight than Earth does now. So, no!
