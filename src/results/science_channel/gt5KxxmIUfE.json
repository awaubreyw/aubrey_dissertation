We still have the same circles around the sun and same circles we make in our day as we turn about the sun. So everything appears to be relevant still but the heat each year and the feeling of the shorter or faster flying time. \u00a0Also with the weight of the water being removed from our surface the pull of the sun and moons gravity will pull harder on the land plates causing some uprising and more movement here is felt on the ground too. \u00a0Why not?", "comment_date": "2015-07-24T09:32:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WhySoBlue", "comment_text": "What if earth use to look like Mars and Venus looked like earth but then Venus become that earth became habitable and then later Mars will be to?", "comment_date": "2015-07-24T05:49:47Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Matt Jeaven", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"http://youtu.be/gt5KxxmIUfE?t=2m50s\">2:50</a> was I just me or did it lag out ", "comment_date": "2015-07-24T05:14:31Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Alejandra Romero", "comment_text": "This is making me not want kids anymore.", "comment_date": "2015-07-24T02:17:46Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "ChairmanKiryu", "comment_text": "Threeeeee dooooooog!!!", "comment_date": "2015-07-24T01:50:24Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "dimes worth", "comment_text": "All because of the super rich with there private jets and RVeeeeeees We will all die in heat, their making the sun mad.
