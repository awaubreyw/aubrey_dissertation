Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. NOW, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky (ON BALANCE). CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE); as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE). Consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.). A given PLANET (including WHAT IS THE EARTH) sweeps out EQUAL AREAS in equal times consistent WITH F=ma, E=mc2, AND what is perpetual motion, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE); as E=mc2 IS F=ma.

This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. Accordingly, ON BALANCE, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution.

I get it that the mass slows down the time for the object but since we\u00b4re further away from the Black Hole, our time must move faster. I understand that probably from the objects perspective we\u00b4re moving fast because our time runs faster thus giving us more time to &quot;move around&quot; which leads to a kind of fast forward view from the view of the object. Can I assume that because time for the object is so much slowed down, it practically said has &quot;less&quot; time to move around and when it thinks it moves around normally at a normal speed, it seems though like from our view it is moving in slow motion because for the object itself not much time has passed yet but for us much more passed and thus the movement of the object is in slow motion?
