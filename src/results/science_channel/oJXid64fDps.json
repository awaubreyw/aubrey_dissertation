Rudder is by opposing aileron on the front and back swashplate. In addition there is what is called the longitudinal cyclic trim actuator which adds elevator cyclic to the rotors (tilts the swashplate in the longitudinal axis) when flight speed exceeds 60 knots, this helps to reduce the nose down attitude of the helicopter in forward flight which reduces drag and increases efficiency and speed. The pilot has no control over this it is controlled automatically by the flight computer. Early CH-47&#39;s did not have this system and so would nose down in forward flight more than more modern Chinooks. Also the two rotors are angled forward slightly to help with ground taxiing and this is also compensated for in hovering flight by the longitudinal trim actuator (early CH-47&#39;s also would hover &quot;nose high&quot; because they would instead compensate for the forward angle of the rotors with differential collective)", "comment_date": "2017-07-23T02:26:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "69sungam", "comment_text": "is this film in sweden?", "comment_date": "2017-06-30T16:12:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kobe", "comment_text": "Carrying your own weight does not count.", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T12:35:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bill Yost", "comment_text": "LMAO!<br>A bit misleading and a bit short on facts.<br>I worked on the Lycoming T-55 L-712 on and off the CH-47C, D and E model Chinooks. <br>If you check the U.S. ARMY TM circa 1987 for C model specifications for the Chinook you would discover that even the C model was GUARANTEED by Boeing-Vertol that the Chinook can and WILL lift it&#39;s own weight times two.
