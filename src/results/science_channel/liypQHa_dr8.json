Like I remember my RC Car, I couldn&#39;t be more than 7 meters away from to control it. How tf u gonna drive that on mars. Not only that but wouldn&#39;t there be lag. Like when I watch streams on twitch, the stream is like 30 seconds behind. Imagine a live video from mars. Shit would take 10 minutes. Imagine that, that&#39;s like playing with 1 bar on cod mw2. The craziest part about it is that these robots were made back in 2003. How you make that rover in 2003 back didn&#39;t make the fidget spinner till 2017. That&#39;s crazy to me. Yea ik there&#39;s satellite there to boost the signals and all but still, unless it sends information at the speed of light, idk how they drive them rovers.
