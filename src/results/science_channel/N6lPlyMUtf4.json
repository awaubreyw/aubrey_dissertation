Once beyond Earth, these new thruster&#39;s would work great no weight in space unlimited range. You push something in space it keeps going. Add a little thrust every now an then or just keep them going an after a while you would be going somewhere very fast. No fuel problem. They use electricity to create thrust. With a small nuclear reactor they would have unlimited range. Slowing down is a problem, after all your just working with very little thrust. Danger exist an there is no way of slowing down fast enough. With little thrust it would take time to slow down  a lot of time. An you would have to have these new thruster at both ends an for maneuvering around the new ship for up down and sideways.  Yes I&#39;ve been toying with this idea sense I was 8 yrs old. The only thing I came up with was parachutes very big ones but it would be to slow. We are trying to do away with the use of rockets because of the danger of the fuel. Its a work in progress.
