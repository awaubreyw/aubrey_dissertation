The one God is a trinity of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. The Son came and laid down his own life to save ours.  His sacrifice on the cross paid the price for our redemption with his own blood. On the third day he rose from dead and offers the gift of salvation and forgiveness to those that repent and trust in him. Although God&#39;s creation was created perfect, having no death, sickness and disease, the creation became corrupted through Adam and Eve in them disobeying God. In this rebellion the creation became fallen through the curse of sin and mankind became separated from God. This world is fallen, but God offers reconciliation to him through his provision at the cross. Ultimately God will restore his creation to perfection when he returns but those that who reject his offer of redemption will remain condemned by their sins and go to hell. <br><br>John 1:1,14 KJV<br>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and THE WORD WAS GOD.
