SUPERPHOSPHATO TRIPLE (TSP). AMMONIUM MONO PHOSPHATE (MAP) OR DIAMONIO PHOSPHATE (DAP) ARE OBTAINED BY ADDING AMMONIA. THE LIST IS LONG. THE USE OF THESE MINERALS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES IN A CIVILIZATION LIKE OURS OR MORE ADVANCE ARE WIDE ENOUGH AND POSSIBLY UNKNOWN TO US. NOW THE MYSTERY OF NAN MADOL IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN THE PACIFIC BEGINS TO MAKE SENSE.\r<br>\r<br>THE OLDEST FACILITIES OF NAN MADOL ARE UNDER THE SEA, OBVIOUSLY THEY ARE ANTEDILUVIANS. THE STACKING OF THE DIFFERENT BASSALT STONE CYLINDERS ARE A MORE RECENT WORK.\r<br>\r<br>THESE SEMI CYLINDRICAL STONES WERE TAKEN FROM THE RUINS UNDERWATER AND OF PREDILUVIAN CONSTRUCTION, THEY WERE IN MORE RECENT TIMES DUG FROM THE ANCIENT CITY SEA BED (REMOTE MINING OUTPOST) AND BROUGHT TO THE PRESENT SITE AND STACKED IN ORGANIZED FORM AND CLASSIFIED BY SECTOR DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY WERE SPECIFICALLY RECOVERED FOR THEIR FUTURE USE. THE WAYS TO STORE THESE COLUMNS THAT WERE EXCAVATED FROM THE SEABED AND STACKED IN THE PRESENT SITE IN THE PRESENT MANNER ALLOWED FOR THE LOCALS TO USE THE SITE FOR OTHER PURPOSES WHILE THEY REMAIN WHERE THEY ARE.\r<br>\r<br>THE SEMI CYLINDRICAL BASSALT STONES OF DIFFERENT DIAMETERS ARE THE RAW MATERIAL USED BY BORING MACHINERY THAT FUNCTIONS LIKE A SILICON GLUE GUN AND THE HOT MELT GLUE STICKS.  THE BORING MACHINE MELTED BASSALT STICKS ON THE BACK END WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DREDGING OR BORING TUNNEL OR A WIDE UNDERGROUND AND SUBMARINE STRUCTURE, APPLYING THE BASSALT TO REINFORCE STRUCTURES. THE FACT THAT THEY ARE SOMETHING RADIOACTIVE IS NOT A CASUALITY.\r<br>\r<br>IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT AS THE BASSALT STONES WERE RECOVERED, THEY WERE BOMBARDED WITH LOW-RANGE RADIOACTIVE ENERGY BEAMS BEFORE STORING OR INCLUDING BEFORE INTALATION OF THE BASSALT COLUMS, OR  THE RADIOACTIVE PARTICLES LEFT ON THE BASSALT COLUMS S WERE ACQUIRED IN THE MELTING AND HARDENING PROCESS, BECAUSE OF THE TECNOLOGY USED FOR HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE URANIUM GENERATORS USED FOR MEKTING AS THEY DO THE BORING PROCESS.  \r<br>\r<br>THESE RADIOACTIVE MELTING TECNOLGIES USED ON THIS SITE HAD THE BENEFICIAL BI PRODUCT OF KEEPING AWAY PARASITE MICROLIFE AS ALGIES, MOLLUSK, BARNICLES, CORALS BUILD UP ETC, UNDERS WATER AND ON DRYLAND SUCH AS THEIR CURRENT LOCATION.  THIS RADIOACTIVE PESTICIDE OR HERBICIDE ELIMINATES  THE PARASITE SUBMARINE AND DRYLAND BIORGANIC AGENTS THAT WOULD STICK TO THE STONES TO MAKE LIFE AND DAMAGE THE STONES WOULD LAST FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS TECHNOLOGIES WERE APPLIED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. \r<br>\r<br>THE LABORATORIES CORELAB AND PROTECHNICS HAS DEVELOPED THIS TYPE OF TECHNOLOGIES USED BY THE OIL INDUSTRY.\r ALSO TODAY RADIOACTIVE BEAMS ARE USED TO BOMBARD LARGE CHEAP COLORED DIAMONDS TO CHANGE THE COLOR STRUCTURES TO WHAT ITS CALLED FANCY COLORED DIAMONDS, SELLING LATER FOR MUCH BETTER PRICE IF THEY GO UNDETECTED.\r<br>\r<br>MORE THAN 12,000 YEARS AGO, IT IS VERY POSSIBLE THAT ANCIENT CIVILIZATIONS BUILT SUBMARINE CAVE DEPOSITS TO DISPOSE OF NON-RECYCLABLE TOXIC MATERIALS IN ISOLATED FAR AWAY PLACES.\r<br>\r<br>OR THERE WAS A MINING REMOTE OUTPOST THAT BUILT UNDERGROUND HOUSING FACILITIES OR ALL TOGETHER.\r<br>\r<br>THE LOCATION OF &quot;NAN MADOL&quot; COULD HAVE BEEN A IMPORTANT MINING REMOTE OUTPOST THAT USED THE QUALITY AND ABUNDANCE OF ITS NEARBY MINERALS AS THE FIRST THING ON WHICH THEIR BUILDERS WERE BASED TO LOCATE THEIR FACILITIES. THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE ALONG HISTORY WITH ALL TYPES OF MINERALS SUCH AS GOLD MINES, PRECIOUS STONES ETC.\r<br>\r<br>EVERYBOY KEEPS ASKING WHY BUILT NAN MADOL IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, THE ANSWER ITS QUITE CLEAR AND SIMPLE. THE BENTONITE, PHOSPHATE AND MANGANESE NATURAL DEPOSITS ARE ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, THE TYPE OF MINERAL RESOURCES THAT LIE DEEPER UNDERGROUND COULD POSSIBLY BE REVEALED BY OUR PRESENT LASER SATELITE DEEP GROUND PENETRATION TECNOLOGY, \r<br>\r<br>THE ANCIENT ANTEDILUVIANS SITE UNDERWATER OF NAN MADOL ITS HUGE\r<br>\r<br>HERE I DROP THIS PEARL ...\r<br>\r<br>WHEN ZECHARIA SITCHIN STARTED USING MODERN MAN LOGIC TO INTERPRET THE ANCIENT WRITINGS OF SUMERIA, THEN THESE LEGENDS AND MYTH BEGAN TO REVEAL TO US ANCIENT MYSTERIES OF FORGOTTEN CIVILIZATIONS.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>BY THE WAY DO YOU REMEMBER THE MOVIE COCOONS BY STEVENS SPIELBERG?
