[{"comment_by": "Mike Orick", "comment_text": "The compound bow made the shot because the stiffer arrow flexed less in flight as the bow is more center shot; less bow to flex around than the longbow. The compound bow was probably faster by 100-150fps too; less arrow drop. Odysseus may not have used a longbow; the Greek word can be translated as &quot;recurved&quot;. The recurved bows he may have encountered on his travels include the Scythian, Assyrian, Hittite, Egyptian, and Cretan. He is shown with a Scythian style bow most often in Greek art. With a light enough arrow they could be as fast as the compound bow was. With a stiff enough arrow, less flexing in flight; he could adjust for that too. He was tricky enough to know that even if MythBusters was not. Strong enough to string the bow, tricky enough to know how to set up the shot, good enough to get it done.

However, because the bow is built so far from center, the arrow has to flex around the bow, which is what he means by \u201carcher\u2019s paradox\u201d. However, if we were to put the Odyssey into actual historical possibilities, no bows with shelves were around during whatever time period the tale is told in. So, the only possible way for an arrow to have flown true and straight enough to pass through a dozen rings like this is if it was flying the way an arrow does when fired from an Eastern style bow off the right side. In this method, which is shown in historical Turkish, Korean, and other Asiatic and Eastern methods of shooting, the arrow is shot from the right side of the bow with a thumb draw, which changes the alignment from near the head to the bow, allowing it to fly straight with the addition of \u201ckhatra\u201d, which is where upon release of the string the bow is allowed to move to the left with the bow hand, making it so that the arrow doesn\u2019t have to flex around the bow, but fly completely straight to the target.", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T21:41:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henry HM", "comment_text": "500th comment", "comment_date": "2020-06-25T04:38:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "molly saji", "comment_text": "Sorry I wrote falcon 5", "comment_date": "2020-06-10T08:45:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "molly saji", "comment_text": "And I have tested some myths", "comment_date": "2020-06-10T08:44:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "molly saji", "comment_text": "Hey Adam Savage I saw you on falcon 5.
