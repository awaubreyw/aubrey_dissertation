The warriors had other tasks I don\u2019t recall but the last task was running up this rock wall and once you made it to the top you yelled your spirt animal for all to hear.

I have always been fascinated by it since I was a kid. I really had no idea it was that significant and rare. I drove by it a few days ago, the water is pretty high at this point and doesn&#39;t have as much definition as it does in the summer, but it is still really cool and odd. I personally wouldn&#39;t say it is a lake in length it is probably 200 meters long and 50 metres wide. On my way back next week I will actually pull over and take a close look at it for the first time. Surprisingly it&#39;s not as big of a deal as this video is making it out to be, but I haven&#39;t done extensive research mainly due to me not knowing it was significant at all really. <br><br>From being from a small town it is really cool to see this on you tube.
