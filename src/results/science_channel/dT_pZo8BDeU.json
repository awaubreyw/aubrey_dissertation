Any video discussing the Suns effects on Earth that does not discuss our magnetosphere should be considered propaganda and not science. As we progress through a geomagnetic excursion or reversal referred to as pole shift, the increased effect the Sun has on Earth due to our weak and further weakening magnetic shield is of the upmost importance.<br>Today is May 12, 2021 and the fact that the SWPC did not forecast the kp7 geomagnetic storm of this morning is either criminal or at best, delusional. The only reason why the authorities have stopped public reporting of our magnetic field can only be taken as a negative of the strength of our field and should be factored into all forecasts. Clearly, even a person with only a vague understanding of spaceweather can randomly guess a forecast more accurate than the authorities public forecast.
