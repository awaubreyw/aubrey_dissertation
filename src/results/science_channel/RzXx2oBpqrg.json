Will you interview the first Bulgarian cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov, who is currently 79 years old, or will make an episode of his space mission ,,Soyuz 33\u201d which almost killed him in space in 1979? The astronaut Georgi Ivanov has spoken many times about the damage to the engines of the space capsule and the premature termination of the Soviet space mission &quot;Soyuz 33&quot;, which saved his life. The Bulgarian national television made many films about him and you can see them on youtube .  The space capsule and space suit of Georgi Ivanov are in the aviation museum in Plovdiv. I will leave a link to the cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov&#39;s Facebook if you decide to contact him. The cosmonaut Georgi Ivanov is a very kind person and he will be really happy to hear from you.
