The valid reason has to do with the number of images flies see in a given time period compared to humans. They see more than four times the images per second than we do. They can then compare the changes in these images four times faster than humans and quickly detect danger.

So how can we speed it up, like in an instant so we can succeed? I experimented and this is how it is. It&#39;s easy to swat a fly if you know how. You use both slow motion and instantly fast motion. When a fly lands, it always works. If you see a landed fly, prepare your swatter by flexing the lethal end of the swatter backwards with the other hand and slowly and fluently line the swatter up for an accurate direct hit (take your time to line it up perfect, cos as long as you are really slow the fly won&#39;t notice and you can take as long as you like). Then suddenly release (or flick) the swatter for an guaranteed strike. lol  You will get (at least) a 99% strike rate if you do that but if you just swat the fly normally you will get a 1% strike rate. And if you are missing flies it&#39;s most probably cos you haven&#39;t taken your time to line it up. Do not anticipate cos that causes much faster (slow) movement and the fly will notice. If you nudge the last inch in anticipation just before you release, it will almost certainly be a fail every time. lol It&#39;s all really slow until it flicks, that&#39;s the secret for a near 100% strike rate.", "comment_date": "2017-10-17T12:30:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "monmonbox", "comment_text": "Sharingan i guess", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T13:41:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "medicine for dummies", "comment_text": "Because they fly.", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T04:50:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lilbitch", "comment_text": "Hide the fly swater there problem solved.\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2017-10-16T02:42:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "khalifa coast", "comment_text": "Oh fuck you", "comment_date": "2017-10-15T23:43:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "all good names taken", "comment_text": "there was a fly in my bathroom that wouldn&#39;t leave for about 3 days....then it finally fucked off....wonder why", "comment_date": "2017-10-15T07:59:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jed M", "comment_text": "Talkin about evolving but it never happened", "comment_date": "2017-10-15T04:35:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dev", "comment_text": "It has a sharingan", "comment_date": "2017-10-15T02:15:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DalisYn", "comment_text": "I just spray em with bleach and watch them fall mid flight", "comment_date": "2017-10-14T21:55:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ziscia", "comment_text": "Because all of the Sharingans in the hexagons in its eyes", "comment_date": "2017-10-14T03:47:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "david gaffney", "comment_text": "Fabreze!", "comment_date": "2017-10-13T21:54:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nita Carr", "comment_text": "Shit not me I&#39;m the fly swatting Queen", "comment_date": "2017-10-13T14:46:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cyrome Turtle", "comment_text": "Its ez when they stop throw a notebook  fast and quick and the poop they ate will expload like if u agree", "comment_date": "2017-10-13T11:49:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "King E", "comment_text": "Wow interesting", "comment_date": "2017-10-13T08:54:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shrubz4Scrubz", "comment_text": "So flies have the sharingan.....teach me your ways...", "comment_date": "2017-10-12T03:50:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yuyya", "comment_text": "apparently theres a fly in my room which was turned the opposite way at me but i tried swatting it an it flew away.. explain", "comment_date": "2017-10-11T22:11:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jelonade Gillo", "comment_text": "I know it...I watched Epic movie..", "comment_date": "2017-10-11T17:44:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dee Thomas", "comment_text": "They have 1000s of Sharingans... that\u2019s why.", "comment_date": "2017-10-11T11:12:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xCynik", "comment_text": "I vacuumed a live fly before", "comment_date": "2017-10-10T21:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drizzy Mane", "comment_text": "I killm all the time,Just swat at the Direction their body is Pointing (That&#39;s the way the lil SOB will take off.),Just like Sasukes n Itachis Sharing an which gives them like 5-10 seconds of Visual Prowess or a time loop which they see shit about to happen.Thx.", "comment_date": "2017-10-10T18:32:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pranav Gainz", "comment_text": "I swat flys easily.", "comment_date": "2017-10-09T05:46:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "josh miranda", "comment_text": "Its easy asf what do you mean", "comment_date": "2017-10-09T03:19:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Krizi", "comment_text": "666k views, this proves that the flies are evil...", "comment_date": "2017-10-08T23:53:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aleeanna Gonzalez", "comment_text": "I killed many flies just with paper", "comment_date": "2017-10-08T16:11:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Parkour Bushido Kingsley", "comment_text": "Swatting flys is easy I can swat more than a hundred a day.", "comment_date": "2017-10-08T00:12:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xtendo Dee", "comment_text": "I wanna shoot the fly thats in the video", "comment_date": "2017-10-07T13:55:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aexiy", "comment_text": "we dont see the world in hz our eyes see it in motion : P", "comment_date": "2017-10-07T00:02:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miyakolover", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsEzKH4Tl9g&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a> That fly took a dump", "comment_date": "2017-10-06T19:12:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Masterr59", "comment_text": "Yeah I think we need some data to show we only see in 60hz.
