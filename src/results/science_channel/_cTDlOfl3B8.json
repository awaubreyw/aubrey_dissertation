I&#39;m currently designing a two man personal submarine very similar in shape to this one, but utilizing stiffening rings at two to three foot intervals which would increase the depth (rated by ASME standards for pressure vessels subject to external pressure) to roughly 305 ft. This makes my design depth of the submarine 200 ft for a 50% contingency. My current challenge is getting the combined assembly to weigh more than the bouyant force of the hull due to its displacement. <br>How did you guys overcome this challenge? I&#39;m about to fill the hull volume with concrete to add on the weight.<br><br>My calculations for the volume of a 500 gal. propane tank (10ft length x 36&quot; diameter) with 4x 5 gal. air banks means the hull has to weigh at least ~4500 lbs. to be neutrally bouyant.<br><br>I&#39;d really appreciate being able to discuss some of the things you guys did for this project.
