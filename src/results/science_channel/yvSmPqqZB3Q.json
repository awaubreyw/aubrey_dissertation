(calculated for 1 kilogram)<br><br>And that&#39;s not even all the science behind this! To transform from solid to fluid (also from fluid to gas) every stuff has its own amount of energy to absorb before it transforms. This is called heat of fusion. To water it is 3.3 kJ per kilogram (about 0.4 kilocalories per pound)<br><br>Using waters specific heat capacity we can count a little to lighten things up. Waters shc is 4.2 kJ/kg and lavas is 1.6 kJ. We assume that the lava in the video is about 5000 degree Celsius (9000 Fahrenheit) because the color of the stuff they pour on the ice. (And that high temperature is completely absurd because in nature lava is only between 800 and 1200 Celsius... 1500-2200 Fahrenheit) After summing things up a little (you can calculate these things by yourself if you are smart enough;) really this is not so complicated..) I figured out that 1 kilogram of that stuff in the video will heat up 1 kilogram of water roughly 1800 degree Celsius. For the american youtubers out there 1 pound of 9000 Fahrenheit lava will heat up 1 pound of water roughly 517 degree Fahrenheit (&lt;-- not completely sure about that one though. If you are american please check out that by yourself:D) And in these calculations I even didn&#39;t take account of the heat of fusion.
