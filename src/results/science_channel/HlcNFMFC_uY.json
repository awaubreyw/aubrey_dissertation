As Jesus said to His disciples, He also says to you &quot;Peace be with you.&quot; (John 20 : 21) Since He is your constant companion, His peace is steadfastly with you. When you keep your focus on Jesus Christ, you experience both His presence and His peace. Worship Him as King of kings, Lord of lords, and Prince of Peace. You need His peace each moment to accomplish your purposes in your life. Sometimes you are tempted to take shortcuts, in order to reach your goal as quickly as possible. But if the shortcut requires turning your <br>back on the peaceful presence of Jesus Christ, you must choose the longer route.         <br><br>Precious friend, walk WITH Jesus along paths of peace and enjoy the journey in His presence. This can be done by first acknowledging you are a sinner in need of our Savior. Welcome the righteousness of Jesus Christ into your life. Receive grace through faith by believing in Jesus Christ and what He did on the cross. You will then be sealed and justified in salvation. You will be rewarded greatly and your life will be forever changed! God bless you in the Glorious name of Jesus Christ our Lord and our Savior.\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f .
