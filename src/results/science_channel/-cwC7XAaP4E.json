I have come to believe that Germany surrendered but the Nazis did not.

That in its essence is fascism: ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power.\u201d  ~Franklin D. Roosevelt.

But why didn&#39;t Hitler live in three of the houses? According to accurate information, as houses that are a little further back, they only have 1 bathroom and 1 laundry room, seeming to house 35 people. Workers do not need luxury and will share the same bathroom and the same laundry. Hitler will not sleep and share a bathroom with 35 operators and wash his in the midst of these people.<br><br>Hitler placed workers to work on the construction of a secret tunnel inside the mountains of Patagonia and to save all gold from Europe in 1942. Because he would escape to Argentina in 1945 when the war was over.<br><br>Before the war started, hitler learned of the construction of the largest and most modern German submarine called U-513 which is sunk in the coast of Brazil. The submarine was built with the longest and largest internal space of the submarine category, developed for transport and not for combat, with autonomy for more than 24,000km without recharging batteries and the only one built with a hatch in the bow, to facilitate the cargo entry. In 1942 Hitler mysteriously disappears without a trace in Germany, coincidentally in the same year that the submarine went to sea, Hitler was not going to transport the gold of ship for fear that it would be torpedoed. If we are going to transport all German gold, we will need the most experienced captain in the fleet to guide you. That is why Rolf R\u00fcggeberg, on January 10, 1942, was called in to drive the submarine and transport all Nazi gold to southern Argentina. Where gold was in Germany, there is a railway that connects directly to some port that I don&#39;t know which one is. How did Hitler reappear for the first time at the end of 1942, in a special meeting with admirals and Rolf R\u00fcggeberg, to decorate him with a knight&#39;s cross for torpedoing 3 freighters full of iron ore? Loud talk! Hitler rolled up the Germans and everyone else rolled up. Now he asks who is the submarine captain, who wants to sail with a vessel of almost 80 meters to fight in the waters of the North Atlantic? None wants because it is slow, too heavy and easy to detect by sonar.<br><br>Let&#39;s go to the accounts that prove that Hitler fled to Argentina:<br><br>Rolf R\u00fcggeberg spent 222 days in charge of the U-513.<br>222 days divided by 30 (month) = 7.4 months. Almost 8 months at sea.<br>The distance from Germany to Argentina is 22.000  kilometers.<br>22,000 thousand KM divided by 1,852 nautical miles = 11880nm<br>Time is equal to distance divided by speed:<br>11880nm divided by 8 kt (average speed of the submerged U-513) = 1485<br>1485 divided by 365 days (one year) = 4 months.<br><br>4 months to take the gold to Argentina and 4 months to return to Germany.<br>Corresponds to the number of days that Rolf R\u00fcggeberg was in command of submarine U-513. Returning to Germany 18 days faster because the submarine was empty, totaling 222 days exactly. All of Europe&#39;s wealth came out in a cargo submarine camouflaged from a combat submarine.
