It is weak in firepower as a sea going frigate and too large and wide for river patrol. Upscale it to light cruiser size, give it some very light and thin armor, and outfit it with everything an Arleigh Burke class destroyer has. Then you can have another contender to replace the current destroyers. Let it keep some of the above the waterline shaping of the Zumwalt class as well as the 6&quot; gun and radar. Then you will have an advanced light cruiser more capable and faster than the current destroyers.<br><br>The Ticonderoga class guided missile cruisers can likewise be replaced with higher capability battle cruisers with some similar features but more focused on the air defense role. The new battle cruisers could have a monohull or also be a trimaran. If a trimaran is chosen the ama can help to protect part of the center hull but it would probably be less suited for icy waters. They should be modestly armored and have nuclear propulsion. They should have several 6 inch guns in one or two turrets and a lot of missiles. Also a very large powerful radar with the best air defense missiles available such as SkyCeptor plus ESSM and RAM for shorter ranges.", "comment_date": "2017-06-03T23:35:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Winter 1944", "comment_text": "The front side profile looks like the tip of the Benchmade Emerson CQC-7 knife.", "comment_date": "2017-05-28T01:25:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gibs Camus", "comment_text": "awesome", "comment_date": "2017-05-26T08:11:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Valerie \u041a\u0430\u0440\u0440\u0435\u043e\u043d \u2022 80 years ago", "comment_text": "USS Tusla?
