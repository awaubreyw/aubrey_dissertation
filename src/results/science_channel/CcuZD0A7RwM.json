Scientifically its a very good description of the Sun or First generation Stars! In some verses its described as a place with towering pillars of fiery inferno while other verses describe it as huge columns of fire!! That is exactly what we see on our sun. We have seen superheated  columns of gas and plasma rising from deep within the sun, it loops around the sun; its stretches far into space, it rains down fire from above while some breaks away as solar flares!! This is exactly how hell have been described! What i dont understand is why religion has damned those who otherwise are good people but deny Gods existence! They have been marked as fuel for that miserable cauldron! I understand evil people should go to hell, cruel maybe but understandable; heck our justice system punishes the wicked, the vile &amp; corrupt by throwing them in Jails with itself is analogous to hell! So why shouldn&#39;t God, right! However it is disconcerting to know atheists and Mormons (LOL) are fuel for that inferno! it is all the same!!", "comment_date": "2019-11-11T18:46:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pock", "comment_text": "Sounds like a microwave", "comment_date": "2019-11-09T18:23:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ehodges", "comment_text": "Video: <b>Tries to be serious</b><br>Everyone in the comment section: Imma be funny", "comment_date": "2019-11-07T00:34:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Handsome Guy", "comment_text": "What we see here is sound", "comment_date": "2019-11-06T23:31:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manoj Saxena", "comment_text": "Sound of fire.", "comment_date": "2019-11-06T07:36:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gilbert Guzman", "comment_text": "Just in a stoner moment but theres is nothing stronger than the sun\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\ud83c\udf1e", "comment_date": "2019-11-05T15:17:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orion Dezine", "comment_text": "So we\u2019re not actually hearing the sun.

And the Firmament has He raised high, and He has set up the Balance (of Justice).\u201d (Surah 55, Ayah 5-7) <br><br>In the great mathematical universe, there are great mathematical laws that require calculations. We now understand that these Ayat refer to the laws discovered by Kepler and Newton. These laws bear witness to Allah\u2032s Wisdom and also His favors to His creatures. We all benefit from the energy and light, the seasons and the numerous changes in the tides and the atmosphere. Quranic commentators interpret the balance in the above Ayah as one of the following: <br><br>\u2666 Balance of Justice between humans. <br><br>\u2666 The heavens themselves are sustained by Divine equilibrium. <br><br>\u2666 The sun enters the Constellation Libra (the balance) at the middle of the zodiacal year. <br><br>The divine equilibrium of the skies discovered by Newton in 1687 had not been realized in the seventh century. Yet the Creator of equilibrium revealed one of His favors to humanity. The equilibrium of the stars and planets requires an orbital motion that each should follow. Therefore, in other Chapters in the Quran, a clear mention of the orbital motion is presented: <br><br>\u201cIt is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon: All (celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course (orbit).\u201d (Surah 21, Ayah 33) <br><br>\u201cIt is not permitted to the sun to catch up the moon, nor the night outstrips the day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law).\u201d (Surah 36, Ayah 40) <br><br>The orbital motion of all celestial objects is repeated twice in the above Ayat for emphasis. These orbital motions of stars and planets are described as \u201cswimming\u201d through space with perfectly smooth motion. Swimming is \u201cthe action of propelling oneself by means of the movements of the body.\u201d This perfect description of celestial motion by the action of swimming indicates that heavenly objects have two motions: one is moving forward and a second motion of the body around itself. This second motion is the rotation of the stars and planets about an internal axis. It is quite impossible that someone in the seventh century, even if he had all the knowledge of his time, to use such an expression \u201cswim in orbits\u201d to describe the motion of stars and planets. Who told him that? It is the Only One that Knows. It is Allah Himself, the Creator of orbits. <br><br>Julian and Lunar Calendars <br><br>The Muslim calendar is based upon the moon, which revolves around the earth in periods of about 29 days. The Islamic calendar was established by the second Caliph Omar in 639 AD to begin with the new moon of the first Arabic month (Muharram) of the year in which the migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Madinah took place. That first day was 16 June 622 of the Julian calendar. <br><br>Nearly fourteen centuries ago, the Quran was revealed to the Arabs in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula, who were used to the lunar system. It was correct to address them in the only language they could understand and not to upset their habits. It is known how well versed men living in the desert are in the observation of the sky; they navigated according to the stars and told time according to the motion of the sun and the moon. This was the simplest and the most reliable system available for them. Most people are unaware of the perfect correlation between the Julian and the lunar calendar: 235 lunar months corresponds exactly to 19 Julian years of 365 1/4 days, (228 months). The length of our year of 365 days is not perfect because it has to be rectified every four years (with a leap year). With the lunar calendar, the same phenomena occur every 19 Julian years. The Quran refers to this relationship between the lunar and the Julian systems as follows: <br><br>\u201cSo they stayed in their cave three hundred years, and nine (more).\u201d (Surah 18, Ayah 25) <br><br>The literal translation of the above Ayah replaces \u201cand nine\u201d by \u201cincreased by nine.\u201d This suggests that one has to be careful about each word or letter in the Quran. The latest calculation of the lunar month is 29.53059 days. Therefore, the lunar year is 12 x 29.53059 = 354.36708 days. This means that 300 Julian year (300x365.25= 109575 days) is equivalent to 309 lunar years (354.36708x309= 109499.43). This is a miraculous accuracy. Therefore the above Ayah can be explained as \u201cSo they stayed in their cave three hundred solar years and increased by nine lunar years\u201d. This is just an amazing revelation from the Creator of time. Only Allah knows the exact time of any event in any reference of time. \u201cSay: Allah knows best how long they stayed.\u201d (Surah 18, Ayah 26)", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T09:32:41Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Yxng K1", "comment_text": "Bro I really came here from the meme \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T21:41:03Z", "likes_count": 517}, {"comment_by": "boobee_enjoyer", "comment_text": "&quot;It&#39;s the sound of chaos&quot;<br>Sun: &quot;I can do anything!&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-03-10T20:31:58Z", "likes_count": 38}, {"comment_by": "Ashley", "comment_text": "What if the sun is hell?
