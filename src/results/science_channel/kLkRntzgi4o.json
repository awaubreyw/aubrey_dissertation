Galatians 2:20 I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. I Died with Christ. Romans 6:3 Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? Was Buried with Christ. Romans 6:4 4 Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life., We were Crucified with Jesus And Now Jesus Live In us, We Have His Life In Christ. The Cross Has Formed A permanent Barrier Between Us And The World.

Ephesians 2:5,6. 5 Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;) 6 And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus: We Were Made Alive, Quickened, Zoed Together With Jesus, When He was Made Alive, He Was The First Begotten From The Dead and We Were Created In Christ Jesus When He Was Made Alive. When Jesus was Made Alive, He Conquered satan and Spoiled The Principalities And The Powers Making A Show Of Them.. We shared In Jesus Victory and the devil is A Defeated Foe As Far As We Are Concerned, He is Under Our Feet. The Same Power that Raised Jesus from is In Us Now, And We Were Raise Up Together and Made To Sit Together In Heavenly Places In Christ Jesus!

Perhaps then, if we are non-believers in alien beings, flying saucers and all that stuff, we take the purely scientific view - that is to say, these hollow segments of the Moon MIGHT contain gas, derived from some geological activity aeons ago but trapped inside these cavities for all that time until now. The &quot;smoke cloud&quot; might then be a slow escape of gas into the vacuum at the Moon&#39;s surface.

Now, for those of us who do believe in alien beings, flying saucers and all that stuff, we might believe in all of the above mentioned possibilities - except for one. That one is the reason for the, &quot;smoke cloud.&quot; We might believe that there is something more than just gas inside these hollows.

( &quot;How auroras form. Auroras occur when charged particles (electrons and protons) collide with gases in Earth&#39;s upper atmosphere. Those collisions produce tiny flashes that fill the sky with colorful lights. As billions of flashes occur in sequence, the auroras appear to move or &quot; dance &quot; in the sky.&#39;) Although the Earth has a magnetic field, which is responsible for the Auroras. However, Boston University Center for Space Physics&#39; study 30 Sept 1991 states:   &quot;. . .our moon does indeed have an atmosphere consisting of some unusual gases, including sodium and potassium, which are not found in the atmospheres of Earth, Mars or Venus. It&#39;s an infinitesimal amount of air when compared to Earth&#39;s atmosphere. At sea level on Earth, we breathe in an atmosphere where each cubic centimeter contains 10,000,000,000,000,000,000 molecules; by comparison the lunar atmosphere has less than 1,000,000 molecules in the same volume.\r<br>Pretty thin soup.

Thousands of creatures can be reproduced from one creature. If one mosquito lays eggs, so many mosquitoes will come from that one mosquito. So, Whatever that has been created can be recreated using the same scientific formula. <br><br>If there is a tree,  there will be many trees. If there is a planet, there will be many planets. So, if one thing is created, it can be recreated and many versions of the same can be created. Everything created functions as per scientific laws embedded in nature. <br><br>What created the  scientific laws embedded in universe? What created all the things? If there is a creature, what made it a creature?  What makes the creature function as per scientific laws? Everything including neutrons and protons  function as per predetermined scientific laws only. What created these  scientific laws  should be above those scientific laws. What created scientific laws can&#39;t be controlled by the same scientific laws. Universe can&#39;t create what created the universe.<br><br>Scientific laws are applicable on all creatures and things. But, scientific laws won&#39;t work on a superior force which created scientific laws. We call that superior force which created universe and all its scientific laws as creator.

So, Whatever that has been created can be recreated using the same scientific formula. <br><br>If there is a tree,  there will be many trees. If there is a planet, there will be many planets.

He is returning very soon, but before He does, Satan, the devil, is coming to pretend to be Jesus/God. Satan is an angel, and he will have certain supernatural powers with which to try to fool everyone. He will, for example, be able to make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men. He will only be on earth a short time before the real King of Kings, Jesus Christ, God in the flesh, returns. When the real Jesus comes we will all be transformed into our spiritual bodies at the same moment. Jesus came in the flesh to offer forgiveness of sins and eternal life to anyone who believes and calls on His precious name!<br><br>if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. - Romans 10:9<br><br>Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper, There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always. For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her. - Matthew 26:6-13<br><br>Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.<br><br>To anoint your self, the sick, or a building for spiritual protection:<br>Get a small bottle of olive oil and pour off a small amount into a smaller vessel like a vial or baby food jar. Use the rest of the bottle for cooking. Ask the Lord to bless your vial of oil in Jesus name. Anoint yourself with the oil by placing a dab of oil on tip of finger and touch it to your forehead, and ask the Lord to bless you/heal you. Place a dab of oil on your finger and anoint the door posts and order all negativity and evil out of the house, and order that nothing negative or evil can enter into your home including piggybacking on a person entering, order it  to be so in the name of Jesus. Anoint all potential entrances to your home. To anoint the sick, place oil on tip of finger and touch it to the head of the sick and say a prayer of healing over them in Jesus name.
