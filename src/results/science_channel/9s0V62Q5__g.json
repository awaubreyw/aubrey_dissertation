For me, this is the very example of someone who does not respect nature, and place the man up in the food chain bit is what he believes ... All the snakes that manipulate in front of the camera, or on live recording , the snake only seeks to flee, flee, and flee! The human being, who prevents him, bars his way, lifts them with pliers, folds them back, yours by the tail, for beautiful shots in front of the camera.... Sometimes the snake finds himself so exhausted trying to escape that he no longer reacts to human proximity. Tell me which animals in the wild do this to humans ??? No one!!! Everyone gets scared and go a way far to human, on 90% of the time, and if one does not act stupidly, if he is not trapped, the option to escape is his first defensive reflex.<br>- [] for example, a wolf, or a hungry bear finds you in the virgin nature, in her environment, that you come face to face with your backpack, without effective weapons, totally surprised ...

He said the possibility of a bite was a very real part of life and this way if a child was bitten they had a far higher chance of survival. He also said that venom was used like a drug by older men and sometimes women as they knew exactly how much to &quot;use&quot; and that it was also used for a type of hallucinogen for &quot;religious ceremonies&quot; by the older tribesmen who had not converted to Christianity. He said that it was within days that the elders started him and his family on these &quot;snake scratches&quot; and that it was a terrifying thought but that they do not show you the process to prevent shock from fear and prevent raiding the heart rate etc. The reptile is held securely and placed under a cloth along with an extremity if the person being scratched.

Footage of him here:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDAaXQJ9BtU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDAaXQJ9BtU</a>   His booster shots contained the venom from a bunch of different species, though.  He survived mamba and king cobra bites and his hands were all gnarled up and he lost a finger from rattler bites.  He said he was on a respirator for the mamba bite, but that was probably 50 yrs ago.  I dunno if they even hand the antivenin for those back then.

I only feared two snakes, the puffadder because it&#39;s a lazy snake that will not move out of man&#39;s path like most snakes do and the infamous Black Mamba who truly put the fear of God in me, it can be very aggressive and has been known to chase people on occasion.. Oh and btw, the Mamba can grow to like 12-14 feet.. It can move almost as fast as a man can run at full sprint and God help you if it starts chasing you in the bush, in the bush a man will not out run a Mamba, if he can even see it coming in the first place and their poison will paralyze you within half an hour, on top of that I think it&#39;s the world&#39;s most fastest striking snake.. In other words a pure killer, big, strong, highly venomous, very fast, super aggressive and it&#39;s hard to kill.. In the Drakensberg Mountains when I went hiking I actually jump over a puff adder because I though it was an old belt laying in the middle of my path, it tried to bite up and get me but i cleared it with a mighty jump.. When I was in Malalane, I witnessed this HUGH Black Mamba sun bathing on this giant rock where I was sun bathing the day before and just looking at that snake filled me with pure terror.. By the time I got back to America, I couldn&#39;t take black widows or rattle snakes too seriously anymore cause honestly you&#39;ll probably going to survive it..
