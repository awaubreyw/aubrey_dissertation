They are cloaked you see through them but when the sun and moon have halo your looking through one... Or a few like a scope. Our Sky gets unheard of now adays. Cloudy days are simple to see.

Why are there no photos or videos of Hubble or Kepler space telecopes in their orbits?<br>2.Why has neither space telescope ever trained their lenses on the old Moon landing sites to illustrate the old equipment left behind? PR on that would be limitless, if they could have, they would have, the problem is we never went.<br>3. Why has neither space telescope taken any pics of Earth? Hubble is 354 miles in orbit but we still only have composite CGI Photos and Kelper at 75 million miles away, zero pics, we should have some awesome pic of Earth, 1,000&#39;s of pics but we have NONE. There shouldn&#39;t be any reason to have composite, cut and pasted pics, because of the distance, Kepler is simply not really out there, neither is Hubble, at best, they are 40,000 ft altitude plane platform systems, nothing in space.<br>4. Why don&#39;t we have any 180 or 360 degree video pannig of &quot;any&quot; space walk? From Skylab to the ISS, to the entire space shuttle program, there is NO video footage of this kind, there is no docking video of shuttles, there is no egress or hatch entry, exits. We don&#39;t have any video of a 100% video uninterrupted fro launch to docking.......ever.<br>5. Satellites.....Some say we have as many as 10,000 satellites from communication, GPS, military etc. Why then on a full Moon with a nice, fairly expensive civilian telescope do we never see satellite transits moving in front of the Moon? With 10,000 satellites, you&#39;d be seeing a few hundred transits at bare minimum on an entire full moon night of watching and monitoring very closely, there are ZERO transits......ever.<br>6.

We now know the Apollo astronauts would of needed 6 feet of lead shielding to survive, the electronics would be toast, extremely easily.<br><br>There are a host of more completely rational, scientifically accurate questions that NASA can&#39;t answer without assuming we&#39;re morons.
