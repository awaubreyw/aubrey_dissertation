I remember those day my mom had to make a small mud patch in the garden to germinate the rice. My father and the water Buffalo did the ploughing to prepare the field. Once they\u2019re big enough, she brought them to the field and plant them by hands. <br>Every couple days, she would bring me to those field and we together pulled up the water with this tool ( note sure what it called anymore, it\u2019s like a cone shape bucket with strings on both side, 2 people each hold 2 strings attached to top and bottom of the cone and scope up the water from tiny runnel to water the rice paddy. On dry season, sometimes we had to do it from one runnel to the next to gather enough water for small paddy). <br>it took months of manual watering, weeding, etc\u2026 for the rice to be ready for harvest. If that\u2019s on hot day, my parent would cut the rice overnight to avoid the extreme heat. There\u2019s no fancy tool, just small sickle and lots of sweats, they tied them in bunches, carried them to the wood trailer. I had seen some farmer carried so much rice that the back of their neck and shoulder swollen up like they got a baseball inside. <br>Once the trailer is fulled, my father would be the one who pull it while other pushed from behind to bring the rice home, then back to the field and repeat until all rice was transported back. At home, they use this tool looked like wooden nunchucks to wrap each bunch of rice and hit it on a slab of stone until most the rice fall off the plant, any left would be manually pull off by us kids. The rice then would be sun dry for couple days. As kids, our job would be this easy part of watching out for rain and turn the rice by dragging our feet though it every once in a while to make sure the rice got completely dry for storage. Everyday just scooping out the rice, sun dry them, and scoop them back in at the end was enough to build 6 packs lol. If we goofed and not paying attention to the sky, we could loose it all with some sudden rain. <br>Once dried, my mom would use flat big bamboo tray to screen out stuffs like empty husk, straws, dirt. First she used the biggest circle tray, possibly 4-5ft diameter, this one was tightly weaved, no holes to flip the rice back and forth, the bad one or empty husk usually lighter would gather in one end and she would throw them aside to use as burning material for the kitchen later. Then she transferred the good one to smaller  ones with some holes on bottoms to screen out the rocks, dirt or other debris. <br>All that done, we could finally store the rice. If we need to use it, my mom would have to bring out this huge tool that\u2019s like a giant form of mortar and pestle to de-husk the rice. Rice was put inside a huge stone hole, the adult would use their feet to step on one end of a log which connected to a big pestle . When they stepped on the end, the pestle would raise up and they released the pressure, the pestle would hit the rice and remove the husk. This again would go through screening process to separate the eatable rice, husk and bran. Brand would be used for the animal food, husk for burning material. <br>Some years when the weather was tough, we could loose all the crop right before harvest. Imagine working with promised pay by the end of the year and all went down the without any warning. Im glad, my parents don\u2019t have to work like that anymore.", "comment_date": "2022-08-22T03:09:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kingdave IV", "comment_text": "Where does the rejected go?", "comment_date": "2022-08-21T13:47:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uce60\uc721\uc774\uc624\uc77c \uc2a4\uce74\uc5d0\uc787\uce58", "comment_text": "S.korea&#39;s rice is better than Jp", "comment_date": "2022-08-21T12:59:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mira veta", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ray8LsGvvgQ&amp;t=2m00s\">2:00</a> that&#39;s disgustingly wasteful.

The early Americans of George Washington&#39;s time, predominantly those in the former southern colonies, ate rice in addition to bread and potatoes.  But somehow rice fell out of favor and was largely forgotten save for the rare locale like New Orleans.  Rice became an odd food associated with Asian Peoples.  For Asians, rice was the stuff of life and death for thousands of years.  Asians didn&#39;t have the luxury of rejecting rice crops because they found bugs.  These impurities were just shifted out manually.  Rice wasn&#39;t just food, it was a money commodity.  Like ye olde England and western Europe, farmers paid their land rents in rice or wheat.  Often the rents were harsh and exorbitantly high.  The English landlords took almost all the wheat grown in Ireland as rent.  Irish farmers grew potatoes on spare land and ate that while handing over all their wheat to the landowners.  In medieval Japan it got almost as worse at times with avaricious daimyo (aristocratic landlords) confiscating two-thirds or even more of their tenant farmers&#39; rice crops.  Rice in the Far East was often distributed around like money.  In ancient and medieval China the emperors tried to ensure taxes in the form of rice crops were not exorbitant and confiscatory, the doctrine of Confucianism and Neo-Confucianism being behind this.  But even this was often bypassed in years of poor crops and crop failures.<br>California became a major rice producer despite its semi-arid, chaparral, Mediterranean climate.  This technique is known as dry rice farming.  It doesn&#39;t require the vast amounts of water necessary in the Far East.  Machines do the watering and are programmed to water the rice crops just when they need the water.<br>People still think of rice as a predominantly Northeast Asian staple of the Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Southeast Asians, Philippines, so forth.  Yet rice feeds the 1.3 billion people of India.  Southern Italy and Sicily also grow rice although few people know that.<br>In recent years doctors determined that rice consumption is not good for elderly people.  Rice has high glucose content, which is why it makes for good rice wine, popular in China, Korea, and Japan, which calls it, sake.  It&#39;s not good for diabetics.  When asked of elderly Asian People whether they could tolerate giving up rice consumption for their health, a common response was, I&#39;d rather die than give up rice eating.", "comment_date": "2022-03-21T02:52:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zikki Charade", "comment_text": "No washing?", "comment_date": "2022-03-20T12:14:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sukreet Subba", "comment_text": "Yall throw the entire batch if a bug is found...
