Drywell fuse holders are made of strands of fiberglass instead of sheets, but they\u2019re wound around a steel mandrel just like these poles. Of course we wind them to be thicker, with a different mixture of resin and different baking times and temps so they\u2019re rigid instead of flexible.", "comment_date": "2022-04-15T01:36:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BPollard86", "comment_text": "let me run down the road with a car suspension spring so I can yeet over a wall.", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T02:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Samuel", "comment_text": "As a pole vaulter and huggbees fan.
