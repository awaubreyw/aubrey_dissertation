I have a young nephew who asked two questions in particular that we looked up online and found that although it seems that the questions have been before they have been answered in the laziest fashion possible.  The first question &quot;Why can&#39;t planes fly into space?&quot;, he understands that planes need air for lift and controlled flight and oxygen for the engines to produce thrust, as do most people. Knowing this I understood that what he really means is couldn&#39;t someone just add rockets and a reaction control system to a jet and fly into space. But as we looked online including on YouTube all we found was videos, some ridiculously longer than they need to be that said the same basic thing I said in one sentence, the need for air for lift and controlled flight and oxygen to produce thrust. None of them thought to go any farther, and think maybe there was more to the question than what a three-year-old might ask and I would like to know why? The second question he asked that baffles me that no one really answered since it seems both relevant and obvious is &quot;Why don&#39;t electric car makers put gasoline or other fuel generators in their cars so while you drive it recharges the battery once the charge gets low and once you have a full charge shut off?&quot;. Looking that up we found a lot of things about hybrids and range extenders but nothing about the question asked? It seems that many channels go out of their way to avoid the question altogether and we can&#39;t understand why? The question is clearly about a system that is not a range extender hybrid like the BMW Rex or the Chevy Volt or the Prius nor is it about the system the Fisker Karma has where for some reason you have a gas generator that creates electricity that then powers the car when the battery charge runs out but does not recharge the batteries while driving. I am sorry this comment is so long and yes I am asking the same thing to all the science channels I come across so you are not alone, but I just do not understand why so many of them including those that do deep dives into very difficult subjects seems to treat those two questions with what can only be termed intellectual laziness?", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T23:16:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "VIDEOHEREBOB", "comment_text": "I had no idea faucets were made in glass.
