I met God the Father behind a gray screen. In the years since then he continues to speak. Here is what I know about UAP from the other side.  There are endless numbers of civilizations throughout the universe. Not all look like us but many do.  The earth is the only civilization that rejected His Son.  All others accepted his love and his representation of the Father wholeheartedly.  As the universe is made of light and dark, it is also made of good and evil.  All evil God the Father has confined to the limits of the earth.  All the other civilizations passed the test, we did not.  Now enters UAP.  As is the universe, there are both good and evil UAP.  Evil UAP are manufactured by pure evil fallen angels. They are capable of deception, such as good, light, other worldly experiences and many other falsehoods.  That is why the beings that have been here look like clones. Only God can create real humans with a body, soul and spirit. It is also why they slaughter animals and have had human abductions. They are trying to duplicate our God-given bodies, souls and spirits. God&#39;s beings from other worlds would never treat us badly. Now the good UAP.  These are permitted by God the Father and Him alone to visit here. Jesus said that &quot;In the last days there would be signs in the heavens.&quot;  Good beings sent by God whether angels or His other civilizations with advanced technology have one thing in common. They would never do anything unloving because God is love.  Some God-given UAP are permitted to come here to humble the White House, Moscow world leaders and military technology.  That is because God humbles the haughty and exalts the lowly. That is why Jesus was Resurrected and exalted after the humiliation of the crucifixion.  If a UAP humbles military people, jet fighters and the human race with their technology, then that is good.  If UAP abducts, abuses, pinches, draws blood, crashes air craft, kills people, etc. they are not from advanced civilizations. They are mastered by evil in the universe confined to earthly realms.

Personally I don&#39;t believe in the lightspeed barrier. The light speed barrier only restrict Aether perturbation modalities. Wave phenomena in water has a speed restriction, as does sound through air, as does radiation Through The Ether. The Ancients had it right period As Above So Below, translation everything mimics the part made of. When they mentioned speed of light as being the ultimate speed limit, they do this without any knowledge of what light is. Would you make wave in water it is still just water. When you make a sound in air it is still just are or whatever physical matter it is the carries the sound. EMF is the same thing. Life itself there&#39;s nothing more then the medium that carries it... this is called the either.

There are three little words that are the culmination of my research over the last 15 -20 years, and those three words are GRAVITY CONTROLS TIME and I might add, it has been verified that those three little words make a very true statement. First off we are reliably informed by the Hubble Telescope staff that the rate of recessional expansion at the edge of our Universe is exceeding the speed of light. Now, this is in some respects a form of gravitational illusion as it involves time changes caused by changes in the gravitational value. But for a proper explanation read on. The matter at the edge of our Universe expands into a much greater volume of space causing the matter to thin out or dilute, and a reduction in matter concentration will always result in lower gravity and lower gravity means faster time. This phenomenon has a BUT and that BUT is But, where is the observer situated. Answer the Hubble Telescope (home observer). The effect is in evidence at the position where the Hubble Telescope is focused namely at the edge of the expanding Universe (away Observer), when seen by an observer at the telescope (home observer), because the observer is situated within the time frame of the telescope and the effect is seen at the edge of the expanding Universe that is within that local low gravity time frame, he will see the fast-tracking time frame. To add to this almost indescribable effect, consider the problem associated with not one but all of the GPS satellites around the Earth. Every one of the satellites has an elevated time frame because the position of the satellites is 400 miles above the Earth and the Earth\u2019s gravity following the inverse square law results in a much lower gravity with the corresponding speed up in the passage of time at the orbit of the satellite. Lastly, look at the Black hole which is well known for the very high event Horizon gravity and it is no surprise that the time frame is extremely slow. We call this effect Time Dilation but the expression is totally ambiguous and I prefer \u2018time slows\u2019 or \u2018time increases\u2019. Now for the hard bit. The speed of light as seen from afar seems normal when in actual fact it can be faster or slower depending upon the time frame and the position of the observer. As the light from a far distant and slower time frame (time runs slower), travels to the Earth, it will conform to the time frame that is actual for its dimensional position and the gravity at that position. The light approaches the earth and enters the Earth\u2019s gravity field where it will then be under the Earth&#39;s One G gravity and be at normal light speed(300Mm/s) within our time frame. Light Photons or Quanta have mass because they are affected by gravity (no mass no event horizon, no deviation). Because of this mass, any time frame will set its own time with respect to gravity, but the mass of the photon will set the top limit of its speed. In essence, the speed of light is not a constant but a variable. I then found that I had to alter Einstein\u2019s famous Equation to read E=Mv^2 which is compatible with Kinetic energy E^k= \u00bd MV^2  and the follow-on is that Kinetic energy is always exactly half of a body in motion and the same as the energy of a body at rest.", "comment_date": "2021-04-25T20:30:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Denis Vandale", "comment_text": "Appear to be!", "comment_date": "2021-04-25T20:11:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rhonda Strange", "comment_text": "Maybe the rest of space hasn&#39;t realized that it&#39;s breaking the law", "comment_date": "2021-04-25T20:00:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Frost", "comment_text": "and I thought my ex-wife&#39;s cooking traveld fast.", "comment_date": "2021-04-25T18:19:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Nichols", "comment_text": "Faster than light.

First of all... Things moveing away from you fast than light travels would never be viewable because the image it gave off would be travelling away from you and never reach you.  Einstien said that to travel faster than light you would have to get to your destination before you departed.  Meaning light is a standing waive with zero resistance and infinite speed.  He said you cant get to your destination before you start your journey.  Therefore travelling faster than light is impossible.  So objects moveing away from us at the speed of light appear to be going faster than the speed of light if we are also moveing away from them.  The space cannot grow faster than the speed of light though.  Because the speed of light is instantanious.  That is why we could see the objects moving away.  Because the speed of light is actually infinite in empty space.  No matter what speed the object is moveing the light shining off it will still reach us in that very instant.

That means cattle on feed will eat twice as much as normal, then they will emit twice as much methane gas as before. Methane is a brown house gas which is 5 times more destructive to climate change than great house gases.

E=mc2 is DIRECTLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY DERIVED FROM F=ma. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ACCORDINGLY, the rotation of THE MOON MATCHES it&#39;s revolution. THE MOON is the universal expression OR manifestation of THE SUN AND THE EARTH (IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY ! Consider the fully brightened AND setting MOON in DIRECT comparison with what is the FLAT, SETTING, AND ORANGE SUN (with the SPACE around it THEN going invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE).

GRAVITY AND/ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. OVERLAY what is THE EYE in BALANCED RELATION to/WITH what is THE EARTH. Consider what is the SEMI-SPHERICAL, TRANSLUCENT, QUANTUM GRAVITATIONAL, AND BLUE SKY. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Most importantly, the ultimate unification (AND UNDERSTANDING) of physics/physical experience combines, BALANCES, and includes opposites. The curvature or shape of THIS MOON NECESSARILY MATCHES that of the EARTH/GROUND (given a clear horizon, of course). MOREOVER, the COMPOSITION of lunar rocks IS practically IDENTICAL to that of EARTH rocks. Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the SPEED OF LIGHT; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. THOUGHTS ARE INVISIBLE. ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY electromagnetic/gravitational IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This is, in fact, CLEARLY proven by BOTH F=ma AND E=mc2. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. The INTEGRATED EXTENSIVENESS of THOUGHT (AND description) is improved in the truly superior mind. It ALL makes perfect sense. The DOME of a person&#39;s EYE is ALSO VISIBLE. NOW, consider the black space of THE EYE as well. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/AS what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. The balance of being AND EXPERIENCE is ESSENTIAL. The viscosity of LAVA IS BETWEEN that of WATER AND THE EARTH/GROUND. Water comes from THE EYE, AND this ORANGE SUN is manifest at what is EYE LEVEL/BODY HEIGHT. NOW, consider the role or RELATION of what is THE EYELID. The experience of THE EYE of what is the ORANGE SUN is equivalent (ON BALANCE) to/with what is the EARTH/GROUND/LAVA. Now, the fully brightened (or illuminated) AND setting MOON (along WITH it&#39;s white LIGHT) is the relational and BALANCED TOTALITY that then matches the form or manifestation of the EARTH AND/AS LAVA, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

Dreams make thought MORE LIKE sensory experience in general, thereby improving upon memory AND UNDERSTANDING. Indeed, the ability of THOUGHT to DESCRIBE OR RECONFIGURE sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which THOUGHT IS SIMILAR TO sensory experience. (THOUGHTS ARE INVISIBLE.) It is a very great truth that THE SELF represents, FORMS, and experiences a COMPREHENSIVE approximation of experience in general by combining conscious and unconscious experience.<br><br>Objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

Recent test on light traveling through something as innocuous as a jar indicates that Shadows created by the Light start to appear before the light has gotten to it.

So for anyone wondering how this could be possible without interstellar aliens and warp drives... <br><br>They&#39;re not moving faster than the speed of light. They just appear to be because the space between us is expanding. Every light year of intergalactic space between us is independently stretched, so every light year of expanding space between us seems to add to the object&#39;s relative velocity. Beyond a certain point, that makes it appear as if distant galaxies are moving away from us faster than the speed of light. But the fact that we&#39;re still observing the beam of photons they emit proves that they&#39;re not actually traveling away from us faster than light. If they were, we wouldn&#39;t be observing them in the first place. Their light would never catch up to us. <br><br>The way we account for that is by reasoning that the distance the object&#39;s light actually traveled to reach us is shorter than the distance we observe. If that were the case we&#39;d expect to see the wavelength of its light stretched by the expansion of the space it was traveling through. Basically, the wavelengths of light it emits should be longer than the wavelengths we observe from nearby galaxies. And that&#39;s exactly what we see. The wavelengths of light emitted by distant galaxies are all shifted to the red end of the spectrum. The end of the spectrum with longer wavelengths. <br><br> It&#39;s not actually moving faster than light, and the fact that we can still observe its light proves that its light didn&#39;t actually travel the full distance we observe. If it were actually moving away from us faster than light, we wouldn&#39;t be able to observe the object at all. The stream of photons emitted by the object would never have made it to us. The only way to account for the fact that we are still observing the light those objects emit is to assume that when the beam of light from that distant object left on it&#39;s way to us, the distance between us was shorter, and the light w<br>Every light year of space between us is expanding independently, so the further away an object is, the faster it appears to be moving away from us. Beyond a certain point, the distance between two objects on opposite ends of the observable universe starts to appear greater than the distance light could have traveled in the time it would take the light to get from point a to point b. But the light itself isn&#39;t actually traveling that entire distance. It left on its journey to us billions of years ago, when the distance between us wasn&#39;t so great.

Just like some of those &quot;ufo&#39;s the eyes aren&#39;t seeing but radar is, other times we see things and radar doesn&#39;t&quot; S.

Anything past the speed of light is beyond the knowledge that we can fore see.  Seeing distant moving Galaxies was according to scientist was a shot in the dark.   One of the greatest of Hubble&#39;s deep field telescope functioning creations.  I doubt galaxies are traveling the speed of light but that are probably moving quite fast though.  You know as well as I do, they&#39;ve been doing this all along, we just chose to glance in a part of the universe that opened a window to some more knowledge to talk about.  Something that would be talked about and theorized for a long time to come.  Time, space and speed of traveling in this Massive universe could be possible but we may be just viewing things in telescopic warp speed sight only.   Remember, the Hubble is reaching billions of light years into the future or the past of the Universe.  To see other Galaxies in the deep field was just a devastating thing to see or even try to imagine.  Oooo the scientific theorist came alive.  You know that time stands still for anything that approaches light speed.  As if that object weren&#39;t even moving. The same effect when you are in an aircraft when things below seem to be almost standing still but the aircraft is surging ahead at unheard of speeds with powerful engines pushing it forward.   The Hubble was in essence seeing the past.   Of course there is no resistance in outer space in a vacuum so speed can be said to be relevant to the force in which it was originally propelled at in the beginning of the big bang.   It would&#39;ve be a ridiculous amount of speed.  Since light is the first result of the big bang, it is then assumed that things can&#39;t go faster than that speed. Light itself was a reference of speed.  Since we cannot see past the speed of light itself, then it is relevant to say that there is no speed beyond the speed of light.  Speed of light just allows us with our human eyes to see things that weren&#39;t possible.   Yes, the warp of space time could be causing us to see things that seem to moving faster than the speed of light.  It&#39;s only the warps in space time that gives us the gift of seeing the other galaxies.  A fact that we&#39;ll go on trying to wonder about life on those other Galaxies.

If that same gun is on a plane traveling at 1000fps and fires a bullet forward in the direction of travel at a velocity of 2500fps then the bullet is traveling at 3500fps as relative to the earth.  If the gun were to fire the bullet at a velocity of 2500fps rearward to the direction of travel then it would be traveling at a velocity of 1500fps as relative to the earth.<br><br>On a galactic scale, say you have a really really big spool of string stretched between two planets, each in separate galaxies with each moving at near the perceived speed of light in directions opposite each other.  The light from the one galaxy can never reach the other galaxy because the galaxies are moving away from each other at greater than what we perceive to be the speed of light.  But yet the string stretched between planets in each of those galaxies is being spooled out at a rate near twice what we perceive to be the speed of light.  Does the string then become unable to be seen by an observer on that planet because it&#39;s being spooled out at near twice the speed of light?  Would the string cease to exist because to exist it must be spooling out at near twice the perceived speed of light?  If the string doesn&#39;t cease to exist then it&#39;s not accurate to say nothing can travel faster than light.<br><br>At the even horizon of a black hole, it&#39;s currently perceived that there is a point where light escapes and then a point when light doesn&#39;t escape because of intense gravity.  What about light near the event horizon, but yet not so near it cannot escape at reduced velocity, it just barely escapes?  Photons escaping from being near the event horizon at say 5000fps?  Once getting further away from the event horizon, escaping it&#39;s influence, do those photons then accelerate themselves up to 186,000mps?  If so where do they get the energy to accelerate from 5000fps to 186,000mps?  Or do these photons remain at a velocity of 5000fps?  What about light traveling towards the event horizon?  Wouldn&#39;t it then accelerate by magnitudes as it gets closer to the event horizon?<br><br>Just as the medium a bullet travels through effects it&#39;s velocity, so to the medium light travels through must also effect it&#39;s velocity.  Also if the velocity of the point of origin effects the velocity of a bullet, so to must the velocity of the point of origin also effect the velocity of light.<br><br>As relative to different perspectives?  What perspectives?  There&#39;s countless trillions of different perspectives.  Somewhere there is a galaxy we will never see because it is moving away from this galaxy at a speed greater than the perceived speed of light.  This planet we are on is traveling at greater than the perceived speed of light, not only to the perspective of an observer in a galaxy moving away from us at greater than the perceived speed of light, but also to our perspective because we can&#39;t see the galaxy moving away from us as greater than the perceived speed of light.<br><br>I believe it&#39;s only accurate to say light travels at a certain speed under certain conditions, as the conditions change, so does the speed of light, thus there is no set speed of light because conditions are always changing.<br><br>Also because of the string thought experiment I believe it&#39;s false to say nothing can travel faster than light.", "comment_date": "2020-08-12T15:49:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "brett run", "comment_text": "Here\u2019s a very simple way to describe it:  If you\u2019re moving in one direction at the speed of light and I\u2019m moving in the opposite direction at the speed of light we are moving away from each other at twice the speed of light.

World War Vladimir Vladimir Putin was born in the 20th century he was a poor child or infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until 2036 he is the current dictator of Russia and antichrist (mentally ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or protests including that of racism among others in the world. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, it is necessary to apply the corrective of ending once and for all the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that if they have them active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Cayman Island , VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, \u05e7\u05d4\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d4\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05ea (HEBREW- ISRAEL) among others, since they are a breeding ground for the allied demons or helpers of the 21st century antichrist and these assistant demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine PAPA of the Catholic Church Francisco, director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkey empire, Iran empire, failed Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator from VENEZUELA, Nicolas Mature Moors, who has $ 5,000,000,000 badly deposited in the Vatican bank, not including the billions of ill-gotten dollars that they constantly deposit in their anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc.&quot; A small part is sold to the aforementioned demons, helpers of the 21st century antichrist, but really Most of that wealth is sold primarily NOT to Russia, but directly to the current 21st-century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the 21st century antichrist and all of his &quot;demon helpers including Nicolas Mature Moors- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use it to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or generally harm or subdue the humanity. In this world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the uncovering as a state secret of the INTERNET since currently it is not only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the ocean floor with the INTERNET nothing is hidden . And the 3rd. An event is the uncovering of humanity that will be announced no later than MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not alone the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the lost link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. Always IF there will be only wars: &quot;conventional like all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will come later to this in order to either unfairly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there are more old or elderly population alive than young population and also due to the bad manipulation of batteries as the capitalist communist republic CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. From there, comes my theory that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there were more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear Hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal, plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why, from there, we must end various myths that seem childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the dinosaurs were accidentally extinguished by a huge meteorite that crashed into the earth millions of years ago, what really happened is that the aliens annihilated or they modified the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem, 2) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God already that our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 3) That oil came or is produced by the extinction of all dinosaurs due to a huge meteorite that collided or is it crashed into the earth, since oil has existed since the planet earth was formed, since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Rock Oil or Crack and buried at high depths, the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of crack oil Due to the high temperatures and pressure under the ground or at the bottom of the sea, it becomes liquid or molten, as is the case with iron at the surface level. terrestrial or in mountains and far from the nucleus of the earth is in solid form the iron instead in the center of the earth of iron-nickel is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that there is creating the famous magnetic field that protect us from gamma radiation and neutrons that comes from space especially from the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of dinosaurs, then I ask, could it be that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or pure-bred dinosaurs lived only in the north sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ?. In our universe there are asteroids that not only contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; but also oil in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of rock or crack oil are held by the USA whose technology to melt or exploit it has been transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have enormous amounts of crack or rock oil and this reserves of stone or crack oil. The US exceeds the liquid oil reserves of VENEZUELA and other OPEC countries. 4) That there is fresh water on the Earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since below the Earth&#39;s surface there are huge reservoirs of fresh water, as in various comets, planets and asteroids are sources of supply of frozen fresh water. 5) That man did not go, did not step on, or has not reached the moon, since on 07/15/1969 the moon did arrive and colonize and in the late 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology TR-3 Black Manta plane- U.S.A. 6) Due to a missile impact on 03/08/2014, MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as stated or confessed on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of a possible pandemic like that of the covid-19. 7) That it was by chance the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska airspace in Siberia- RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What really happened is that the 10,000-year-old alien artifact black knight orbiting the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired an energy beam at him to avoid further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile get close to or orbit near it. There is a recently discovered trace that in our ancestor more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced extraterrestrial technologies. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for: Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction and nothing by chance. And the myths or legends before me mentioned and others more including the mysteries of the big bang of the universe and those related to the Most Holy Jesus of Nazareth since he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resurrection will be answered or revealed more precisely by aliens for being direct witnesses or participants for millions of years of the evolutionary events of planet earth.", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T21:58:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Eliot", "comment_text": "Speed of Thought?", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T20:29:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aman Peace", "comment_text": "You know we fuxx up when others galaxy run away from earth", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T16:27:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Hutchins", "comment_text": "Simple...

They have already been able to stop light and speed it up 30 times faster than it is presumed to normally travel, thus light does not have a constant speed, only the observable speed we see as it passes through our solar system. Plus when you add in the fact that the &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot; violates the laws of physics, specifically the laws of Motion, Centrifugal Force and the Conservational Law of Angular Momentum, it is impossible for these fidiot scientists to figure out the truth when the very basis of their theories are already skewed. IF the &quot;Big Bang&quot; were true, all the planets in our solar system would all be rotating the same way, but Saturn spins backwards and Neptune spins on its side. WAKE UP!! Like it or not, this is a CREATED existence, NOT an &quot;accident&quot;. Evolution and the Big Bang Theory is for people who want to be &quot;god&quot; and can&#39;t stomach the idea that the job is already taken and they can&#39;t just do whatever they want per their own self-desires!!!<br>A way to look at it be re-writing Genesis with &quot;scientific terminology&quot; ; In the beginning the Creator made our Physical Existence (&quot;Heaven&quot; singular, if you&#39;re going to make something, you have to have somewhere to put it if it is going to be different from where you already are, the place we refer to as the &quot;spiritual&quot; level of existence) and Matter (the &quot;earth&quot;) and it was without form and empty because matter cannot take shape or hold itself together alone. And darkness was upon the matter because energy had not been introduced to the system yet. &quot;Let there be light&quot; means once all matter/building blocks were made, then He could start making things and putting the verb of movement and life into it. So matter became energized and with that it started to move, starting what we call &quot;Time&quot; and thus matter could then exist in States per the volume of energy contained within. He put thing into place where He wanted them to be, charged up the system and let everything take off like pulling the string on a top and let it take off spinning do it&#39;s thing. After this, everything is referred to as Heavens Plural. and once the flood happened which broke down the protective canopy over the earth, He stretched out the heavens to move all these harmful energies away from us because we were no longer protected from the amazing and violent energies that are just recently being discovered outside the heliosphere of our solar system by the Voyager satellites. This is why there is the &quot;Red Shift&quot; is because everything is being pulled away by the Maker of this vast expanse we call the &quot;Universe&quot; Uni=single, verse=spoken sentence. We live in a single spoken sentence, a &quot;Uni-verse&quot;.

Evolution is for those who want to control everything around them, and their religion fails them. YES, &quot;evolution&quot; is a RELIGION because there is NO science that proves it, evolution thinking has NEVER contributed one advancement in science, and numerous scientists today are finally coming out and saying that in the next 100 years, the people of the future will look back on this generation as the butt of all jokes about how stupid people were to believe such impossible bullshit!!!! I do not support religions, only a relationship with our Maker, which is no different than respecting your own father.

The things that we call impossible?, Or simply things that we have not yet seen, but will see sometime in the future. Throughout human history there have been barriers that were supposedly unbreakable or laws that were unattainable. In the dark ages they thought the earth is flat, but Columbus proved it was round, for years nobody can figure out what chapters to the earth until Isaac Newton came along. For decades they said the sound barrier could never be broken, it was broken, warp speed, or if you prefer, faster than light travel, is simply yet another obstacle for humanity to overcome, and we will. It has already been broken, albeit using microscopic particles, but regardless, the lightspeed barrier can be broken, it\u2019s simply a matter of time before we overcome this next obstacle in our path. Nothing is more indomitable than the human quest for knowledge and to obtain the unobtainable, it is what distinguishes us from the rest of the animal kingdom, and we will not stop until we get what we want. I believe the bigger question is, Are we truly ready for the rigours of interstellar space travel? Just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must, humanity is nowhere near ready to face what we may find out they\u2019re awaiting us, and this isn\u2019t because of what I\u2019ve seen on Star Trek, it\u2019s simple logic. There are billions of galaxies out there, each one containing billions of planets, the loss of statistics state that we cannot be The only intelligent life out there, although judging from what\u2019s been going on in the last few weeks, I wouldn\u2019t call it intelligent either. Humanity at the moment is far too arrogant and too primitive, and is nowhere near ready to face what we may encounter. Our society needs to evolve much further before we can even consider FTL travel. Despite our advancing technology, we are so primitive in our way of thinking, we still cannot resolve the simplest conflicts between nations, how in gods name do you propose we resolve conflicts with another species that we may or may not encounter in the vast reaches of outer space?

Boy, it took them a while. Just please don&#39;t call them UFO but UAP. If they ask me nicely, I will call the five UFO&#39;s my friends and I saw, any way they want.

Dr Steven Greer has been front and center of this crusade for years, and he and his team has had fascinating contact stories. True enough, if they were malignant, we&#39;d be kissing their alien butt for the past millennia, so instead, the military has repeated for decades that they don&#39;t know what it is, but they want to reassure us that UFO&#39;s &quot;don&#39;t present a threat to National Security&quot;.  And, that means that FTL travel is totally possible. &quot;Impossible! Einstein says...&quot;  Did you know that the prestigious Lord Kevin in late 1800&#39;s declined an invitation to be part of a newly formed Royal Aeronautical Society (1860) because he didn&#39;t believe that any craft heavier than air, could fly?

Proof of it, is when you shoot a duck, it sure drops out of the sky. Can&#39;t fly no more &#39;cause it&#39;s dead.

The theory is that the ships system would magnify a spot in space, bend the space time and instantaneously teleport the object to that spot. The apparatus could reboot in 12 milliseconds to do it again. They went into further detail on how the apparatus was able to do this. Knowing how it did it was the easy part, finding sufficient amounts of element 115 is pretty difficult. This is the main component in the apparatus, and shooting protons at it will create element 116. The 116 immediately disintegrates leaving antimatter.

I went to get my camera and they were gone but the 3 people with me spotted them when I pointed to then.  There are all kind of alien life out there. These 3 craft could have had 500 thousand aliens in them each or more or 500 or 1000 smaller saucers.  In each one. My wife with 7 friends and old boyfriend had a travis Walton type close encounter without the tractor beam abduction. Boyfriend confirmed twice when I interviewed him.  And my great uncle was at Roswell in the weeks after they took the crash to Wright Patterson airbase. They didnt take everything ! A couple scraps remained ! I heard about that when I was a boy in the 1970s and in 1995 he told me himself. Said he and the base commander used the pieces for target practice with a 45 Thompson machine gun and the 45 slugs didnt put a scratch on the stuff. 45 is weak comparatively but still interesting. A 223 armor piercing steel core would be impressive but they didnt have those in 47. anyway, no buhler schit. But i wouldn&#39;t believe it necessarily if i read it in a youtube comment myself.

At these speeds the clouds nearly keep pace with the light they emit as they move towards Earth, so when the light finally reaches us, the motion appears much more rapid than the speed of light.

It varies depending on the density of the space it is moving through.  Space has some density, which is variable.  The space fabric close to large bodies like stars is very thin, minimally dense due to the presence of so much matter, which &quot;heats&quot; (radiation-wise) the space fabric around it, thinning it out and reducing its density.  Conversely, areas of space which do not have stars are &quot;cooler&quot; (radiation-wise), and the fabric of space is more dense in those regions.  Light travelling through pockets of less dense space will travel faster, while light travelling through pockets of denser space will move more slowly.  The speed of light is variable.

For all things beyond that horizon, there is a sufficient quantity of space between us and them that that space is expanding faster than light can traverse it. Light leaves those objects and races toward us, but as it does so, the distance remaining at each moment never decreases. It goes up and up.

They also say the universe started here, there and everywhere,they also claim, there is an edge how do they know this.If theirs a edge, then our come, it&#39;s at the beginning of the universe and not the middle time of the universe and not the start. Estimated to be almost 15,000 million light years in diameter, then if the universe exploded everywhere, then the edge is as old has the centre,middle ground and all the edge&#39;s rims. We know out solar system form over 8,000  million years from a supernova dust cloud and then to clumps together over hundreds millions years, we have no analysis of this exploding star how big it was and how old it was. Was the star 10 or 40 times bigger than a star now and where in this quadrant of stars was our stella a nursery... I like to think around problems, I see questions in 3 dimensions, not 2 dimensions.

This is particularly true if the mass of an object diminishes as it approaches the speed of light or even more abstract if the mass is less than 0. We all know that E=mc**2. If we approach the speed of light, it would seem that it takes more and more energy to accelerate an object, because we know that the weight of a thing does not vary. But is there any reason to believe that weight and mass have a consistent relationship? Weight is defined by the gravitational effect on an object. Mass is not.  If the mass decreases the faster it goes, mass eventually is zero (or perhaps less than zero under certain conditions). So if the mass is zero, then we have E=0*c**2 or in essence, it may take less and less energy to accelerate the object. Other equations from Einstein and others provide more details on this subject and support this conjecture. Experimental results may also support this. If we can see objects moving faster than the speed of light using the Hubble, then there must be some explanation for this. Scientists who claim that the speed of light is a limiting factor are correct if an object has mass (or even worse has more mass if it is accelerating near the speed of light), but since we can observe objects in space moving faster than the speed of light and we have done so for 0ver 50 years now, there must be some reason that these observations are valid.", "comment_date": "2018-07-22T19:51:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Topa joka", "comment_text": "This guys here?

Being Edwin Hubble&#39;s apprentice he was there at the &quot;birth&quot;of the possibility that red shift  could a be measure for speed (In contradiction to common belief, Hubble himself doubted very much his own idea and reasoned that there could be other explanations for his measurments). <br><br>However after years and years of collecting data and observing thousands and thousands of galaxies using the biggest  most powerful telescopes then available he discovered that many galaxies were connected physically to what we know as Quasars. (Halton Arp&#39;s finding were bundled in the &quot;Atlas of peculier galaxies&quot;, which became a standard work in the world of astronomy) The problem being that quasars were believed to be among the most distant objects in the universe according to there measure of red shift. <br><br>How could it be then that they were associated with nearby galaxies with much lower redshifts. Arp came to the conclusions that red shift is mainly a measure of age rather than distance. Most quasars are found in pairs or mutliples  roughly positioned within a certain amount of degrees along the rotational axes of their parent galaxies. Arp presented the idea that quasars were objects that were expelled from the center of galaxies with extremely high energy levels (=high redshift) but low mass, in time they would gain mass but decrease in redshift by quantized steps (see any chart with values of redshift quasars and you&#39;ll notice these values easily).  After a certain amount of time the objects would arc back in their trajectory towards the parent galaxy and become satellite galaxies like our Magellan clouds today are.<br><br>The theory is being developed further by scientists that consider a (more or less)  revolutionairy concept, that of the the universe being dominated by electromagnetism rather than gravity. <br>From around Hubble&#39;s time (a few decades earlier actually) the  concept of an expanding universe created in a &quot;first event&quot;, known as the big bang has dominated the field of astronomy. Here too we get in trouble by using red shift as a measure of speed to explain expansion. Because the redshift values observed do no match those calculated for a gradually expanding universe, an early inflationary stage was ad hoc presented as scientific solid, leading to the next problem of expansion rates not matching the observations again leading to another ad hoc solution: &quot;dark energy&quot;,  allthough there is no means of ever experimentally verifying the concept, WHICH IS WHAT EMPERICAL SCIENCE IS FOUNDED ON. <br><br>If however a universe is viewed through the eyes of electromagnetically driven processes there is no need for a &quot;miraculous&quot;(George Lemaitre), or divine big bang (or as Rupert Sheldon likes to echo Terence McKenna : &quot;give us one free miracle and we&#39;ll do the rest&quot;). If red shift is a measure of age then the universe could very well be without beginning or end that we can know. Problems with rotational periods of galaxies&#39; most distant stars also follow from the assumption that only gravity plays the game. If electromagnetism is introduced then there is no need for the theoretical  concepts (there are many versions) of dark matter allthough the public is led to believe that this is all established science. <br><br>Speed of light. Much can be said about that. If the speed of light were an absolute border than why would light not excape from alledged black holes (Stephen Crothers, a hornet&#39;s nest here, none of the types of black holes or universes can coexist but in the mind of the scientific community black holes team up and exist by the millions) since the speed of light IS the escape velocity. It does not make sense to launch a rocket into space with escape velocity if that speed is to slow for the rocket to escape in the first place. Speed of light measurements are also not constant but the National Physical Laboratory of Teddington were metrologists measure all assumed physical constants  did fix the problem back in 1972, the set the speed of light on a fixed value and derived the meter from that constant. SO the meter is now used to define the speed of light and the speed of light is used to define the meter! Google Rupert Sheldrake who intensively investigated this shameless fraudulent but accepted way of swiping anomalies under the rug. EInstein was brilliant in many ways but what his folloers did was turn him into a flawless godlike scientist which the himself most certainly wouldn&#39;t agree with. He was hesitant about many of his claims and with good reasons. One of which is the fact that thought experiment can never tajke the place of experiments done in laboratories simply because in a lab you&#39;ll run into all the elements you didn&#39;t yhink of when setting up the experiment. With thought experiments you assume that the parameters and logic you put in are complete and total. Needless to say that no one is  capable of such knowledge beforehand. Using math to &quot;prove&quot; such experiments is very dangerous. Again there is no real verification from reality though mathematicians build on these flimsy foundations day by day. The whole search for gravitywaves, Higg&#39;s Boson, Dark matter or energy and strange energy are the results of such processes. The assumptions at the base of the concept are never questioned no matter how many anomalies are found in observation. <br>Another idea worth pondering over in order to get the feel of my reservations, is the question why, if the speed of light is fastest way to transmit information from ponit a to b in our universe, doesn&#39;t earth, or any other body in gravitational relation to any other body, stay in their orbit. Earth &quot;knows&quot;were the sun is this very instant rather than eight or so minutes ago, which is the time it take for the light of the sun to reach us.If gravity would be an instant force, which it appears to be then it would very much violate our laws. My bet is on nature, not man&#39;s interpretation, however intricate, of it...<br><br>SO it seems that we need to go back to the drawing board concerning a whole bunch of issues, from the tiniest to the macroscopic scale. Again looking and observing anf testing what we think are the answers...Not onlu losing ourselves in math and assumption or neglecting any deviation that stains our pretty concepts and theories. Remeber in math, if only one exeption is found than a rule doesn&#39;t apply.<br>Facts and ideas can be found on the Thunderbolts Group webpage and other advocates of the electric universe concept.

By 1915 with his General Theory of Relativity Einstein had abandoned the postulate that the speed of light in free space has the same value in all inertial reference frames, since speed was in the new theory relative to a gravitational frame of reference. Thus, as Einstein pointed out later in his book &quot;Relativity: The Special and General Theory&quot; we must give up the notion of the speed of light as an absolute speed limit. Why most physicists still do not understand this over 100 years after Einstein so clearly articulated this puzzles me. Let me try to explain with a simple analogy how the speed of objects relative to each other may exceed the speed of light.<br><br>No analogy is perfect, or else it would not be an analogy, but let us imagine for a moment that we postulate a law that objects can travel no faster than 600 miles per hour through water (there is no such law, it\u2019s just for explanatory purposes). Now imagine a vast body of water like an ocean. We know that different parts of the ocean can be moving relative to each other, the Gulf Stream current is one example. Now imagine that there are two objects in the ocean traveling at the maximum velocity (which we are imagining is 600 miles per hour) through the water. Let&#39;s also say that speed of the Gulf Stream is 5 miles per hour. Let us imagine that two objects are traveling away from each other and one of these objects is traveling along with the Gulf Stream, and the other object is traveling parallel to the Gulf Stream, but not in it, and it is traveling in the opposite direction of the first object. Now both objects are traveling relative to the water around them at 600 miles per hour (the maximum velocity we postulated) but they are traveling relative to each other at the 1205 miles per hour (the speed of each on plus the speed of the Gulf Stream, 5 miles per hour.) Of course, this analogy is not perfect, but it illustrates the principle that since the speed of light is relative to gravitational fields (like the speed of objects in our analogy is relative to the water) and gravitational fields can move relative to each other, the speed of objects relative to each other can and does exceed the speed of light. This fact is especially apparent in objects that are many, many, many gravitational fields away from us, such as very distant galaxies that appear to be moving away from us at speeds much higher than the speed of light, because they are in fact moving away from us at speeds much higher that the speed of light.", "comment_date": "2018-06-30T22:01:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "XavierKatzone", "comment_text": "And THEY&#39;RE HEADED RIGHT AT US!", "comment_date": "2018-06-30T21:38:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shiggo", "comment_text": "Fake science!", "comment_date": "2018-06-30T21:08:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt", "comment_text": "Outer space lmao.

So they can&#39;t even grasp simple fucking concept so why would you expect him to be able to understand the fact that just because light is the fastest thing that most of these scientists have been able to observe doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s in the universe.

So, that would mean that if you look back a million years after the big bang, the speed of light would be MUCH MUCH faster than it is now. and the initial blast would in fact send matter out in all directions just under the speed of light - for that time anyway, which is faster than lights top speed now of course. if that werent the case you wouldnt have objects 50 billion light years from eachother when just 13.8 billion years ago they were the same singularity. so natuarally, the further back in time we look the faster things are moving. and they would appear that they are moving faster than the speed of light - but they arent. theyre moving the &quot;ancient speed limit&quot; of light so to speak. If someone 50 billion light years away from us were to watch us (it will take 50 billion years for our light to reach them) we would appear to be moving faster than the speed of light too. because 50 billion years from now the speed of light will be slower", "comment_date": "2018-06-13T09:26:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan Hemmer", "comment_text": "It is funny that everybody keeps parrotting that nothing can go faster than light.<br>Yet the only experimental fact we have, is that the speed of light is constant in respect to every observer, independent of the velocity of that observer.<br>The rest is conjecture.", "comment_date": "2018-06-13T07:40:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Len Kop", "comment_text": "nasa bs", "comment_date": "2018-06-13T04:58:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rick Thomas", "comment_text": "not less something is smarter", "comment_date": "2018-06-13T01:59:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason King", "comment_text": "Hmmm... if data cannot be communicated faster  than light, how did the Hubble telescope detect this faster than light data.......", "comment_date": "2018-06-12T23:08:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "allon33", "comment_text": "CERN a portal for the Draco, thx Mankind :(", "comment_date": "2018-06-12T09:42:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M E", "comment_text": "Lol at the title of this video!!", "comment_date": "2018-06-12T03:41:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prof ret GY Land", "comment_text": "What nonsense, how can you see something that is faster than light?

The Alcubierre drive has a fatal flaw, topology. Theres simply no manner in which you can contort a gridded, continuous 3 dimensional medium which allows an object at one grid point to move to another grid point without traversing a continuous set of points between, without tearing the medium all the way around the craft, and when you&#39;re talking about putting a spherical tear in spacetime, you&#39;re talking about the event horizon of a black hole that you just opened with your ship in the center, bravo. So you can probably put Alcubierre FLT out of mind. It may however, facilitate travel at extremely close to light speed by allowing empty space to essentially be pumped to clear any non photon obstacles from a crafts path. This would allow us to &quot;safely&quot; reach speeds up just under 99.999999%c as there or above the effects of length contraction and time dilation cause the CMB photons to present to the primed observer as gamma rays in a high enough regime of energy that they can not only interact with themselves, but interact with matter in a way that produces antimatter, which would instantly annihilate, the net effect being the same as having a million nuclear bombs constantly detonating on the forward facing surfaces of your craft.

Would there be an additive effect or would it be like the sonic boom left behind a plane traveling faster than the speed of sound? Interesting question.

A is traveling 10km an hour.. and object B is traveling teh opposite direction at 10 km an hour. The distance between both objects be perception depending on where someone is, say object A, teh distance between both objects is changing twice as fast, twice the speed yet no violation becasue its relative to the object.<br>So two objects going light speed in the opposite direction to each other, has a distance between them relative to 2x light speed of change, yet each object is going light speed, so This wouldn&#39;t break their law of nothing faster then light speed. Then ther eis clustering relativity.. If were going ot go by their lightspeed as teh constant. Then it should relate not to distance, because speed is of the object in motion of space past within a time frame, not a distance of relation of two moving objects, in which are both moving. <br><br>Back to clustering, if I have a universal complex of all known variables  and the entirety of the universe os observable at once, what one would see is a multitude of objects moving at varying speeds, and the distance of those objects could be relative to other forms of laws. I don&#39;t want ot say light speed is the limit but if we are going with that theory I will craft this as such but my mind thinks thats an error. So if one manipulates gravity, that changes in how light operates since its a mass also what affects light is temperature and many other things, and so the attractive quality of gravity fissures and cold and hot spots would create a field of objects appearing to travel at speeds of light speed, but if one is measuring the distance and not accounting for the fields and fissures and temperatures and their body of motion relevant ot that picture then one cannot get a good grasp of that speed in which something is traveling, especially on a 3-d plane. Then there is the expanse and growth of speed. I  tend not to put limits to thigns that are theories, until they&#39;re truths in meaning, no longer any more theories in which can change this information in reality it remains no firmament of human code of knowledge and is applicable to reality as a current constant. However certai nthigns firm, can always change wit hreletive information. Such as teh classification of sensory model of the periodic chart and phasic state of quatifying this ellements is archaic now, and should be redesigned for a bettering tool of education and understanding ona universal level, in which one the ncan make accurate visual conceptions of any compound within an environement, relative to  teh understanding of the leemtent or compound in question. A teacher brought this up, and studying LorD kelvin at the tiem of the Kuelvin scale als oindicated the base core molecule movemtn of matter ceasing to move is a best basis of this point, to a a current understanding that heat as a infinite source, but currently it has a finite theory or limit to it. Which is interesting to think about. Then ther eis pressure, mass, gravity that create a ffects to substances that different form tis standard field. So we have our earth field based typically on our sensory information. Whereas the natural base bield of the universe gives a template for each element, that can scale on a zero pressure... however, what is interesting is each element as a masss saturation weight in which depending on how much of it is in an area is creates ts own pressure on its self so initself it can alter its state depending on how much of itself is there. Then ther eis motion.. I think that is the main reason I dislike  the solid gas and liquid states, becasue every state is in a motion, and the nhwe have transitory states depending on teh pressure and temperature relative to them.  Each element is interesting, Its why I find such an interesting with metallic hydrogen i nteh bands of jupitor t obe an inspiring creative notion of the application. As it is in nature we also could create a pressure like Jupiter to create metallic hydrogen... or cold... Thus there is varying dfifferences to elements depending on its ions... and other factors.. then the inversion of matter - anti matter is another interesting thought... which  is something to think about.. its like some weird elastic band.... if one can invert a molecule element or whatever ... then it the elasticity demonstrates a invisible constraint to reality of matter, i nmeaning is ther a way to sever matter from our reality. so it cease to exist in inversion and itself... basically cutting a whole in teh fabric of space like a hole ina sock.... ..

By the time we are able to see it what changed during the space of time it takes for us to see it. How did that change impact what we are seeing. Given the same situation if something different changes the next time we see the same phenomenon, will it change the way we view it. For instance a star goes super nova, on the side that it takes longer for us to see, something else happened that sped up the life cycle of that star, we draw conclusions based on what we were able to see, but the next time we see this phenomenon it is within that stars life cycle, will all things be equal. And as we move further out in space moving closer to the beginning of time, did the same laws apply then as now. I cant imagine that the same laws of physics applied at the beginning as it does now, but then i dont believe anything dtsys constant over time we just dont live long enough to see the changes, possibly billions of years.

Stars drive the expansion when they add photons to the background like air pressure filling a balloon, new stars are out numbering dieing stars right now so we are in the expansion and accelerating part of sine wave. Eventually the sine wave pattern will start a contraction time. Looking at any object moving away only causes freqeucy shift . The frequency represents the energy level when the energy shifting reaches zero there is no light to see and energy from the object reaches zero. No objects can be viewed it there moving away at the speed of light.  So the exact edge of the visible universe is always growing at the speed of light in all directions as more time goes by we are seeing deeper into the whole entire universe. At the top of the sine wave the entire universe will be at it maximum size, coldest and will become completely  visible at the same time and then will begin the contraction. The contraction will cause an increase in frequency shift of all observed objects and cause things to start warming back up. More stars will light up and start the expansion all over again.

Because he never inserted the variable or cause of gravity. He only used the variables that describe the reactions of gravity. If he had inserted the cause into his equations he would have predicted the exponentially expansion of space. And if he had inserted the variable of the thrust produced by the EM drive he would have predicted the extra movement associated with the stars and mass located near the outside edge of galaxies, i.e., dark matter.<br><br>If Einstein had inserted the variable responsible for gravity he would have not claimed that nothing is able to escape the gravity of a black hole. He would not have predicted an event horizon and he would not have claimed that nothing can go faster than light, see quantum entanglement. All these hypothesis in the Theory of General and Special Relativity will eventually be proven to be wrong.<br><br>The event horizon telescope, a collection of radio telescopes around the world, will discover that the black hole Sgr A* does not have an event horizon and that energy, massive amounts of it are escaping the black hole. Completely showing Einstein&#39;s theories to be a giant blunder, but can be fixed easily though by simply adding in the action that is responsible for gravity. <br><br>The new James Webb Space Telescope, JWST will discover that light happens in an instant, similar to what occurs to twin photons when their fields have interacted, exchanging info, thus becoming entangled. It will confuse astrophysicists to their core beliefs after they discover fully grown galaxies as far as the JWST is able to see, even further than it would take light to reach us from that distance if light travels at c. Light happens in an instant. Believing that you can use a telescope to look into the past is as silly as believing that you can use a microscope to look into the future. You mainly see in the now. Only reflected light travels at c and the wave front of the light source. But if you interrupt the path of light the information that represents the now is transferred in an instant. So you see the distant stars in the now, not how they looked in the past when the light left the star or collection of stars in a galaxy (photons being entangled). <br><br>Like what happened with the star V838 Mon. When it brightened we were able to see it as it happened. Yet it took many months for the light that reflected off the dust and gas surrounding it to reach us, causing a light echo because that light was newly formed, it traveled at c. But the brightening occurred in an instant because the photons Hubble telescope was detecting were entangled to all the other light photons that the star had created in the past along with the photons in the now which produced the brightening. So when it brightened time was not a variable in the instant action of quantum entanglement. Thus the light information happened in the now, we were able to see the star brighten the moment it happened.", "comment_date": "2017-05-12T15:35:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Payne", "comment_text": "what ever you see and enters your eye is information travelling at the speed of light you can not see in total darkness stupid.......and you have PHD what is that exactly.....?", "comment_date": "2017-05-12T07:04:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antonius Moroinius", "comment_text": "light can be affected by gravity", "comment_date": "2017-05-11T23:14:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Sapiens", "comment_text": "Could be an intergalactic freeway for Aliens.......&quot;Ma...he&#39;s touching me!&quot; &quot;But he started it....&quot; &quot;KIDS!

So right there he says that there is faster than the speed of light its in his most well known equation.  How can energy  equal mass times the speed of light squared if there is nothing faster than the speed of light. Well that equation says speed of light squared.   So how can it be and not be at the same time.  He says it is, but we are squaring the speed of light which is supposed to be a constant.  So that makes no sense if nothing can be faster than the speed of light that how can you square the speed of light or the speed of light to the power of 2 to equal times mass equal energy??? Energy we know there is energy and are told it can&#39;t be faster but he is saying its mass times the speed of light squared. That init self doesn&#39;t make sense. But   If you take a say a device that has emites light from 1 spot in 2 directions it will move away from itself twice the speed of light or we can say on a line graph how we would look at  zero with plus and minus numbers and the device is 0 the line is the light                                <br><br>   here is   the   device   &lt;-<del>-------0--------</del>&gt;   So its moving away from itself at twice the speed of light.    But whatever, I am not so sure that just because one person says nothingcan travel faster than the speed of light because if it does the laws of mans idea of physics and the universe break down WHOOOPDY DOOOOO So it can&#39;t be if man was wrong.  So then we take a light year is the speed of light traveling for 1 year. But one year where On earth????  Cause a year on earth is roughly 365 days, but a day on Uranus thats not a light year. So I don&#39;t know it is possible becuase some things hold true on earth and man might have got lucky.

Space is not a perfect vacuum and, in intergalactic space, the concentration of monatomic hydrogen or single hydrogen atoms is about one atom per cubic meter.  That means, as a photon streaks through billions of light years of intergalactic space, it will encounter many hydrogen atoms along the way.  These encounters each extract a tiny amount of energy from a photon and cause its frequency to decrease a bit.

And it&#39;s a word that you can&#39;t back up. Just saying it is impossible isn&#39;t proof. Giving me math isn&#39;t proof. Math can be wrong.... Clearly! Only proof i will buy is an infinite amount of atempts with 100% failiure. But if science is right about the Universe only being so so old then i&#39;m sorry, we haven&#39;t yet been able to to an infinite amount of atempts. Impossible... That&#39;s for me a paradox because there is one thing i think is impossible. And that is proving that something is impossible. And as i said, we don&#39;t have infinity to back up any of these stupid theories so Laws of the Universe MY ASS.

Light move relative to space, and always the same relative to the observer but relative to space, a space that was speculated to be static and homogeneous. Light always move at C, but time does change when moving relative to space or if space move relative to the observer as in the situation of dark energy or gravity. Some physicists often think that time dilation in gravity and at high speed are two different things, its not, its the same thing. The wave riding space ship in this video also look like nothing more than momentum and there is no chance at beating the speed of light with that either. Many physicists still think momentum is energy stored in the mass as in classical physics, It.s a property between mass and space, like a surfer riding a wave. .\u00a0<br><br>Obviously matter cannot exist outside the boundaries of space because matter is in space, if you assume matter could exist outside the boundaries of space, then it would not have momentum. A centrifuge will not work. Space and matter is at all times intimately tied. like a wave in water, you cannot take the water-wave out of the water. Strings itself are singularities, space does not exist where they are, yet they are nothing but a phenomena in space where space is constantly falling into, hence we have gravity and gravity time dilation.\u00a0<br><br><br>This is why light cannot escape a black hole not because light slows down to 0, but because light move against the current of space at the speed of light and ultimately space itself fall into the singularity at the speed of light. Hence light don&#39;t escape but still move at the speed of light. So before scientist do not forget the idea of space being like a blanket, fixed and curving, they will not be able to answer these observations, the fabric of space is as dynamic as water itself, it can flow, change density, form whirlpools, waves all these phenomena shaping the existence of light and matter in 11 dimensions. in fact, everything exist out of space itself or at least a phenomena of space. we tend to separate things with definitions and categorization of properties, but fundamentally its all the same thing. But no objects can move faster than light because light is a wave of space and that wave cannot go faster than a wave in space. So when you observe anything going faster than light, then you need to focus on what is the fabric of space doing. hence don&#39;t trust all your observations of red shift as they are not all due to Doppler phenomena because what the fabric of space is doing is also part of the observations, they are intimately tied.", "comment_date": "2015-04-24T22:01:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Revnge7Fold", "comment_text": "This guys voice....<br><br>THIS IS...

We really needed an extra high-speed film/video Camera that has constant speed video photos that has full open spectrum of light capability as in infrared Ultraviolet and other color spectrums, Like the Hubble cameras has just a higher speed feed camera type video. To us looking up naked eye a star can be seen on a clear sky day, but not the next day. It does not mean that star has disappeared just the light has not reached us. More information was needed in this and missed that opportunity really such a shame. I do think it is possible to go faster than light but very hard to measure it, as could travel say 4 times the speed of light to a million times faster than light. But would there be any movement to us on earth or just too fast to see, as could be too fast for any distortion to happen so would never be detected just instantly gone to another place.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-09-16T01:45:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Konnies Egg", "comment_text": "Maybe we are going half the speed of light away from the galaxy and it is going half the speed of light away from us so it looks like its going the speed of light or faster", "comment_date": "2014-09-10T14:02:08Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "TheHachebe", "comment_text": "fake, how can you &quot;see&quot; an object thats moving ftl, let alone see that it is infact moving ftl, the light that you see would still be moving at the speed of light", "comment_date": "2014-09-09T15:28:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "zyfi", "comment_text": "&quot;the laws of physics break down.&quot; <b>video starts buffering</b><br>My God. \u0ca0_\u0ca0", "comment_date": "2014-09-05T02:03:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "johnnyaum3", "comment_text": "Speed of Light is not the maximal speed in Universe, who can say such a madness?
