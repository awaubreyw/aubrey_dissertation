Prologue: In the year 2036, an asteroid with the land mass of 10.6 million sq feet and 1,700 kilometers in diameter, roughly the size of a Continent collided with the moon. The moon was destroyed. The lunar dust rained down on the earth for years, blocking out the sun and contaminating the oceans. The earth is now uninhabitable and squalid. The richest and smartest people on the planet knew about the asteroid 20 years in advance. They built a space station the size of the moon to live on. Three other space stations were built too. The Russians found out the elites&#39; secret about the asteroid and built a space station on the Moon Europa, orbiting Jupiter. The elite&#39;s military lived on a barrack on the red planet Mars. The last space station housed the humans and robots known as e-humans, located at the edge of the solar system. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/A-E-AFTER-EARTH-Thomas-Blueprint-ebook/dp/B00ZGYAQLI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ie0cd-20&amp;linkId=12d62def9629ef396f55365f97aef8ce\">http://www.amazon.com/A-E-AFTER-EARTH-Thomas-Blueprint-ebook/dp/B00ZGYAQLI/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=ie0cd-20&amp;linkId=12d62def9629ef396f55365f97aef8ce</a>", "comment_date": "2016-04-01T19:00:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Junbear", "comment_text": "Well, you can&#39;t even call that an &quot;error&quot;.
