That is also proven in this clip. Every clip I have <br>seen elsewhere of domino tricks show the starter giving the first brick a heavily <br>and hard push. Something to think and ask questions about when you try <br>to explain the twin tower collaps as a domino effect: The falling tower <br>accelerates on the way down, but the top was not thrown against the next floor below, and every floor below is stronger and stronger than the previous as it was constructed to hold more weight.
