gonna touch it see if it moved or was dead, i didnt even get to touch it anytime i got close it lifted its legs up maybe it was saying hi or needed help i dont speak bee, i dunno what was wrong with but it was so lifeless i was able to cup it in a areosol lid and put it on the plants outside, i went back later and it was gone, i did an amazing job there im usually terrified of bees/wasps thats my phobia but this one seemed like it was sleeping or something had it of been more lively i wouldnt of went anywhere near it., why the bee does it im not sure thats what im looking for.",

finger more than once on a computer keyboard and the spider was on his finger during one part of the video and did not bite him even once plus he did this multiple times I&#39;m going to look for more videos on his channel to see if this is really his pet spider or not so what is your point are you sure that you really know don&#39;t be sure the human brain is full of chemical parts and because we are chemical sales we can believe something like animals don&#39;t really do that stuff and full ourselves so if we&#39;re not careful we can believe a lie and believe it too strongly so if people believe that they&#39;re right why are people stubborn why can&#39;t they just laugh and say okay but it&#39;s not going to happen why do people refuse to be proven wrong refuse to be shown the truth why are people stubborn if they&#39;re so sure that they&#39;re right and they believe that they&#39;re not going to be proven wrong why can&#39;t people at least let them try to prove them wrong if they believe that it won&#39;t happen what is your stupid Dark motherfuking Secret I never could understand people like you you believe that you&#39;re right but you&#39;re stubborn and you won&#39;t let us show you that you&#39;re wrong what the f*** I don&#39;t f*<b>***</b> get it lazarbeam your brain is to chemical and you just really hate what you think that you&#39;re going to experience okay that&#39;s another clue well I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m just going to have to use secrecy and trickery to show you that you&#39;re wrong since you won&#39;t let me show you up front I found out from your doctor that you&#39;re not allergic to pecans but you just hate the way they taste guess what I&#39;ll sneak apacon little chunk and your vanilla ice cream I don&#39;t care I don&#39;t give a f*** if you complain about me putting it in there I don&#39;t care and I don&#39;t give a f*** if you don&#39;t like the way it tastes I think that putting pecans in vanilla ice cream is delicious but how am I supposed to know for sure that you won&#39;t think that too if you won&#39;t f*<b>***</b> man up and just try it in front of me but okay after I sabotage your ice cream and I see that you don&#39;t like the way it tastes afterwards then okay fine I won&#39;t do it again but I&#39;m going to be you&#39;re Evil nemesis if you don&#39;t start Manning up and just do it in front of me and then tell me what you think and stop being such a crybaby over a f*<b>***</b> thing of food that you&#39;re not even allergic to especially ice cream with one&#39;s lousy f*<b>***</b> nut that doesn&#39;t even taste like putting a vegetable or a piece of meat in it just to tell me if you like it or not but yeah I think that I&#39;m smarter than all of you and I gave up on people because the atheist or just as stupid as religious people you all call yourself right I studied the human brain and psychology so I don&#39;t think that any of you know what I know and I think that all of you are ridiculous for being afraid of a different religion or being so annoyed and stubborn that you can&#39;t even give other stuff a chance I should just face it lots of grown ups in this world now or like kids I just hope that one day microchips will mind control the human race and that we&#39;re all peaceful and that when we try to split paths hate each other call each other different be enemies that the chip will kick in and force us to love each other so that we cannot Escape all of the knowledge and experience that we&#39;re supposed to have in order to understand that were wrong sometimes yes 95% of life is mental we can be right to the good bit though", "comment_date": "2020-11-30T08:23:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OV HUS", "comment_text": "So cute the bee is!", "comment_date":
