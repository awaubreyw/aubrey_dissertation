I do intend to sell / strategically give away my final product for free - this piece of footage I would get from you would make up a very small amount of a long video (around an hour) - I will use just portions of the video above - and can use my own narration, unless given permission to use portions of yours. If I am allowed to use this, I could send you my final product for free - though it cannot be resold unless I reach a deal with you on that end, this project will have taken thousands of hours of work, as I assume your project too was quite costly. This would be mutually beneficial as you would get a new one of a kind safety video, and get the message about propane safety out further, and I would get some footage to really show people how serious a propane explosion can be. I will set up ways to figure out if people sell this as their own work, which obviously I cannot have. Please let me as soon as you can if my proposal above would work for you, and if you have the rights to give me permission to use this video. Thank you for your time!
