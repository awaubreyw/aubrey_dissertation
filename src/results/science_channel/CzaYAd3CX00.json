Most people do. However, most of us differ as to the definition of &quot;good.&quot; The Bible says that God is good, and the Ten Commandments are His standard of goodness. So, we will look at God&#39;s Law . . . With a tender conscience, ask yourself if you have obeyed the following:<br><br>You shall have no other gods before Me. (Have you always loved God above all else?)You shall not make yourself an idol. (Have you made a god in your mind that you&#39;re more comfortable with, a god to suit yourself?)You shall not take God&#39;s name in vain. (Have you ever used God&#39;s holy Name as a cuss word?)Remember the Sabbath Day, to keep it holy.Honor your father and <a href=\"http://mother.you/\">mother.You</a> shall not murder. (God considers hatred to be as murder).You shall not commit adultery. (&quot;Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart&quot; Matthew 5:27-28; this also includes sex before marriage).You shall not steal. (Have you ever stolen anything? the value of the item is irrelevant).You shall not lie. (Have you lied even once? Including answering these questions).You shall not covet. (Have you ever jealously desired what belongs to others?)The Bible says that God will punish all murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, adulterers, etc. He will even judge our words and thoughts. On Judgment Day, will you be found to be guilty or innocent of breaking His commandments?<br><br>Perhaps you think that God is good, and will therefore overlook your sins. But it is His goodness that will make sure that murderers, rapists, thieves, liars, etc. receive justice. He would be a corrupt Judge if He turned a blind eye to injustice. Have you kept the Commandments?<br><br>The Bible says that the Law is perfect. It commands you to be perfect (Matthew 5:48). Are you perfect (in thought, word, and deed)? Will you make it to Heaven? You may say that you are still good, but God says you&#39;re not (see Psalm 14:2-3). So one of you is lying, and the Scriptures tell us that it is impossible for God to lie. Remember that all liars will be cast into the Lake of Fire (Revelation 21:8). God&#39;s Law demands justice, and the penalty for sinning against Him is death and Hell. Listen carefully if you want to live.<br><br>God Himself made a way where His justice and His goodness could meet. We broke the Law, but He became a man to pay the fine. Jesus suffered and died on the cross to satisfy the Law. God can forgive us and grant us the gift of everlasting life! But you may still think that you can (from now on) keep the Ten Commandments. But isn&#39;t it true that the best of us have lied, stolen, lusted, hated, failed to love God above all else, and failed to love our neighbor as ourselves?<br><br>How can we then, live a &quot;good&quot; life if we have already sinned against God? At best we are reformed liars and thieves . . . but still Lawbreakers. Think of it this way - would you sell one of your eyes for a million dollars? Would you sell both for $50 million? I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t. Your eyes are priceless, yet they are merely the windows of your soul. What then must your life (soul) be worth? With these thoughts in mind, what would be a fair price to pay for everlasting life? It is utterly without price. Yet, if we trust in our own goodness to enter Heaven, we are saying to God, &quot;I should enter Heaven because I have done good - I have earned my way in.&quot;<br><br>Imagine if you wanted to give me a brand new (very expensive) car, but I said, &quot;I can&#39;t take it! I feel embarrassed receiving such a gift . . . here&#39;s 10 cents for it.&quot; I&#39;m sure you would be very insulted by such a pathetic offer of payment. Besides, if I pay for it, it is no longer a gift, it&#39;s a purchase . . . it&#39;s mine by right.<br><br>When we talk of entering Heaven by being good, by trying to keep the Ten Commandments etc., we are tossing God 10 cents of &quot;self-righteousness,&quot; which is a terrible insult to Him, in the light of His sacrifice. The only thing we can do is humble ourselves, repent of our sins, and receive the gift by trusting Jesus Christ alone. Almighty God demonstrated how much He loves you when Jesus suffered for you on the cross. If you want to trust in your own goodness, then you are saying His agonizing death on the cross was in vain. The Bible says, &quot;For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God.&quot; You cannot earn a gift.<br><br>When Jesus said to &quot;believe&quot; on Him, He was saying we should have faith in Him, in the same way you would trust a parachute to save you when you jump from a plane. You don&#39;t merely believe in the parachute - you put it on. Please don&#39;t &quot;jump&quot; without Jesus. If you die in your sins there is no second chance. God will give you justice, and you will end up in Hell forever. Any troubles you have at present are dwarfed by the trouble you are in with your Creator. His wrath abides upon you (John 3:36). God doesn&#39;t want you to go to Hell. Neither do you want to go there, so confess your sins to God right now, put your trust in Jesus to save you, and you will pass from death to life. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. (See John 14:21). Your obedience to God is the proof of your love. Have faith in God, He will never fail you.<br><br>Pray\u00a0something\u00a0like this:<br><br>&quot;Dear God, today I turn away from all of my sins (name them). This day I put my trust in Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. He is the only way for me to be saved. He is &#39;The way, the truth, and the life.&#39;&quot; Please forgive me, change my heart, and grant me Your gift of everlasting life. In Jesus&#39; name I pray.

And mine, and rose again the third day, victorious over death, hell, and the grave. We must believe this and acknowledge the fact that we are sinners in need of a savior.  If you ask God to forgive you, and come into your heart and save you, (with a humble and contrite heart, with a repentant heart..the fact that you now see your sin as an offense to God..and you are sorry for your sin, and you want to live a life pleasing to him..but you know that on your own power you can&#39;t) he will.  If this is the condition of your heart, and you have a sincere desire to trust him and receive his free gift of salvation..He will save you from eternity in hell and give you a relationship with him.

Much more than, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.  <br><br>In John 3, the Bible explains that if you have not been born again the wrath of God already abides on you.  <br>The only thing you have to do is go to hell, is nothing because until you receive Jesus Christ as your personal savior, you&#39;re already headed there my friend.  I say this not to be mean, but out of love because I don&#39;t want to see you go to hell for rejecting Jesus Christ.  <br><br>Romans 3:28 says therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.<br>That means we cannot work our way to heaven, we cannot get baptized to go to heaven, we cannot give money to the church or the pope to go to heaven.. it is only by trusting completely in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross.  Faith in his shed blood! Faith in the fact that he rose again from the grave victorious over hell, death, and the grave.<br>Romans 4:24-51 -if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead; who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised again for our justification. Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>You see, we are not all children of God automatically. You have to want to be, and you have to put your faith in what God says about who Jesus Christ is, and what he has done for you.  We cannot have peace with God unless we trust in the finished work of Jesus Christ, and who he is as a person.<br>The Bible says that he is God.<br>Emmanuel =God with Us.  <br><br>Romans 3:22 even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe.<br>When you trust in the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior, (get saved by grace which is God&#39;s unmerited favor, by faith)<br>You are justified.  That&#39;s a legal term which means his righteousness is transferred to you.  Your sin has been transferred to him but in order for you to receive his righteousness it takes faith.<br><br>Romans 2:4 or despises thou The riches of his goodness and the forbearance and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God lead a thee to repentance.<br>God&#39;s goodness allows you to see your sin through God&#39;s eyes, as you acknowledge the fact that you are a sinner and headed to hell, you will see that your sin is disgusting to God.  We are an offense to God.  We deserve hell all of us.  This is a sobering thought, and the grace of God allows us to realize this, and gives us the right view of our sin, and the right attitude about our sin.  We cannot be good on our own power we can&#39;t go to heaven on our own power, we can&#39;t turn from our sin on our own power and earn favor with God, we must ask him to forgive us and save us cuz there&#39;s nothing we can do on our own to earn favor with him.<br><br>Ephesians 2: 8,9 paraphrased- we are saved by grace through faith, it is a gift and not of works, so nobody can boast about it.  <br><br>Will you receive God&#39;s free gift of salvation? Or will you reject God&#39;s gift to you?  He died for the whole world but we must all personally make a decision to receive him.  Not making a decision to receive him is in fact rejecting him.  The Bible tells us that we are with him or against him there is no in between.  <br><br>If you believe all of this with your whole heart and you are convicted of your sin.. pray this prayer.  <br><br>Heavenly father, I know that I&#39;m a sinner and I need your forgiveness.  I believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross, and shed his blood for my sin.  Help me to turn from my sin and please you, but I can&#39;t but by your grace.  Please come into my heart and save me.  Help me follow you with my whole heart.. I can do nothing without you please help me and save me.  In Jesus name amen.  <br><br>If your heart condition is right to be saved, you will have no problem with praying that prayer and will do it gladly.  If you have any questions feel free to ask.<br><br>God says that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved... <br>If God convicted your heart and you experienced godly sorrow about your sin, if you wholeheartedly trust in Jesus Christ alone to save you, then you are saved / eternally secure in the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>The Bible says in 1st Peter 1 that we are kept by the power of God.  Salvation is God&#39;s to give us.  Not ours.. it&#39;s not ours to lose or walk away from.<br>In John 10 the Bible explains that we are held in both the hands of Jesus Christ and the father and that no man can pluck us out.<br>In John 6 Jesus Christ says whoever comes to him he will in no wise cast out (he will under no circumstances reject them).  <br><br>If your heart matches your head.. and you didn&#39;t give the Lord Jesus Christ lip service.. then you can rejoice because you are saved and eternally secure.  Welcome to the family of God.  You can be a disobedient child, or an obedient child.  <br><br>God is such a good Father, and wants to talk to us daily through the Bible and he wants to hear what we have to say through prayer.  <br><br>Hebrews 11:6 (speaking of God). But without faith it is impossible to please him, for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek them.", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T03:07:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Curtis", "comment_text": "The putty knife was a bolster chisel, and the trowel was a float.  ha ha,  get it right", "comment_date": "2022-04-05T18:27:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chandran kurup", "comment_text": "Kerala Malayalam phone no", "comment_date": "2022-03-14T16:43:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Douglas Pelo", "comment_text": "How do the handles get attached?", "comment_date": "2022-02-14T06:38:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ava F", "comment_text": "&quot;What do you do for a living?&quot;<br><br>&quot;...

It is my professional opinion that the bottom should be concave, Even a mild curved bottom would allow for contents to concentrate in the center where the vac hoses end up. Oh, and another thing. Placing these things way out in a grassy area, far from the road is also stupid. Makes it take way too much hose, just as setting them in the middle of parking areas (and I mean your parking space) is also problematic. These are the same concrete tanks used by any place with a large commercial kitchen to collect dish sink wastes. (Called an Grease Interceptor, or Interceptor).
