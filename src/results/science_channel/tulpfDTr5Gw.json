God is holy, and completely sinless. Because of our sins, we are separated from the one who created the heaven and the earth (in six days, and rested on the 7th and sanctified it to be a holy day).<br><br>There&#39;s GREAT NEWS. Hear the gospel:<br>Jesus Christ died on the cross, was buried, and rose on the third day, to save you from the detriment of your sins. <br><br>In order to receive the beautiful gift of eternal salvation, you have to BELIEVE in the gospel. You have to believe and put all of your faith in Jesus Christ and what he did for you, for me, and humanity on that very cross. John 3:16 King James Version of the Holy Bible states, &quot;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him will not perish, but shall receive everlasting life.&quot; God truely loves you and He keeps His promise, His Word remian the same yesterday, today, and forever. <br><br>Without believing in the gospel and  accepting Jesus Christ into your hearts, your souls will not enter into Heaven. You will be casted into hell for eternity. Eternal life is where your souls will go into the afterlife when you pass, and there are only two places, Heaven and hell. Please DO NOT reject Jesus.<br><br>He truely loves you. He gave his entire life for you, every single moment of mockery, abuse, slander, and persecution that led up to him being cruxified on that cross, he thought about you. Me. Your entire family, your neighbors, your communities, ALL of humanity. <br><br>Please believe and repent from your sins immediately, turn back to Christ and live a life pleasing to God.
