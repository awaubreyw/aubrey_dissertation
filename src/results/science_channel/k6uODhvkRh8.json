And after the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born in the 20th century he was a child or poor infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until the year 2036 he is the dictator of Russia and antichrist (Criminal-Mentally Ill) of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or currently protests of racism among others. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, we must apply the corrective of ending once and for all with the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that they do have active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Island Cayman, VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, HaMishtara HaTzvait- ISRAEL among others, since they are breeding grounds for demon allies or helpers of the antichrist of the century 21 and these helper demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine POPE of the Catholic Church Francisco, WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkish empire, Iran empire, Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA failed \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator of VENEZUELA Nicolas Maduro Moros who has ill-gotten 5,000,000,000 dollars deposited in the Vatican bank not including the ill-gotten billions of dollars that they constantly deposit in his anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc&quot; a small part is sold to the previously named helper demons of the 21st century antichrist but really Most of those riches are sold primarily NOT to Russia but directly to the current 21st century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the antichrist of the 21st century and all his &quot;helper demons including Nicolas Maduro Moros- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use them to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or in a general way to harm or submit to the humanity. In the world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called a caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the disclosure as a state secret of the INTERNET since it is currently NOT only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the bottom of the ocean with the INTERNET is nothing hidden . And the 3rd. Event is the disclosure to humanity that will be announced no later than or MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the missing link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. There will always be only wars: &quot;conventional as all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will later come to this in order either to unjustly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there is more old or elderly population living there than young population and also due to mishandling of batteries as the capitalist communist republic of CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. Hence, my theory comes that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there have been more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal and plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why we must end several myths that seem Childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God since our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 2) That the dinosaurs They were extinguished by a huge meteorite or asteroid that hit the earth and the oil came or is the product of that extinction. What DOES really happen is that the aliens were modifying the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs so that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem. And scientifically or technically oil exists before the dinosaurs or since the planet earth was formed since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Oil in Rock or Crack and buried at high depths the oil is liquid or molten since the rock Oil crack due to the high temperature and pressure under the earth or at the bottom of the sea this becomes liquid or molten also as is the case of iron at the level of the earth&#39;s surface or in mountains and far from the core of the earth is in solid form iron, on the other hand, in the center of the iron-nickel earth is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that exist there creating the famous magnetic field that protects us from the gamma radiation and neutrons that come of space especially the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of the dinosaurs, then I ask, is it that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or purebred dinosaurs lived perhaps only in the North Sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ? In our universe there are asteroids that contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; also petroleum in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest oil reserves in rock or crack are held by the USA, whose technology to melt or exploit it was transferred or rented to the Republic of China since they have huge amounts of crack or oil in rock and this oil reserves in rock or crack of the USA surpass the liquid oil reserves that VENEZUELA and OPEC countries have. 3) That there is fresh water on the earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since there are huge reservoirs of fresh water below the earth&#39;s surface, as in several comets, planets and asteroids they are sources of frozen fresh water supply. 4) That man did not go, did not step on, or did not reach the moon, since on 07/15/1969 he did arrive and colonize the moon and at the end of the 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology see plane TR-3 Black blanket. 5) MALAYSIA Airlines Flight 370 (MH370 / MAS370) exploded due to a missile impact error on 03/08/2014. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as I affirm or confess on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of the USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of the possible pandemic such as the covid-19. 6) That it was by chance that the asteroid that exploded in the airspace of Tunguska-Siberia-RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What if it really happened is that the 10,000-year-old black knight extraterrestrial artifact that orbits between the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired a beam of energy to prevent further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile approaches or orbit close to it. There is a trace recently discovered that in our ancestor with more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced technologies of wars between extraterrestrials. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for &quot;Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction&quot; and NOT by mere chance. And all the uncertainties, myths or legends including those related to the Blessed Jesus of Nazareth from the time he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resuscitation will be answered or revealed with more precision by the extraterrestrials by being witnesses or direct participants from millions of years ago from the evolutionary facts of planet earth. It seems primitive or childish to me that in the middle of the 21st century in my beloved and beautiful Jerusalem-Israel, its pilgrims go to the wailing wall to insert or send written pieces of paper or hit their heads against the wall or speak to the wall and believing that God or the wall : &quot;He will answer: either in writing on the same or another paper, or spoken or by telepathy&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-08-15T20:19:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": ": 3", "comment_text": "Rip ford prefect", "comment_date": "2020-08-14T23:13:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chon Chon Ese", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6uODhvkRh8&amp;t=3m13s\">3:13</a>  everyone is talking about how the sun is going to explode and this guy just said it better, it\u2019s just a big ass explosion \ud83d\udca5.

One of its poles is also roughly aligned with our solar system. Given its mass, the star will probably give way to a black hole. Said black hole will begin to feed on the star from the inside outward. However, since there is so much gas to feed on, the black hole will overstuff itself and produce two jets of gamma rays from its poles.

It takes 43 min for light to go from the sun to the orbit of Jupiter. What this means is it will take Betelgeuse at least 43minutes to &quot;explode&quot; to double it&#39;s size if light travels at the speed of light (nothing is faster). So these animations in this clip with these ultrafast flash and light and heat explosion is all total BS. I&#39;d wish these scientists would use basic common sense and physics 101. So in reality this will look like a slowly expanding dot of light... it will probably take a day or longer to expand and become big..

The fusion of silicon into iron causes the core to shrink and get heavier.    The remaining gas &quot;falls&quot; and is compressed into a smaller area.  The increased compression of remaining gases and increased gravity on the iron results in increased compression and fusion .  The star emits photons and expels its fused elements. <br>    ....

On one hand we say that small red dwarfs are billions of years older than Red giants, and that Blue giants are shorter lived than Red giants. If small red dwarfs don&#39;t have as much fuel you have to ask how can they be older or longer lived than a red giant? And if Blue giants are relatively more recent burning pristine hydrogen in the nebulae or cluster from which they formed, we simply haven&#39;t yet seen whether they burn their hydrogen faster than a red giant, though it is assumed. If Betelgeuse is about to go supernova and if it isn&#39;t a binary star enveloped in its expanded shell waiting for their cores to fuse, we might be lucky to see if a Red giant like Betelgeuse categorizes the parameters for the development of a neutron star or collapse into a black hole in comparison to a Blue giant supernova.", "comment_date": "2020-03-06T19:23:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renegade Douglas", "comment_text": "This is such garbage.

Did not fully understand what it was. The dream showed a star brighter than the Moon, with a halo around it, like Saturn\u2019s ring. Unlike Saturn, which seems like an eye, due to the viewing angle, this star\u2019s halo was circular from the perspective of Earth. We were all looking at it, in the dream, and it was a sight to see. Something amazing. Just imagine a bright star with a circular halo around it. Everybody was looking at it in amazement for the halo, the ring around it was pulsating, becoming larger and smaller in its radius. It was beating like a heart, the ring increasing its size as it pulsated becoming larger, then smaller, as if it were a multistage implosion about to take place. It was an ominous feeling and people started seeking for shelter, running to their homes, trying to protect themselves from an explosion. Then, as the ring around the star collapsed for the very last time, and in an instant, as I was watching, I saw the bodies of people carbonized in an instant. The legs disintegrated and human bodies just fell on the ground, dark brown, unrecognizable. This event took but an instant, and the odd thing was how trees and homes were intact, as if nothing had happened.  That\u2019s the dream. I\u2019ve kept the dream for many years, since 1981, when I had this dream I haven\u2019t forgotten. Now that I hear everyone talking about Betelgeuse, I have come to understand that the Pyramids of Egypt were left there for us as a warning, so that we would look up to the sky, in the direction of Orion\u2019s Belt. I am now convinced this great sign on the sky announces the end, the baptism by fire of Earth.  When I see Betelgeuse dimming it reminds me of a tsunami, how water retreats before it comes at us with a vengeance.   Yes, I am a Christian, and I believe we are living in prophetic times.   Imagine if we are positioned right in the northern of southern axis of the star. The neutron star explosion would shoot a beam of gamma rays so strong it would obliterate Earth with its power.  I am also wondering if the Sun has gone shy lately due to Betelgeuse electromagnetic influence, after all, it\u2019s an Orange Supergiant with could end up creating a nebulae thousands of light years in diameter, putting Earth and our solar system inside that nebulae once it goes bye bye.  Well, go to confession, repent before it\u2019s too late. I\u2019m sure once the phenomena starts there won\u2019t be enough time to do it.  We are in the Great Tribulation undoubtedly, for one fifth of humanity has been butchered inside the womb, 1,500 million thus far, 61 million in the USA, in a clear attempt to destroy the human family. It all is happening as it was written in the book of Revelation, right before the second coming of Jesus Christ in glory, to take us to a New Earth, in a New Universe. Believe me you, the sky will look a lot different after this Betelgeuse even takes place. Imagine being surrounded by a sky filled in blue and pink colors, a super bright night sky, as it has never happened on Earth before.
