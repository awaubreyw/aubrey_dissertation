If we want to build a Moon base or go to MARS we need a place to put our astronauts and that place is BEAM. How it works is nylon straps hold the module down for launch in the trunk of Dragon or inside of a Delta IV rocket once the module reaches space it is extracted, mated to the station, and attached to a tire pump and inflated. Those UFOs you see during the inflation are the straps as BEAM is inflated the pressure removes the adhesive on the back of Velcro tabs and the straps are wadded up in Mylar and jettisoned as the module inflates. Once BEAM reaches it&#39;s full size it is the size of a small car or a closet. The larger modules will be the size of a bus and bigger.
