Mitchell, The Way of the Explorer: An Apollo Astronaut&#39;s Journey Through the Material and Mystical World<br><br> AFFIDAVIT (1) My name is Thomas Jefferson Dubose (2) My address is: XXXXXXXXXX (3) I retired from the U.S. Air force in 1959 with the rank of Brigadier General. (4) In July 1947, I was stationed at Fort Worth Army Air Field [later Carswell Air Force Base] in Fort Worth, Texas. I served as Chief of Staff to Major General Roger Ramey, Commander, Eighth Air Force. I had the rank of Colonel. (5) In early July, I received a phone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, Deputy Commander, Strategic Air Command. He asked what we knew about the object which had been recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, as reported in the press. I called Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the Roswell Army Air Field, and directed him to send the material in a sealed container to me at Fort Worth. I so informed Maj. Gen. McMullen. (6) After the plane from Roswell arrived with the material, I asked the Base Commander, Col. Al Clark, to take possession of the material and to personally transport it in a B-26 to Maj. Gen. McMullen in Washington, D.C. I notified Maj. Gen. McMullen, and he told me he would send the material by personal courier on his plane to Benjamin Chidlaw, Commanding General of the Air Material Command at Wright Field [later Wright Patterson AFB]. The entire operation was conducted under the strictest secrecy. (7) The material shown in the photographs taken in Maj. Gen. Ramey\u2019s office was a weather balloon. The weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press. (8) I have not been paid or given anything of value to make this statement, which is the truth to the best of my recollection. Signed: T. J. Dubose Date: 9/16/91 Signature witnessed by: Linda R.

To begin, I believe that an asteroid must be treated with equal rights to any other planet such as the earth or the mounaki. This is essential as otherwise nasa may be demolished by its asteroid friends. Please interact with caution when your actions are observed by any asteroids as the earth will be put under greater risk than is necessary. I do strongly believe that if we provoke the asteroid family, they will attack. But. We must not. This is key. If we do, we will be demolitioned from the universal milky way. This means no more chocolate for us. Yes. I am looking at you bob from the united states of america. Yes. You fatty. You want your chocolate don&#39;t you (please view my final paragraph for a reflection on this comment)? Therefore, please pay attention to my potential solutions below.<br><br>1) We can say no to the asteroid. Without consent, it cannot approach. If it does, we will begin a lawsuit against it.<br>To expand on this option, all asteroids have equal rules and regulations towards us as we do towards them. This suggests that if we reject the option of being approached by the asteroid, the asteroid must not approach. If it does, we will be forced to take it to court in a trial of bad stuff.<br><br>2) Say hello and try and be friendly with it and tell it politely to go away.<br>To expand on this option, we will be polite to the asteroid with the goal of becoming good friends. This will mean that the asteroid will not want to hurt us habitants of the earth. Instead, it will visit every now and then to say hello by giving us a nice shower of shooting stars. This will be astonishing to watch, and we will thank me for suggesting such a powerful option.<br><br>4) Tell it to bugger off.<br>To keep this one short we will ask it abruptly to go away, with the aim of frightening it and making it leave the close proximitations of our beloved earth. To shorten this point, the abruption of the request will make the hair of the asteroid whiten. This is in other words of saying that the fright will make it older. Such occasions occur only in humans, and not asteroids, so it is actually simply a metaphor. If it wasn&#39;t, the taughtology of my teachings would be incorrect as it actually is not.<br><br>5) Say mars is a better option as earth is too easy target.<br>This point is basically saying that mars is a better target than earth for the asteroid. This would be good only if mars was smaller as this would mean that the challenge for the asteroid would increase. Then, it could return to its home with the win of demolishing a harder planet. It is like asking me, would you rather win the European championships, or the World championships. In this case, I would choose the world. However, Earth is actually a harder target, so this would make my point invalid. This means that it relies on the asteroid being uneducated and not knowing what planet is bigger. This makes this option not such a good one, as unlike common thought, asteroids actually have a very good educational system.<br><br>6) Say boo, and it will be frightened.<br>The epigrammatic meaning of this point is similar to point 4. The goal is to frighten it away. I will not go on any longer with this point as it has already bored you enough. Therefore: &quot;To keep this one short we will ask it abruptly to go away, with the aim of frightening it and making it leave the close proximitations of our beloved earth. To shorten this point, the abruption of the request will make the hair of the asteroid whiten. This is in other words of saying that the fright will make it older. Such occasions occur only in humans, and not asteroids, so it is actually simply a metaphor. If it wasn&#39;t, the taughtology of my teachings would be incorrect as it actually is not.&quot; This is the point.<br><br>7) Smack it in the balls with a slipper.<br>Here, after milleniums of calculation by me and my friends balgit and baboo, we have located the exact coordinates of any asteroids testicular regions according to its mass and height. It isn&#39;t actually as complex to locate as we thought as they are indeed rather above average. If the balls are big, it means that it is an easy target to smack. It may even be bigger that my slipper. I have some big slippers. I actually ordered them from a specific site only for slippers. If you would like more info on these, please leave a comment down below.<br><br>Long story short, to conclude my statements, all these options depend on the size of the asteroid. I would reccommend to choose 3,10 or 15 if it is small, 5,9 and 7 if it is big. Most asteroids are polite and respectful, so please use the polite variations of these options if you come across such an asteroid. If it isn&#39;t, please let it know that we have backup in the fanaria of deligiani. They will make sure to put into action option 7 with aggression and grit and determination and skill and predictive validity to be sure they can&#39;t reproduce any more asteroids from their testicles. If the testicular regions are smaller than we have estimated, it means that we were wrong. In this case, please disregard this comment. Thanks for reading.<br><br>On a side note, I had written a more in detail comment, but some silly asteroid troll removed it, so this is just a short and sweet summary of that one, from what I can remember by memory. *Also, please any americans named bob do not take offense to my reference in the introduction.

Mass extinctions occur more often than previously thought and they occur according to a fixed schedule. Scientists are walking in the dark as long as they ignore ancient texts, like the Indian Mahabharata and the Mayan Popol Vuh, that tell us that our planet Earth is suffering from a cycle of seven natural disasters. Those disasters are causing a huge tidal wave, massive floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, and a bombardment of fiery meteors every few thousand years. Several animal species become extinct and mankind hardly survives. The only possible natural cause of this cycle can be a ninth planet in our solar system, orbiting our sun in an eccentric orbit. If you don&#39;t know this cycle, history is incomprehensible. To learn much more about the cycle of recurring floods and its timeline, the recreation of civilizations and ancient high technology, read the eBook: &quot;Planet 9 = Nibiru&quot;.

You have brought stupidity in this comment section. I am here to tell you that you are scientifically trying to prove people wrong when you don\u2019t even know how to use the right your or you\u2019re. Also just because someone believes in this theory doesn\u2019t mean that they believe in a certain religion. I can have a belief like cows are purple, but that belief doesn\u2019t not extend to a religion. Like a point you tried to make in another comment but failed logically, beliefs can be independent of a religion. In this case, believing in the Big Bang Theory and God can be two independent things; I can believe in both, and there are many Christians who do so. On another note, your pals and you have mixed up a common thing that they teach in all science classes - the difference between a hypothesis and theory. A hypothesis is an educated guess with or without evidence to support it; however, through the accumulation of data, theories are developed and can only be classified as a theory once data has proven it through and through many times. You can\u2019t test that tomatoes are red 1000 times and claim all tomatoes are red. That\u2019s only a hypothesis. However, through evidence and many experiments, you can develop a theory that tomatoes actually come in many different colors. Also, the fact that your argument tries to invalidate any evidence that the Big Bang theory provides shows that you\u2019re living in an echo chamber. You will only accept evidence that aligns with your ideas and anything else is false. If you are referring to Genesis Park as your only source that dinosaurs existed alongside with humans then it simply remains as a hypothesis until more evidence can be gathered. A phenomenon called pareidolia \u2014seeing what we believe to be a significant shape or pattern when it isn&#39;t really there \u2014 can help explain why the interpretations of the cave drawings are not accurate. Because you want to believe that dinosaurs existed with humans, you will go to extremes to draw connections and make those shapes into dinosaurs. However, my point is you can go on believing what you want but also try to be accepting of views different from yours and consider their plausibility from many sources not just one. And when you need to defend yourself, don\u2019t only bring in one fact like the cave drawings because that\u2019s a very weak argument. @Nate Dagreat", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T03:18:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TimyTProdigy", "comment_text": "Is anyone dinosaurs still here?", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T00:13:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin SHOTS", "comment_text": "Then Corona virus hit hard\ud83e\udd7a", "comment_date": "2020-10-30T16:10:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Peaceful, Happy, and Bountiful Life", "comment_text": "I just woke up from a really bad dream about armageddon comming very soon.

Most &quot;emotions&quot; are nowhere near as evolved as ours however the basic instincts remain the same. However, now a days the love for other animals over our fellow human can sometimes scare me. Placing a value on them against us is truly foolish and certainly would not exist if we didnt not evolve and build our way to the privileged position we sit in today as a race. The fact that we feel this way towards other animals shows that we do have a higher state of intelligence than most of them which cannot be argued, because when it comes down to you being alone in your most basic form with no gadgets to help you out, in the jungle trying to &quot;save and protect&quot; a tiger from &quot;extinction&quot;, do you think the tiger gives a shit about you or is it gonna have you for lunch? Cause I know what I&#39;m betting on. There is a hierarchy and yeah we as a human race have the fucking cheat codes but dont be so idiotic to think that we can relate to everything at an emotional level because when push comes to shove, you will quickly find out why it&#39;s better to let nature do it&#39;s own thing and keep your nose out. I&#39;m not saying dont show love for animals and different creatures.

If they didn&#39;t survive and ocean life was affected, why do we have so much diversity in sea life. Why didn&#39;t sea lions go extinct?

If you read the Bible, it&#39;s actually the opposite, a major flood happened which shows the depiction of thousands of flood legends that are around the world, and since water was beneath the Earth, God judged the planet because of wickedness and the water blasted through the earth, massive earthquakes occurring and the discord of tectonic plates shattering causing high volumes of rock materials to be flung at very high pressure and speed into outer space damaging and destroying our 7th atmosphere; which was an icy shell around Earth to protect against the current aging problems that are caused by waves that come from the Sun directly at us and also blasting our Moon like a shotgun shell at only those specific areas leading it to recede away from us. If an asteroid of that size ever landed on our planet, this planet wouldn&#39;t even exist. The atmosphere itself can&#39;t be repaired once destroyed and separated from its atoms and has been disintegrated into a vacuum. Energy conservation then has caused a chain-reaction which would destroy everything on Earth; whether with an enormous soundquake shockwave or the blast size of trillions of megatons of dynamite at once. If we had such an event, why is there not a single weird structure hanging mid air? If you an asteroid had come down and smacked the Earth head on, things would be frozen in outer space orbiting us, halfway through our atmosphere things would be just hanging and floating because of physical object and magnetic interaction with comet&#39;s particles. That&#39;s why when the 7th atmosphere was broken (the layer of ice; i.e. Firmament that&#39;s stated in KJV bible) it dropped to the North and South poles because um... ice is actually magnetic and will drop there instead of near the equator where the polarities of magnetic physics is particularly weak and can&#39;t attract with much power.

The humanoid species seemed to be successful during the first time, but in a last battle the reptilians decided to use a mighty experimental weapon - a special kind of fusion bomb which should destroy the life forms on the planet but should not harm the valuable raw materials and the copper.<br><br>The bomb was fired from space and detonated at a point of your planet you call &quot;Middle America&quot; today. As it detonated in the ocean, it produced an unpredictable fusion with hydrogen and the effect was much stronger than the reptilians had expected. A deadly radiation, an over-production of fusion-oxygen, a fall-out of different elements and a &quot;nuclear winter&quot; for nearly 200 years were the result.<br><br>Most of the humanoids were killed and the reptilians lost their interest on the planet after some years for (even for us) unknown reasons - maybe because of the radiation. Planet Earth was on its own again and the animals on the surface died.<br><br>By the way, one result of the fusion bomb was the fall-out of different elements and materials created in the burning process and one of those materials was Iridium. Your human scientists today see the Iridium concentration in the ground as an evidence for an asteroid impact that killed the dinosaurs.<br><br>That is not true, but how should you know that?<br><br>Well, most of the dinosaurs died (not all in the detonation but in the bad things which came after the war, especially in the nuclear winter and in the fall-out.)<br><br>Nearly all dinosaurs and reptilians were dead within the next 20 years. Some of them - especially those in the oceans - were able to survive for the next 200 to 300 years even in this changed world, but these species also died, because the climate had changed. The nuclear winter ended after 200 years, but it was colder on earth than before.<br><br>Despite the cataclysm, some species were able to survive: fish (like the sharks), birds, little creepy mammals (your ancestors), various reptiles like crocodiles... and there was a special kind of small but advanced dinosaurs which had developed together with the last large animal-reptilians like the species you call Tyrannosaurus.<br><br>From<br><a href=\"https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_52.htm\">https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/vida_alien/esp_vida_alien_52.htm</a>", "comment_date": "2018-06-30T20:18:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jo - Bug", "comment_text": "Trigger warning?!

Fossils cannot occur without a sudden burial. They are vastly younger than proposed by science as well since living tissue has been found on quite a few fossils and why so many are found close to the Earth&#39;s surface. If dinos are are older than man, than why can we find a plethora of dino fossils but not one missing link since they should be much higher in the geological column. Besides, if you divide the current population down to a common denominator given how fast a population explodes, it would take us back to only 6000 years.
