By design, there isn&#39;t very much padding in a racing boot, just very stiff carbon fiber. So, after two or three hours of skating and getting squeezed or poked in the same spot on a bone a few thousand times, you can believe it that those pressure spots begin to hurt! And skating 4 or 5 times a week, they stay sore... <br><br>Then a Pro at a marathon event told me I needed customs because my ankle bones are pretty big and my feet are pretty wide and have a sensitive pinky toe bone. I told him customs are expensive. He said how much did you spend on those three pair of boots that hurt your feet? I said hmmm, you have a point... loll<br><br>So, he set me up with a boot maker who didn&#39;t wrap my feet with strips of plaster cloth, instead he put each foot into its own box, slightly larger than a shoe box. Then he mixed some powder with water and filled each box with my foot in it with the mixture, which then set-up like Jello into soft rubber after a few minutes. Then he sliced through it along the top of my foot so I could lift my foot out. He then filled that negative of my foot with liquid plaster and later stripped the rubber away and had an exact plaster mold of each foot and made the boots around them. After I broke them in and made a couple of minor heat molding tweaks, they fit like gloves! and I&#39;ve been skating pain free in them for about six years!", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T10:11:00Z", "likes_count": 55}, {"comment_by": "Wiktor", "comment_text": "(<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mjs6eC3Wd-I&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a>) So satisfying to watch", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T10:06:24Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "AlisherChanse", "comment_text": "Make a video about Anishona", "comment_date": "2022-04-19T04:21:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Posey", "comment_text": "I had both type of skates.
