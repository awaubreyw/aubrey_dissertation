I was playing games, sitting on my bed under my blanket. I felt a pinch on my foot. It hurt but I didn\u2019t really mind it, until I realised what it\u2019s like to get bit by a bug. It took me like 10 minuets to realise this... because I\u2019m stupid. I don\u2019t know why I\u2019d feel a sharp pinch under my blankets on my bed. Anyways, I immediately grabbed my phone, yeeted off my bed, and hopped on a chair in my room. The lights were off, which made it worse, so I put on the flashlight on my phone (still standing on the chair). I looked at my foot, and I had a big azz bump with 2 fang marks. I realised that I had a few friends visit me that weekend, and by friends I mean a family of brown roclus\u2019s. I see brown roclus a lot (even tho they are big af)  but this still sent shivers down my spine. I opened my messaging app, and texted my dad like <br><br>\u201cDAD\u201d<br>\u201cDAD\u201d<br>\u201cA BIG AF SPIDER BIT ME!\u201d<br>\u201cHELP!\u201d<br><br>My dad was asleep on the couch in the living room (since my dad doesn\u2019t know YouTube exist, the tv is his life.) and I could hear the sound of the messages coming in. Than I texted my sister the same thing. She texted me.<br><br>\u201cAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA.\u201d<br><br>Now I was like, this is survival, baby, because no one was gonna help me. (Why did I even text my sister?! She was in Paris.) I was thinking of ways to sleep without a spider biting me. My dad heard the messages, got up and opened my door. He said \u201cWhat are you texting me for?!\u201d In his Louisiana accent. \u201cA spider bit me!\u201d I said.<br><br>My dad literally \u201ctch\u201d me! Then he walked away. I wasn\u2019t suprised bc I know my dad... I was really mad though.<br>But since the lights were on, I could see the floor. So I ran out the door, but than I was like \u201cdude, where am I gonna sleep.\u201d <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>To cut the story short, I slept on the counter in the bathroom.

There is a parasite that can inflict various bugs, including spiders, praying mantises and others. The parasite eventually begins to take over, mainly a night. What it does is try to get the creature wet, once it does get wet the parasite kills the bug and sprouts out so it can grow. Now, this all from memory but I&#39;ll try to answer a few questions. <br><br>Is it worm?<br>No, fairly sure it&#39;s a type of plant or fungi.<br><br>Why did the bug spray not kill the &quot;worm&quot;?<br>If it isn&#39;t a worm, obvious why. If it is, well bug spray normally doesn&#39;t work on non-flying insects and it&#39;s pretty rare. The spider, nevertheless, died due the fact that it got wet. The parasite is most likely immune to the spray and survives.<br><br>Why does it just splurt out like that?<br>As I stated previously, it causes a reaction that causes the thing to grow. Becoming wet is normally a sign of rain, the perfect condition to grow.

They are named Gordian worms because &quot;Gordian&quot; stems from the legendary Gordian knot. This relates to the fact that nematomorpha often tie themselves in knots. They can be discovered in damp areas such as watering troughs, swimming pools, streams, puddles, and cisterns. The adult worms are free-living, but the larvae are parasitic on arthropods, such as beetles, cockroaches, mantids, orthopterans, and crustaceans. They can reach in extreme cases up to 2 metres.", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T06:45:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vibe Check", "comment_text": "Don\u2019t watch this when you\u2019re about to go to bed ._.

However, he was moved into a flat with a gas fire and continued in his sadistic anti-arachnid behaviour. It was sickening watching the spiders curl up and burn into the metal casing around the gas flames.<br><br>He was one of the unluckiest people I knew. One day the gas stopped igniting because the ignition spark was blocked by the corpses of burnt spiders. Having failed to ignite his fire he went into the kitchen to retrieve his matches. Seeing a spider scurrying across the floor he spent a while chasing it with a dish cloth until finally catching it, intending to throw it on the fire once ignited.
