Vacuums don\u2019t suck, the fan inside reduces the air pressure inside the container and the ambient air outside is being pushed in due to its higher pressure than inside the vacuum, thus forcing dirt particles in along with it. Similar to drinking a liquid through a straw. The air pressure in your mouth is less than the air pressure outside the drink, which in return forces the liquid up the straw and into your mouth. If you were to seal the top of the drink you will find that you will not be able to drink because the air pressure will not change and won\u2019t push the liquid into your mouth.", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T17:11:43Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Caleb Steele", "comment_text": "Was this a commercial?
