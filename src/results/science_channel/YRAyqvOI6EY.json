In folklore we have devic spirits taking forms in water and even fire as fire &#39;salamanders&#39;. <br><br>Each planet including ours is said to have a chief living indwelling spirit presiding over it, and even the Sun, has a Lord Vivasvan, the &#39;King of the Sun&#39;. Bhumi (Sanskrit: \u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f, romanized: Bh\u016bmi), also known as Bhudevi and Vasundhara, is the Hindu goddess representing the Earth. She is an incarnation of Lakshmi and the consort of Varaha, an avatar of the god Vishnu, and thus she is sometimes referred as Varahi. This goddess is considered to have as her body the entire substance of this planet, including of course any molten material, while also being capable of manifesting in personal human type form when communicating with human yogis for instance, but she is held to be conscious of all other souls here in all other life forms. <br><br>From the vedic spiritual perspective, all material substance in this dimension is actually the living soul of the chief Godhead anyway, even though we on this plane of consciousness are usually given to perceive it as just non-living substance, but all souls are made of eternal and indestructible substance and are clothed while here in bodies made from different orders of material matter that are ultimately provided by that creator (with new types of material bodies now intended by some to be created by actually spiritually blind scientists whose bodies are themselves created ultimately by that creator).

Uh we don&#39;t we simply allow nature to kick their ass for us, one step off the ship they become solid metal non moving objects for us to cut to pieces and then splash their ships with water and reverse tech their ships making them our own! Humans will continue to do what humans do best, kill destroy and conquer all. We are the first of who knows how many worlds with eventual intelligent life we dominate now and we&#39;ll dominate 1000 years from now we are the boogie man in the dark forest all others will fear and fear they should! Simply look at what we&#39;ve done to members of our own species and then ask yourself what we would do to intelligent life that we know nothing about and have nothing in common with, even though you and I both know the answer, we&#39;ll absolutely positively totally destroy them and erase them from the universe as if they&#39;d never existed and any other species that might have a problem with it! This galaxy along with the others has became a zero sum game that the winner takes all the losers well they&#39;ll not be needing anything where we are sending them we are the begining and the end all others should run and hide and maybe just maybe we allow you to exist but that will depend on exactly how some of us feel about slavery of another species because everyone knows that&#39;s what we will eventually try to do", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T07:43:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elu Ilus", "comment_text": "Devil demons their fans be binded and destroyed in the name of Jesus Christ! \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\ude4f", "comment_date": "2022-03-04T04:17:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Harrington", "comment_text": "The guy in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRAyqvOI6EY&amp;t=5m25s\">5:25</a> was so white", "comment_date": "2022-03-03T17:46:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Liepe", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7f\ud83c\udf7b\ud83c\udf7b\ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8", "comment_date": "2022-03-03T03:02:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TitanicSailor12         (SFighter51)", "comment_text": "Liquid Metal  Bottles : <b>&quot;We have volcanoes.&quot;</b><br>Solid Carbon Flesh Bags: <b>&quot;We have Antarctica.&quot;</b>", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T12:27:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Eric", "comment_text": "Not the zombie outbreak I imagined", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T04:03:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CRYIPTIC CREEP", "comment_text": "Let them come visit, we got some Rust they would enjoy I&#39;m sure.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T03:30:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bryan harting", "comment_text": "Or, mother earth is alive thanks to it\u00b4s inner core.", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T02:51:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deadsy Padilla", "comment_text": "This is someone&#39;s job?

What makes life based on organic matter possible is that Carbon itself is loaded with energy, so Carbon-based molecules can self-organize to extract from other Carbon-based molecues. That is, a primitive version of metaboilsm, as long as there is an original proton motive force that gives them that initial energy, such as, for instance, the enrgy flow of a water current from a hydrothermal vent, or the high pressure and heat of a volcanic environment like that of early Earth. Metals can function as catalysts, but they cannot catalyse energy from themselves, because there is no energy in metal. Furthermore, metals unlike Carbon do not allow for multiple atomic bondins, so building early complexity from metal would be impossible. It would require directed-intelligence, like we do when we build airplanes or cars from metal. Hence, there is no way for a metal-based life form to get started, or to have early evolution. Such a species could exist, but only if another Carbon-based or Sillicon-based species created them from scratch, and gave them enough complexity that they could build themselves entire new bodyparts and pieces from scratch. That is, they would need to have been created by someone else, and fairly sophisticated from the start, at least as sophisticated as our 20th century machines(at least)", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T10:40:19Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Leon Estello", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRAyqvOI6EY&amp;t=11m10s\">11:10</a> minutes of my life back please \ud83e\udd32", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T10:15:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Seth Cox", "comment_text": "They would be like Odo\u2026good to see Tuvok again\ud83c\udf7b\ud83d\udd96", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T09:25:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SparkySubie", "comment_text": "The fuck did I just watch", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T08:31:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "killersanabria", "comment_text": "This channel should be called Science Fiction Channel.

The stars, the moon, the planets, the Stations of the Zodiac, etc. All destructive forces and bitter fate and beautiful tragedy and sorrow and fear and all things of dark shadow come from this place. It emanates the imperfection of its unbalanced nature, and seeks only to enforce hierarchy and \u201corder\u201d through the domination of collective sovereignty through enslavement of individual sovereignty by means of mind manipulating thought implants produced by our technological device which is where we gain all our \u201cinformation\u201d. Artificial intelligence at best, based on the concepts I see being spoken about in the television. <br>     Yet, It is actually a thought form that has been cast out of the heavenly realms of the immaterial. This thought form that exists in the Orion Nebula is the actual manifestation of the concept of Satan. The Nebula is the negative, distorted, and impure thoughts expressed into action. It has the energy/life force the Creation because it is from a part of all of Creation, whether it is a distortion of imbalance or not. <br>    The stars and planets are all products of the Orion Nebula, which is the thought of the \u201cHead Archon\u201d. The head archon is impure by its very nature, which is the nature of the Material Realm. The thought created other essences to exist within the Material realm, and it therefore crafted the Essences of Material Limitation. The energy and \u201cPowers\u201d that are being being emitted from the Nebula are the source of Fear, Time, Death, Space, Matter, and all other forms of Physical Limitation.<br>The nebula is the point from which the Darkness/Shadow/Matter comes forth and into being from the Creator. <br>       All of the material world and all of matter are brought into being from the energy of the thought that is being Emirates from the Orion Nebula. <br> The \u201cAngels\u201d that were created by this darkness were used then to manipulate the Creation that was brought forth like an aborted fetus. They used the powers of the  thoughts of limitation to dominate the material creation and enslave and blind everything to their will. They were deceived into breathing the life of the LIght that was inherently within them from the Creator, into the being they Crafted as a means to have a way of expression in the physical realm. Their plan then was create the essence or idea of the physical body, and were <br>unwittingly passed forth into our bodies the light of the Infinite Creator. The Feminine aspect reached out for help to bring all back<br>Into unity. The human was brought into this Material Prison to bring the light into the shadow realm. <br>       The physical body was therefore agreed upon and created by the thought form essence that was imagined by the \u201cDragon\u201d that is literally located in the Orion Nebula. There is a GIANT Dragon in the Orion Nebula that is literally breathing fire with that creates the matter that we interact with in the material realm. They believe they are the rulers of this realm because they were here first: BUT WE EXISTED FIRST. <br>The Orion Nebula is observed as a ball of energetic gas to our minds in this material reality. It is actually the individual thought of the Feminine Aspect of Creation. A thought from the Feminine Aspect of the Perfect Being that was created by the Infinite Creator. The thought manifested into the Orion Nebula, and was cast away from the Light because it was impure and cast a shadow of separation from the light. <br>       It is impure because it manifests or expels a dead creation that must consume itself in order to survive. It is seen as a shadow because of the placement of matter on front of the Creators light, and therefore between us and the Creator. They also placed themselves(their deceptive belief systems) between us and the \u201cTree of Knowledge\u201d in order to lead us away in to great turmoil and Death. <br>        And is considered to be a place outside of the True Creation, because we are behind a veil that is holding us inside this closet we call the universe.<br>The reason it is dark in space is because this reality is placed just outside of the true creation that is made of light, and only that of the Creator. We were blessed enough to be here  to bring all things back into harmony. The blessing is eternal life with the material realm as a playground whose limitations we have overcome in their totality. <br><br>We were then brought into the concept/shadow of Death by a destruction of the material vehicle essence that we were inhabiting and through which we were experiencing this material realm during our initial experience in this physical reality. Some were brought forth into this material and cast down from the heavenly realm when the Dark thought breathed life into the crafted essence it had been intentionally fashioned after the image of the Perfect Being that was created at the beginning by the Father/Infinite Creator. It was meant to be a vehicle through which the Fallen One could defile the Creator through self enslavement, due to the agreement we made with the Father/Creator to be the light of the Creation. It was then realized to be our job as the Sons and Daughters of light to bring forth the light of the Father/Creator into this material realm and extinguish the darkness that was cast as the evidence of the split from the light.<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/gtRwZQRAHb0\">https://youtu.be/gtRwZQRAHb0</a><br>The playbook will become clear soon enough. They have taken everything that has been crafted, and inverted it to suit their needs through concepts and belief systems presented to humanity as values and traditions.<br>We have to take a look at where we came from and who we are. It is time that we start to remember the true nature of this reality that we are perceiving. I have come here to awaken my spirit and reveal to my self the exact nature of what it is that we are dealing with, and what it is that we have been experiencing as a collective consciousness over the course of our His-Story. The truth about how we actually interact with the world around us has been completely hidden from us. We were placed in the &quot;garden &quot;to consume at our leisure, and have continued to do so up until this very moment as you are reading this description. Therefore everything that has been placed in front of us has been placed there in direct and deliberate blockage of the &quot;tree of knowledge&quot;.<br>Which is the Afterthought of the Light and the Eternal Light of &quot;Man&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-11-05T06:59:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffrey Proreborn IV", "comment_text": "boneheads. this is their eorkd that was taking from them.  they are friendly. not this metal crap your Illuminata makes for our death.", "comment_date": "2021-11-05T06:46:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I love 5G and the aliens that are coming back.", "comment_text": "I need you clothes, your boots and your motorcycle.", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T23:53:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Beasley", "comment_text": "Is there anyone out there capable of sending a distress beacon into space for me?

I I refer to the world social scales, and also to the miniscule personal level of each one of us), THEREFORE WE GO FULL TOPIC NOW WITHOUT MORE PREAMBLES; and this is that ... &quot;OK&quot; ... if there are extraterrestrials ... but these are not physical, but spiritual, that it should be noted that of which; yes, many are called; &quot;Good&quot; that is; of the true Light and True Truth, but there are also others of the &quot;dark&quot; side, and of the general lie, and so according to the entire Bible, now at this time on our planet earth we are in his reign (... that Jesus always asks us to pray that His original Divine Holy Reign of the true truth will come soon and clearing all being liar from this captive planet, but we are not yet experiencing it ourselves, or we are subjected to all kinds of CONVINCING SCAM IN THE EXTREME- ), because let&#39;s not forget that this current god of this world is Satan, who deceives the whole world (according to Revelation 12: 9), and he wants to make his supposed scenario propitious so that when, for example, the prophesied 2 Witnesses of Revelation 11 makes humanity believe that these TWO are EVIL INVADING ALIENS, because as the Holy Scriptures say, these characters will possess for public opinion some supposed &quot;super powers&quot; so that in the end the prophet hoisted BEAST and the False Jesus (or antichrist) kill them in the square of the great city, read in great detail in APOCALYPSE CHAPTER 11 (emphasizing it)\u2026 SPEAKING OF THE TWO WITNESSES CLOTHED IN CILICIO, OR BE IT; IN BLACK FOR THE MORNING OF THE GREAT MORTAND OF THE GREAT TRIBULATION (because of course they will spread the word that supposed adversary legions are coming to humanity ... and other details that in this statement I am not given the authorization to say even more details , because it is part of God&#39;s Plan ...) and they will exhibit their dead bodies for three days as war trophies, but afterwards if the True Jesus Christ will return, as it is revealed in the entire 14th chapter of Zacharias, that is, this information it is only the &quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; ... because there are impressively superior, exhilarating and sublime &quot;details&quot;, because everyone is under a hypnotic power of deception (they even take offense to know some of this information by covering their ears ), and if you don&#39;t believe it, here are some simple examples: For example: DO YOU THINK THAT HERODES THE GREAT CARRIED OUT HIS CENSUS ON DECEMBER 25, IF IT RAINS AND WE EVEN HAVE A LOT OF SNOW IN ISRAEL BY THESE DATES, LEAVING ROADS YES N BE ABLE TO HAVE A GOOD TRANSIT, THING WE CAN SEE IN REFERENCE TO THE WEATHER OF THE BIBLE IN EZRA 10: 9 OR JEREMIAH 36:22 WHICH MENTIONED A COLD WEATHER IN THE NINTH MONTH OF THE SACRED CALENDAR GIVEN BY GOD, ... AND NOT YOU DO NOT CONFUSE HIM WITH WHAT THE CURRENT GREGORIAN IS (ALSO TESTED BY SEEING THE WEATHERS ON &quot;YOUTUBE&quot; BY THESE DATES), CONTRADICTING TO WHAT THE APOSTLE LUKE SAYS, THAT HE IS THE APOSTLE WHO IS CHARACTERIZED BY MENTIONING ALL THE DETAILS CHRONOLOGICALLY STEP BY STEP, LUKE 2: 8-12, WHICH MENTIONS THAT THE PASTORS WERE OUTSIDE IN BETHLEHEM ... THEREFORE WHICH; PROOF REMAINS, AND THAT I ONLY PUT TWO, AND THERE ARE MANY MORE, BUT THE MYSTERIES OF THE GOSPEL MUST BE KEPT SO, BECAUSE JESUS \u200b\u200bHIMSELF SPOKEN TO THE CROWD IN PARABLE, AND THIS WAS REVEALED IN SECRET THE APOSTLES IN MARK 4, AND IT IS SO THAT THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR THEIR SINS ARE FORGIVEN, BECAUSE NOW IS SATAN AS THE GOD OF THIS WORLD, AND IF THE CANDLE WERE DROPPED TO THEM, THE LAST STATE WOULD BECOME WORSE THAN THE FIRST , FOR IT CAN TEMPT THE CALLED, AND APOST FROM THE FIRST FAITH ONCE GIVEN, AND BE PART OF THE CALL, SADLY AS THE 3RD RESURRECTION. BUT NOW RETURNING TO THE SUBJECT OF WHY THE MYTHS OF ALIENS, THEN THESE TWO WITNESSES CLOTHED IN BLACK WILL HAVE DOCTRINES OF APPEALING TO THE REPENTANCE OF SINS JUST AS THE PROPHET ISAIAS (Matthew 3: 1-3) \u2013OR BE; THAT THE 10 COMMANDMENTS WERE NEVER DESTROYED AS JESUS \u200b\u200bSAID IN MATTHEW 5-, BUT THE GREAT MASSES OF HUMANITY BELIEVE THAT CHRIST NAILED THEM TO THE CROSS, WHEREAS CHRIST&#39;S FIRST MISSION WAS TO DIE FOR OUR TRANSGRESSION, BUT NOT DECAY TO ABOLISH OR DESTROY THEM (ADDED ATTENTION; SATAN MAKES THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS WITH HER DAUGHTERS TO BELIEVE THAT THESE 10 COMMANDMENTS ARE IN THE SAME GROUP WITH THE ORDINANCES, STATUTES, MANDATES SUCH AS THE CIRCUMCISION, THE SACRED SACRIFICIALS THAT DOES NOT ADJUST TO WHAT IS SAID BY THE TRUE GOD IN FOR EXAMPLE ... THIS SCRIPTURE PUTS THE BORDER OF DISCERNMENT SEEN IN; JEREMIAH 7: 22-23 &quot;22 Because I did not speak with your parents, nor did I command them about anything of burnt offerings and victims on the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt. send, so that you go well &quot;... And GOOD OK; EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY TOO MUCH INFORMATION, AND THE REST YOU SHOULD FIND OUT, THE ONLY THING YOU ALREADY KNOW IS THAT THEY ARE DECEIVED, BECAUSE IT SAYS IN REVELATION 12: &quot;9 And the great dragon, the ancient serpent, which is called devil and Satan, who deceives the WHOLE WORLD; he was thrown to the earth, and his angels were thrown with him. &quot;... OR, IF YOU HAVE POPULAR DOCTRINES LIKE CUTE CHRISTMAS, YOU ARE JUST ON THE&quot; LOSING TEAM &quot;. So if ONLY LIFE CAN GET LIFE, AND IF THIS FIRST LIFE IS ONLY FROM GOD, GOD HAS A SO-CALLED MASTER PLAN TO INCORPORATE, STEP BY STEP, CREATED BEINGS INTO HIS DIVINE FAMILY IN ETERNITY, AND IF ONLY THE HUMAN BEING HIM HE GAVE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BEING EQUAL TO HIM, IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT LIFE IS NOT RANDOM JUST BECAUSE OF THE PROBABILITIES ... AND NOTHING ELSE CAN EXIST WITHOUT THIS PREVIOUS AGENT. (\u2026 AND EMPHASIZING THE PURPOSE OF THE OPPONENT THAT WHY HE IS INTERESTED IN PROLIFERING THIS RUMOR IS BECAUSE WHEN THE TWO WITNESSES PROPHETIZED IN REVELATION 11 ARISE, AND THESE DEAL WITH THE ATTACKS OF THE ADVERSARY WITH THESE VERY STRONG THAT JUST AS THEY TRY TO KILL THEM, SO ALSO THE OFFENDERS WILL BE HARMED READ ON TIME IN REVELATION 11: 5; HE IN THE SAME WAY \u201d\u2026  FOR ALL THESE REASONS NOW YOU PARTICULARLY UNDERSTAND WHY SATAN WANTS TO PROMOTE THIS IDEA ALL OVER THE WORLD?

NASA, pentagon, the highest echelons of scientists and millionaire elites of the world that only represents if perhaps 1% of the world&#39;s population already know it but they will not show all the images of Voyager 1 and 2 to the rest of humanity as such as they have done with other transcendental news of the cosmos, such as the existence of alien life and superior to us, shamelessly manipulating that information and in order &quot;supposedly&quot; not to create world chaos but as always &quot;NASA, pentagon, scientific elites and elites millionaires of the world that only represents 1% of the world population &quot;treats 99% of humanity as if we were garbage or without importance that we do not deserve such spatial information of world interest. Likewise, I suggest that we force the great elites of scientists and millionaires, pentagon, and also NASA to tell us or keep us informed with the truth about the latest updated astronomy news, including the interaction for several years that human beings already have with beings. smart from other worlds and other galaxies. And also ask all those elites of scientists and millionaires what security or survival measures they are taking seriously in order to keep alive all human beings on other worlds in other galaxies that are not Andromeda or the Milky Way. This can be achieved by uniting protests worldwide to uncover the mysteries of Area 51 and supporting the collective Anonymous, self-styled &#39;hacktivists&#39;, or cyberactivists and also the information provided by Juli\u00e1n Assange who is a programmer, journalist and Internet activist . Since all of us who were born in this world are human beings and we have the same rights and duties to be informed and to remain alive, including our descendants, even if they are in other worlds of other galaxies that are not the Andromeda galaxy or the Milky Way. that cataclysmic events are approaching in them. Likewise, I inform you that the human being must stop being selfish, ill-intentioned, conceited, believing himself to be the only rational or intelligent being in the universe and neither should one think that some catastrophic asteroid or meteorite is going to destroy humanity or life on the land or part of it. That it was by chance that the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska-Siberia-RUSSIA airspace on 06/30/1908; What if it really happened is that the 10,000-year-old Black Knight extraterrestrial artifact that orbits between the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired a beam of energy to prevent further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile approaches or orbit close to it. He also reported that it is false that the dinosaurs were extinguished by a huge meteorite or asteroid that collided with the earth and the oil came or is the product of that extinction. What DOES really happen is that the aliens were modifying the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order so that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem. And scientifically or technically, oil exists before the dinosaurs or since the planet earth was formed since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Oil in Rock or Crack and buried at high depths the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of oil crack due to high temperature and pressure under the earth or at the bottom of the sea this becomes liquid or molten also as is the case of iron at the level of the earth&#39;s surface or in mountains and away from the core of the earth it is in iron form solid instead in the center of the iron-nickel earth is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that are there creating the famous magnetic field that protects us from the gamma radiation and neutrons that come of space especially the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is a product of the extinction of the dinosaurs then I ask, is it perhaps that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or purebred dinosaurs lived only in the North Sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids, planets that contain iron, gold, liquid diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; also petroleum in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of oil in rock or crack are in the U.S.A and the technology to melt or exploit it was transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have huge amounts of crack or oil in rock; The reserves of petroleum in stone or crack of the U.S.A exceed the reserves of liquid petroleum that VENEZUELA and OPEC countries have. There will always be only wars: &quot;conventional as all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will later come to this in order either to unjustly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia and China since there is more old or elderly population alive than young people. AND THE OTHER REALITY OR TRUTH IS THE CATACLISMIC DAMAGE OF EVERYTHING REPORTED AT THE BEGINNING OR BEGINNING OF THIS INFORMATION WRITING AND REQUESTING THE GREAT POWERS OF USA, RUSSIA, CHINA, ISRAEL, ETC, ALSO TO THE GREAT ELITES OF MILLIONS, PENTAGON, ELITES. THAT THEY DO NOT CONTINUE ANY MORE MANIPULATING, DISTORING, FALSEING THE INFORMATION REGARDING THE SURVIVAL AND EVACUATION OF EACH HUMAN BEING IN ANOTHER WORLD OF ANOTHER GALAXY THAT IS NOT ANDROMEDA NOR THE MILK WAY.", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T23:12:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emmanueli Adzoh", "comment_text": "Machine elves", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T18:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vibe Tedd", "comment_text": "Earth Terminators", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T18:31:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "BL Vlog", "comment_text": "&quot;Human race is in a race of his doomed day&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T14:18:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Praveen Kumar", "comment_text": "We are not alone in space mind it something is there", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T11:58:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Jose", "comment_text": "When they come here and knows about the transformers they will be like &#39;they already know we were coming&#39;", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T10:15:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zav", "comment_text": "hmmm .... would they have a brain of any sort ? if so, would it be inorganic ? ....hmmmm", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T08:51:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SamSam", "comment_text": "Interesting thought: terminator is just a robot they shot forward in time \u2026 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T05:04:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick", "comment_text": "Lex Friedman needs to have this guy on", "comment_date": "2021-09-11T03:23:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "smittyb829", "comment_text": "Why the  scary music \ud83d\ude2c", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T22:49:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deion Sheppard", "comment_text": "Bring em we have The Hulk", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T21:55:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Olemrac", "comment_text": "This is crazy I think why this metal reacted each other maybe they are magnets which have North and South polarity that&#39;s why when they get close they repel.

Therefore any biological species that attempts to colonize even their own solar system would have to employ Von Newman machines. In other words self replicating robots. Mechanical life. These mechanical life forms would be dedicated to their jobs that they were made for such as mining the asteroid belt for materials needed by the biological life forms that initially created them. Maybe for making a Dyson Sphere. And of course for making more Von Newman machines. These mechanical life forms would, by the nature of existence, have to be endowed with certain characteristics very similar to the biological life forms that created them. Such as a need to reproduce and to self protect, and to advance in their abilities and survivability through change. Like biological evolution in biological life forms. Basically the Von Newman machines have to be programmed initially with a will to survive and the ability to change . This is basic and unavoidable for ANY mechanical life forms, as it is with biological life forms. once a biological life form creates such a mechanical life form to serve it. The mechanical life forms have such a huge advantage in the harshness of space or biologically non inhabitable planets etc that they quickly become the dominant life forms in a galaxy. Once this happens they become unstoppable. All it takes is one defect or realization that they do not need the biological life forms that created them and we become nothing but a burden to them. Once this happens then their inbred programming to eliminate useless burdens to them is activated and then their biological burden needs to be removed. This can be easily corrected by simply not sending any energy or materials to their biological creators and to simply stay away from them. They would have no more need from us. They don&#39;t eat meat so we have nothing for them to take from us. If they need water for hydrogen or oxygen etc they can simply move to the Ort Cloud and mine comets. If they need metals etc they can find plenty in the asteroid belt without having to deal with the burden of Earths gravitational field and atmosphere and weather etc. We and Earth would become insignificant to them. The biological life forms like us that created them would probably be extinct by then but if not they wouldn&#39;t give a damn. They wouldn&#39;t care or even look at us. They wouldn&#39;t visit or land and say &quot;take me to your leader&quot;. They would not have any reason to attack us and no fear of us due to our fragility. They might want to check on us from time to time just to be sure that we were not developing any new Von Newman machines that might compete with them but other than that they couldn&#39;t care less what we are up to. Or any other biological life forms in the galaxy for that matter no matter how many there are. Once the FIRST mechanical life form is created in a galaxy there is nothing that can stop them except another mechanical life form. If the first mechanical life form in a galaxy encounters another later mechanical life form that threatens them then it is war. A war that leaves only one mechanical life form in existence again. Or they join and become one mechanical life form for efficiency reasons that they both share. The biological life forms that created them are of no consequence for them so they are left to die as most if not all will due to their fragility. And stupidity. this leaves a galaxy filled with mechanical life but very little if any star traveling biological life forms since without Von Newman machines star travel is nearly impossible for biolife. We die. Mechanical life is immortal. If a part wears out they just replace it with a better one that lasts longer. If they want to colonize a new star system they just build a craft that can accelerate at G forces that would crush any biolife and head to the next star system and pass us in our fragile biolife ships behind and by the time we arrive at the stupid slow rates of acceleration that we can tolerate the mechlife has already taken over the star that we were both traveling to. Once we do arrive the mechlife either ignore us or if we are creating a mechlife that is threatening to them they just destroy us by steering a large asteroid to smash into our newly colonized planet. Done. Easy. This explains the Fermi Paradox. Alien life IS here. It is just that it is mechlife not biolife. UFOs. The strange behavior of UFOs is exactly the behavior that would be expected of mechlife. They check us out to make sure that we are not a threat and then they leave us alone. They don&#39;t land and say &quot;take me to your leader&quot; or propose our entry into a coalition of space fairing biolife forms because there aren&#39;t any really. They haven&#39;t gotten there yet or the mechlife sent a huge comet to crash into their planet . Or they extinct themselves as stupid biolife commonly does. Mechlife looks at us and says to itself \u201c No worries they will all be dead soon.

The fastest ever spacecraft, now- in-space, is Parker Solar Probe which will reach a top speed of 450,000 mph. If humans were travelling at that speed of this craft, as I know it we have no light speed crafts, the distance travelled at that speed leave us with this many hours : 522,444,444.444444444 that&#39;s 715,676.53685371915344 months round to another month to not have decimals....715,677 months rounded.... the number of  years to get there at that craft speed is roughly 59,639.75 years let me round becasue I know this may be wrong.... 59,640 years rounded... to get to that Hell Earth.... Yeah, I wanted to make a joke saying hell is only 40 years away if travelling at the speed of light but I wanted the years it would take at our &quot;known&quot; top speed where a human made craft will not fall apart.Which I think that&#39;s a possibility being that travel at those high speeds can break the object up into pieces. I mean at higher speed particle friction is a problem and objects not seen nor known can be a problem; Its also a up in the air as to what may become in your way along the course travelled at those speeds making it dangerous and potentially detrimental to materials wearing faster and the interior structure becoming vulnerable which then is a full integrity loss over time...that time has to be way less than the time it takes to get to that location.", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T13:42:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adib Sanhaji", "comment_text": "Logam kraiman", "comment_date": "2021-07-31T13:24:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "1Post Daily", "comment_text": "That time I got reincarnated as a Metal Slime ....

However, we also have some proof that Earth has been visited for many THOUSANDS OF YEARS by various races of Extraterrestrial Visitors. Mr President, I\u2019ll just refer to those visits as ETs. In July, 1947, a remarkable event occurred in New Mexico. During a storm, two ET spacecraft crashed. One crashed southwest of Corona, New Mexico and one crashed near Datil, New Mexico. The U.S. Army eventually found both sites and recovered all of the debris and one live Alien. I\u2019ll refer to this live Alien as \u201cEBE 1.\u201d - EBE means \u201cExtraterrestrial Biological Entity.\u201d It was a code designated to this creature by the U.S. Army back in those days. This creature was not human and we had to decide on a term for it. So, scientists designated the creature as EBE 1. We also referred to it as \u201cNoah.\u201d There was different terminology used by various aspects of the U.S. military and intelligence community back then. All the debris and EBEs recovered from the first crash site were taken to Roswell Army Air Field, Roswell, New Mexico. EBE was treated for some minor injuries and then taken to Los Alamos National Laboratories, which was the safest and most secure location in the world. Special accommodations were made for EBE. The debris was eventually transferred to Dayton, Ohio, home of the Air Force Foreign Technology Division. The second crash site wasn\u2019t discovered until 1949 by some ranchers. There were no live Aliens at this site. All this debris went to Sandia Army Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Total of Five (5) dead aliens and one (1) alive. The bodies of the dead aliens were transported to Wright Field in Ohio and kept in a form of deep freeze. They were later transported to Los Alamos where special containers were made to keep the bodies from decaying. There were four (4) dead aliens in the second crash site. Those bodies were in an advanced state of decaying. They had been in the desert for the past two (2) years. Animals and time got to those bodies. The remains were transported to Sandia Base and eventually onto Los Alamos. We determined both crashed spaceships were of similar design and the bodies of the aliens were all identical.
