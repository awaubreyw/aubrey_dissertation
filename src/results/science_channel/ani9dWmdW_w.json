They used a two piece driveshaft and a single carrier bearing for mine (a 72&quot; stretch). Limos are a lot like RVs... there are a couple of companies that make parts for a multitude of limo manufacturers. Mine had a secondary HVAC box behind the driver&#39;s compartment with a second heater core and AC evaporator. It had air shocks, but otherwise looked like the original Lincoln coils in the rear. Two batteries and a 200A alternator - may have been an option from Lincoln. The rear compartment solenoid looked the same as one used for a 1950s Ford starter. The biggest issue was glass, lots of custom, curved glass. Once some kids broke the rear door glass. The doors were stretched about 8&quot; and had custom glass. I had to have a polycarbonate window custom made because the original supplier was out of business. They literally spliced the original wire harness going to the back of the car to extend it.
