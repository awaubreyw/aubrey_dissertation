They use lower quality fruit (meaning bruised, broken, animal bitten, etc) because it is going to be ground up. &#39;Perfect&#39; apples are sorted with a higher level of quality in mind and go to the shelves. Sanitation requirements by the FDA, OSHA and local inspection agencies mean, regardless of any rust, tarnishing or other imperfections in machinery, the equipment used to process the cider was rigorously tested for proper functionality, and probably steam cleaned with a bleach solution the night before, and again that night. American standards for food are some of the strictest in the world, and the factory that produces this food is in America. No, it is not a perfectly sterile environment like an operating theater or a microprocessor manufacturing facility, where even the slightest bacterium or mote of dust can mean a dead patient or ruined product.<br> <br>If you are this concerned with cleanliness, you should stop breathing immediately, let alone ever eat anything again. I&#39;m not exaggerating. The world is astoundingly filthy, from the air you breath to phone you use, to the money you spend, to every surface you come in contact with, to the very bodies you inhabit even a second after you step out of the shower. Any insignificantly small amounts of ground up apple worms or rusty equipment utterly pale in comparison to what you encounter on a daily basis, and I suspect you don&#39;t bathe yourself and your living quarters daily in a scalding shower of bleach water.<br> <br>In closing, all dirt is actually poop.
