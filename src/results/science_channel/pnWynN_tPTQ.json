Dont forget that despite the struggles and madness in this world today, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can&#39;t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. <br><br>Christ says in John 16:33: I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have\u00a0[perfect]\u00a0peace. In the world you have tribulation\u00a0and\u00a0distress\u00a0and\u00a0suffering, but be courageous\u00a0[be confident, be undaunted, be filled with joy];\u00a0I have overcome the world.\u201d\u00a0[My conquest is accomplished, My victory abiding.]<br>-\u00a0 (AMPLIFIED version) <br><br>NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. Regardless of what you&#39;ve done or what you&#39;re going through you CAN make it through Jesus xx", "comment_date": "2022-02-14T08:31:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ravina Purewal", "comment_text": "cute baby \ud83d\ude0e", "comment_date": "2022-02-14T06:37:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thawnaurora", "comment_text": "wow. thank you Doctor!", "comment_date": "2022-02-08T07:39:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HAECHAN'S soccermom", "comment_text": "I did this to my nephew whenever he would cry", "comment_date": "2022-02-08T03:04:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Short & Cute videos\ud83d\udc96", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude3b", "comment_date": "2022-02-06T15:28:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Renee Martin", "comment_text": "So cute", "comment_date": "2022-02-04T22:25:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brittney Forrester", "comment_text": "Here I am 4 babies later, thinking I was going to find a baby crying video to give my fianc\u00e9&#39; a taste of what&#39;s to come...then BOOM I find this!!

I went over to her and whispered, \u201cgently rock him from side to side,\u201d which she did.  In about 3 minutes the boy was sound asleep. I told her that the sideway motion is the same motion of a pregnant woman with the baby still inside. Each time she walks, the baby is gently rocked side to side.  So that it becomes an inborn experience a person never forgets. Put me in a rocking chair and guess who falls asleep.  It may be forward and backwards but the gentle rocking motion of an unborn child <br>kicks in and off to slumberland you go.  That\u2019s why a woman holding a baby will rock it side to side to make it fall asleep.

In the bible it days, who knows the ways of the Lord.\u00a0 Even when he wanted to talk to Moses, the had to show him his back, because no human can see God&#39;s face and live, he couldn&#39;t show his glory, because it in the face, the face is how you recognise someone. Also, after 40 days with God Moses face was shining. If you need proof of\u00a0 God&#39;s\u00a0 existence, search scientists find Jesus&#39;s tomb.\u00a0 No one would die for something that isn&#39;t true.\u00a0 The bible le says we christians would be persecuted in the end times, look now, on\u00a0 youtube, search christian persecution, you&#39;ll get loads of stuff, but with Muslims or anything else, youlle get none. The bible says people will love themselves, we now call that narcissism, the bible says people will love money, and hate him, what do people do today, he said great things will happen, and the world will soon go through a great tribulation. In the tribulation, 1/3 of the world will burn 1/3 of the water will become blood, and 1/3 people killed, then some other stuff and demand will torture them. I as a christian, have found hope in christ, but all people who reject Jesus, like you right now, will be thrown in fire for ever, no end, no rescue, Jesus will feel bad, because he loves you, but you rejected him, only living can allow him, so use the time you have now to seek Jesus, he says Those who seek him he will never turn away. In hell, unbelievers, and those rejecting Jesus, will burn FOREVER and EVER, God is a just God, je hates sin, but loves us sinners, that&#39;s why he gave Jesus. Jesus is the only escape route. While people who rejected Jesus are in hell, God will dwell among us, he will make a new heaven and earth, and we will be his people, and e will be our God. We will dwell with all animals that went extinct, like dinosaurs, lions, and e.t.c. no murder, no death, no sin. Forever will be like that. No bad. But he&#39;ll will be like that as well, no end to the tortured and people think of hell as a nice rock party place, but it&#39;s a place where you burn forever, and the devil will as well, he will not be resistant, but will be going through the pain as you, he was the top and most powerful, and wise Angel of GOD, but he led a revolt, taking 1/3 of the angels with him. Because he thought he could be God, he will be cast down forever, and he is trying to decide many people before he does, he wants souls with him in hell. I am trembling writing this to you, because I know if you pass a blind eye, you will get that fate. Why do you think many movies have the devil, demonic things, the number of the devil (three sixes). He is a deciever, and the god of this world. I don&#39;t want you in hell please.

I now have 2 daughters in their mid to late 20&#39;s. When they were infants and toddlers they were amazing. They both slept thru the night within a few weeks of coming home from the hospital. They potty trained quickly, the eldest walked early, I always got comments on how polite/well behaved they were and still are to this day. The only issues I had with them were that even tho I wanted to breastfeed I was/am ill and my body couldn&#39;t produce enough milk for my first daughter so I had to supplement with formula. I was prepared for this with my youngest and with my doctor&#39;s help I was able to breastfeed for the full 6 months I wanted to. However, I had to work the evening she started on formula and after just 2 or 3 hours my father in law, who was babysitting alone for the first time, called me and said she was tossing up and crying. I thought maybe he was just a little overwhelmed so I gave him some basic instructions to calm her and get her to sleep. 2 hours later he called again and said she was still crying and still tossing up. That was so out of the ordinary that I called in a replacement, called my husband and headed home. We drove an hour to the hospital and the doctor examined her and thank goodness she was perfectly fine, she was simply lactose intolerant. He gave us a couple tins of soy formula and sent us home with a much happier baby. The soy formula smelled horrible and babies often spit up while being burped after they eat and they drool quite a bit, turns out regurgitated soy formula smells even worse.

He is essentially opening or expanding the ribcage by crossing the arms. He is also slightly tractioning the back by having baby at that angle. Thirdly by doctor rocking baby&#39;s butt only, he is creating a pivot point in the spinal column where any &quot;restrictions&quot; can be loosened or relieved. These restricted vertebrae in the spinal column have nerves in them that are slightly compressed. Causing discomfort for baby. These same nerves supply the stomach with information to produce HCL or stomach acid to break down food. If baby&#39;s nerves have too much pressure, proper signals to produce HCL after baby eats will not be met. Resulting in food that is not being broken down properly and simply sitting and rotting in the stomach. This typically results in baby with gas build up and discomfort. Baby will cry all night. This is why put putting them in a car seat will sometimes work. It takes pressure off a compressed nerve. This is similar to finding relief in poping a certain part of your back after a meal and feeling like you can digest food better.", "comment_date": "2017-11-03T16:40:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Miz.

It&#39;s simpler and tested for up to 5 months : <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BdqPKPHgxM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BdqPKPHgxM</a><br><br>In his video the pediatrician holds the baby at arm&#39;s length while holding his chin and blocking both arms with one hand, the other hand carries it, then he makes him go up and down as he moves forward. It&#39;s very effective, but ...<br><br>- When the baby becomes heavier, already a week or two, you start to feel the weight.<br>- It is difficult to hold both arms and chin, need a calm baby and be very muscular.<br>- The baby becomes heavier and very difficult to maintain, not to mention the risks of falling. With my wife we \u200b\u200bonly made it above the bed or the sofa.<br><br>After reflection, we wondered why this method works? And we wondered if it is not the sensation of acceleration and deceleration that calms the child? Sensation that we know in elevators or rides at sensations. So I tried to reproduce these sensations by not holding the baby at arm&#39;s length but carrying it against me. And surprise ! it works, even better. After having tested it ourselves with our daughter, we had it tested by relatives and the result was positive.<br><br>After this discovery, I thought of all these parents who take their baby to take a ride in order to calm him down. It is the same thing, are the slight accelerations and decelerations that have a calming effect on him.<br> <br>It&#39;s up to you to test and let me know your comments. I really need your positive or negative feedback, thanks;)<br><br>Dan", "comment_date": "2017-09-29T08:11:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "droid commander The spinosaurus", "comment_text": "&quot;Here we have a crying baby&quot; no shit sherlock i can hear it!", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T19:11:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamie McFall", "comment_text": "The babes can see and check stuff out while chillin in a comfy familiar hold perfect catch and technique doc", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T06:07:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Comey's Curtains", "comment_text": "Pretty sure he is just shaking babies.", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T04:39:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kathleen beckett", "comment_text": "That womans hairdresser should be sued.

This was established through Child Development research many decades ago. Folding  the arms across the chest mimics swaddling the child tightly with the arms in that same position. I&#39;m not a medical person, nor even a parent, but I learned about the inner ear at university. I learned about the arms across the chest when I was training to become a baby holder for premature and sick infants. Whenever possible I held the baby such that its head was next to my heart because that sound is similar to mom&#39;s heartbeat when the baby was still in the womb.<br>I trained myself to lower my respiration to 2 and 1/4 breaths per minute while holding a baby. This helped to induce their own calmness and significantly lowered their own heart rate and respiration rate as they relaxed. I once held a baby who was on withdrawal from drugs and was having a mini convulsion every 3 seconds. I was told don&#39;t worry the baby won&#39;t be quiet. I did my breathing exercise and the baby&#39;s convulsions became sporadic, and eventually stopped completely. I held the baby for another 40 minutes. After laying the baby down I stood by the quiet bed for another 20 minutes before I left the unit. <br>As I passed by, the nurse looked at me and asked &quot;Who are you?&quot;  I replied &quot; Nobody special, but my nephew calls me Uncle Natewatl.&quot;<br>Live and learn.", "comment_date": "2017-09-15T20:25:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mindy Rawson aka IamMimisMusic", "comment_text": "Right on!", "comment_date": "2017-09-15T17:49:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "N.S-J.", "comment_text": "It just simulates the womb i knew this already, discovered quit a while ago.", "comment_date": "2017-09-14T16:00:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "djimbej", "comment_text": "Baby was paid.
