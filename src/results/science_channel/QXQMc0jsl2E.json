It&#39;s not because the glass is a liquid that slowly slumps and deforms over time,  it was made that way.   Float glass uses a bath of molten tin, which melts at a much lower temperature and also happens to be more dense than molten glass, so the glass floats like oil and water, hence the name.   You really begin to appreciate all the craftsmanship and time that went into building a new house 100 years ago.  The windows,  the horsehair plaster &amp; lathe walls, the crown molding and cabinetry,  you feel a sense of charm and nostalgia that you can can&#39;t get with new construction where they can built a home in just a few months", "comment_date": "2021-12-19T13:01:11Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "\uff2c\uff25\uff27\uff29\uff34  \uff27\uff21\uff2d\uff29\uff2e\uff27", "comment_text": "My left ear enjoyed it\ud83d\ude42", "comment_date": "2021-12-13T12:48:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Return To The Truth", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXQMc0jsl2E&amp;t=2m17s\">2:17</a> The Guy in Green Shirt Needs to be Careful", "comment_date": "2021-12-12T02:29:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nayana Gowda", "comment_text": "Dd", "comment_date": "2021-12-06T01:37:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kyle", "comment_text": "My left ear loved this", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T17:06:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christiana Eweto", "comment_text": "Another herdle to jump over.", "comment_date": "2021-11-09T19:43:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Big.D.
