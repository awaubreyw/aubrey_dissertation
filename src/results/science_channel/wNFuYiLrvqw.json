(4) In July 1947, I was stationed at Fort Worth Army Air Field [later Carswell Air Force Base] in Fort Worth, Texas. I served as Chief of Staff to Major General Roger Ramey, Commander, Eighth Air Force. I had the rank of Colonel. (5) In early July, I received a phone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, Deputy Commander, Strategic Air Command. He asked what we knew about the object which had been recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, as reported in the press. I called Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the Roswell Army Air Field, and directed him to send the material in a sealed container to me at Fort Worth. I so informed Maj. Gen. McMullen. (6) After the plane from Roswell arrived with the material, I asked the Base Commander, Col. Al Clark, to take possession of the material and to personally transport it in a B-26 to Maj. Gen. McMullen in Washington, D.C. I notified Maj. Gen. McMullen, and he told me he would send the material by personal courier on his plane to Benjamin Chidlaw, Commanding General of the Air Material Command at Wright Field [later Wright Patterson AFB]. The entire operation was conducted under the strictest secrecy. (7) The material shown in the photographs taken in Maj. Gen. Ramey\u2019s office was a weather balloon. The weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press. (8) I have not been paid or given anything of value to make this statement, which is the truth to the best of my recollection. Signed: T. J. Dubose Date: 9/16/91 Signature witnessed by: Linda R.

Honestly did anyone pay attention in science class? Maybe in Math Class? seems not... The closest POSSIBLY inhabitable planet is 45 THOUSAND LIGHT YEARS AWAY.... Now consider that... honestly.. consider what that really means... it means if you could travel at the speed of light (which you can&#39;t) it would take you FORTY FIVE THOUSAND YEARS to get to that first (maybe there is life on it but most likely not) Planet... EVEN IF YOU COULD TRAVEL AT 45 TIMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT... IT WOULD TAKE YOU A THOUSAND YEARS TO GET THERE.. and what are you going to use for propulsion? If you broke the entire oceans of the earth down to Oxygen and Hydrogen you wouldn&#39;t have enough to get there.. and how would you even do that? ... so people put out stupid ideas of Worm Holes or Nuclear Powered Craft.. you are so seriously incompetent you shouldn&#39;t even be allowed to tie your shoe laces let alone have laces on your shoes because you will probably get yourself tangled up in them and choke yourself to death because you are so impossibly stupid... The fact is and everyone with a brain knows this... the earth will have massive famines and wars before and exterminate ourselves within the next 200 years because of population growth which doubles the population every 10 years and to believe that you are going to escape to Mars or the Moon or anywhere else is total denial of humanity&#39;s real problem.. we won&#39;t have to ban Oil in about 75 years because there won&#39;t be enough of it left to power anything and we will be preserving it to make plastics and other products necessary to survive and the only global warming we will have to worry about is that from Global Nuclear War... I am glad I won&#39;t be here for any of that but consider the migration patterns of people today moving from lands that won&#39;t support life to highly populated lands and then consider that over population will destroy farm lands .. this is no joke you only have to look to Asia today where population growth is out of control and then realize that they can&#39;t control it even if governments put in place one child laws.. We are feeling the beginning of this.. our children will see it starting to happen .. our great grand children will experience it full on... and the clown show of Space Travel and all these other stupid things like global warming need to be put in proper perspective.  ............ dang why didn&#39;t you pay attention in science class because this really is not difficult to predict and realize.", "comment_date": "2022-07-14T18:30:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bart Dye", "comment_text": "You people will believe anything", "comment_date": "2022-07-14T17:59:46Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Bart Dye", "comment_text": "Such bullcrap", "comment_date": "2022-07-14T17:59:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Cruz", "comment_text": "I am a ailen...\u00a3\u00a2|\u2022\u20ac\u20ac", "comment_date": "2022-07-14T17:08:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nunya biz", "comment_text": "There&#39;s another documentary about this too.
