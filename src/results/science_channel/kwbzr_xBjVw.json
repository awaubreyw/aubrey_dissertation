He first educated himself in basics of physics. Understood them thoroughly by applying real world problems. Then visualized each and every problem he could observe in everyday life and tried to create the analogy that will stand for principles that seemed either fiction or garbage, much like how Christianity spewed the garbage of earth being the center-of-earth which was proven false by Leonardo da Vinci, for which he was casted out, lived and died alone like a beggar in his latter days. <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Lets take an example from video, space in the example here is represented by a fabric (in mathematical sense - in 2dimensional because understanding space in 3d is much harder, like a circle is in 2d, but in 3d, it is represented as sphere or a ball in the easiest way.) So by putting an heavy object, bends the fabric thus attracting lighter object towards it. And that&#39;s gravity.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Another simple example is Famous Titanic. Consider the surface of ocean as simple fabric in space-time. One the titanic starts sinking, its own weight pulled up a lot water around it, thereby pulling down every surviving and swimming soul nearby to its eventual death. <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Now this is how a wormhole can be thought of. Take a kitchen sink, and block its hole with towel, fill the entire sink with water. Now remove the towel and you will see a swirl of water in the middle, creating a hole. That&#39;s your  wormhole in space. Problem is you have to open the door from the other side to make a whole or push through the space. And just like a mass of water was able to create that swirl in the middle, same way you need a lot of mass to create a wormhole and to control that mass, you need a lot of energy too. Thus the conclusion,  blackhole, controlled can warp and create wormhole through space and time. Its not the exact example but i guess can be thought of as a stepping stone.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Einstein observed these daily scenarios, created analogies, applied those and was able to demonstrate with full confidence. And since these explanations were as simple as daily life problems that can be observed, visualized, analyzed and scrutinized and yet no body can say that its some cheap trick of the hand, he won the argument without making one.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>Funny things is it took him 2 World wars to wait for, so that couple of astronomers who I think went to the other part of the desolate desert in Australia, with their big lenses, took the snapshot of solar eclipse that proved that light from other stars can be bend by a heavier object in space, thus proving the effect of gravity and general relativity.<br><br>Moral is - &quot;Visualization is a power tool, if applied correctly&quot;. <br><br>Physics is not that hard to understand. Its like boxing. You need to train hard, visualize the next punch coming and move fast enough to avoid and hit at the same time.

Speed of light in vacuum is the constant limit.<br><br>Speed(constant) = Distance/time.<br><br>So if the light travels 100 m in the train(very fast train) and 50 m outside the train in T seconds. Then, this will cause the time in the train to dilate 2 times longer. Speed = 100/2T = 50/T and so now both have the same speed. But, now the time in the train is 2x longer( 2T : T ) than outside the train.<br><br>(I don&#39;t know if this is correct with the real formula, but this is just a way to understand the concept)<br><br>There is something called length contraction too.

We brought it for ourselve to ease our difficulties in measuring and simplyfyin stuff..  But theres no real time..

Biological change?  The other twin gets old and the another doesnt..  Well factor associated to our anatomy and our bilogicak structre.

First of all, some claims are wrong: before 1905, there was experimental both theoretical arguments (from Maxwell&#39;s equations) and observational evidences of the invariance of the speed of light (Michelson-Morley experiment), the equations of special relativity were known before Einstein (hence the name Lorentz&#39; equations - not to mention the role of Poincar\u00e9). Einstein brought a new light on those ideas which he latter developed and a deep physical explanation but he was not alone in that quest. Also, I don&#39;t think that the explanation by Michio Kaku at 25&quot; really helps here (but that&#39;s a detail).<br><br>But most importantly, the presentation of the reaction of the scientific community seems crazy. The new ideas proposed by Einstein surely needed some time to be accepted but depicting the reaction of Philipp Lenard as representative is wrong: many physicist accepted the theory (precisely because of the observational evidences and previous theoretical arguments). By the way, it seems that Lenard was not always that crazy (although he ended being crazy). And the idea that scientist&#39;s refused the theory because they based their career on Newtonian mechanics is wrong (electromagnetism and thermodynamics were already well established sciences); it&#39;s not exactly what the speaker says at 2&#39;05&quot; but I fear that it can be interpreted, given current taste for pseudo-sociological arguments, as &quot;they refused the idea solely because their career was at stake&quot;.<br><br>Clearly not a great video (poorly presents the ideas and their impact).", "comment_date": "2020-11-07T13:03:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ching ho", "comment_text": "If Einstein would have traveled faster than light, he would have been still with us", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T04:55:00Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Invit123", "comment_text": "This title is incredibly funny because if you know anything about physics then this entire documentary will absolutely enrage you... the explanations are so oversimplified to the point of not actually explaining anything at all, Einstein\u2019s logic is made to seem unattainable and mystified, and the politics are just way overblown.", "comment_date": "2020-11-01T20:36:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sparsh", "comment_text": "According to me if there is a giant and a human then the distance travelled by the giant will be a special unit and time would be different for giant as compared to human", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T09:12:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PRETOM Mitra", "comment_text": "SIR U IS THE BEST SCIENTIST , LEGEND IS ALWAYS LEGEND", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T16:57:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kunal halder", "comment_text": "What about Schrodinger&#39;s Cat?!", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T19:36:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cipher7", "comment_text": "Mind blown\ud83e\udd2f", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T15:27:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Bello Mellies", "comment_text": ":-)", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T22:38:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "slapthelip", "comment_text": "this acting is hilarious", "comment_date": "2020-10-17T00:04:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gokhel barik", "comment_text": "I want to know how a change in time affects the age of our body?How body can know within that I am on Jupiter or I am on earth\ud83d\ude15", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T13:48:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "abhishek deshpande", "comment_text": "It&#39;s very easy to make documentary on Einstein.
