A less advanced species is still too far away to be seen or likely found by any of our technology to date. A more advanced species really isn&#39;t going to be too interested in us as we are not as exciting as we think we are. Do you bother to talk to your cat and explain your way of life to it? Probably not. Are you going to try to teach it to drive and help it evolve? No. Why would you waste your time. It&#39;s a cat. Its role is your pet and companion.

I turned and looked and it was a windy day with a lot of grey fast-moving clouds in the sky. In the direction that my friend pointed, at an altitude of what I estimate to be approx. 12,000ft, (I&#39;m an amateur skydiver and am familiar with estimating altitude), staying in the same place but rotating slowly as the clouds rushed by, was a black triangle with lights on it similar or identical to the one in this clip. Considering the distance it was from us and the size it was compared to the clouds, it seemed to be huge; maybe 2 to 3 times the width of a Boeing 747. When I first saw it I didn&#39;t think it might be a UFO but thought it might be a hang-glider and that my eyes were playing tricks on me, but it was just staying in one place while rotating and not moving even though the wind was very strong. We watched it, fascinated, for about 2 minutes before the clouds blocked it out and we couldn&#39;t see it anymore.

They have to start descent which would make the magnetic field very strong pulling down the aeroplane causing it to crash.  Think of it as gravity.
