Who is Jesus?<br>Born of a virgin, Mary.<br>Matthew Chapter 1 verse 20: &quot; behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him (Joseph), in a dream and said, &quot;Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for that (Christ)which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.<br>Jesus, the Christ, is God&#39;s word made flesh. Jesus is Jehovah God&#39;s (The Creator&#39;s) Word made into flesh.<br>1 John chapter 5 verse 7: &quot; For there are three that bear a record in heaven, The Father, The Word, and the Holy Spirit: and these three are one.&quot;<br>John chapter 1 verse 1: &quot;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>John chapter 1 verse 14: &quot; And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.&quot;<br>John chapter 1 verse 10: &quot; He was in the world, and the world\u00a0 knew Him not.&quot;<br>Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12: &quot; For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.&quot;<br>How beautiful and awesome is God&#39;s Word, who is our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, magnificent in all His glory, is He. Amen!<br>John&#39;s Vision Of Christ Seated On His Throne In Heaven:<br>Revelation chapter 4 verse 2 to 3: &quot; Immediately, I (John), was in the Spirit, and behold a throne sat in Heaven, and One sat on the throne. And He who sat there was like a jasper and a sardius stone in appearance, and there was a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.&quot;<br>Why did Christ Jesus came and sacrificed His precious life for sinners like us?<br>Christ (God&#39;s Word made into flesh), came because through flesh (Adam&#39;s flesh) sin entered the world, and then because of sin death entered the whole earth. Through flesh(Jesus Christ&#39;s flesh), the earth will be saved, sin is destroyed, and the curse of death\u00a0 shall be broken, death and the grave shall be cast into hell.<br>Christ, who is God&#39;s Word made into flesh, sacrificed His life for us. He was crucified for our sins and transgressions.<br>Christ died, and on the third day He resurrected in the flesh, conquering death and the grave. Now,\u00a0 Christ is seated in Heaven, at the right hand of Power(God). Through Christ&#39;s sacrifice we gain Salvation through God&#39;s abundant mercy and grace. We are reconciled and recompensed back to God, through the shed blood of His beloved Son Christ Jesus.<br>John chapter 3 verse 16: &quot; For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him, shall not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot;<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 8: &quot; But God demonstrates His love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;<br>Christ came to undo the sin and eternal death brought upon the world through the sin of Adam.<br>Death in Adam, Life In Christ:<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 19: &quot; For as by one man&#39;s disobedience(Adam), many were made sinners, so also by one Man&#39;s obedience(Jesus) , many will be made righteous.&quot;<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 18: &quot; Therefore, as through one man&#39;s (Adam&#39;s) offense, judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even through one Man&#39;s (Christ&#39;s) righteous act, the free gift came to all men, resulting in the justification of life.&quot;<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 17: &quot; For if by the one man&#39;s offense(Adam&#39;s offense), death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in the life through the One(Jesus Christ).<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 12: &quot; Therefore, just as through one man (Adam), sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned.&quot;<br>Romans chapter 5 verse 21: &quot; &quot;So that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;<br>\u00a0Do you now see that through Adam, sin and death entered the world, so that is why Christ Jesus came to give life, and give it more abundantly? Yes, Christ came to give eternal life through Salvation.<br>Adam&#39;s flesh brought sin, death, destruction, and condemnation.<br>1 Corinthians 15 : 21-22, &quot;For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ, all shall be made alive.&quot;<br>Christ&#39;s sacrifice, the crucifixtion\u00a0 of His flesh, brings reconciliation of sins, life, resurrection, eternal life, salvation<br>Christ is coming back again, not as a sacrificial lamb. He is coming back as a roaring, waring lion, to destroy sin, death, and the grave once and for all. Amen! Amen! Hallelujah!<br>Revelation chapter 22 verse 12 to 13: &quot; And behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be. I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last. &quot;<br>Now do you see friends, Why Christ Jesus is so Important for our Salvation? Yes.<br>Now, do you understand why there is only one way to God, and that is only through Christ Jesus? Yes.<br>Christ is Salvation. Christ is our Lord and Saviour. Christ is the only way to God. Christ is the only Mediator between God and men(us humans).<br>God loves us so much, He does not want anyone to perish in hell. God wants all sinners to be saved. That is why He sent His Word to save the world. God&#39;s Word became flesh, and dwelt among us to save us.<br>Will you accept Christ and be saved?<br>Romans chapter 6 verse 23: &quot;\u00a0 For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;<br>John Chapter 3 verse 16: &quot; For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that who ever believes in Him shall not perish, but have everlasting life.&quot;<br>Salvation is free!<br>Christ already paid the price, all you have to do is receive salvation through acceptance of Jesus Christ, Yeshua Ha Massiach, repent of your sins, and keep His commands.<br>So who is Christ?<br>He is The Word Of God. He is the Son of God. He is God. He is the image of the invisible God. He is the Alpha and Omega. He is the beginning and the end. He is the Great I Am. He is Emmanuel. He is The Christ. He is The Messiah. He is The Creator. He is our Lord and Saviour. He is our Mediator. He is the Lion and the Lamb. He is Salvation. He is the way, the truth, and life. He is The Rock. Amen! I love you Lord!<br>God created the heavens and the earth with His spoken Word. Did you know, that Jesus is that Word, through which all things were created? Yes.<br>John chapter 14 verse 6: &quot; Jesus said to him,&quot; I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.&quot;<br>Colassians chapter 1 verse 15 to 16:<br>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven, and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones, or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.&quot;<br>John chapter 1 verse 1 to 4:<br>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with\u00a0God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&quot;<br>I hope that you know Christ, and understand Christ better now, to the glory of God.\u00a0Amen!<br>Christ is for all who will receive Him.<br>This is how our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said we should pray. Matthew chapter 6 verse 9 to 13:<br>&quot;Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come. Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.&quot;<br>Now that you understand who Christ is, share Christ with others. Amen!<br>Repent of your sins. Sin no more! Be baptized in Jesus Name.<br>Submit to Jehovah-God.<br>Love God with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit. Keep God&#39;s Commandments. Love one another.<br>Forgive one another. It is written, &quot;resist the devil, submit to God, and the devil will flee from you.&quot;<br>Hate sin with all your heart, mind, body, soul, and spirit.<br>Only Jesus The Christ, can baptize you with God&#39;s Holy Spirit. Only Christ can give you The Holy Spirit, and the Gifts of The Spirit.<br>Acts 11 vs. 15 to 16, &quot; And as I began to speak, The Holy Spirit fell upon them, as upon us at the beginning. Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, &quot;John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.&quot;<br>Read Exodus Chapter 20, The 10 Commandments of God.<br>Share the Gospel of Christ with others.<br>God forgives. Mercy still abounds. But<br>one day mercy will seize, and the wrath of God will come upon all the earth.", "comment_date": "2022-04-02T20:50:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Xandimal Beach", "comment_text":

With the personality they give you to do all these things it will be too complicated. Probable acts of violence or discrimination, no work or if there is very hard. High probability of suicide. \r<br>\r<br>Procedure: there comes a time when suddenly Christ and Satan show up in front of the mirror and by deception force to choose one of the two. By choosing the first, the following things happen: Christ, the Virgin Mary and in case some saints show up and in case you are playing or having fun in any way they force you to work and toil helping someone always with their voice and their words inside your head. Their procedure consists of this: prevent you from having fun, drinking, masturbating, etc. and getting sledding like a mule.     \r<br>Being as they say second choice, you should only work from morning to night and nothing else. Anything else is not good for them. At first Christ pretends to be God and shows you how he pretends to give you gifts by putting for a moment a kind of white glow at the height of the navel and telling you that they give a &quot;gift&quot; to everyone and no more than one but in reality, they are all lies that as you go on, they come out on their own. They try to frame you with vague promises, rewards and various scum once in what they call &quot;paradise&quot;, but once they verify that the element in question doesn&#39;t take the bait (because he\u2019s not a moron!) they begin to reveal their infamous procedures that they have implemented to try to ruin his life.  \r<br>As a second choice you are given a very antisocial, extreme and stray personality so that you cannot have any kind of contact with other people (friendships, relationships) because you see everyone else as if they came from another planet and there is no kind of compatibility. In addition to this your physique is damaged with the following things and for the following reasons: first you will have few or no muscles at all as having been damaged at birth you will be sick and you will have a disposition to make revenge and war against everyone; per second you will have some knee problems that will prevent you from practicing any type of sport in a serious way and third you will have some kind of defect or imperfection in intimate parts such as various spots, in, strange shapes, etc. so as to prevent you from having any kind of relationship.     \r<br>The second choice should according to their infamous system try to remedy the wrong things that someone who died 40 years ago or more has combined. \r<br>In paradise a kind of personal &quot;circle&quot; is created where there are the spirits of all the people who have had some kind of importance in your life: family members, sports idols, musicians, actors or characters compatible with your personality or with the life you have to make. All these characters are obliged to show up and say certain phrases with the purpose of deceiving and doing things that the person in question would not do in itself. They also take advantage of the relationship of admiration you had for them when they were alive to get you to have a conversation, but it&#39;s all a lie, the real purpose is to analyze your way of thinking and acting and your personality to see if you can overcome certain obstacles, cheating and lies that will try to get you on the road.    \r<br>Of all the characters you see the Virgin Mary is the most annoying of all. She talks all the time saying a lot of lies to see if someone is so stupid to believe in it (like their altar boys) and she always and constantly repeats the same things until nausea (procedure). She cries all the time and says she&#39;s the most beautiful woman in the world.     \r<br>Their way of speaking is to repeat in your head their phrases that irritate and provoke and annoy you to the point of nausea as the angriest you are, the more your nerves jump and the more vulnerable you are to them because you could lose control of your actions and do what they want. They never believe in threats to make them stop until they are put into practice. \r<br>\r<br>At the beginning of the journey if you rebel against their infamous system, they can resort to making the devil appear.\r<br>Not having chosen him appears much poorer than he appears to his followers. He can appear in many different forms but usually appears with red eyes and the stick it uses to subdue its followers. Among the things he does to you we find: images of spiders quite credible in the head, temptations of various kinds very treacherous. At first it makes you think he wants to take you into his group by always making you trawls to try to frame yourself (for example women you might have, things that might happen to you, etc.) and then tries to bother you at night by showing you his red eyes, goat legs, strange faces and telling you to come to his group. To try to submit use a kind of feeling of great warmth at the height of the navel that is transmitted throughout the body and that almost gives the feeling of fainting. It is overcome by always being in the company of someone, as it must be stealthy and cannot leave traces. During submission attempts, every thought, everything read and seen, and every memory will be used as a weapon against you.       \r<br>On some occasions it may go so far as to tell you to give him your soul, that is, to perform the following ritual: to write explicitly your intention on a sheet of paper, to bring blood out of your body and sign with it. As a final act burn the sheet (which is absolutely to be avoided as then you do not go back).     \r<br>Their followers to get any kind of role in hell must sacrifice everything they have in life and kill someone, better if someone they care about or some complete stranger and as a final gesture themselves. \r<br>Demons cannot bring anything out and it must be the adept who performs certain rituals to learn new things and improve level, but at each of these acts their lives are ruined more and more.\r<br>Hell consists of 9 levels. \r<br>The souls of people who commit suicide are struck by the eyes little by little until they get their eyes ripped, a process that lasts years and they have to turn 15 turns before they can be saved.", "comment_date": "2021-08-15T05:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ike Ikie", "comment_text": "LoL CooL.............", "comment_date": "2021-08-14T16:24:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick", "comment_text": "This was actually very risky.

I thought it would be a kinder method than my dad&#39;s old snap traps. I ended up having to quickly drown a harmless little mouse (didn&#39;t even look like a field mouse... Looked like a neighbor might have lost a pet) because it was so stuck to the trap that I could tell I was badly hurting it no matter where I tried to pull (tail, back, belly, rear hip/legs). That was the first and last glue trap I ever used - because I am not some tiny peckered territorial sadist easily emasculated by tiny rodents.<br><br>I use a little tunnel trap (that is also infinitely reusable, unlike these idiotic sociopaths and their disposable glue traps created for psycho animal torturers) on the rare occasion that a mouse finds its way into my home.

I hope y&#39;all are having a wonderful and blessed day/night! \ud83d\ude01 If I could just have your attention for a bit, that would be awesome! So you may, or may not have heard that Jesus is coming back soon. If not, that&#39;s fine! It&#39;s totally okay since there is still time left! Search up &quot;Jesus&#39; second coming&quot; If you would like to know more! It&#39;s also in the Bible! If you do not know, here&#39;s a little backdrop for you! So, we are currently in the end times. I know! Scary right? Well no need to be afraid, God will protect and provide for you! I know you may be a bit troubled by all that&#39;s going on right now, I get it! But everything happening now has to happen and is necessary for Jesus&#39; second coming! But I know it&#39;s very nerve wracking, for I was also scared because I didn&#39;t know what was happening. All the bad that is happening now, it&#39;s also because of how much sinning there is, the world is being punished. Now, if you were to die right now, do you think you would go to heaven? If not, or you don&#39;t know, it&#39;s definitely a time for you to get right with God! And oh my goodness, it is WORTH IT I promise you!! God is speaking through me to warn all of you that there isn&#39;t much time left, and in order to get to heaven, and be confident and sure about it, you must get saved! What is being/getting saved you may ask? Well, being saved means that you are saved from hell through the blood of Jesus Christ! Here are some Bible verses that level you must be saved in order to get to heaven! In  <b>Acts </b><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR8dqCCZ_IY&amp;t=4m12s\">4:12</a></b><br> <b>&quot;And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\u201d</b> <br><b>Acts </b><b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR8dqCCZ_IY&amp;t=16m31s\">16:31</a></b><br><b>&quot;And they said, \u201cBelieve in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.\u201d</b> There is much more verses if you would like to search them up! I never realized how simple but super powerful getting saved was! I just got saved on Oct. 1st 2020. And I tell you, Best. Day. Of. My. Life. You may not get it, it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t! You don&#39;t get it because it just hasn&#39;t happened to you yet! And if you think you&#39;ve been saved, but you aren&#39;t quite sure about it. You probably didn&#39;t get saved! But don&#39;t panic. There is still time! And trust me, being saved is just as simple as 123. God gave us the free gift of salvation that is so simple, yet so powerful! If you are reading this, and you&#39;ve gotten this far, it&#39;s not by accident or coincidence. God made you fine this comment, and urged you to read this far! If you want to know how to get saved, It&#39;s acknowledging what Christ did for the world on the cross. He died for our sins so that we wouldn&#39;t have to pay the price for our sins in hell. He took our place, we were supposed to to take the punishment. But instead God came down in human form (Jesus Christ) and payed it all on the cross! And guess what, all you have to do to be saved is to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior, to believe that he died for your sins, and rose again 3 days later to finish it all, and to trust that his blood shed for you on the cross, for your sins, will get you to heaven. Boom! You&#39;re saved! If you still feel like you aren&#39;t saved, it&#39;s maybe because you didn&#39;t truly mean it, or maybe you did and you still feel that way! Well my friend, that&#39;s the devil trying to put doubts in your mind, and trying to make you second guess yourself so that you do not believe that you&#39;re saved. Trust me, it&#39;s happened to me, and still is. But! You cannot let him decieve you like that! If you know truly in your heart that you&#39;re saved, do not believe the devil. And you&#39;ll start noticing that whenever you get saved, the devil ALL OF A SUDDEN starts putting doubts and worries in your mind. Hmmm! I wonder why! Because you&#39;re saved and he knows you&#39;re getting closer to God and that you&#39;re going to heaven! He&#39;ll do ANYTHING to drag you away from God! He puts doubts in your mind about him, cause you to worry, cause you to get confused and question, ect. I know, the devil is horrible. I&#39;ve personally delt with all of those in my journey, and whenever the devil starts doing that, PRAY! Pray to God to help you! To help you get saved, or whatever you&#39;re dealing with! I promise you, even whenever it feels like he isn&#39;t listening or he&#39;s not there with you, he IS! He has listened to your every cry, every word, every thought. He loves you SO SO SO SO SOOOOO MUCH, it&#39;s beyond our comprehension! He cares for you, he cries with you, he laughs with you. Stop blocking him for your life, he doesn&#39;t want you to perish. God gave me these videos to help me understand how to get saved, and I am now saved because of him! \ud83d\ude2d God is so good y&#39;all have no idea!! And I plead with you, please watch these videos and go to God! He is there to listen and help you!! For me personally, I prayed every day for three months for this, for a bit I actually thought it wouldn&#39;t happen, and guess what, I am finally saved!! I&#39;m so overwhelmed with joy it&#39;s insane!! His ways are not your ways. Trust him! For he knows better and greater than you! He knows what&#39;s best for you, he has an amazing miracle coming your way! Do not lose hope or faith! I did not lose hope nor faith, although my faith wasn&#39;t very strong because I could not see anything good coming my way. Just because you can&#39;t see it, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not coming your way. That&#39;s what I had to learn! I thought all those months too that I was going to hell, and there was no way I was going to heaven. The devil really messed me up. But who was there with me? God! Who helped me? God! Who comforted me? God! Who listened to me? God! Who cared for me? God! You get the idea, he&#39;s AMAZING!!! Words can&#39;t even describe how amazing he is! And if you feel like he&#39;s abandoned you, or doesn&#39;t listen to you or care, nor love you. That&#39;s the devil making you think all of that horrible stuff. News flash! The devil is WRONG! God did not abandon you, he listens to your every cry, he is there for you, he cares for you, he loves you! And so much more! It may not feel like it right now for some of you, but it&#39;s only because you&#39;ve drifted away from him and you don&#39;t know him. He can help you get to know him, he can help you with anything! Just ask for it like I did! I am here now, saved, and going to heaven whenever I never thought I would! I trusted God, I trusted he would deliver me from brokenness, my sadness that I wasn&#39;t where I wanted to be with him. And here I am now, saved! I am so thankful!! \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude4c God is so good!! And if he could do it for me, he can most certainly do it for you. These links to videos that personally helped me on how to get saved that God provided for me explains this WAY better than I do \ud83d\ude02 As you can probably tell, I am not the best at explaining! But hopefully these videos will help you!<br><br><b>Learn how to get saved</b><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g\">https://youtu.be/lbb4xwYj19g</a><br><br><b>Learn how to live a Christian Life after you&#39;re saved</b><br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/ks03saG0Vog\">https://youtu.be/ks03saG0Vog</a><br><br>Hopefully these help you! There is still SOOOOO much I want to say! But that would take forever! \ud83d\ude02 God bless you if you&#39;ve read all of this! If you&#39;ve read all of this, it wasn&#39;t by accident! And if you aren&#39;t saved by this or any of the videos, don&#39;t panic! Ask God to help you! That&#39;s what I did, and now I&#39;m here! ^^ And for the ones who refuse to be saved, or to not let God come into your life. I swear to you, you will not regret it! There is a hell, if you don&#39;t believe me, that&#39;s on you, I&#39;m sorry. Only God can help y&#39;all! Go to him while you have the time!! Use your time wisely, spend your time with God, not your technology, spouse, lover, ect. Spend your time with him! Jesus is coming soon, be prepared!! Focus more on him than the world! Read your Bible! For some, this is a brand new fresh start! Do not give up on God, for he has never gave up on you! You will not regret it!! And remember! God loves you!! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude01\u2665\ufe0f God does not abandon people who seek him!!", "comment_date": "2020-10-02T13:29:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NotRain", "comment_text":
