The realistic approach is the only way to save yourself from disaster and to live a tension-free life. <br><br>Maulana Wahiduddin Khan I SUNDAY GUARDIAN I June 28 2020<br>Full article at: <a href=\"https://www.cpsglobal.org/content/realistic-approach\">https://www.cpsglobal.org/content/realistic-approach</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T01:11:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deville", "comment_text": "Thanks Mike!", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T00:54:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Militant Pacifist", "comment_text": "Humanity has five billion years left to get out of Earth and go to other worlds.", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T00:52:31Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "MemoGrafix", "comment_text": "I love these shows for the entertainment and CGI graphics, but these people are full of feces.  <br>I can do without the 50 so-called astronomy SCAMenTwists/ScienTwists telling their <b><i>OPINIONS</i></b> of what they <b><i>THINK</i></b> is going on of outer-space.
