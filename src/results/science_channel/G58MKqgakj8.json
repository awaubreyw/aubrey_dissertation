[{"comment_by": "Florida Musings", "comment_text": "There are pros and cons for everything; the fact is most wheelchair users aren\u2019t \u201cstandard\u201d. If you are disabled and drive; the modifications are costly and depending on the disability a lot of automation and electrical parts. We chose this after our after market conversion is 19 years old; it still works but I never put a front seat in as I wanted my partner to be as close to the passenger seat. We now need a front seat with a lower profile than a standard van (older parent).  We chose rear entry (way better parking) and a manual ramp (no maintenance) . It is a little tricky to tie her down in the front as it needs two hands and the fold up seats are tight for a bigger person to wedge in and tie down. A stick with a hook worked fine. But having the capacity for two wheel chairs is pretty good. That being said, the mini van is priced as a used car (or new if purchased new) and you pay for the conversion (no tax with an RX), the conversion is about $20k; a little overpriced considering they have this down to a factory assembly line.", "comment_date": "2021-08-01T15:08:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "5 minutes alone", "comment_text": "Reminds me when I use to drive city buses.
