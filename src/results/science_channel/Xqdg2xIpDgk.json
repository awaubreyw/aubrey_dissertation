Utter nonsense that the Malaysian air force would allow a rogue airliner to circle back towards Kuala Lumpur without scrambling interceptors to investigate. Obama travelled to KL to get Razak&#39;s signature on the PSI (Proliferation Security Initiative} in return for military cooperation against China and in so doing swore to protect their corrupt government from the truth being revealed. Read the PSI! It declares the RIGHT to tell the public whatever lies it deems strategically necessary. That such a law exists and is not being acknowledged anywhere in the media is PROOF of a coverup.", "comment_date": "2017-09-03T21:09:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scrooge", "comment_text": "Dear video editor: stop cutting the video so soon", "comment_date": "2017-09-01T01:47:40Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Josh", "comment_text": "&quot;Watch Dogs 3&quot; Has been created!", "comment_date": "2017-08-31T05:45:51Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Steven Stehling", "comment_text": "Science Channel has turned into worthless tabloid gossip.  This video is a lot of fiction.  First of all Diego Garcia is not the US military&#39;s most important base.  Not even close.  It&#39;s also not a secret.  It&#39;s just remote.  It is a very small island that is barely large enough to support an airfield and some other buildings.  It&#39;s actually too far from almost anything to be an important base.  It is however an airfield in the middle of a vast area without anywhere else to land.  That&#39;s it&#39;s value.  Few aircraft even operate out of that base because it is so remote.  It has some strategic value as a base for surveillance aircraft monitoring ships in the Indian Ocean, which would be important to have if a conflict arose that involved a naval power in the region.<br><br>This is little better than CNN speculating that the plane was swallowed up by a black hole.<br><br>Oh, by the way.  The US Navy has an official website for Diego Garcia available to the public.  <br><a href=\"https://cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrj/installations/nsf_diego_garcia.html\">https://cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrj/installations/nsf_diego_garcia.html</a><br><br>You can read about the history of the island, it lists the units stationed there, the mission and a lot of other information.  You can&#39;t call the base secretive by any measure.  When the US military wants to keep a base secret, they don&#39;t talk about it, like the unnamed facilities in Nevada or Base X in the Middle East.", "comment_date": "2017-08-31T03:12:57Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "S34N", "comment_text": "&quot;The single most important and secret military base&quot; not so secret now since everybody knows about it...", "comment_date": "2017-08-31T02:47:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "samara611", "comment_text": "<b>*most secret air base*</b> <b>*says exactly where it is*</b> seems legit", "comment_date": "2017-08-31T02:30:37Z", "likes_count": 37}, {"comment_by": "rey", "comment_text": "u should ask avery ryan and her teammate&#39;s", "comment_date": "2017-08-31T01:38:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reecepbcups", "comment_text": "It was just wireshark...", "comment_date": "2017-08-30T23:22:12Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Bruce Wayne", "comment_text": "Well shit.
