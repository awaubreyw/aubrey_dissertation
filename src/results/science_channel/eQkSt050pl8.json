(4) In July 1947, I was stationed at Fort Worth Army Air Field [later Carswell Air Force Base] in Fort Worth, Texas. I served as Chief of Staff to Major General Roger Ramey, Commander, Eighth Air Force. I had the rank of Colonel. (5) In early July, I received a phone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, Deputy Commander, Strategic Air Command. He asked what we knew about the object which had been recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, as reported in the press. I called Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the Roswell Army Air Field, and directed him to send the material in a sealed container to me at Fort Worth. I so informed Maj. Gen. McMullen. (6) After the plane from Roswell arrived with the material, I asked the Base Commander, Col. Al Clark, to take possession of the material and to personally transport it in a B-26 to Maj. Gen. McMullen in Washington, D.C. I notified Maj. Gen. McMullen, and he told me he would send the material by personal courier on his plane to Benjamin Chidlaw, Commanding General of the Air Material Command at Wright Field [later Wright Patterson AFB]. The entire operation was conducted under the strictest secrecy. (7) The material shown in the photographs taken in Maj. Gen. Ramey\u2019s office was a weather balloon. The weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press.

Every single thing in the Universe is connected, and\r<br>everything in it is needed or was needed to produce this unique\r<br>place of life we called Earth. All the stars, all the galaxies, all the\r<br>planets, everything in the Universe helped produced this single\r<br>outcome. Life in the Universe only exists here and that Earth and the Universe are one place.\r<br>The Theory of One examines three principal elements for life\r<br>in the Universe to be unique.\r<br>1. Requirements.\r<br>2. Essential Conditions.\r<br>3. Necessary Connections and Cosmic Relationships.\r<br>A simple example of a Requirement for life is the need for\r<br>&quot;sunlight.&quot; The Sun, which is a star, produces a broad spectrum\r<br>of energy in the form of charged particles and electromagnetic\r<br>radiation. Sunlight is only a small part of that spectrum. Plants\r<br>use sunlight directly by turning carbon dioxide into sugars in a\r<br>process called photosynthesis.\r<br>\r<br>But deep in the ocean, there are some autotrophs, a type of\r<br>bacteria that do not need direct sunlight. They use the energy\r<br>from the Earth&#39;s hot core. These bacteria use chemicals like\r<br>methane and hydrogen sulfide emitted from hydrothermal\r<br>vents on the ocean&#39;s floor to make their food. They need the\r<br>Sun&#39;s energy indirectly; without this sunlight, the Earth would\r<br>not have enough of its own heat to sustain them.\r<br>The second principle element is the Essential Conditions, and\r<br>as such, this &quot;required sunlight&quot; needs a unique sun. This sun\r<br>will need to be the ideal candidate. We do not want a sun that\r<br>produces intense bursts of deadly gamma rays or x-rays for\r<br>example.\r<br>The third element is the Necessary Connections and Cosmic\r<br>Relationships that exist among all objects, both directly and\r<br>indirectly. Continuing to follow through with this sunlight\r<br>example, it would mean that this ideal sun and its delicate\r<br>attributes have established a unique relationship with this\r<br>planet. The Earth&#39;s magnetic field interacts with this &quot;sunlight,&quot;\r<br>providing a protective shield. This magnetic field is dependent\r<br>on the structure of the planet&#39;s molten core. And as such, the\r<br>Sun has a complicated relationship with Earth. It generates our\r<br>weather patterns, produces the albedo effect, and even helps to\r<br>develop vitamin D in the human body. The Sun&#39;s\r<br>electromagnetic radiation plays a role in a countless number of\r<br>other natural events here on Earth.\r<br>\r<br>The emerging consequences from examining these three key\r<br>elements suggest that the &quot;Requirements&quot; for life are extremely\r<br>precise and that the &quot;Conditions&quot; are seemingly endless. More\r<br>importantly, these &quot;Connections and Relationships&quot; are\r<br>extraordinarily demanding and far-reaching. The Theory of One\r<br>goes on to say that these three principles produce an expanding\r<br>relationship and profound connective dependence, which\r<br>ultimately includes everything in the Universe. The Earth and\r<br>the Universe are indeed one place.\r<br>What are some of the logistical requirements for life to emerge\r<br>on Earth? Here on this planet, we have acquired the proper\r<br>blend of chemical elements needed to develop life. This correct\r<br>chemical balance was only possible because of this planet&#39;s\r<br>remarkable location in the Milky Way Galaxy. This planet&#39;s\r<br>position is critical because if the Earth formed closer to the\r<br>center of the Milky Way, then we would have acquired too\r<br>many of the lighter elements, and the existence of life would\r<br>have become highly unlikely. If, on the other hand, this planet\r<br>was formed farther out in the galaxy, we would then have too\r<br>many of the heavier elements and the possibility of life evolving\r<br>and flourishing would also be highly unlikely. We can continue\r<br>to expand on these aspects and requirements. For example, we\r<br>also need the Moon, but not just any moon. We need this Moon\r<br>and its exact properties.\r<br>\r<br>The Moon stabilizes the Earth&#39;s motion producing a needed\r<br>steady and reliable weather system. The Moon also affects\r<br>Earth&#39;s plate tectonics, which in turn plays a role in our carbon\r<br>cycle. The Moon also produces the tides, which ultimately\r<br>helped develop life. Our Sun is 93,000,000 miles away (150\r<br>million kilometers), for life to exist on this planet we depend on\r<br>this Sun. It is an exceptional Sun; it is one which is not too hot\r<br>and not too cold. This Sun needed to be in a stable state and in\r<br>the proper stage of development long enough for life to develop\r<br>on Earth. Not only do we need this Sun to be the right type and\r<br>size of star, but we also need it to be in the correct position and\r<br>distance. Now, if the Sun were just a fraction of a distance\r<br>closer, then Earth&#39;s water would have eventually evaporated\r<br>into space. And yet, on the other hand, if it were a fraction of\r<br>the distance further away we would have become a cold dead\r<br>planet of ice.\r<br>This Sun has its&#39; own vast complex requirements and &quot;far off&quot;\r<br>external influences. Those cosmic interactions ultimately\r<br>complement and support our existence. And those &quot;far off&quot;\r<br>external influences and interactions demand their own\r<br>requirements. Furthermore, we need a solar system with\r<br>massive planets like Jupiter and Saturn. These planets protect\r<br>us. They shield this planet from incoming asteroid disasters and\r<br>comet impacts\u2014these giant planets &quot;sweep clean&quot; our solar\r<br>system.\r<br>\r<br>We needed and still need their size and gravitational strength\r<br>to prevail, even though these planets are millions upon millions\r<br>of miles away. But it doesn&#39;t end there. Just these two planets\r<br>alone have many of their own cosmic prerequisites. They have a\r<br>vast number of critical conditions and precise requirements,\r<br>which are also complicated and far-reaching. All these\r<br>conditions and requirements are time-sensitive; they all need to\r<br>be created within a similar time period. That requirement alone\r<br>is an incredible plight.\r<br>We can continue to expand the idea behind the Theory of One.\r<br>The Milky Way Galaxy, which we are located in, has its own\r<br>vast complex requirements and correspondence. As such, it\r<br>interacts with other galaxies, which in turn have their own\r<br>interactions and conditions. These direct and indirect\r<br>relationships support our existence and extend the connection\r<br>to everything in the Universe. It is truly remarkable. This\r<br>network does not stop or fade away with distance.\r<br>In conclusion, The Theory of One suggests that everything in\r<br>the Universe is connected and is required to support life here on\r<br>this planet. Is it possible for life to exist elsewhere in the\r<br>Universe?

They knew gravity is the most accurate measured fundamental force in the labs. They said the tide is caused by the gravity of the moon and the sun. But they just keep lying to protect the rest of the lies in their theories. \r<br>\r<br>Gravity is not a force but it keeps planets in orbit, matters fall to the ground, two lead balls attract each other with a force F=G x m1m2/R^2? \r<br>\r<br>What else did they lie? Blackhole is fake, gravity wave is fake, solar wind is fake, fusion is fake, the moon landing is fake, the tide is caused by the moon&#39;s gravity is fake, and much more.\r<br>\r<br>So what is gravity? The curvature of spacetime? Another immaterial word puzzle? \r<br>\r<br>Gravity is an induced electrostatic attraction force between neutrally charged matters.\r<br>\r<br>Two hydrogen atoms 1 and 2 at a sun-earth distance, proton 1 attracts electron 2 and repels proton 2, proton 2 attracts electron 1 and repels proton 1, electron 1 attracts proton 2 and repels electron 2, electron 2 attracts proton 1 and repels electron 2. The net Coulomb&#39;s force is always an attractive force which is proportional to the product of total charges within the two atoms. Total charges equal to mass. Without charges, there is no mass. This is the mechanism of universal gravitational force. \r<br>\r<br>Two magnets at a distance always attract each other with a magnetic force, even the same poles repel each other. Same principle.\r<br>\r<br>All matters are made from atoms, all atoms are formed from charged atom building blocks. Charged atom building blocks only carry electric force/electrostatic force, therefore all forces matters carried are the electric force in different configurations.\r<br>\r<br>In reality, there are no force lines and force fields. All made up word puzzles.\r<br>\r<br>The magnetic force is a misinterpretation of the circular electric force. The field is a misinterpretation of force. Fields and forces must coexist with the matters/carriers.\r<br>\r<br>There is no magnetic field around a current-carrying wire or coil. There are iron powders around a current-carrying wire or coil. \r<br>\r<br>The current in the wire induces nearby iron powders to become small magnets and connected together and form into a circle around the current is the precise mechanism. \r<br>\r<br>The so-called magnetic force is in fact circular electrostatic force carried by a circular current or concentric dipole rings in the magnet.", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T10:48:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Mayala", "comment_text": "My view life is the reason for big bang", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T19:10:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lila B.

This process is carried out by the Almighty of the Universe based on the Nature of Reality of the Active Planets. These systems serve a variety of time limit functional needs of planets and living beings. Several factors in time limit functions need to be considered based on the functional behavior of non living things when activated and living things. All elements of non-living things in the Universe are having two functional behavior of minus and plus and require activation to perform its time limit function. Every element in the seven universes is made of Jabiga atoms (living electro molecule and living nucleus dust) and Ronos (electromagnetic force). All atoms of an element are not the same but all the atoms have minus and plus sense. Atoms of different elements are having different kinds of behavior and have different kinds of time limit functions. Jabiga atoms of different elements which are normally related to each other can join hands when time limit activation is normal to form a new force or to create a new component. If not related to each other it takes avatar as a destructive force with abnormal time limit creates natural calamities which could not be controlled by human. There are two fundamental forces namely Jabiga and Ronos forces with four avatars. Jabiga forces with plus and minus characters and Ronos forces with plus and minus characters are involved in keeping stable Jabiga atoms. Ronos electromagnetic force helps for keeping Jabiga atoms stable. Another fundamental gravity force disturbs the time limit function of Jabiga atom to some extent. <br><br>Earthians View: According to study by Earthians \u2018When solar system was born 4-6 billion years ago only 6 percentage of potentially inhabitable planets that will ever form in the universe existed, which means 92 percent of more earth like world yet to be born.\u201d Earthians accepted that Earth planet is not flat but just like a ball rotating, that there is a vast dark force, Earthians studied about the shining stars and heavenly bodies and also named some planets and stars. Earthians creating horoscope and calculating the fate of human being based on the planetary movements and stars. Earthian accepts that there are seven human beings with similar face structure. Earthians cannot deny that they appeared on the Earth without parental sexual functions. There is Universal power that no one can see or feel the power or predict the time limit function of the Almighty.\r<br>\u2022\tThere are about 300 Active planets in seven universes. Just like Earth Planet there are one planet in Haloma Universe, one planet in Rajsival Universe and one planet in Hindoma Universe. All the three planets are identical to the Earth Planet, and Bindra (mold) is just like Earthians, but mass of the three planets may vary. \r<br>\u2022\tThe entire universes are covered with darkness and woven with the fabric nerve system of Jabga (vertical fabric living nerve) and Ronos (horizontal fabric living nerve). Jabiga-living electric molecules, vertical fabric nerve and living nucleus dust and Ronos (horizontal fabric nerve of Electromagnetic force) covering the entire Universe. Jabiga and Ronos are playing their vital part in regard to creation of light and sound, maintaining the nature of reality like rain, creation of life, trees and plants, feeding the living beings, trees and plants, giving fresh air, creation of seasons (weather) changing the atmospheric condition, helping planets to rotate themselves at a possible distance. Jabiga Air contains, living molecules, nucleus, rays, and water and spreading to all over the seven Universes. Jabiga absorbs the Sun\u2019s light and releases numerous types of protected rays, and creates soft positive and negative electric waves and gravity sense and helping trees, plants and living beings. Based on Bivinja, Jabiga allows the trees and plants absorb particular color molecules and taste molecules from the Sun\u2019s rays. Selects Jabiga molecules and nucleus from the Jabiga air and restrict ratio of water molecules generates various colors to flowers with smell or without smell and with different kinds of tastes. Similarly, the taste of vegetables, color, taste and shape of fruits and nuts vary due to Jabiga. Jabiga has two Avatars Minus Jabiga (negative character) and Plus Jabiga (positive character). Jabiga positive character and negative character can act independently.\r<br>\u2022\tOne Jabiga dust (which can\u2019t be available for experiment) contain 20 percent of electricity, 20 percent of living nucleus dust, 20 percent chemical, color, taste, and smell dust and air, 20 percent of heat dust, 20 percent of gravity sense. Ronos (horizontal fabric nerve of Electro magnetic force).\r<br>\u2022\tOne unit of Ronos contain 50 percent of magnetic force, 30 percent of air and 20 percent of ice (chillness). Ronos also have two avatars minus Ronos and plus Ronos. Ronos cannot act independently. Jabiga and Ronos can mix in several ratios to do several time limit functions, such as formation of electricity, creation of magnetic force, creation of seasons, helping for recycling of life, bringing rains. Jabiga (vertical fabric nerve system) Ronos (horizontal fabric nerve system) are covering the entire universes.\r<br>\u2022\tEvery element in the seven universes is made of Jabiga atoms (living electro molecule and living nucleus dust) and Ronos electromagnetic force. All atoms of an element are not the same but all the atoms have minus and plus sense. Atoms of different elements are having different kinds of behavior and have different kinds of time limit functions. Jabiga atoms of different elements which are normally related to each other can join hands when time limit activation is normal to form a new force or to create a new component. If not related to each other it took avatar as a destructive force with abnormal time limit natural calamities which could not be controlled by human.\r<br>02. Earthian Scientists classified the Dark Force into three categories: Dark Fluid, Dark Matter and Dark Energy. Dark Energy is a matter and not fluid that exists in the vast dark space. The Dark Force consist two categories namely Jabiga and Ronos in zero status which require activation.  Activation is done on a tiny part (a dot) of Dark Force by the Almighty when a new universe has to be formed. Dark force is vast dark space woven with the fabrics of Jabiga and Ronos creating cosmic waves on which the universes, stars, planets, heavenly bodies are floating. <br> No one can see or measure the nature strength, density and formation of dark force. One dot of a dark force is to be considered as a universe. If one can travel beyond the time limit travel distance of the existing planetary system he can see the wonder creations of some other planetary systems. This can be proved with the following simple example.  Normally one can see things within the time limit travel distance.  A person traveling in a car in the dark night he cannot sight light or things that exist beyond the time limit travel distance. He has to travel or cross the distance to touch the time limit travel distance of new place and then only he can able to see the light and things in that new place.  \r<br>\r03. Dark force contains 20 percent of Jabiga, 20 percent of Ronos, 50 percent dark chillness and dust, and 10 percent of radiation.   The Dark force contains fabrics of Jabiga and Ronos to control and maintain the time limit function of entire planetary rotation system and to enable them to stay at a possible distance from one planet to other planets and heavenly bodies in the universes.", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T05:39:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maugan Ra", "comment_text": "Science channel is by far the best thing out there on tv right now.", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T05:34:27Z", "likes_count": 81}, {"comment_by": "Dadson worldwide", "comment_text": "We are very much alone.
