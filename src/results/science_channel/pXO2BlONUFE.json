During the 3rd Great Battle, the Atlanteans (yes like Namor or Aquaman) sought to enslave the native species of Earth. The Lemurians on the other hand thought the species should be left alone, and should evolve at their own natural rate of progression.<br><br>The only reason that the Atlanteans were trying to enslave the younger race was because of Draconian subterfuge. The Draconians favorite method of causing a society to collapse is not become the mouthpiece itself, but to whisper in the ear of the mouthpiece, and effect change from the shadows. This is why in a royal court, the advisor to the crown is the most powerful. Yes the ruling monarch has supreme authority over their dominion and subjects. The advisor is able to use their influence over the monarch to direct the flow of society, and if things don&#39;t workout, then it won&#39;t be the advisors head the people call for. They call the name of the head that wears the crown. <br><br>The Draconian&#39;s endgame was to enslave primitive man to mine gold for them, as they had lost a revolution some years prior. This loss cost them their slaves, a race of beings known as the Igigi, a secondary race that falls under the Annunaki umbrella. <br><br>The reason the Draconians needed gold was so they could ionize it and fire it into the atmosphere of Nibiru (Draconian home world). They believed it would repair the atmosphere and make the planet inhabitable for their species once more.<br><br>The Draconian established an outpost located on Mars, since it&#39;s thought that Mars is the halfway point between Earth and Nibiru. And during the height of the war, a giant superweapon called NARA-1, said to be nuclear energy based, was fired off  at Mars in attempt to cut off the Draconian from calling their reinforcements.  This scorched the surface of Mars, vaporized water that used be on the surface, and drove the remaining Martian society underground.<br><br>EDIT: this is just a theory I&#39;ve come across during my studies of fringe topics.

They tried hoses to make bubbles, they tried using lubes and wax to coat it and it helped. What they dont realize and what Bob never told anyone is EVERY component of an alien craft is a Natural element, every part reacts to another part. Free unlimited energy, our lost art is to make amazing things out of the materials we have available. I&#39;m not talking about cars or TV, I mean like rocks that seemingly boil water, interfere with electricity flow, and disappear from a mirror (theres an Egyptian mythical city made of this this stuff). If a rock can instantly boil water without it being hot, imagine not needing a stove... or a water heater... That&#39;s some thousands back into your pocket every year.. pyramids are set up Almost exactly like the real teslas power tower with the whole granite and water and iron and copper rods... but what I&#39;m saying is vibrations. Vibrations can move very large things.. (hint). Vibrations can cut very hard materials like its butter in conjunction with other tools. Imagine and axe that vibrates at a very high intensity everytime you strike a tree, massive damage, less effort. In construction they use a &quot;probe/vibrator&quot; to pack the sand when they dig holes so nobody steps into quicksand. That probe vibrates a whole hell of alot it usually takes 2 men to not only carry the battery but also take turns in being vibrated senseless, that probe with water goes 10 feet into the sand as if you were lowering it into a hole with no sand... the vibrator never gets wet, the vibrations cause a &quot;bubble&quot; around it like a force field or barrier. Static, sound, vibration, used with other things can and DID make this world a much better place. The ancients were far more advanced because they had limitless potential and some knowledge of Natural tools and methods. Today we rely on technology that has limits. We pay 20 dollars for a package of 8 Energizer batteries, ancient Afghans made a clay pot, filled it with lemon juice or whater was acidic enough for them, put a rod through the lid and then sealed the lid onto the pot.. their batteries were not only almost free if they didnt have to buy materials or lemons or the rod but also lasted more than a lifetime considering they are still being found buried in the sands. Those batteries they made, when the juice goes bad they replace the juice, You have to go out and buy more batteries.. 20 dollars feeds 2-3 people typically. If everyone had a pyramid built correctly and set up right to your home, you could have unlimited energy, clean, free, unlimited. No more electric bill. Water? Dig a well.. hope this helped some of you, you cant understand aliens til you understand ourselves, where we came from and how we went and continue to stay so damn wrong about everything.. Want a spaceship that travels super fast and can go forever? Climb inside a rock and catapult yourself into space (very primitive and probably wouldn&#39;t support life). But you will undoubtedly spiral, spin, go two ways from Sunday but you will never run out of gas. With some well planned navigation and preparation perhaps you could shoot a rock into orbit around Something and gain enough speed to be projected towards aanother something and gain more speed or slow down and repeat the process til you are were you want to go (probably not in a rock). But let&#39;s think, if NASA sent a boulder into space and it spun around the moon and flung itself back at earth because of the whole things get much heavier the faster they move, you can imagine the return trip would be much fast than the original trip. Not only that but besides the catapult the whole operation would cost pretty much, nothing. Unless that rock hits land then people would probably get hurt. NOW make that rock vibrate at such and intensity all you hear is the hum, as it hovers their. \ud83d\ude0a", "comment_date": "2022-08-17T06:12:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A. H.

(4) In July 1947, I was stationed at Fort Worth Army Air Field [later Carswell Air Force Base] in Fort Worth, Texas. I served as Chief of Staff to Major General Roger Ramey, Commander, Eighth Air Force. I had the rank of Colonel. (5) In early July, I received a phone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, Deputy Commander, Strategic Air Command. He asked what we knew about the object which had been recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, as reported in the press. I called Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the Roswell Army Air Field, and directed him to send the material in a sealed container to me at Fort Worth. I so informed Maj. Gen. McMullen. (6) After the plane from Roswell arrived with the material, I asked the Base Commander, Col. Al Clark, to take possession of the material and to personally transport it in a B-26 to Maj. Gen. McMullen in Washington, D.C. I notified Maj. Gen. McMullen, and he told me he would send the material by personal courier on his plane to Benjamin Chidlaw, Commanding General of the Air Material Command at Wright Field [later Wright Patterson AFB]. The entire operation was conducted under the strictest secrecy. (7) The material shown in the photographs taken in Maj. Gen. Ramey\u2019s office was a weather balloon. The weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press. (8) I have not been paid or given anything of value to make this statement, which is the truth to the best of my recollection. Signed: T. J. Dubose Date: 9/16/91 Signature witnessed by: Linda R.

The very beings who blasted Mars &amp; here on our Earth doing the same here as Mars &amp; call it whatever but think of who thinks they control us &amp; the Earth but are the guilty ones who are destroying it while placing that blame on us &amp; they been tricking us since the beginning of human life. YES there are several spieces of beings here but only one threatens our destruction &amp; how hard is it to figure out who those are when they just stolen an election to keep their grooming the people agenda with virus after virus &amp; migrations galore plus whatever else it takes to out number us all &amp; no matter how many weapons &amp; guns &amp; whatever you have ah try taking out their 2 trillion watt energy weapon, the invisible lazer. These lazers were detected during all of those fires as the smoke exposed the beams &amp; the beams were either red or green &amp; most of the forest fires were started with these &amp; remember the chemtrails being sprayed every where or are you aware of chemtrailing? OK so spraying Aluminum Dust &amp; Barium &amp; other toxic highly famible metals or dust but they fire a lazer at this dust &amp; even fire chiefs stated that these fires spread like a football field a minute &amp; extremely hot. Military grade thermite also is a weapon used &amp; extremely hot. Go rewatch the towers before callapsing &amp; look for those sparks shooting out of the corner of tower one &amp; also go before the event &amp; see that ACE ELEVATOR&quot; had all of the shafts closed for up to 9 months with security guards with guns at the entrances. So who was this security company anyways???  MARVIN BUSH that is who. All the roach coaches or food vendors did not show up that morning &amp; as of this event it is very important to pay close attention to smoke &amp; what you see in it so watch the towers smoke, the Canada Fort ??? fire smoke &amp; watch the smoke in South Korea when Trump did drills firing at targets? Lot to see but listen to the sound? When hitting targets it sounds like demons screaming, no really see for your selves! So now after all that be lucky if you find much of anything in past videos as You-Tube has really twisted searches &amp; goofy looking crap comes up instead besides eliminating peoples sites so there it is you mind controlled beings? Yeah you are &amp; if not then we would not be where were at now---&quot;SCREWED&quot; Should of paid more attention to a mans critical speech he died over besides wanting to end the Fed Reserve &amp; tear up the CIA into a billion pieces into the wind. JFK tried to tell us who, how &amp; when but hell no not one did a thing &amp; now 50+ years later what was few is now the DEEP STATE, the many deep every where.

The poles are the point of minimal shielding on every body we&#39;ve taken measures on so far.
