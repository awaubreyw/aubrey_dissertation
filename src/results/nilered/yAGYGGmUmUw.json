And then simply evaporate the Mercury off to leave the gold. Of course this causes enormous amounts of mercury vapor pollution and is in fact one of the largest sources of mercury pollution in the world after coal power plants. <br><br>The mining also causes damage to the river ecosystem directly due to stirring up large amounts of sediment... And some of the miners also Venture into the woods to cut down rainforest trees and dig up the land to form new ponds where they do the same procedure as in the river.<br><br>The government had been trying to stop them with laws and sporadic enforcement but it was impossible to stop all the miners. I even heard there were military operations to blow up some of larger mining barges.

As you implied, amalgamation followed by distillation is a common method used in developing countries, with serious environmental and health costs, esp. when the mercury is simply boiled off in the open air.  I prospect for precious metals in a location in Eastern OR where metallic mercury occurs together with gold.  The locals claim that ALL the gold there is partially amalgamated with Hg so that it appears silvery on the surface.  I panned a dense very small particle which I examined with my hand loupe.  It looked like a couple of minute octahedra beneath a silvery surface that formed a meniscus with the crystals.  Previous miners claimed the spot for gold and platinum extraction.  Since Pt and Au (almost) never occur together, so I&#39;m left to wonder if the old timers were mistaking amalgam for Pt.  BTW, the local stream flows into a river in which an endangered species of trout are found.  One wonders how much Hg is found in their environment and how they manage to survive.
