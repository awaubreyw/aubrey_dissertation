Wait do you mean to tell me that YouTube allows you to have a video whether it\u2019s monetize or not the fact that it\u2019s up, but a video of how to make chloroform!?!?!?!?The idea that chloroform can be used with malicious intent and the fact that it\u2019s dangerous and toxic is not the total reason why my mind is blown. The main reason is that you were allowed to have a video on how to make chloroform knowing individuals have used it to rape women/men or rob men/women and can be used by substance abusers with deadly consequences but, and emphasis on the butt, you can\u2019t have videos giving an alternative perspective reciting science-based evidence from clinical trials on the efficacy of masks against Covid or the efficacy of an mRNA vaccine Being used in a global pandemic as well as it being shoved into most bodies on earth all at once damn near or a video stating you believe that the virus came from a Chinese lab and was created on purpose (at least I know they were blocking those videos up until the past month or so when all the other evidence came out). Or a video saying you believe the virus was man-made in China on purpose without being called a racist. Can\u2019t have videos-of your natural dialogue that you would use when out with your friends throughout the day because u used to much profanity or made statements that are not considered PC. Because YouTube will demonetize or block your video or deleted permanently because you used to many cuss words or you expressed the notion that a grown ass man who puts on a wig and calls himself Sheila can walk in the little girls bathrooms and you don\u2019t like that at all and think that shouldn\u2019t be allowed. Or you could get demonitized and have your YouTube channel banned if you were questioning the validity of the machines and the system in which our elections in the US for 2020 were counted and long does data and you thought that these machines could easily be manipulated and that there was evidence that showed it was manipulated and so you demanded a recount. Nope that video would\u2019ve gotten deleted and demonetized as well. You can\u2019t have videos or even a Twitter about the Arizona audit on the election results because your Twitter and YouTube will get banned and yes this actually happened but you can have a video on how to make chloroform and you can also have kids videos that display torture and pedophilia as well as other with with nothing but bad intent behind your videos and yet your videos can be monetized and have Coke a cola displayed as your advert and they won\u2019t delete you for years or demonetize you if they ever even do it all. Do you guys remember how long the channel was up that would pop up on kids playlist that parents would let their toddlers watch and it involves this one creepy dude who would take all kinds of dolls and stick them with syringes and stabbed a syringe in your head and do all this other weird shit to dolls? Yeah that channel was monetizing went on for years and years and I\u2019m not sure they even got rid of his account or he just got out himself because there was too many underground Internet sleuth investigating on their own because YouTube wouldn\u2019t take action. I\u2019m not hating on you for making chloroform because I feel like that education should be at the fingertips of anyone who\u2019s interested 1000%. Just like I agree that anybody who is interested in studying COVID-19 or any of the SARS type of viruses and The origins of those viruses as well as the efficacy of certain treatments whether it be ivermectin which CNN called horse medicine saying Joe Rogan was basically an idiot even though ivermectin was used on humans for almost a decade before it was ever used on animals and there are two different formulas of ivermectin one for animals and one for humans and the ones for horses and other animals are extreme doses that are not given to humans but CNN even though they knew this didn\u2019t seem to want to distinguish that fact for its audience because Joe Rogan has a bigger audience than them and they\u2019re jealous. I think though if you wanted to listen to doctors who said Covid was seriously deadly and needed to be taken serious as well as listening to doctors who said that it was a flu like virus that wasn\u2019t that deadly and that a mask wouldn\u2019t really protect you because the particles are too small that\u2019s why people who work with viruses where basically a bubble boy suit and a hazmat suit on top of that and would laugh at you if you ever walked in there with a mask thinking that you\u2019re gonna stop the virus, that you should be able to get the opinion from both those doctors but YouTube doesn\u2019t believe so. If you read this whole comment I truly know that you are an awesome and brave individual lol might be a little curious thinking that I\u2019m a nut case venting YouTube \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. And in that assessment with my character you would be at least 27% correct lol but I\u2019m just tired of things not being stated anywhere for me to read them or a dialogue and discussion about these kinds of matters not just on YouTube but things throughout the world but especially American politics and it\u2019s medicine because I don\u2019t see enough of this dialogue and I know that not everyone wants one opinion from doctors who were only approved by Dr. Fauci who he himself after learning about what he did to those dogs not long ago doesn\u2019t deserve to approve any kind of medicine or medical opinion for a vast audience especially an audience as big as a country the size of America because throughout this pandemic yes he said things that turned out to be false or premature and he would just change the statement and his opinion on the fly without ever retracting or addressing his false statements originally because he doesn\u2019t admit to any of his faults and you never trust anybody who doesn\u2019t admit to their faults or their wrongdoings or wrong sayings or wrong opinions.

EHUO 1st November, 31000 Oran, Algeria Abstract Chlorobutanol is an active pharmaceutical ingredient used in therapeutic for many years as an antiseptic, analgesic and local anesthetic. It has other properties: hypnotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-emetic. It\u2019s used as conservative in some pharmaceutical preparations because it has antibacterial and antifungal properties. We synthesized this active pharmaceutical ingredient in Therapeutic laboratory of pharmacy department of Sidi Bel-Abbes by Referenced method based on the addition of chloroform with acetone under the influence of chemical catalyst (potassium hydroxide) using the distillation assembly. The second synthesis using the optimized method improves the yield of 20 %. The synthesized product was controlled according to the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia 8th edition: the organoleptic characteristics, solubility, colorimetric reactions and the degree of coloring were positive; its melting point is 78 \u00b0C; its water content is estimated to 4.66% and its purity is equal to 98.27%. Keywords optimization, synthesis, Chlorobutanol, yield, control 1. Introduction Chlorobutanol is used in pharmaceutical compositions at variable concentrations; it may be combined with other antiseptics such as Chlorhexidine to enhance its antiseptic action which allows a potentiation of the antimicrobial activity of these two active ingredients. This potentiation is exercised on gram-negative bacteria as well as gram-positive bacteria. Due to its bacteriostatic properties, Chlorobutanol is also used as a preservative for pharmaceutical preparations [1]. Chemically, Chlorobutanol is a chlorinated antiseptic that belongs to the alcohol family. At the laboratory scale, it\u2019s prepared by a simple nucleophilic addition of chloroform to acetone in the presence of potassium hydroxide; it\u2019s more specifically the nucleophilic addition of the trichloromethyl anion to the carbonyl bond of acetone using the distillation assembly [1,2].<br>Figure 1: Chemical structure of Chlorobutanol<br><br><br><br><br>PAGE 2*<b>**</b><br><br><br>Matmour D et al The Pharmaceutical and Chemical Journal, 2019, 6(1):53-56<br>The Pharmaceutical and Chemical Journal<br>54<br>According to the bibliographic references consulted, the different techniques mentioned for the chemical synthesis<br>of Chlorobutanol give a very low yield varies between 14% and 40% [3]. In this study, we optimize the Synthesis<br>method of Chlorobutanol for provides a better yield and we control its physicochemical quality.<br>2. Materials and Methods<br>2.1. Synthesis of Chlorobutanol by referenced method<br>45 ml of acetone, 5 ml of chloroform and 1 g of potassium hydroxide were mixed in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. The<br>reaction mixture was stirred at -5 \u00b0C for two hours, the resulting slurry was filtered and the filtrate was freed of<br>excess acetone by distillation. The yellowish oily residue was mixed with 50 ml of ice water, resulting in a<br>precipitate in the form of white crystals (Chlorobutanol Hemihydrate) which were filtered and dried.<br>Recrystallization was carried out in a small volume of ethanol. Finally, the amount of Chlobutanol obtained was<br>weighed to calculate the synthesis yield [3].<br>2.2. Chlorobutanol Synthesis by optimized method<br>We optimized the synthesis conditions with using of reflux heating and we left the container open for spontaneous<br>evaporation of the unreacted acetone.<br>2.3. Control Quality of the synthesized Chlorobutanol<br>2.3.1. Organoleptic propreties, solubility and Melting point measurement<br>We checked the aspect, color and tested the solubility of synthesized Chlorobutanol by the optimized method in<br>water and glycerol 85%. The melting point was measured using B\u00dcCHI Melting Point B-545 [4].<br>2.3.2. Chemical characterization processes<br>Reaction A: in a 100 ml beaker, 1 ml of pyridine, 2 ml of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution and 20 mg of<br>synthesized Chlorobutanol were mixed, heated in a water bath and finally let stand [5].<br>Reaction B: in a 100 ml beaker, 5 ml of ammoniacal solution of silver nitrate and 20 mg of synthesized<br>Chlorobutanol were mixed and heated slightly [5].<br>Acidity test: in a 100 ml beaker, 20 mg of synthesized Chlorobutanol, 15 ml of ethanol and 0.1 ml of bromothymol<br>blue and 1 ml d\u2019hydroxyde de sodium 0.01M were mixed [5].<br>2.3.3. Dosage test<br>In a 200 ml beaker, 0.1 g of synthesized Chlorobutanol was dissolved in 20 ml of ethanol 96%, 10 ml of dilute<br>sodium hydroxide solution was added. The mixture was heated in a water bath for 5 minutes and then cooled. Add<br>20 ml of diluted nitric acid, 25 ml of 0,1M silver nitrate and 2 ml of dibutyl phthalate. After stirring, 2 ml of ferric<br>sulfate and ammonium solution was added. Finally, a titration with ammonium thiocyanate [6].<br>2.3.4. Loss on drying: 0.3 g of synthesized Chlorobutanol was dried in the oven at 105 \u00b0C for 1 hour. A second<br>weighing was performed after desiccation [7].<br>3. Results and Discussion<br>3.1.
