Nile red stains intracellular lipid droplets yellow. In most polar solvents, Nile red will not fluoresce; however, when in a lipid-rich environment, it can be intensely fluorescent, with varying colours from deep red (for polar membrane lipid) to strong yellow-gold emission (for neutral lipid in intracellular storages). The dye is highly solvatochromic and its emission and excitation wavelength both shift depending on solvent polarity[1] and in polar media will hardly fluoresce at all.[2]\r<br>\r<br>Nile red has applications in cell biology, where it can be used as a membrane dye which can be readily visualized using an epifluorescence microscope with excitation and emission wavelengths usually shared with red fluorescent protein. Nile red has also been used as part of a sensitive detection process for microplastics in bottled water.[3][4] Additionally, nile red is a remarkable candidator in fabricating membrane for different sensors to detect environmental changes, such as taste, gas, pH, etc.[5]\r<br>\r<br>In triglycerides (a neutral lipid), Nile red has an excitation maximum of about 515 nm (green), and emission maximum of about 585 nm (yellow-orange).[6] In contrast, in phospholipids (polar lipids), Nile red has an excitation maximum of about 554 nm (green), and an emission maximum of about 638 nm (red).[7]\r<br>\r<br>Synthesis<br>Nile red can be prepared through acid hydrolysis by boiling a solution of Nile blue with sulfuric acid.[8] This process replaces an iminium group with a carbonyl group. Alternatively, Nile red and its analogs (naphthooxazine dyes) can be prepared by acid-catalyzed condensation of corresponding 5-(dialkylamino)-2-nitrosophenols with 2-naphthol. The yields are generally moderate as no co-oxidant is used in this procedure.[9] Since the reaction to generate Nile red does not usually completely exhaust the supply of Nile blue, additional separation steps are required if pure Nile red is needed.", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T14:16:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jim A", "comment_text": "&quot;I hit 40k subs and I honestly thought it was going to be the most I&#39;d ever have.&quot; - NileRed, currently with 3.78 MILLION subs and popular enough to be parodied by an entire channel (by NileGreen)", "comment_date": "2022-01-09T04:40:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Heck", "comment_text": "Love the channel", "comment_date": "2022-01-08T14:39:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Long Tin Huen", "comment_text": "Explosives: In the fridge. <br>Highly dangerous acids and compounds: In normal cabinets I use to put shoes. <br>Dyes and color agents: In the only locked cabinet in the entire chemical storage area.", "comment_date": "2022-01-07T14:04:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BABACAN OFLAZ", "comment_text": "Your tutelage would be good thing to sell with video  anyone would appreciate a masters hand helping him even with a video while experimenting", "comment_date": "2022-01-06T19:34:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Step Ver", "comment_text": "you thought that 4k subs was going to be it? well, you have over 3M now", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T01:40:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahee Sh", "comment_text": "This is THE location for Breaking Bad in a parallel universe \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude09", "comment_date": "2022-01-02T07:06:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "what", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the THC urine test for?", "comment_date": "2021-12-30T02:59:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Metsys", "comment_text": "Please make meth ! :D", "comment_date": "2021-12-28T09:49:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ND Vibes", "comment_text": "good luck for your new lab I like your videos :)", "comment_date": "2021-12-28T04:28:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iliketrains0pwned", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mk4Q5omv3Q&amp;t=5m04s\">5:04</a> If Drake didn&#39;t forget the power saw", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T23:24:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ayden Sexton", "comment_text": "&quot;ah yes and here i keep my flammable stuff here beside my oven&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T12:47:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mike Morzinski", "comment_text": "i like how hes just casually, &quot;and heres my poison bucket, it has stuff like cyanide and lead and mercury compounds&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-12-17T03:58:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Snow-maker", "comment_text": "And then he moves again", "comment_date": "2021-12-14T03:51:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colonel Hacker", "comment_text": "Is that really enough water for an emergency eyewash when at times you need to flush for 15 minutes?

Also, I have seen people doing pretty stupid things on YouTube wth liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen and again, thinking of confined spaces, with N2, you can take the O2 well down below 21% to a level that cannot support life and with O2, take above around 25% and fires get difficult to put out.

CARBON. Put it in the microwave. How can I measure the temp of that plasma? GRAPHENE OXIDE. Before you microwave it, test on a styrofoam boat in water for diamagnetic or magnetic. After microwaving it becomes super paramagnetic, but why? After you make your graphene oxide, (electrolisys of graphite (+) and platinum plated Titanium mesh (-) @ 10-12volts for approx 3 days. Also for every gallon of distilled water, add 50 grams of potassium sulphate, (sulphate of potash) for your electrolyte. car battery charger works well for power supply. Do this in a 5 gallon bucket with you cathode and anode dropped in from the top, though the lid for the 5 gallon bucket, secured and made air-tight with hot glue. If you have a submersible water pump, (the kind you can buy at the hardware store for small garden fountains), it greatly increases the yield of the GO, (graphene oxide). After 3 days reaction, take a torch to the surface of the water, while your pump is still circulating water.... you should see that GO will actually swim to the flame even against the current! This I cannot explain. Now remove your electrodes, turn off your pump, let the water settle so that there no more current. tie a torus N54 neodymium magnet to a piece of string and hang from a bar across the bucket so that half the magnet is submerged. Now look closely at the GO around the magnet. This is not an air battery because the bucke is not metal. This &quot;perpetual movment of the GO too cannot be explained, unless this is some form of room temperature super conductivity, which I tend to believe it may be, due to another experiment that backs this up. That experiment is the 3D printing of a geometric lattice that gets coated with GO. When the lattice is charged briefly with a 9 volt battery, the lattice hold a small, (0.10 volt) charge until the lattice is grounded). If you have the time, I would like you to verify my findings. Ive asked no one to do this yet, but I assure you I have verified hundreds of times my self. One last piece of information... IBM, Intel and others have been trying to figure out how to use graphene as the replacement for silicone to manufacture computer processors. The difficulty is that Graphene can not be made act as a transistor, because the only way to turn the transistor, (switch) on and off is to do so physically... that is until you microwave it. Ive open sourced this and even wrote to their engineers, but strangely no response. Funny thing is that my super para-magnetic graphene page is the most visited page on my website. <a href=\"https://www.noble3dprinters.com/aylward\">https://www.Noble3DPrinters.com/aylward</a>.

But I&#39;ve replicated some of my favs. Cadaverine, methyl anthranilate syntheses, chloroform (risky, I know). But I don&#39;t play with highly sensitive stuff. For example your distillation of ether. Your warnings in the beginning of your videos, for example the warning for you video making silicon tetrachloride. The moment you said it&#39;s extremely dangerous, and it can kill you. That&#39;s a red flag for me not to even entertain the idea. I love messing with liquid nitrogen though, very fun. That&#39;s risky but not so much once you understand the risks, dangers, and safety precautions. I wear all the right equipment.

(i understand you don&#39;t have running water on-site for now, but you can run the RO at home and bring the water in). once you stop washing glassware with tap water you will never go back.<br><br>an air filter makes more of a difference to experiment reliability than you would think. less dust means everything from weighing to decomposition is more consistent. a good example is that i can store 12% peroxide open in an unfiltered room for maybe a day tops, but can leave it in a filtered one for over a week. there are however some reactions which will ONLY happen when there is sufficient dust, i find that dandruf is a suitable substitute in most cases.                             .<br><br>wrap every chemical container with way to much parafilm, there are many reasons for this but it becomes exponentially more important the more different samples you have in proximity to one another. in 20 years when you&#39;r looking at your old bottles wondering if it&#39;s permanganate or iodine, you&#39;l be glad you can still read the labels. it helps contain smashed glass containers to which has saved me from long hazardous cleanups many times. <br><br>things are just what they are made of, so most lab gear is WAY overpriced, a home made fume hood hood is cheep, easy and often more chemically resilient than a brand made one. a hood can get pretty beat up and it&#39;s hard to get every last trace of some compounds out of there, so i like to replace parts every few months. i mostly use RTV silicon as the sealant as it&#39;s chemically resistant, airtight and you can take it off easily with a razor blade. you can build a scrubber to go before your exhaust to give yourself a bit more flexibility on what you can do<br><br>lastly a note on safety gear.<br><br>POWDER fire extinguisher. just do it, don&#39;t let your dreams be dreams.<br><br> an eye bath is nice but you can squirt saline into your eyes from the standard opticians bottles easily enough that it&#39;s optional.<br><br>a shower however, is; in my opinion, an absolute must when working above test tube scale with anything more dangerous than say 10% acetic. if you&#39;r distilling hardware sulfuric without a shower then may figurative god help you if it super-heats and goes pop.<br><br>a nice tub of sodium bicarbonate in easy reach. as it can neutralize both acids and strong bases you can just chuck it on anything if you&#39;r unsure what to do (there are some rare incompatibilities so use common sense). due to bicarb being so cheep i use it like i would a bucket of sand if theirs a fire.<br><br>some Plexiglas glued to a stand as a blast/spatter screen comes in handy.<br><br>ps: i&#39;l probably be posting some videos to you-tube once i have a backlog of 10 episodes and i finish editing.<br><br>RIP to the EM community. hopefully you-tube won&#39;t continue it&#39;s path of destroying chemistry videos.", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T23:08:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J Alvi", "comment_text": "Love your candid honesty.

I find your videos entertaining and informative.   Well done.<br><br>Re:  Your thoughts on doing You Tube videos being weird<br><br>I have some perspective to share.  I&#39;m an 80&#39;s era kid, and am largely self taught in most things I do for my own pleasure and professionally.  College rounded that out some, and wasn&#39;t the investment it is for people today.<br><br>Back then, taking one&#39;s own path was more of an outlier.  Like you, I tend to enjoy learning and sharing what I learn, and often have that outlet professionally.<br><br>To explain that, I grew up at the end of what I will characterize as a, &quot;learn and do to solve problems&quot; type culture.  My many antics learning about technology, science, and other things as a kid were rewarded back then.  People encouraged it, and I found many opportunities to apply what I learned to help others, make date money, and generally get started.  Honestly, that was more of an outlier type way to navigate life back then.  The trend was toward a &quot;spend to solve or do&quot; culture.  That didn&#39;t work for me, but it did for most of my peers.<br><br>One of the reasons for that was it being hard.  Information access largely consisted of going to a library and doing a lot of reading, and figuring out how to get to talk to people with experience.<br><br>Over the last decade, I&#39;ve seen our access to information change things considerably.  Anyone with an interest, passion, can find out pretty much all they need to know online.  Given a mentor, group, or even just focus and some resolve, it is possible to reach considerable mastery, and increasing numbers of people do.<br><br>Honestly, your decisions and feelings about all of this make a great deal of sense.   <br><br>This trend toward people learning, doing, making, experimenting, is on the rise, and you are in resonance with all of that.  Many of the expectations set for us, tend to clash with hard realities these days.  It is also a lot more important to manage one&#39;s burdens and the requirements associated with them as, for many people, risk reward propositions are more aggressive than they have been in the past.   <br><br>The world is growing complex.  And for many, too many I feel, it&#39;s also quite expensive.  Flat out, it&#39;s much harder for most people to make a good living, and this has forced changes in life expectations that resonate with the work you, and many others, are doing.<br><br>Not only do we have insane information access, many people can get the things they need shipped to them, often at a very reasonable cost.   <br><br>It&#39;s not weird.  You are in resonance with growing norms.

In my opinion, i thinks that air-free technique for organic synthesis might be a good way to start with your new lab ( which made me very excited ) . you can made some Grignard reagent under inert atmosphere ( nitrogen or argon ) or made some cool video with the schlenk line ( with schlenk tube ) or Gilam reagent, Organozinc, OrganoLithium or may be cross coupling reaction ( which i think is very cool such as Suzuki, Heck,Negishi, Buchwald Hartwig or Chan-Lam cross coupling which i have working for a year ) and even you can publish a science paper with those glassware ( if you have enough chemical and a analytical balance-of course ).

Not to mention the immense embarrassment from the attention of equally ignorant neighbours who were evacuated or saw everything happening. The most dangerous thing I ever made was about 0.5 g of nitrocellulose, which was placed into a bomb disposal trailer and detonated at a police disposal range (Was on the Australian TV show The Force - 2013).
