However, when working with organic solvents, beware of the risk of fire. Solvent/air mixtures can even be explosive. When working with diethyl ether one should keep in mind that this chemical forms peroxides during storage. Especially when you evaporate etheric extracts to dryness as in this video, you can get a nasty explosion, with fragments of the flask flying around.<br><br>There is a procedure to make ether peroxide-free, but it is rather involved. Easier might be the use of tert. butyl methyl ether, which doesn&#39;t form peroxides for steric reasons. As a solvent it has similar properties as diethyl ether (except that it doesn&#39;t work in Gringard&#39;s reaction).<br><br>Fluorescein can also be purified by pouring the molten raw product into some dilute HCl (~ 1 M) and boiling. This extracts most of the contaminants without the use of organic solvents. Filter, discard the acid and dry the insoluble material, which is chromatographically pure fluorescein. Both the raw product and also commercial fluorescein have some brownish contaminant that forms a long tail during thin-layer chromatography.<br><br>Somebody mentioned eosin synthesis. This is quite simple: Disperse some fluorescein in absolute ethanol, stir and dropwise add a stoichiometric amount of bromine (which of course is a very corrosive and toxic liquid, so work carefully in a fume cupboard). Initially, the mixture will turn into a solution as ethanol-soluble dibromofluorescein is formed. Further addition of bromine leads to precipitation of tetrabromofluorescein, i.e., eosine. Simply filter and dry, if you started from pure fluorescein  you do not need to further purify the eosin. Again, it is interesting to take samples at various stages of the reaction for TLC.<br><br>If you keep the eosine over a vessel of NH4OH over night, it reacts with the NH3 gas and you get the ammonium salt of eosine, which is more water-soluble than the free acid.<br><br>I have not tried this, but if the bromine is replaced by iodine, you should get erythrosin (eosine B for blueish), which has an even more intensive colour than eosine Y (for yellowish).", "comment_date": "2017-02-05T12:51:47Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "David Crunk", "comment_text": "hullo, love your videos! just one silly question, if you had the stir bar in the bottom oil bath how is it stirring the florocene?
