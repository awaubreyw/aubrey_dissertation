That&#39;s God stating it in that verse and there are more verses. People need to repent, to be cleansed by His blood and live Holy because He&#39;s Holy and righteous because He&#39;s righteous. Our God said to stop sinning in many many scriptures and He paid for everyone to be cleansed of sin (Isaiah 53), and to live how He said. He dwells in the Holy temple (your body) and said not to defile the temple. He said to defile the temple is death. He&#39;s always serious about everything He said to do. He&#39;s just as serious about what He said not to do. We live in obedience to His law, every word if it! He dwells within us all to be with and lead us in His ways. \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude4f<br><br>Deuteronomy 28 there are blessings for obedience and curses for disobedience. The whole chapter, and verse 46 is one example of generational curses. These go into the following generations, the 3 and 4th. Our children pay the price for our sin. Stop sinning you are sending consequences to yourself and to your loved ones, children. By God&#39;s law you are. If you don&#39;t believe me ask Him, in Jesus name may you see and know the truth in it&#39;s fullness.\u00a0<br><br>He&#39;s worthy of everything He said and paid for, so I implore you to do as God said.
