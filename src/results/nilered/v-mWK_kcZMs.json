This is an anti explosive, anti nuclear supernatural chemical invented by the Ancient Egyptians for the purpose of preventing any bad omens including but not limited to explosions both nuclear and non-nuclear, and any radioactive activity in general. The reason they created this chemical was due to the dangerous highly radioactive particles that constantly were emitted by the Ancient Kitten Gods who ruled over Egypt, and the entire world. <br><br>Unfortunately not many people are knowledgeable on this topic, but that is not that is not their fault whatsoever. The Kitten Gods purposely hid their presence from everyone else other than The Ancient Egyptians, who were actually a test run to see how they would react to perceiving such powerful omniscient and omnipotent beings. The Ancient Egyptians could barely handle the presence of low level Kitten Gods, and only after first of all inventing Flufficus-Kitteneum, then further researching and developing different forms of it did they complete the perfect and purified form of the chemical which had supernatural properties, were they able to survive past 5 minutes of exposure to these low level Kitten Gods. Which by the way, for the curious viewers and ask any aspiring scientists out there, the specific form of this chemical was a positive DiFlufficus-Kitteneum Molecule bonded with Chlorine (Fk\u2082Cl\u2082). <br><br>The great part about this specific form, is that all they had to do was ingest 5.3 grams of the chemical. Eventually the Ancient Egyptians created a drink mixture similar to the method shown in Nile\u2019s video, except instead of making an Alcoholic beverage they created a drink mix called Flying Kitten Dreams, which the recipe for it consisted of the following:<br><br>(Don\u2019t try this at home kids, this is a highly illegal concoction in most countries currently due to the fact that the government found out about its supernatural properties in 1931, the same year and time that Diacetylmorphin was banned (Heroine, I know both forms of the drug are spelled wrong and they and any other drugs will be spelled wrong in any other times during this comment, doing that so YouTube doesn\u2019t delete the comment as people need to know about the Kitten Gods). Coincidence? I think not. Seriously though that is the soul reason it was made illegal, along with other drugs as the government feared what would happen if the Kitten Gods \u201creturned\u201d once again to enlighten the people of Earth. Well they never actually left, but we can no longer see them and they can no longer see us unless the following drink mixture is infested. Anyways here is the recipe.)<br><br>Recipe:<br>Fk\u2082Cl\u2082 - 7.64g<br>Diacetylmorphin - 123mg<br>Amphetamin - 53mg<br>Sugar - 69g (Yes I know it\u2019s not very healthy but they didn\u2019t know nor care back then. Plus you just take it once)<br>Coca Leaves - 18.5g(Very specific but it\u2019s equivalent to about 62mg of coke)<br>Tree Bark - 2.3g<br>Finely Crushed Rose Petals - 7.4g (Mortar and Pestle works best, should be a very fine powder, takes awhile.)<br>And last but not least - 0.25pt Human Blood (Yup... Now I think you understand the sugar content)<br><br>By the way, let\u2019s say you decide to make this, don\u2019t even bother if you have a heart condition because it will kill you. And if you have anxiety and/or panic attacks, it is rather intense at first until the H and kicks in so just know that if you are prone to panic attacks, because you\u2019ll likely have one.<br><br>But that\u2019s all I can tell you about the Kitten Gods, Fluccicus Kitteneum, and Fk\u2082Cl\u2082. not only as in what im ALLOWED to tell you, but also as in what I can PHYSICALLY TELL YOU without you being unable to comprehend what I am saying.

Then it slaps every nerve cell in your throat at the same time, just to let you know you&#39;re alive.<br>Yours was only ~120 proof though, so probably not THAT bad, really. I don&#39;t blame you for not slamming a whole shot of it at once, though.<br><br>FYI, it&#39;s those impurities that make it taste bitter that give people a hangover. A fair percent of those get carried straight to your bloodstream. Fastest way to fix that: Hypersaturate your body with water or orange juice in the morning. Lay down and wait for the water to flush out your kidneys. You&#39;ll get dizzy like you&#39;re drunk again almost immediately, but right after that the contaminints will become dilute and leave your bloodstream. Ibuprofen doesn&#39;t hust, but really it&#39;s just making you feel comfy, the water / juice is fixing the problem. :)", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T07:55:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Xu", "comment_text": "What im getting is if i chew hard enough to break molucules in my t shirt it will eventally taste sweet?", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T07:23:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gato", "comment_text": "What did I just witness", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T06:50:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bandy Bandy", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know much about chemistry, but this was very entertaining", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T06:29:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Knight", "comment_text": "Do keep in mind that ethyl alcohol isn&#39;t the only type of alcohol produced through fermentation.

By stearing you keep temperature of solution eaven, that why all of alcohol inside flask  started to boil at once hence run away.  <br>Secondly insulating column just kill it function, instead of having temperatures gradient that would allow water to condense on glass and drop back to boiling flask you created setup that used column as decoration. <br>Pro tip, by colecting multiple fraction you could save a lot of energy, time and just dont delute just purify product.<br>I also like to mention that ethanol is tasteless so thing that You tasted was a bunch impurities. <br>Ps. From my experience fermentation preformed on pure glucose still produced some methanol, although I judging it by compare density of 70\u00b0C - 75\u00b0C fraction with 78\u00b0C- 81\u00b0C (booth in temperature of -4\u00b0C) so I  might be wrong.

So it should be much lower though near the boiling point of ethanol. If the temperature slowly increases then you are going up the boiling line. It means the solution will contain less and less ethanol. Something were we start to use fractional destiallation. Also know about azeotropic points that ethanol-water have at around 96% ethanol concentration. This means, you can never with water together get higher concentrations like that, if you not chemically or physically capture the water.<br>Learn about the kill of concentration of yeast by alcohold which is about 14%.

Those guys know A LOT more about the chemistry of distillation than you do. First off you let it run too long and likely had vinegar before you distilled it. There&#39;s an optimum period that mash &quot;works off&quot; before it goes too long and becomes vinegar. (happened to Josh on that show numerous times) 3 weeks was WAY too long to let the mash go. Also a hydrometer will tell you exactly what percentage of alcohol your mash is at post fermentation, and what percentage your alcohol is post distillation. You can also use it to tell how much sugar is in the mash as well. Each further distillation strips the impurities from the alcohol and raises the alcohol percentage but removes all flavor from it. Also wood alcohol is methanol not ethanol and methanol is toxic, let alone it&#39;s oxidized form.. formaldehyde.", "comment_date": "2020-10-04T21:06:18Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "J.A.Ratt85", "comment_text": "Okay at the beginning of this before I watch the whole video I have to point out that yes ethanol is drinkable, but without impurities it 1) is incredibly dangerous to drink as the high level alcohol quickly becomes toxic by overwhelming your liver, and B) it won&#39;t taste good, it&#39;ll be like drinking rubbing alcohol. The flavor of alcohol is actually locked in the impurities that are transferred over during distilling from the mash. Most people consider 80 proof or 40% alcohol by volume to be the best drinking percentage for hard liquor. To make drinkable and palatable alcohol from something that doesn&#39;t inherently taste good, you&#39;d need to add in flavors, one of the easiest ways to do that would be to add in terpenes from marijuana such as limonene. You could also add in CBD to give it some health benefits at the same time. Hey! There&#39;s a video you should do!

If you&#39;re reading the PA scale after fermentation, it is NOT telling you the alcohol content. And if it&#39;s reading high (i.e. 80), that&#39;s a sign that you have mostly sugar, and a low alcohol content, not high.<br>Now maybe there&#39;s some sort of hydrometer with a scale I&#39;m not familiar with, but I&#39;ve never heard of a hydrometer with a scale for reading alcohol percentage directly, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s even possible. It sounds like you&#39;re reading the PA scale as if it&#39;s a direct measure of alcohol content, which it absolutely is not.", "comment_date": "2020-07-11T14:16:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChildishPotato", "comment_text": "You should get a.

I think this overall process is super interesting and this is a cool experiment, but I have some commentary I&#39;d like to share. <br><br>Rather than using a chemical pretreatment, I believe you could also have finely ground the toilet paper in your buffer medium and the dissolved enzymes in one solution. To grind/chop the pulp, you&#39;d use a high powered blender before enzymatic hydrolysis. So why use alkaline pretreatment at all? Well, the reference you use mentions alkaline pretreatment for &quot;lignocellulosic&quot; biomass, which is a key difference! Alkaline pretreatment for this feedstock functions to remove additional compounds the cellulose is entrained in, like lignin and hemicellulose. However, for high purity cellulose like in paper products, you simply need to increase the surface area of the cellulose before hydrolysis, since the cellulose is no longer entrained in cell walls with the other polymers like it is in raw biomass. I say this only because it might have saved you an extra step and wouldn&#39;t have taken as long as you might have believed if the paper was sufficiently ground before hydrolysis. Even though we know alkaline pretreatment works to increase the surface area of cellulose, it might not necessary because it requires an additional consumable and step in the process.<br><br>Some lignocellulosic pretreatment doesn&#39;t even use an alkaline pretreatment. Sulfuric acid pretreatment before hydrolysis and fermentation is also common, even if it functions completely differently than the alkaline pretreatment. In a perfect world, no pretreatment would be required to separate the cellulose from the biomass, but we&#39;ve yet to figure out a way to do that. I would be happy to send you the papers that review these pretreatment steps if you&#39;re interested in this kind of work!", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T23:15:55Z", "likes_count": 472}, {"comment_by": "Izzy -", "comment_text": "\u201cI was eventually left with a nice and mushy toilet paper stew\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T22:08:27Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Louis Piper Carson", "comment_text": "But is the reverse reaction possible?", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T16:28:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matheus Moreira", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-mWK_kcZMs&amp;t=23m47s\">23:47</a> &quot;... this wasn&#39;t a huge <i>dildo...&quot;</i> lol", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T14:51:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Kramme", "comment_text": "Weird flex, but ok.", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T09:43:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LenZi", "comment_text": "2020<br>Me: &quot;Cool, i&#39;m gonna do this too&quot;\r<br>Entire Family: <b><i>&quot;B*tch, y r u throwing??&quot;</i></b>", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T07:23:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ata Orhan", "comment_text": "he knew.. how did he know...", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T06:53:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "urmom1120", "comment_text": "I love how he said dirty toilet paper wine", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T05:40:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "#Reaper", "comment_text": "Just FYI: that toilet paper isn&#39;t pure cellulose, it contains an nice amount of optical brighteners (which I suspect to be not that tasty).

If you poured some of the pot off, it would have prevented this, however cleaning the tube and column would have eliminated the white cloud you ended up with at the end.  Also, wood alcohol is product of the same type of fibers broken down, however methanol, or wood alcohol and other volatile compounds such as isopropyl are probably being output within the first good 10% of your batch that comes off at like 148 to 170. At 173 the ethyl alcohol is released and should be the only alcohol you do NOT discard. Once it gets to maybe 185 it may start to get cloudy again , so you should shut it down and discard the tails to eliminate fusil oils. You should have between 120 and 160 proof alcohol due to the use of the column as it tempers the distillation like a thumper would if you did it correctly without a paper enzyme bubble bath. The PH was probably not correct as well due to the enzyme remaining active while fermenting. The ph should be taken before yeast has been added and after fermentation so you could determine the ABV your wash will have.

Besides yeast strain type etc, Controlling fermentation temperature to the low side is a helpful way to reduce the amount of Fusel oil,  yeast metabolism by-products such as higher alcohols, aldehydes and ketones etc that are inevitably produced by yeast as the process continues. In any case, the worst portion and type of this Fusel oil fraction as it is called can and MUST be removed in any fermented and distilled alcohol intended for human consumption, the majority of these by-products have boiling points lower than ethanol,  B.P. ~78.6 Degrees Celsius, and thus will distill over first, this is usually accompanied by a smaller portion of the ethyl alcohol that is also discarded as the thermometer rises up-to distillation temperature , and controlled and stabilized near the B.P of the Alcohol, a little more of the distillate is also allowed to distill over just as a precaution to be certain that the Fusel oil has indeed been boiled off. This may sound like old hat to many of you, and it is, but it cannot be over-stated for the newbie who wants to give DIY booze a go. Every year many people either just flat out die or go blind, or at the least damage their Livers or worse Brains by drinking home made alcohol without getting rid of the first 100 Milli Liters or so that come from the condenser. Brain cells and the light sensitive cells on the Retina in the back of the eye are most sensitive to the livers metabolites of the Fusel oil , and to make matters worse, it can be a slow acting poisoning, often the damage is done by the next day, but this also offers a silver lining in that if caught early enough, the stomach can be pumped, activated charcoal used, or syrup of Ipecac to induce vomiting, a sulfur containing amino acid called cysteine, common in eggs, can also help prevent further liver damage. Ethanol itself, oddly enough, can also be given to protect the body from METHANOL poisoning, as it is preferentially acted on by the livers enzyme systems, while the methanol can be flushed out via the kidneys in urine, as the Methanol itself isn&#39;t terribly toxic, it&#39;s the metabolite of the methanol, which is Formaldehyde, that is highly toxic, because it is highly reactive, and binds irreversibly to any organic material having amino acids in it, so basically any part of your body. Formaldehyde is the main chemical in Formalin, which is Formaldehyde dissolved in ethanol, that is used to embalm body parts, seen some brain or eye in a jar at school ? that&#39;s the stuff it&#39;s stored in, oh, and another fun fact, because of this irreversible binding, it is also a potent carcinogen. Isn&#39;t it amazing the difference what one little carbon atom can make, between Methanol and Ethanol, either fun time at the Bar, or no fun at all at the Morgue. now where&#39;s my beer...", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T05:34:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Azr", "comment_text": "NileRed: I guess we could make Alcohol out of toilet papers....<br><br><br>Drunkards: <b>Buys multiple tissue paper rolls</b>", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T05:14:22Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Azr", "comment_text": "NileRed: I guess we could make Alcohol out of toilet papers....<br><br><br>Drunkards: <b>Buys multiple tissue paper rolls</b>", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T05:14:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "andrew peyton", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-mWK_kcZMs&amp;t=8m14s\">8:14</a> mmm popcorn", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T04:38:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travis Mann", "comment_text": "i kinda want to try it lol", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T04:10:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaushik Adhikari", "comment_text": "Niledead", "comment_date": "2019-12-27T02:13:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ReallyRachel", "comment_text": "Can\u2019t really see the baby painting in this one.

This is not how hydrometers work, some hydrometers do have ABV markings on them (I use one myself) but those numbers are potential ABV based on the sugar in solution, not the amount of alcohol in solution.  In order to find out how much alcohol you generated with a hydrometer, you would have needed to take a specific gravity reading before adding yeast, and then again after fermentation. These numbers are your Original Gravity and Final Gravity respectively, you then Subtract the OG from the FG and multiply that number by 131.25 and that number is your ABV percentage.  Though this still doesn&#39;t help you after distilling, because you are changing the volume.  Calculating the ABV of a distilled spirit with a hydrometer really isn&#39;t possible, because you lose so much volume in the distillation process that your gravity readings will be thrown way off. You may have been able to use an alcoholmeter, but those are finicky, any sugars or other solubles still in solution will throw your readings way off.

In order to actually make a difference, humanity would need to plant 20 million trees every single day for years on end, and this assumes all the trees survive. And at that point they would store the co2 in their mass but that co2 would be released back into the atmosphere when the trees die and decay.<br><br>Team Trees goal is at best, a good intentioned jester that highlights communities who wish for a better future for the planet. And while this is a good thing, it is not realistic to expect a one off planting of 20 million trees to actually help the planet much. Real issue is the actual emission of co2 by humans and their constant use of fossil fuels, first that must be reduced and or eliminated and then humanity as a whole needs to unify in gradually removing the co2 from the atmosphere over a few centuries time", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T14:37:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Epsilon", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-mWK_kcZMs&amp;t=5m06s\">5:06</a> To basically cook it, YEAH RIGHT IT HAS SODIUM HYDROXIDE", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T14:21:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H M M M M M M M M M M M M M M M", "comment_text": "Other youtubers supporting team trees: *makes environment/nature related videos<br><br><br><br><br>Nile Red: <b><i>t o i l e t  p a p e r  m o o n s h i n e</i></b>", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T12:56:21Z", "likes_count": 550}, {"comment_by": "Shiva potdar", "comment_text": "Please make Fluoroantimonic acid", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T12:15:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "OneTwentyOver80", "comment_text": "This is fascinating, I brew beer at home, would love to try distilling!", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T12:07:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KK Tan", "comment_text": "I feel like dating him...

Trust me you do not want ANY of the base in your product before you proceed on to the next stage of your experiment.  With a proper vacuum filter you could have done this easily.  I would have ALSO put the product in a BLENDER with some distilled water after it was washed - and chopped up the paper even more!  This would have also sped up the reaction process by quite a bit!  Don&#39;t knock blenders lol - they work really well!  ESPECIALLY if you have a Blendtec Blender like I do :D (will it blend?  fuck yes it&#39;ll blend.  It&#39;ll blend an entire fucking broom handle into dust if you want,  FFS you can even blend a damn iphone in this behemoth of a blender LOL.  That blender IS expensive though - and there is NO way around that cost if you want one - I too use the Blendtec Blender frequently in my lab LOL).  I would have ALSO waited longer than 48 hours for the cellulase to finish up eating up the cellulose.  I would have ALSO added more if it was required to finish off ALL of the product so you are left with a liquid with NO paper in it!

It turns dark blue/black when there is starch<br>- To avoid the mess during the first round of distillation, filter your brew and then degas it.

I made a lot of crappy moonshine when I was in school, so I have some experience. I think you might find it goes faster if you don&#39;t overfill the boiling flask and if you connect the condenser directly to the flask instead of putting the reflex column between. Boil moderately first run, slower on second run. The first run should have had about the alcohol content you ended up with. The second run should have been strong enough that a sip would kill the top layer of skin in your mouth so it peels off after a minute or so. Except for the obvious foaming problem, I really don&#39;t see why it wasn&#39;t much stronger than it was.

They are grouped into endocellulases, which attack the bond at random positions, exocellulases, which &quot;cut off&quot; mostly cellobiose (the beta1-4 glucose disaccharide) from the ends of the bonds and cellobiases, which splits cellobiose into glucose. Most Bacteria and yeasts like T. reesei produce multiple exocellulases, endocellulases and cellobiases. Although the above isn&#39;t entirely correct since it was found out that most of the cellulases specify on one of these things, but most can actually do all of them, this classification is still common. Summarizing, cooking the cellulose in base definitely helps the process a lot, but I&#39;ve also been able to produce significant amounts of glucose out of paper towels without any pretreatment except for cutting them down a bit and  blending them with a household blender.<br>Edit:<br>Specifically t reesei doesn&#39;t produce a lot of enzymes that act as exocellulases, so they don&#39;t really attack the ends of the bonds too much - so while you can speed the process up alot by pretreatment, they can cope with pretty big chains - here is a figure showing what enzymes t reesei produces: ( <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Trichoderma-reesei-cellulolytic-enzymes_tbl1_317276203\">https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Trichoderma-reesei-cellulolytic-enzymes_tbl1_317276203</a> )", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T23:57:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "THEEMPEROR NM", "comment_text": "go to your bathroom take the toilet paper and drain cleaner and get wasted \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T23:57:07Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Anton", "comment_text": "Now make toilet paper from alcohol", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T23:56:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "kropf leuchtenfu\u00df", "comment_text": "Mabe a freeze destillation would be the more economic first step in concentrating ethanol.", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T23:56:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "colosalblack", "comment_text": "You should make a follow up video inviting a vodka \rconnoisseur to taste it and film his reaction.", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T23:55:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "groog", "comment_text": "Oh I thought you was making your favorite carcinogen in heaven", "comment_date": "2019-11-15T23:55:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "richard koo", "comment_text": "This video makes my day.
