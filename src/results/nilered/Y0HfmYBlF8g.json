I realize that a compressor capable of that kind of pressure will set you back a bit if you buy it brand new but a well maintained used unit would be a reasonable option.  Especially if you can use that compressor for other experiments.  When depressurizing the chamber slowly you want to use a gate valve like one would have on a outside water spigot.  It gives you greater controll and will also last longer.  For better temperature control you can get some heat tape/trace from a hardware store and then insulate the chamber for even heating.  You could then keep everything stationary which may help prevent cracking in the future.  Perhaps you could find a method to make this insulator more pliable, wouldn&#39;t that be something?<br>     Do those raycon ear buds have ambient sound?

So to do more at once:<br>Add another section of straight pipe at the bottom of the 4-way.  Make a little rack that lets you stack a few gels on top of one another (like a commercial baker&#39;s rack) and load from the bottom.  Have the top of this race have some wires with a half circle loop that catches on a small wire frame inside, such that you can lift it up from the bottom and then rotate it 45 degrees and lower it to set the hooks on the rack into the catches in the frame.  It should hold itself down enough to handle the turbulence of all the fluid moving around without being terribly complicated to make or to engage the catch for loading (though it obviously would need to be kept upright and not shaken like crazy).<br><br>You could then either have this frame hanging out of the bottom of the 4-way and then screw on the longer bottom section with endcap already fastened, or feed it up through the long segment and just attach the endcap/ bottom valve to seal.  I kind of feel like removing the whole pipe with endcap might be easier, though, since it would probably be better for have all the valve stuff set and not messed with than trying to screw that end bit on without fucking it up when slotting the socket wrench over it.<br><br>Then you can fill with methanol through the air bleeder valve or the CO2 valve, if the CO2 wouldn&#39;t cause freezing problems with the methanol in the valve (or add a 3rd valve if you want the extra bit of complexity).  So screwing on the bottom pipe/ endcap would have to be done fairly quickly to make sure you don&#39;t dry the gels, but I think it can be done and would really only add the extra cost of that one straight pipe segment and the bits of wire to make that frame (which, TBH, could probably be made mostly out of plain old bailing wire or coat hangers, if you really wanted to cheap out.). I also think that once you have the pipes sealed even incompletely while you crank it down really tight, the methanol evaporation is going to slow considerably, giving you more breathing room.  I live at high altitude, though, so maybe I&#39;m overestimating the evaporation rate of... everything.<br><br>For the container for the water bath, I would suggest just using a trash can, honestly. Dirt cheap and deep.  Maybe not the best, visually, but if you really wanted you could silicone in a clear acrylic window to the side.  But all the action is through the pressure chamber windows, anyways, so IDK if being able to see the wonderful sight of &quot;pipes in a bucket&quot; really matters all that much.<br><br>Also, tiny mirror in the chamber to see the gels.  You could probably even take one of those fish-eye mirrors for sticking onto your rear view mirror and cut a section in the middle out and get a nice wide angle view in the chamber.  Dirt cheap at any auto parts store.  Though IDK if the materials would hold up under those conditions.  Even a piece of polished stainless stuck in there would be better than nothing.  I&#39;m sure you can find someone who will sell you a 1-inch square of any metal you want that&#39;s been polished to a mirror finish in any shape you want.  Find a machining or metalworking YouTuber and collab for it, if companies don&#39;t want to do such a small job.  Or do it yourself.  Most of the mirror polishing process just requires a lot of patience.  Or maybe a cheap hobby mirror would do, IDK.  I just don&#39;t know if a thin sheet of mirrored glass will hold up in those conditions, and I would hate if your otherwise perfect aerogel run got ruined because a glass mirror exploded from the temperature changes and pressure or something and peppered your aerogel and valves with shards of glass.<br><br>Sorry for the novel, I&#39;ve just been fascinated with aerogel since I was pretty young, and seeing this has me very tempted to just run out and blow my savings on the kit to do this.

Use a ratchet or some other long bar to turn the valve.  It&#39;s a lot easier to move a 12 inch bar by 1 degree than it is a 2 inch valve handle.  You do want a tight fit, but even then so long as you keep it locked against the surface that you&#39;re pressing on with that leverage, it should give you very fine control over how open that valve is.<br><br>Edit: oh, he figured that out on the second run.  Still, though, he mentioned it as an aside, but it&#39;s a  super, super, super useful thing to know when trying to get fine control like this, and it&#39;s not necessarily an intuitive thing.  I think it&#39;s natural to associate more leverage with more brute force, and not so much with finer control.  But, the longer the lever, the more fine you can get.

But I have a question for you, and if you solve it you would actually be helping people with their REAL lives. Is there any way to make starting ether from readily obtainable household or hardware-store chemicals?<br>     Myself and several friends all have lawnmowers and gas-powered weed-eaters that are occasionally hard to start. We live here in Thailand, and because the weather is warm, the stores feel no need to import starting ether. It is, however, FREQUENTLY very humid and the jet-setting one uses one day will often cause the mower to be non-startable a day or so later when the humidity changes. So, it would really help US, rather than twiddling the carb jets and pulling the starter cord 17k times, if we had some ether;  the mower/weed-eaters would start easier and THEN one can adjust the jets...it can&#39;t be done before the engine is running.

If it tightens clockwise, then when you&#39;re looking down at it from the top apply it clockwise, and it will go on correctly. It sounds counter intuitive, but this way is easy to remember and it will be counter-clockwise to thread tightening when its installed. Its a matter of the perspective you&#39;re looking at it when applying compared to perspective when you&#39;re tightening, but there is one way to apply it and a lot of people mess it up. I still have to think twice before every time I use it.  Looks like it went on properly in the video though, so kudos.<br><br>Also, a good rule of thumb is to give it a wrap or two extra, somewhere around 5-7 wraps, to account for the tape mashing into the thread pitch of your fittings, you want enough to mash into both sets of threads and fill any air gaps. This helps to form a good seal and makes up for the part tolerances from machining. Then when tightening go probably a full turn at least from where its snug.  In this application it might be good to find out if you need to torque it to a certain setting since you&#39;re dealing with significant pressures. Shouldn&#39;t have any leaks but its always good practice to leak test any time you newly install or adjust. If it goes to crap and shreds while fitting together, then peel it, re-apply, and re-tighten to specification. Teflon tape has great temperature and pressure ratings (-240 C to 260 C @ 10,000 PSI). It can tolerate it as long as you apply enough and apply it properly.<br><br>If you do any home plumbing I&#39;d recommend the same way if you&#39;re using iron/steel fittings or piping. Or go old school with copper, sweat the pipe with flux, and solder the fittings in place for the best plumbing results, just don&#39;t use copper in this scenario. Burst pressures are way lower with copper around 2900 PSI (for annealed copper).<br><br>Also, capillary is pronounced like &quot;kap-ill-air-E&quot;. Never until today have I heard anyone pronounce it where it about sounds similar to caterpillar<br><br>Last note: Props on a good ball valve, exactly what you want for any application where you need an easy way to shut something off.

For bubbles in the gel I would suggest using something that can induce a frequency to the mold/table that shake the fluid gently so that bubbles rise, or just hit the table repeatedly; however the former is a bit more elegant. For molding you can still use a syringe, just create your own square or hexagonal cylinder with the proper plunger; removes the need to use wax. For heating, you could use a taller and thinner column so less water is needed to be heated. Lastly, for the transition from water to methanol, raise the aerogel holder a bit so that water can accumulate at the bottom while methanol stays at the top; since water is more dense than methanol. Methanol is soluble one water, but if there\u2019s enough methanol then the water should be over saturated and no longer be able to both mix; just don\u2019t increase temp or agitate the solution.", "comment_date": "2020-10-09T11:03:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alluxxi", "comment_text": "\u201dI have never done anything like this\u201d and still you can finish the product every time", "comment_date": "2020-10-09T09:38:52Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Seb Web", "comment_text": "Graphen next :)", "comment_date": "2020-10-09T09:37:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seb Web", "comment_text": "OMG amazing work!

I was personally involved in the launch of the Dodge Caliber, Jeep Compass, and Patriot, then I became the plants Continuous improvement leader, Employee involvement Champion for the Plant of three shift&#39;s  and around 100 hourly and 20 office staff on days. I hold the record for most inventions in Safety, ergonomics, increased production speed, reduction in damaged parts. I held the record in all of Arvinmeritor a fortune 500 company with hundreds of plants worldwide. I recieved a special visit from the North American &quot;White Shirt&quot; Navigator for all of Canada, Mexico, and US plants, after I had taken the Health and Safety Coordinator position for 1 year, I was able to mentor a next level safety team who were truly world class I several category&#39;s. I was also visited by Jana Gassner the Company Chemist, and top brass of Health and Safety, I answered to her, she answered to Chip McClure  the company VP. I basically had my Plant Manager, see my passion for Engineering, Safety, and continuous improvement, and Created the position for me, before it was, thrown on H.R.s back, and it was a full time job plus, required a bachelor&#39;s degree, all I had was a High School diploma, with basically straight As in Honors: Chemistry, Physics, Geometry, College Algebra, Biology...all honors classes.I had Children early and couldn&#39;t afford college. I was able to save our company 100k just in workmans compensation insurance....and I reduced our on the job on injury from and unbelievable 50% percent( mostly repetitive strain injuries of the wrist, shoulders, backs) down to 3%!!!  For new cases. They wanted to know HOW the hell I did it. They said my Health and Safety action plan was the most detailed, not overly muddled with usless detail, while holding those assigned with each task accountable, and if they blew off their agreed due date without explanation, I would document and CC that persons boss, even if that were the Plant Manager. Communication is key, and being calm assertive is major, otherwise Manufacturing Engineers, PLC techs,  and Maintenance guys would eat you alive. I showed them early on, I took the Plants success, and improving the employees overall health very, very seriously and would go toe to toe if they were, not fixing a problem considered A priority by the safety team: A) priority means, fix now, today at the latest, go get parts in town in need be. B) Was something serious enough it needed  repair in 5 days or less, and if it took longer daily updates on the living action plan to communicate it with all. And C) Something that would be nice to have, or something non dangerous or critical, fix, build or order within the month, or  communicate if more time was needed.  And finally TBD. TO BE DETERMINED, CAPITAL OR MAJOR BUYS TO IMPROVE SAFETY OR PRODUCTION! Ideas usually brought up at safety meetings. The other thing I told the White Shirt Navigator about our success, was that we DID NOT DO &quot;TADDLE TALE Safety TEAMS!  This was a challenge from day 1!!!  Bob and Kevin for example hate each other at work, so every time they walk by each other&#39;s area they would nit pick, petty little BS and  and call over me or another person form the Safety Team, now I have their Supervisors contacting me because they are short a person. I&#39;D go check it out and it would be something NOT safety related so my VERY NEXT safety meeting all 8 to 12 members were there, plus Night shift Safety Team and shift Supervisors and HR and Plant Manager to explain NO Dirty your neighbor &quot; safety complaints, we have enough legit ones to complete!!! I also mentioned how if people got on the Safety Team just to get away from the lines all the time to pretend to be working Safety issues, I asked them to step down, or get serious. I asked the Plant Supervisors visors for support, not pressure to get back to work! We had a mandate form Corporate to Complete Arvinmeritor H&amp;S Level one, and then level two. I completed level 1 in two years, that meant our Plant meets or exceeds ALL OSHA&#39;S requirements!!!!! Level 2 required spending lots of money and getting World Class! Which I was definitely UP for, but Arvinmeritor sold us to Camryn. Around that time the Dodge Dart 2 was about to be launched!! They wanted my launch, inventor, Safety Coordinator and line lead brain back, all at once, they had me write the control work instruction procedures  first rafety built in, and of last but definitely not least Quality Assurance.  I still have my name on a5prints, for using clay to figure out how to design a nest to ease assembly . My biggest invention other than Safety, was completely dreaming up a goofy method to hand assemble and replace million dollar machines to automatically transfer LH&amp; RH Trailing Arms to the Rear Main lines using poor humans, They COULD NOT FIGURE Anything OUT That made 43 second cycle times, per side . I SAID use the 2 LH operators In alternate roles A and B LH and A and B RH...the person going to grab the next arm does his work then steps down to become B or inside of the line operator, then back outside after inside work...took 4 people but it made cycle ....they never built transfer machines, and with practice and new overhead crane design they got fast enough to check the parking brake cables!!", "comment_date": "2020-09-16T16:42:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mel F", "comment_text": "Dude bro when you talk to a camera, just talk like you would in real life.

At least I am not trying to be disrespectful. I am actually trying to help you out. <br><br>Not that you asked for help so if you do take offense then I am sorry. But I just wanted to mention that it looks like you could have some sort of hormone imbalance or medication related gynecomastia. <br><br>And obviously that is something that can be recognized as embarrassing if someone else is telling you. But I had the same problem because of medication that I was prescribed for years. And then I found out that I had / have low testosterone. <br><br>But when I got put on testosterone injections it actually made my symptoms worse. When I saw a new doctor I was switched to the testosterone gel pretty much all my problems were solved. <br><br>It took about 6 months for the gynecomastia to start reversing and since I wasn&#39;t working out the first 6 months I didn&#39;t have the results that I could have had. BUT, Now that I have been working out for a few months, got a psych medication change, switched to AndroGel instead of testosterone cypionate injections and started eating healthier - my symptoms of gynecomastia/fatty - or non muscular - chest and a sort of odd body type for a 27 year old male has gone away almost entirely. <br><br>So anyways, what I am getting at is, talking to your Dr about receiving some lab/ blood work done to see if you have low testosterone or some other hormonal imbalance and also checking the symptoms of any medications that you&#39;re possiblity prescribed for gynecomastia or hormone imbalance then seeing if you can switch to something different or getting off of the medications altogether is something I would recommend talking to your doctor about. <br><br>It could be life-changing. I know you probably won&#39;t care what some random person has to say on a comment on your YouTube channel but I promise that I&#39;m coming from a place of good-heartedness/well/intentions and that I just want to help.

So cool.<br><br>Suggestion for making better visibility of aerogel formation:  Instead of putting the gel lower in the chamber and filling that big area with a bunch of methanol to protect the gel, build a flat platform across the middle of the chamber and put a tiny petri dish filled with both the methanol and your gel onto the platform.  It might make your process work less well, hard to say... but you would be able to get good video of the entire process.  The only problem is draining the liquid methanol.  Either don&#39;t worry about it and rely on solubilizing it in the CO2 before draining, or maybe add some form of wick to the side to draw the methanol out?  Is there something that is soluble in CO2 but not methanol?  You could build a plug out of that to drain the methanol from the petri dish once it is immersed in CO2.<br><br>Anyway, the point would be to protect the gel in a methanol tank while still keeping it at eye level.<br><br>If it works, it would also facilitate making multiple gels at the same time. <br><br>Anyway, all the work that went into this is appreciated.  It was amazing to see the process from &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be cool if?&quot; all the way through too a hunk of pristine aerogel sitting on your bench.  <br><br> I love all the details you added about the process you went through.  When I used to work in a lab and I would try to recreate the methods from something I saw in a paper, they would always leave out a bunch of critical details.  &quot;Oh!  You have to solubilize in DMSO before dissolving in oil!&quot; (that one was particularly painful.... I wasted a bunch of very expensive hand-crafted retinoic acid derivative while inventing new curse words because of the drug that would not go into solution like the paper said it would.)", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T18:42:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juice", "comment_text": "Me: <b>uses it as hair gel</b>", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T18:36:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chris Smith", "comment_text": "Compression fittings don&#39;t need teflon tape or pipe dope....", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T17:45:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hashir Imran", "comment_text": "Thats not an aerogel thats an<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I dont even know<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Just kidding its a blured stone<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Im wasting ur time<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>STOP<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>STOOOOOOOP<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>you get nothing", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T17:38:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Save02", "comment_text": "this is called lays, and you can buy in a store for 2,99 lol", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T17:01:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Analdil", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0HfmYBlF8g&amp;t=17m24s\">17:24</a><br><br>Josef Mengele, Ausschwitz, 1942", "comment_date": "2020-08-23T16:23:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Probitas Imperium", "comment_text": "Can you do it with helium in the place of air?

The fractures caused by capillary action is hasten by a multitude bubbles. if you were to take a time lapsed video through a  microscope to the Aerogel You will see that the fractures lead from one bubble to the next, almost like connect the dots. Plus, the bubbles will increase in size when taken from a controlled high pressure atmosphere.( not unlike the bends or decompression).  To get bubble free ice for Ice carvers. Ice makers put a vibrating source in or on the ice tank while water is freezing( hence the bumping of the table. The bubbles are keeping the silica molecules from lining.up in a crystalline structure, making the Aerogel blocks a bit more opaque on the corners and edges than a manufactured one.

If the pellets are put in a beaker and allowed to sublimate, a yellow residue of oil remains in the bottom.  I would suggest putting an oil absorbing filter in the line from the CO2 tank.  Also, for the water bath, simple using a deeper tank would alleviate the need to use aluminum foil insulation.  Some of the in-bath heaters from scientific supply companies are programmable as well.

Then crimp the wire at each plate.   Then load the trays as you lower the stack into the pipe containing the liquid.   may need to add pipe to the get more volume for the CO2  The stack can be modified because you get more room above the pipe.  Can add the liquid from the drain valve for the liquid.  So one can be visible in the window.    The chamber for heating with the cooker will have to tall.  but the heater should work better.

When i was a kid in Alabama during one summer we went through a time when during the late after noon to evening shift we would hit a point were being outside everything turned orange without sunlight actually falling on something. It was diffused and looked as though we had colored glasses on. The events would only last a few minutes. We had a local genius student who was like the rest of us kids (and some adults) became fascinated by it and did a science fair project on it.  He built a chamber much like you have here and the look your phone got through the lens was very very similar if not the same (per my memory from 30 years ago lol) of the view he had at the example portion. Apparently the summer heat and weather we had had that summer caused the phenomenon to repeat itself multiple times but it came down to heat and light refraction in the CO2 at a certain temperature. I wish for the life of me i could remember the terms but i recall it was basically an in between state during a thermic reaction. The only reason I remember even that much of the experiment is I too found those afternoons magical and inspiring in my own way in and it made me want to study light. Eventually spuring me to study photography and lighting and becoming a lighting director for theater in and out of college.  Just wanted to help a bit if I could answer a question in your experiment since you took the extra effort to explain it all in truly amazing detail.

He said in what system can you reach that many people and get virtually nothing from it in return, so he decided to make a difference, and started the company that finally brought some returns/relief to some YT providers. <br><br>Google claims (used to trumpet) to &quot;not be evil&quot; but from what I&#39;ve seen, as they get larger and larger, they are tending more and more into that &quot;sphere&quot;.  Probably unavoidable with all the damned bean counters around, but a shame, none the less. <br><br>I have always found it strange that the very same people that complain about being beat on or destroyed (and some are) by the stress caused in companies by this constant expansion/increasing profit margin are most often the investors requiring the profits. In other words they are both the &quot;beaties&quot; and the &quot;beaters&quot;, with only a very very few reaping almost all of the benefits (not the aforementioned crowd, but any sane standard, percentage wise). <br><br>We live in a strange world with strange detrimental systems in place.  I think that call that &quot;shooting yourself in the foot&quot;.  Just plain stupid, and weird.  IF the populace EVER wakes up and figures out IT really does have pretty much ALL the power (not the govt., not corporations, not the ultra rich, some of whom are outright evil bastards) if it would just GET TOGETHER on something, anything really, things might actually change.  OR we can just go on playing it industrial strength stupid....YOUR call folks.

Another idea to improve on this is don&#39;t use the one tab to hang the platform, instead use two to hang on both sides of the cross section. For increasing the quantity in the chamber, keep the depth of the platform that you have for the bottom rack. Make a flat version that&#39;ll sit on top of that, another two in this configuration but inverted to fit in the top of the chamber, then it&#39;d be a matter of stacking platforms between the two.

Your project took a lot of work but the result is so damn satisfying. You have probably already noticed it but to check if you&#39;ve got any methanol left in the chamber you could see how the light is difracting on the edges of two different liquids. It also gave kinda cool effect, because the light was partially sliding on the edge, it looked a bit like those artistic visions depicturing accretion discs around black holes. Also considering heating of a pressure chamber, the water bath seems the best idea, but I&#39;d like to raise a question would it be different if you would just put the chamber to the water already heated to those 40 C? Could you also tell weather the gel was stiff or more like a &quot;jelly&quot; - elastic and spongy? Could that yellow tint be because some parts of chamber corroded or tape got dissolved in the mixture or CO2 and methanol? I think I saw something orange-y on the edges of that display windows, mainly on the thread. Kudos to you for making it, do you happen to know maybe about solutions to &quot;glue&quot; two parts of those little bars or how is such gel produced in a mass scale? I&#39;ve read it is used in home insulation but looking at the labor and time you must put it in, it seems that it&#39;s either &quot;different&quot; kind of gel - maybe not so pure or not exactly an areogel, or some other method is used to produce it, or the same method is used but on much bigger scale.

The footage from the camera taped to the chamber is oddly beautiful, and kinda looks like shots of an empty Blade Runner 2049 set, or the bridge of some sort of alien ship from a Stanley Kubrick film. <br>2. If you end up doing this again you could try making a dedicated heater for the chamber: I.e. Wrapping a flexible heater pad (either a flexible resistive heater film, or even just a small plug in heated blanket), and adding a cheap programmable PID controller to precisely control the temperature and timing.<br>2b. You also might be able to use a 3d printer heater cartridge and thermocouple inside the chamber for much more precise temperature control of the CO2. Granted you should probably ask an expert about modifying a pressure chamber before you do anything like that. <br>3. As an avid tinkerer I feel I must say that you should probably just leave the chamber in the vise the whole time instead of moving it back and forth. Though, I&#39;m probably more prone to dropping expensive things than you are. <br>4. What would happen if you added other components to your gel mixture? Like, ultra fine metal powder, or colourants? Maybe glow in the dark or uv reactive pigments? Could you make aerogel with different properties or colours? Or is the recipe too fragile? I only ask as my parents won&#39;t let me do science in the basement anymore so I can&#39;t try this myself. <br>5. Keep doing amazing stuff like this, Nile.

Fascinating video, loved the extent you went to detailing your methodology. The only issue I have with videos like this, is I then almost want to write a full peer review!<br><br><br>I have some questions/observations about various parts of the video, but I&#39;ll just limit to some observations about that discolouration with your final product:<br>You hypothesize two possible causes (recipe or time-delay), but I can&#39;t really agree with either here, based on what&#39;s visible in the video.<br><br><br>Now, I have to make a few assumptions here:<br>1. The discolouration was visible in the &quot;Hexagon&quot; batch, but not the &quot;Square&quot; batch. (Appears this way in the video, but may not be the case)<br>2. Both batches were made using the same recipe, at <b>roughly</b> the same time (using the same base ingredient bottles, with short enough gap between to rule out e.g. a contaminent entering the now unsealed bottles).<br>3. Both batches were stored together, as the video appears to suggest.<br>4. You mean the long delay was between making the gels, and doing the &quot;drying&quot; step, not between doing the &quot;drying&quot; step of the two batches.<br><br><br>Now:<br>* Recipe can be ruled out based on 1 and 2. If both used the same recipe, then they should both be effected by the discolouration.<br><br><br>* Time-Delay, (which to me would be looking at contamination over time, e.g. atmospheric mixing, or perhaps breakdown of materials, either of the gel, or maybe the container?) should be ruled out by 1 and 3, but does require 4 as well. (If not 4, then sure it&#39;s ruled back in as a possible cause.) Again, if they are stored together, then whatever &quot;age&quot; factors there are should be effecting them equally, causing equal discolouration in both batches.<br><br><br>Instead I put forward the following:<br>The discolouration seems to be a contaminant of some sort, either impregnated within the silica itself, or left behind at some point later in the process (but only visible in the final product). Possible phases where the contamination could have occured would then be: <br>1. Mixing of the batch.<br>2. Pouring into the (different) mould.<br><br>3. During the Drying Process.<br>I&#39;m ruling out post solidification of the gel (and pre-drying), as if the contaminant is within the liquid methanol, and not in some way bonded with the gel, it should then have mixed with both when they were put in the shared methanol bath, especially if they are stored for as long as you suggest.<br><br><br>For the remainder: (3 is my personal favourite)<br>1. Perhaps some other compound got mixed into what became the solid part of the gel in minute quantities? Possibly a residue in the beaker or pipette?<br>2. A different moulding tray was used here. I&#39;m assuming they were made of the same material, so ruling out the material itself, but these things can often have residue from the machining process on them when first purchased, perhaps didn&#39;t get completely cleaned off one?<br>3. If a contaminant were in the chamber, or were to enter the chamber during the drying process, perhaps it bonded to the structure then? An aerosol of some sort could have entered the chamber and lodged on the inner walls, or just been present in the air inside?<br>This last part (along with everything else, I guess) is pure speculation: I&#39;m not hugely experienced with Teflon tape, besides replacing a few pipe fittings at home, but I do know that the teflon tape tends to break apart somewhat when you screw and unscrew the fitting. I also know that teflon can break down, and into micrometer and nanometer sized particles. Finally, that teflon tape you were using (the &quot;much thicker orange one&quot;) was coloured. I&#39;m colourblind, but I&#39;d personally call that more of a &quot;cream&quot;? Perhaps tiny particles that get stuck within the structure could cause that discolouration? It&#39;s hard to be sure from a few seconds from footage, but the discolouration seems to be stronger near the edges than at the core, which I guess would support the late addition of contaminant, especially one that might struggle to penetrate the similarly sized pores?<br>Is the discolouration weaker on the face that sat on the solid base?<br><br><br><br>Longer observations than I intended, but hopefully they help, or spark discussion?", "comment_date": "2020-04-03T10:17:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "myojinlord", "comment_text": "Wow, this kinda like some legendary mmorpg quest.

Excellent work!<br><br>I am glad to see a safety valve on the setup, but I would like to see a better way of holding the chamber without a vice. A vice can exert a lot of force. Also, ventilation is good in a room full of C02. Perhaps, a hose could be added to vent the Co2 outside.<br><br>Drilling small holes in the bottom of your pizza paddle, may ensure even the C02 replacement. These should be deburred, or the bottom of the tray should be sanded so it won&#39;t damage the gels. I like your paddle idea, and perhaps the center could even be a fine stainless mesh. I thought I saw a spot when you lifted the gel, which might be alcohol.<br><br>Perhaps the cell could be wrapped with rope-like resistance heaters, like the silicone covered ones. An controller could be made using a Arduino, and some MOSFETS, like are used in most 3D printers. I would want to place an additional NTC thermistor, a multimeter temp probe, so you can see the temperature on a 2nd piece of equipment, for safety. The heater would need to stay away from the flanges.

PTFE tape isn&#39;t like a putty that just get&#39;s squeezed out of the way if there&#39;s too much. Putting on more can be detrimental to the strength of the joint. Importantly you should leave the first few threads uncovered so that you have more threads engaged before the PTFE tape starts binding up the threads. With the way you did it now you have very little thread engaged and thus lose a lot of strength in the joint. Then have one or two layers on the next few threads get a seal deeper in the engaged thread. Build up to 3 or 4 layers (at most) near the head of the plug/nut/joint/thingamajig. Always wrap with the direction of tightening, so that the tape gets pulled tighter when you tighten the joint (though you probably already know that).

If you were then able to somehow cover it with a thin, hardening polymer coating (while still under a vacuum) you&#39;d be left with a solid object whose density might be just a bit lower than air - essentially a &quot;solid balloon&quot; whose volume is prevented from collapsing due to air pressure by the Silica frame. Of course this would be easier to make the larger you make it since the surface/volume ratio quickly rises in your favor when increasing the size. And my gut feeling tells me the compressive strength probably also rises with size, although I&#39;m not sure, to be honest.<br>Either way, if you were to find a way to apply a coating under a vacuum you might be able to create a floating or at least neutrally buoyant solid object.<br>I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts on this and why it probably wouldn&#39;t work!<br><br>Either way, keep up the great work, I love your videos!<br>Best regards<br><br>EDIT: Perhaps no need to spray something on; putting it into a condom or part of a latex glove and simply sealing it once under a vacuum might do the trick.", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T09:54:31Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "8localidol8", "comment_text": "This video was awesome!

Or you could host a small webserver that you can locally connect to that displays it all in a graph for you and all you would need is a webbrowser to access this).", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:40:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sophie Ferridge", "comment_text": "i want to eat it. it would crunch so good. oh man", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:40:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the toe", "comment_text": "Those Earbuds Are Rip-off and scam me", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:40:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EatingInternet", "comment_text": "Dayum.", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:39:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Graf Kidkat", "comment_text": "&quot;My scientific conclusion is that this method fucking blows&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:39:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Chavez", "comment_text": "Notice how he never mentioned the corona virus...", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:39:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galakon", "comment_text": "My youth leader makes this", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:38:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Banaan", "comment_text": "thanks i need this for my prawn suit", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:38:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MD", "comment_text": "Random question.. can we make windows with aerogel?", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:38:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gustavo Coelho", "comment_text": "It&#39;s weird to see how brittle these aerogel samples are.

It&#39;s the same effect as in the sky - during the day, the sky is blue, but as the sun sets it turns orange. Has to do with scattering. Higher frequencies, ie, blue are scattered more frequently, which gives it the blue haze. Under more other, direct lighting conditions however, the blue light gets scattered away, making the lack of blue light, orange, visible. You might be able to see this by pointing a flashlight at the aerogel.

Rayleigh scattering means that long wavelengths of light (aka red light) go through the material unaffected, but short wavelengths (blue light) are bounced away in a random direction. This happens when there are tiny, microscopic imperfections in how the material bends light. If those variations/imperfections are the right size, you get Rayleigh scattering.<br><br>Basically what this means is that when you&#39;re looking at the material and light is coming in from the side, the only light you see is the light that&#39;s been scattered (bounced away) toward your eye, which as we said before is blue. The red light just goes straight through and doesn&#39;t get directed toward your eye, so you don&#39;t see it. So when light is coming in from the side, the material looks blue.<br><br>But the opposite happens if the light is coming <b>through</b> the material from behind, toward your eye\u2014 the blue light doesn&#39;t make it to your eye, it gets bounced away in some random direction! So when the material is backlit it looks red, because as we said before, only red light makes it through unaffected.<br><br>You had a light <b>behind</b> your setup, so the light was <b>traveling</b> through the CO2 into your camera. So the Rayleigh scattering in the CO2 was bouncing away the blue light and only letting red light through to the camera, and making the whole chamber look red.<br><br>Now here&#39;s the interesting bit: This exact same process is what makes the sky blue and sunsets red! When you look at the sky during the day, it looks blue, because the sunlight is hitting the air from the side (there&#39;s nothing behind it, only the blackness of space). But when the sun is setting, the sunlight skims the surface of the Earth and goes through a ton of atmosphere before it hits your eye (as opposed to taking a shorter path straight down through it, like during the day), and the Rayleigh scattering bounces all the blue light away and leaves only the red. So sunsets are red. <br><br>Rayleigh scattering is also what gives smoke its color\u2014 when you&#39;re looking at smoke from the side, it looks blueish. But when it&#39;s blotting out the sun, it looks extremely red. Same thing as the sky/sunsets, just way stronger! You&#39;ll also notice that the shadow of a smoke cloud looks red, even if the smoke itself looks blue.<br><br>This might also be why your hexagon sample looked orange. Rayleigh scattering is <b>also</b> what gives the aerogel itself its hazy blueness (and why it looks &quot;smoky&quot;); and just like the smoke, it will cast an orange/red shadow or be orange/red if you look through it. So if the Rayleigh scattering is particularly strong (perhaps due to the particular size of the air voids in the silica matrix), then the sample might look more reddish in some circumstances, partly because it tints the background red when you look through it, and partly because it&#39;s casting a red shadow on itself.<br><br>Pretty neat!", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T05:17:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "anthrosaurian", "comment_text": "As &quot;soul destroying&quot; as this project has been for you, congratulations on a successful, albeit discolored, final product!<br><br>Many have attempted and failed in countless ways.

My understanding of this extraction process was that the impressive properties of CO2 as a solvent appear when it goes supercritical, not just in its liquid phase. Like in the extraction of caffeine from coffee. The supercritical state allows for the CO2 to pass freely through the solid coffee bean taking the caffeine with it.

When light is shining through the other side, blue light is scattered away from the camera and warmer colors pass through more easily.

I couldn&#39;t find an absorbtion spectrum of liquid or supercritical CO2 though, so I&#39;m very much unsure this is the cause.
