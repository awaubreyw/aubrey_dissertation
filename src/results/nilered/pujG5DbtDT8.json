I wonder if the NH has on the digestive system?  I looked up Dulcin, and wikipedia said this:  &quot;Early medical tests marked the substance as safe for human consumption, and it was considered ideal for diabetics. However, an FDA study in 1951 raised many questions about its safety resulting in its removal from the market in 1954 after animal testing revealed unspecified carcinogenic properties. In Japan, poisoning accidents by dulcin occurred frequently, and use of dulcin was forbidden in 1969.[4]<br><br>Dulcin is also known by the names sucrol and valzin.&quot;  I&#39;m surprised that it can poison people.  If the urea breaks off, how can urea poison you?  What are you left with?  I looked it up and the products of digestion could be toluene and urea.  Once again, I looked up the effects of toluene on the body, and this is what wikipedia said, Yeah, I know, too much wikipedia, please don&#39;t complain, lol:   &quot;Effects of long-term exposure<br><br>Serious adverse behavioural effects are often associated with chronic occupational exposure [22] and toluene abuse related to the deliberate inhalation of solvents.[23] Long-term toluene exposure is often associated with effects such as: psychoorganic syndrome;[24] visual evoked potential (VEP) abnormality;[24] toxic polyneuropathy, cerebellar, cognitive, and pyramidal dysfunctions;[23][24] optic atrophy; and brain lesions.[23]<br><br>The neurotoxic effects of long-term use (in particular repeated withdrawals) of toluene may cause postural tremors by upregulating GABA receptors within the cerebellar cortex.[23] Treatment with GABA agonists such as benzodiazepines provide some relief from toluene-induced tremor and ataxia.[23] An alternative to drug treatment is vim thalamotomy.[23] The tremors associated with toluene misuse do not seem to be a transient symptom, but an irreversible and progressive symptom which continues after solvent abuse has been discontinued.[23]<br><br>There is some evidence that low-level toluene exposure may cause disruption in the differentiation of astrocyte precursor cells.[25] This does not appear to be a major hazard to adults; however, exposure of pregnant women to toluene during critical stages of fetal development could cause serious disruption to neuronal development.[25]&quot;<br><br>So as you can see, by eating Dulcin, you increase urea and toluene in your body, which clogs your excretory system and prolongs the effects of the acids created.  Don&#39;t think that I&#39;m a chemist or know what I am talking about.  Just issuing these things as a precaution.

Keep in mind that I am doing this at my own risk, and that is generally never a good idea to taste semen. Further more I&#39;ll be using a beaker, pipette, stirring rod, filter, ph paper. The first step is to cover the semen with the distilled water. Stir constantly to separate the solids from the liquids, taking care not to splash. Carefully siphon off most of the liquid using the pipette, and then repeat the first step until the water comes out clear. We can continue purification at this point, but the yield will turn out lower with every turn. Cover once again with distilled water, and add 10 ml acetic acid (If you can&#39;t get your hands on acetic acid, you can use clear vinegar instead off distilled water once the washing is done). The acid will cause the protein to denature, changing it&#39;s chemical structure and effectively &#39;cooking&#39; it. (formula provided on screen, something like H2N__0__NH2) Denaturation was long thought of as an irreversible process, but recently some development has occurred concerning protein renaturation. After 20 minutes, all of the protein will be denatured, and it is time to wash out the acetic acid. Just repeat the first steps until the solution has a PH of around 5.5. Add enough shellfish aroma until the solution reeks of crab (if it did not do so already). Next, use the filter to drain out the remaining liquid. A little pressure can be added to help remove the liquid, which also serves to compact the prote\u00efnes somewhat. Additionally, you could add some red food colouring, but since I do not have any I&#39;ll have to do without. After removing it from the filter the yield turned out to be 15.3 grams, which is approximately as I calculated. The taste tels left me impressed. It was almost indistinguishable from actual imitation-crab. The amount of work involved may make it seem like a fruitless undertaking, but since I have an unlimited supply of semen this might even be a viable business. Honestly, it tastes pretty good, yeah, so... that&#39;s about it.&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-12-17T14:58:45Z", "likes_count": 2069}, {"comment_by": "\u00ab X e t C h r o n o \u00bb", "comment_text": "its actually beneficial to drink your urine. look into urine therapy", "comment_date": "2017-12-17T14:58:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silvo M\u00fcller", "comment_text": "How can you exclude the presence of residual cyanic acid?", "comment_date": "2017-12-17T13:56:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paddy Cunningham", "comment_text": "Another excellent video, keep them coming, very educational and i wish I had even a quarter of your skills", "comment_date": "2017-12-17T12:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jim Cervantes", "comment_text": "Your willingness to consume your end products is simply astounding.
