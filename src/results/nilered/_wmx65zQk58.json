Typically, the Grignard reagent would be added to a large excess of CO2 (pouring rxn mixture onto dry ice) to increase the probability that the Grignard only reacts with CO2. Bubbling the CO2 through the Grignard reagent increase the probability that a second molecule of Grignard will react with the carbonyl on the intermediate forming the geminal diol, heptane-4,4-diol, upon acidic work up, which I think would be quite soluble in the aqueous phase.<br><br>Good video though!
