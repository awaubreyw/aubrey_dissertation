Our ethanol was denatured with toluene which was inert in our process and was stripped off later in the process.  <br><br>Just a note, a lot of ethanol is denatured by a mix of methanol and isopropyl alcohol about 0.5% each.

If we put our faith in Jesus Christ and follow God and do his will, repent, be Baptized, and join the true Church of believers following the Bible, we can be saved.

The composition of an azeotrope is pressure dependent.Hence, if one chooses a different pressure than 1 atmosphere, the resultant distillate contains more (or less) water than the standard pressure azeotrope. Then a second distillation at a different pressure can make separation complete. The advantage is that there is ZERO contamination by residue of drying agent or benzene. See this link:<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotropic_distillation#Pressure-swing_distillation\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotropic_distillation#Pressure-swing_distillation</a><br>[begin quote]Pressure-swing distillation<br>Another method, pressure-swing distillation, relies on the fact that an azeotrope is pressure dependent. An azeotrope is not a range of concentrations that cannot be distilled, but the point at which the activity coefficients of the distillates are crossing one another. If the azeotrope can be &quot;jumped over&quot;, distillation can continue, although because the activity coefficients have crossed, the water will boil out of the remaining ethanol, rather than the ethanol out of the water as at lower concentrations. <br>To &quot;jump&quot; the azeotrope, the azeotrope can be moved by altering the pressure. Typically, pressure will be set such that the azeotrope will differ from the azeotrope at ambient pressure by some percent in either direction. For an ethanol-water mixture, that may be at 93.9% for 20bar overpressure, instead of 95.3% at ambient pressure. The distillation then works in the opposite direction, with the ethanol emerging in the bottoms and the water in the distillate. While in the low pressure column, ethanol is enriched on the way to the top end of the column, the high pressure column enriches ethanol on the bottom end, as ethanol is now the highboiler. The top product (water as distillate) is then again fed to the low pressure column, where the normal distillation is done. The bottom product of the low pressure column primarily consists of water, while the bottom stream of the high pressure column is nearly pure ethanol at concentrations of 99% or higher. Pressure swing distillation essentially inverts the K-values and subsequently inverts which end of the column each component comes out when compared to standard low pressure distillation.

First of all, great clear and quick explanation of azeotropic distillation even though you opted not to use that method.  I rarely, if ever, see it explained so clearly in my engineering books.<br><br>A couple things worth noting:<br><br>1) Mole sieves are the pretty much the best nonreactive way to get contaminants to the lowest possible percentages if they&#39;re applicable to the situation.  3A is perfect for removing water as it doesn&#39;t fit almost any other molecules except H2O into the pores.  However, mole sieves have much lower capacities in exchange for their high adsorptivity.  5% water is probably too much for a mole sieve I thought up front, but I was pleasantly surprised that you were able to adsorb all that water in just two treatments.  At higher volumes, though, mole sieves would become uneconomical.   Great for keeping your ethanol dry, though, in storage as you&#39;re doing.<br><br>In engineering practice at larger volumes, using only adsorption, it&#39;s most cost effective to use alumina first as a cheaper bulk adsorbent for water, then polish the last remaining bits of water out with mole sieves.  Both can be regenerated with heat.  Silica gel is another possible adsorbent that can be regenerated, but you&#39;d have to check your gel&#39;s affinity for water over ethanol just to be sure it&#39;ll work.  Adsorption is a very versatile separation method as long you do your adsorbent homework.<br><br>2) There are a lot of other ways of &quot;breaking&quot; azeotropes listed in the Wikipedia &quot;Azeotrope&quot; article.  Changing the distillation pressure will usually change the azeotropic temperature and composition allowing you to get past the atmospheric azeotrope.  Apparently, that pressure swing effect won&#39;t work for ethanol-water, but it&#39;s viable for other mixtures.  Using selective membranes will also work.  There are many other methods.  Obviously, not all will work for all types of mixtures or be viable at lab scale.

Our copper solar collectors were clogged with silica and carbonate scale.  The only chemical that could dissolve the silica without hurting the equipment was a mixed acid blend with added Ammonium Biflouride.  A straight strong acid bath would not touch the silica but the Ammonium Biflouride dissolved it readily.  It also etched any glass that touched the solution.  Amazing to see a salt with such activity I would expect of HF.  The left over Ammonium Biflouride is pisonous as well as the Silicon Tetraflouride (?) so I learned from the EA that you can &quot;stabilize&quot; it by neutralizing the acid with Sodium Carbonate and Calcium Hydroxide, converting the poisonous Flourides to Calcium Flouride which is quite safe with a 0,0,0 rating.
