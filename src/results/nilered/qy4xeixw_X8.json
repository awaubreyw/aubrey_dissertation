Waiting for the reaction to start can be maddening, but unless your ether is saturated with water or your magnesium is crusted over, it will start.  Once started, the rate of reaction will ramp up exponentially, which will be problematic if you&#39;ve already dumped all of your halide into the reaction flask.  In that case, ether vapor and magnesium flakes will erupt from the condenser like a volcano.  In an indoor environment diethyl ether fumes can easily find an ignition source make for a bad day. \u00a0<br>     Once the reaction starts, it will become vigorous until all that halide you impatiently dumped in is consumed.  Only after the reflux rate has settled down should you resume adding halide.  A good rule of thumb is to add it at approximately the same rate as the ether dripping from the reflux condenser while maintaining the condensate line at about halfway up the condenser.  Slow and steady wins the race.  One method we used in the lab was to pre-treat the magnesium turnings by shaking them in an amalgamating solution containing very dilute nitric acid in which a tiny bead of mercury had previously been dissolved.  This was followed by rinsing in deionized water, dewatering in acetone or methanol and warm air drying.", "comment_date": "2022-02-18T17:00:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamie Klinder", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy4xeixw_X8&amp;t=8m56s\">8:56</a> because it STANK", "comment_date": "2022-01-31T18:13:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EconomicApple", "comment_text": "So that\u2019s what rasputin got near to", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T14:01:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LordO\u2019Pemcil", "comment_text": "I hope he makes some thioacetone eventually", "comment_date": "2022-01-21T04:26:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\ud83d\udda4\u767d\u3044yuka\ud83d\udda4", "comment_text": "Seems like there were some inappropriate stuff said in the comments a long time ago.
