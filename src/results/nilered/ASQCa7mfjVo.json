In another gold extraction later video it says that you can just use aqua regia to dissolve 90% of the gold and later extract the remaining gold on the boards by precipitating the remaining silver with sodium thiosulfate, filtering, and using aqua regia again on the remaining pieces to extract the last bits of gold, sparing you a lot of copper waste and time. Is this correct?

Seriously, the older the scrap the more gold they use in a lot of cases. Motherboards from old servers cracked down into small pieces can yield a lot. I&#39;m talking antique servers though, like late 80s, early 90s. I&#39;m no expert in gold recovery but I know that much from being a bit of a computer/electronics expert. Only RAM seems to use steadily more gold as time goes on. The stuff you can get for the least money with the highest gold will probably be vintage servers, because far fewer people are interested in owning an antique server with no practical use than, say, an old pre-2000s personal computer. The things to avoid are the kinds of scrap with inflated value, or that could still be used for something practical. A lot of post 2000s computer parts end up in less wealthy countries as part of an actual computer, and my town even has a recycling program for computers. They have a reusable area but computers all get taken and shipped off to India, or Thailand or something. If people there are willing to buy junk computers in bulk, there&#39;s a big resale business on eBay for stuff that actually works. So in a way, it&#39;s more economics than tech. The older the stuff is, the less technology was in use at the time. The stuff that was being used by large businesses was sturdier and often overbuilt, but consumer stuff was often pretty bad by comparison. As time has gone on, things have reversed. Instead of keeping old technology businesses constantly upgrade their web severs, so they&#39;re build differently because the world also had a finite amount of gold. Higher demand means people need to be more careful when using it in a design. But back in the 90&#39;s and early 2000s, gold wasn&#39;t as expensive. If you look at a timeline of gold prices, offset it by about 6 months and you&#39;ll have a perfect timetable of how much gold is used in electronics. Buy stuff that was being rolled out at the lowest points on your new graph, and you&#39;ll get a better return. RAM is the exception, hence the global DRAM shortage as some have called it. That&#39;s not the only reason but it&#39;s part of it. I&#39;m not putting any of my money into this but this was interesting and it was worth taking a few moments of my time to look into this a bit.", "comment_date": "2018-09-02T23:25:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unnamed Player", "comment_text": "battery acid+nitrate salt also works", "comment_date": "2018-08-30T14:23:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Salomon", "comment_text": "Nile: Gold can be extracted from PCBs!<br>Me: Sweet, I&#39;m gonna be rich!<br>Nile: All you need is a bunch of Cyanide...<br>Me: That garbage man application seems to be promising", "comment_date": "2018-08-30T03:57:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tanner Luedke", "comment_text": "Do any of you wish that you could take all the gold from broken computers in a 10 mile radius with 100% perfection?", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T16:53:09Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "syd Hastings", "comment_text": "wouldn&#39;t mercury be easier?", "comment_date": "2018-08-24T21:24:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nick limbach", "comment_text": "Cut the board shorter so you don&#39;t need as much solution to sink it and make the reaction faster", "comment_date": "2018-08-19T22:08:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mitch M", "comment_text": "can it cure ligma", "comment_date": "2018-08-19T00:44:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raina Lane", "comment_text": "Interestingly, you call get all the parts required in this video from a University lab and dorm (I have an idea:) )", "comment_date": "2018-08-18T07:04:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "5 Dollar Foot Weiner Dog", "comment_text": "Is that a bug?omg <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASQCa7mfjVo&amp;t=6m50s\">6:50</a>", "comment_date": "2018-08-11T10:51:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mewt", "comment_text": "Paying?

I know the chemistry is rather simple, and i take you might show the cyanide method, but it would be very appreciated. (i\u00b4d do it myself if i wasn\u00b4t the poorest talker on earth and pretty bad at organizing stuff) but as you are at that topic i thought, i could ask for it.

To get it started a bit quicker just add a few drops of peroxide and perhaps a bit of copper, like old electricity wires. You can easily reuse the copper chloride between batches to cut down costs even further. Add a bit of ammonium chloride to further increase the speed. It&#39;ll increase in strength every time you use it. Bubble air in between uses to regenerate the solution.<br><br>It&#39;s how I personally etch PCBs, but would work great here too. I use a cheap $5 aquarium pump from eBay with a piece of PE tubing. I sealed the end by melting it together and pierced hundreds of tiny holes with a hot needle in the section that goes underwater. Regeneration of a fully spent 5 liter batch of copper chloride takes about a week in my case. If the solution becomes fully saturated you can just add more hydrogen chloride, and later on even recover the copper for profit.", "comment_date": "2016-07-14T11:23:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt S", "comment_text": ":)", "comment_date": "2016-07-14T06:21:20Z", "likes_count": 0}]
