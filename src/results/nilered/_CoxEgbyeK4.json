You can also cook the coffee for a longer time, those 15 minutes are not enough. Also try to invest into a Rotavapor, just cooking DCM is not a good idea at all (I hope you got some air-filtering unit above it or a digestor). We use Sodiumsulfate instead of a molecular sieve as drying agent for the DCM. We didn&#39;t recrystalise, because we made titrations with it.

When you think about it that way it\u2019s very very cheap. I think I paid 100 bucks altogether for the kilo.
