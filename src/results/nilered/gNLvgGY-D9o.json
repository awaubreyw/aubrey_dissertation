When the alkali metal dissolves into NH3, the solvated electrons &quot;are looking for something to reduce&quot; (which drives your birch reaction).  Why don&#39;t the solvated electrons attack the Teflon stir-bar, and rip out the fluorine, as the bare metal does?  I assume if there were traces of water, the electrons would reduce the water to H2, as metal does directly?<br>     2nd question: How do you operate stir-bar when there is a large distance between the stir-base and the reaction flask (such as your dry-ice bath or heating mantle)?
