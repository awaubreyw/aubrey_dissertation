This was a cool trick to compensate for side lobe absorptions of the cyan layer (or yellow layer don&#39;t remember ) when the negative gets enlarged or printed to positive paper or film. Back in these days I was a hobby fotographer and did alot of experimentation in the darkroom but also catched interest in the associated chemistry. But unlike you I am not a chemist.
