Use a fry-maker, one with a handle.  No worries for cuts of any kind and will go through tons of potatoes in a matter of minutes.  My fry cutter has a knife for really small fries; smaller than McD&#39;s fries.  What do you want to cook with shredded, starchless potatoes(lol)?  It is not true that you lose by not goifing your taters and I tested that, many times.  The loss is less than 5% from my smallest to largest cut but your method uses almost 50% more time.  Let&#39;s get real logical here.  You don&#39;t need to get that small, water is really good at clearing the porous potatoes of all their starch banks.  Let the potatoes sit in water overnight in your fridge.

Potato starch is used in applications where paste clarity is crucial because it&#39;s lower amylose and the amylose is lower chain length than dent corn starch.  To get clear dent corn starch pastes you either need waxy corn starch which is almost pure amylopectin or modified corn starch.  Modification with ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, acetic anhydride or acid will stop amylose retrogradation.
