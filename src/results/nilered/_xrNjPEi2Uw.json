One time he was at our house, and cut a piece of daiper, then put it in a glass of water. After it finished absorbing, he drank the gel, and I believe the two pieces of daiper that were around the powder as well. He showed how safe it was, but I do not recommend anyone eating or drinking it. Even if the powder becomes fully saturated, I still don&#39;t recommend it, because I am still not sure how exactly the body reacts to it. My grandfather, before modern sodium Polyacrylate was widespread in daipers, he made some sodium polyacrylate with radiation, which he said two hands combined and full of the stuff could absorb several thousand gallons of water. He was upset people didn&#39;t buy it because they thought radiation was dangerous. He didn&#39;t think it was dangerous.", "comment_date": "2021-06-12T12:51:15Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Monster Bikers", "comment_text": "Can I eat this snow ??", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T19:50:02Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "El GordoClips", "comment_text": "Actually polysnow is very different to Sodium Poly where the SP actually turns to a gel where snow would turn to a well snow consistency", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T05:07:37Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Tanuja Kumari", "comment_text": "What about pads", "comment_date": "2021-03-11T10:28:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Md.Monzur Ahmed Quaderi khosru", "comment_text": "Can this snow eat ??", "comment_date": "2020-12-17T20:00:05Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Cindy A", "comment_text": "which one works best?  <br>distilled water <br>demineralized water <br>or deionized water?<br><br>Please can someone tell me.
