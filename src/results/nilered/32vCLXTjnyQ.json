So glad I found this video on your channel! Been at it for a week now trying to make Calcium Acetate for gardening purposes and through some basic and preliminary experiments and research found that I needed around 600ml of vinegar at 5% acidity to completely react with 1 tbsp of ground eggshells. Mixed and stirred frequently in several current trial runs of solution and always end up with a reduction of reaction and the solution seeming to stagnate. The mix still smells of vinegar and has ground eggshells at the bottom so I am left to assume that the reaction is not yet done. Unless calcium acetate has a pungent aroma similar to acetic acid. I need to know by which process can I accelerate or allow to resume the reaction such that all of the calcium carbonate is completely dissolved and mixed in the water as calcium acetate.
