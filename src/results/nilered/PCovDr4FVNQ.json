It would be nice to know the quality of the sulfate precipitate. I am waiting for the product to dry out before weighing it. A few notes:<br><br>1) I think the reason NileRed got a good yield is actually due to the spill! During the heating phase I imagine some NH2:H2N got dissolved in the condensate on the plastic and walls of the beaker. The overflow looked like 50ml from watching the video. Could more NH2:H2N have been dissolved in the condensate than the in spilled stuff?<br><br>2) NH2:H2N.HSO4 has a solubility of ~20g/100ml. The experiment ends up with ~600ml tailings. Could there be more product available in the solution tailings?<br><br>3) I assume that the tailings are contaminated with NH2:H2N. That and the filter paper. How do I dispose of them properly? <br><br>4) I hope I didn&#39;t mess things up, but it seemed that I didn&#39;t have enough H2SO4, because the solution foamed a tiny bit, and there seemed to be incomplete precipitate. I added more acid. Bad? NaHSO4 is a little more soluble than Na2SO4...<br><br>5) Putting the acid in the freezer was brilliant. It helped me drizzle down the side of the beaker instead of using an eyedropper.<br><br>6) I started with 8.25% NaClO, and assuming a 5% loss of strength which meant I diluted 300ml of bleach with 200ml of water. It seriously looked like I was thus working with too dilute bleach. But it went okay. <br><br>7) Hand held vacuum pumps do not work really well, because I still ended up with a paste.<br><br>8) Why go with a bisulfate of hydrazine? Why not di-hydrazine sulfate?<br><br>9) There were no odors from the beaker until I started adding the acid and it started effervescing. Then, I had to open the garage wide.<br><br>10) What about using a fractional distillation column on a 1L flask to capture the aerialized NH2:H2N?<br><br>11) Some automatic stirring hot plates do not work very well between a stainless steal bowl. Some hot plates which claim to go up to 100 C don&#39;t (<a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/131699117190\">http://www.ebay.com/itm/131699117190</a>). I had to carefully warm the side of the beaker with a torch.<br><br>12) The experiment took more time than anticipated (probably the faulty hot plate).<br><br>13) If I were to do this again with the &quot;concentrated&quot; bleach would it work or would I get more sulfate contamination?<br><br>14) I checked my vacuum flask this morning and found a thin silt deposit. Could it be more product? There is honestly too little to consider further extraction.<br><br>15) I noticed a different approach with ammonium sulfate instead of urea. The sulfate ion is already present. I believe that the solution would still have to be very alkaline at first and then acidified. Any thoughts? <br><br>...
