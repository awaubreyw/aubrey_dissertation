This is why denim look darker on one side than other. And as you know denim is twill woven so it&#39;s quite dense. All jeans start out dark blue and various treatments are given to it to change its shade. For example the sky blue jeans are stone washed, meaning it was placed in an industrial washing machine with stones to wear away the surface of the jean, making it lighter but also more &quot;worn in&quot;. The really pale color jeans you see are stone washed and then bleached, giving you the light blue color (I did this before). If you are doing this with Chlorox make sure you soak it with sodium bisulfite after this or else the jean will slowly deteriorate. The mottled jeans you see in the 80s were done with stones and bleach (called acid wash).", "comment_date": "2020-04-11T13:06:24Z", "likes_count": 287}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Bodkin", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know why but imagining you walking into an H&amp;M and buying a single pair of white jeans and nothing else is making me laugh my ass off", "comment_date": "2020-04-06T08:50:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Pixel Simms", "comment_text": "Anyone else watch these to help them sleep?", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T09:39:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gert Vincentzen", "comment_text": "Im unable to view the video linked in the description Final dye vat recipe <a href=\"https://youtu.be/-ljvHUKsE_w\">https://youtu.be/-ljvHUKsE_w</a>   Can somebody help me out? its for a project", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T13:29:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "marcustheboxman", "comment_text": "I expected it to look like shit but then i was quickly amazed", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T11:56:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ValenteConsello", "comment_text": "All this time I thought denim was just blue naturally...", "comment_date": "2020-03-10T08:25:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaby Velasco", "comment_text": "Can you try making Maya Blue pigment?

First, the indigo was taken to a Vat or fermenting vessel. The Vat beater had to remain in waist deep water for 8 hours. There were three vats:<br><br>1st vat: Leaves stripped off the indigo plant were first soaked in warm water in a vat for several hours. Liquid began to boil &amp; rotten leaves were taken out. Liquid was drained into another vat that was placed just below the first vat.<br><br>2nd Vat or beater vat: Solution was continuously stirred and beaten with paddles, it turned green and then blue. Lime water was added &amp; indigo was separated out in flakes, a muddy sediment settled at the bottom &amp; clear liquid rose to the surface<br><br>3rd Vat or Settling vat: Liquid was drained off and the sediment, indigo pulp transferred to another vat &amp; then pressed and dried for sale.<br><br>Source: <a href=\"https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.examrace.com/Study-Material/History/NCERT-Lectures/NCERT-Class-8-History-Chapter-3-YouTube-Lecture-Handouts.amp.html\">https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.examrace.com/Study-Material/History/NCERT-Lectures/NCERT-Class-8-History-Chapter-3-YouTube-Lecture-Handouts.amp.html</a>", "comment_date": "2018-11-07T02:41:10Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "malxum X", "comment_text": "shake your screen at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yhR242MnwA&amp;t=0m15s\">0:15</a>", "comment_date": "2018-11-06T16:24:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "worddunlap", "comment_text": "&quot;my good pair of white jeans&quot;...Something American men never say for $500 Alex.", "comment_date": "2018-10-22T03:07:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "grassy climer", "comment_text": "you have to add vinegar to make them stay dark blue", "comment_date": "2018-09-27T07:47:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "amonducius", "comment_text": "I have one of those Canadian Tire buckets, only I use mine to make my own dye...And by dye I mean wine.", "comment_date": "2018-09-25T23:04:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mister Turk Turkle", "comment_text": "Sponsored content is spam", "comment_date": "2018-09-25T21:48:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wouter Vogelzang", "comment_text": "great channel nile.", "comment_date": "2018-09-21T18:44:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Five", "comment_text": "(Sorry, late to the party)<br><br>Coming so this as a textiles graduate, not a chemist, you mention how after rinsing the dye out, it looked a bit uneven in areas. did you pre-wash the jeans in synthropol or another strong detergent before dying?
