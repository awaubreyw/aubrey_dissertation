So why does basic copper carbonate made by thus method is light-blue? I&#39;m a little bit confused, because we have green Cu2(OH)2CO3 in the lab in uni and there is another mineral - azurite (Cu3(OH)2CO3) and it&#39;s blue. Is it because of impurities or another type of crystal structure?", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T21:04:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erika Sandstrom", "comment_text": "Why does the reaction make basic copper carbonate instead of &quot;regular&quot; copper carbonate (CuCO3)?", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T20:59:02Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Scritch", "comment_text": "Doug&#39;s been kinda inactive lately, though. =(", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T20:53:25Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Ich Selber", "comment_text": "try to use a microwave for getting stuff into solution<br><br>works awesome for me", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T20:48:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mattibboss", "comment_text": "any ways to purify the product? <br>i know that it&#39;s pure but mine start chemicals may be unpure...<br>does CU CO2 dissolve in anything?<br>or can it be reacted with an acid like acetic acid and than coverted back to CO2 by Na CO2?<br>will this increase purity?<br>should i wash it with alcohol and water and hope to make it more pure?<br>any easy ideas?<br><br>(i want to make just a sample and put it in a vial....i hate inpure chemicals...)", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T20:36:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Evelynn Eleonore", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf80a2zZ9w&amp;t=3m38s\">3:38</a> looks like a more than decent swimming pool (cocktail) to me", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T20:28:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The President", "comment_text": "next dry distillation of Calcium acetate please", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T20:22:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "sobbe07", "comment_text": "Nile, <br>Do you have any social media we can follow you on?", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T20:22:01Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Guodlca", "comment_text": "Woah man, two reactions in a row with over 100% yield.
