I had A-1 Bail Bond tin ingot already so I put it on the mill and I shaved a small quantity down for testing. I put it in the drawers of my Mill Vice sticking out sideways with a box underneath it so I wouldn&#39;t lose any. Anyway I a used a 50-50 solution MTI water and 20 Baum hydrochloric acid that I actually made a couple of years ago. I heated then stirred it for actually a couple of days and all of a sudden all the tin particles turn into white powder. I got pissed off and I turn the heat up all the way and boiled the hell out of it to see if I could get it to go into solution. The amount of white powder dissipated by about 3/4 but when it cooled needle-like crystals formed. I repeated this Experiment three or four times over a week it didn&#39;t happen the same way every time. So it isn&#39;t entirely that difficult to come up with a crystalline form of tin chloride unless I was just very lucky<br><br>I&#39;ve tried electrolysis to make tin sulfate and stannous chloride and all I get is black sludge on the anode.
