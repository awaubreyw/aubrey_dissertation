Idea being that the removal of water would further push the reaction to the right through the removal of water as it occurs? That way, you have an excess of methanol AND the removal of a product, and perhaps it&#39;d cut down on the amount of unreacted salycilic acid leftover after the reflux. A lot of the methanol would probably vaporize and end up in the trap as well but perhaps the density difference coupled with the heat would reduce its miscibility in the water product and allow it to return to the reaction flask?<br><br>I&#39;m spitballing here, but I found myself wondering about this while I was watching and figured I&#39;d get your thoughts since I&#39;m interested in trying this myself as well.

I suffered a stroke 2 years ago, and it lead me to be on long term disability. Basically means I am medically retired. I worked 37 years in IT, going back to mainframes in the 70&#39;s. I am also in the USA martial arts Hall of Fame. Then one day I have a stroke, and BAM...not working and struggling to regain my mental and physical capabilities. So I found myself looking for a purpose, still into marital arts, doing more teaching these days. But I have decided to go back to things that interested me in my youth, the sciences. I am bought chemistry sets, lab glassware, chemicals, and of course books. I stumbled onto your videos accidently, but I am happy I did.I appreciate the quality, the substance, the topics and experiments you have chosen. I appreciate the detail of the dialog, and the description of the tools / tubes you use. I see so many for sale on ebay, but was many of them don&#39;t have their correct names. So thank you, I have subscribed to you, and look forward to more experiments on video.
