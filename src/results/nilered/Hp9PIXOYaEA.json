I have been doing digital experiments (chemistry only) and I believe I have found how ball lightning is made exactly.

The others try to hide and fly away from it. I usually do it in a vacuum but they always find a way to disappear and pop outside of the sealed space. You can even control them using thoughts sorta. One is white glow; one is yellow, and the other gold. I\u2019ve even had a few small white ones spontaneously change to gold or yellow. But man they do things that defy gravity. Sometimes they pop out of existence, and suddenly the entire space is filled with acid and water. I want to test this on a large physical scale. But can\u2019t fathom any means that allow for safety or control. If I only create the peaceful types, they will still fly around and work together to escape. I know that they have explosive power and seem to have an endless supply of energy. Somehow the area around them has different hues.

It shold not freeze. Put the cold na amalgam  in the icy cold ammonium chloride aolution and let it sit and react. Neutral sodium atoms will reduce the amonnium ions to neutral ammonium which will dissolve in the mercury as ammonium metal and the sodium will become sodium ions and you will have a lump of ammonium amalgam in a cold solution of sodium chloride.  Keep it well bellow freezing if you want it to be stable. Ammmonium amalgam is a strong reducing agent like an alkali metal amalgam but it only reacts slowly with cold water, You can also prepare ammonium amalgam by preparing a cold solution of ammonium carbonate and electrolysing it with a pool of mercury as the cathode. Keep in mind that pure metallic ammonium does exist at high pressure, You compress ammonia with hydrogen until it becomes metallic, There is suspicion that large amounts of it exists deep in the atmospheres of outer olanets. It might remain stable at ordinary pressures if it is kept cold enough. You can get similar results with quaternariammonium salts. In particular, if you electrolise twtramethylammonium hydroxide solution (cold!) with a mercury cathode you will get the amalgam.  It is possible to dissolve alkali metals in cold ammonia so they form deep blue solutions with powerful reducing <a href=\"http://properties.it/\">properties.It</a> is also possible to form such solutions using  quaternarium amonnium compounnds. they are powerful reducing agents too.

We start initially with Na . Hg amalgum and with some ammonium salt (NH4+/x-) where X is some relatively inert halie or pseudohalide - then it forms some sort of NH4 . Hg amalgum.  So in this reaction the halide is a spectator, but we have a redox reaction between sodium and ammonium, going to a sodium salt (NaX), and Hg . NH4.  However the NH4 is not really a radical like you suggested.  Due to the fact all the valence orbitals are full there&#39;s no where for that extra electron to go.  Instead what happens here is there is NH4+ and a &quot;free&quot; electorn (e-) which is dissociated throughout the mercury.<br><br>My guess is that this amalgum or the sodium one you started with could be potentially useful electron donors in a variety of redox reactions, as working with free electron donors (such as sodium metal) is extrodinarily volitile.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for letting me flex my chemistry brain a little bit.
