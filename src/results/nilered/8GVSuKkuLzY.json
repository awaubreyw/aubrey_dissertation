One of the chemical products has to H2SO4 when it combines with liquid water, even if that liquid water originate from its own original chemical form when it&#39;s sold. This is something that greatly alarmed me when I realized that I had been taking relaxing Epsom salt baths every weekend to help me be a better student during the week (also also during the weekend because I obviously also had to study). Shouldn&#39;t that have meant that I was actually bathing in a bath of sulfuric acid! I reasoned that it must have been okay because it had to be really dilute and that made me wonder why it should be relaxing to take a bath in any concentration of sulfuric acid!<br><br>Therefore, some of the water probably is hard to separate because, once it forms a liquid sulfuric acid, it&#39;s going to be harder to get the water molecule out of that (which is what you also surmised). Now, having to take lots of chemistry and physics, even though my major was biology, I obviously had to take even more biology classes and one of them was neurobiology, which included things like how we taste things. What tells our brain that something tastes sour is nothing more than a receptor (in the neuron sense, as opposed to a self surface receptor protein) that detects an excessive concentration of H+ ions so it&#39;s just an acid receptor. So if there was probably a little sulfuric acid left in that water. I wonder if reverse osmosis would have gotten it out.

Poke a hole in the tarp and feed the handle of a sledgehammer (or whatever you have) through.  Put your material in the bucket, and then put your sledgehammer in there.  You can then either bungee the tarp around the bucket, or freeball it and just let it hang loose.  Then just start smashing it like churning butter.  The tarp will keep chips from flying around everywhere, and if you use a decently strong bucket or one that lies completely flush with the floor, then you can get most of the strength of the concrete under it to smash against.<br><br>You can also put something in the bottom of the bucket if you want a strong surface to pound against, too.  Something like a piece of sheet metal, or an old 10-20 pound (metal) weight works well.  I suppose you could also just pour some concrete into the bottom and let it dry, too, but then you run the risk of contaminating your material with chunks of concrete.  Plus, you are in a situation where you need a solution like this, then you probably aren&#39;t in the market for a solution that requires that kind of prep time...<br><br>You can also just wrap it up in a tarp and smash it that way, but the likelihood of puncturing the tarp are much higher than with the bucket.  This only works for the softer side of rocky materials, but it is a quick and dirty way to get it done that works better than you might think.", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T06:22:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll just file this away in my &quot;potentially useful info for after the apocalypse&quot; folder.", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T06:09:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BoW Skittlez", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GVSuKkuLzY&amp;t=14m24s\">14:24</a> \u201cEpsom smoke.

It has a huge impact on plate tectonics and also affects volcanic activity. A large amount of the water is in the transition zone in between the upper and lower mantle layers but there is also a great deal of water inside the rocks and minerals which make up the mantle zones. About 7 or 8 years ago some diamonds were found which contained the mineral ringwoodite and ringwoodite itself contains 1.5% water by weight. Further, the diamonds were found within kimberlite (which had obviously been brought to the surface by volcanic eruption), the deepest kind of volcanic rocks. <br><br>So technically you are correct in your assumption that the epsom salt obtained water from its environment but I\u2019m guessing you had some other geological process in mind?

Upon discovering it was the natural form of magnesium sulfate I decided to try it mixed into my plant water reservoir. I found its incredibly inconsistent when tested with an EC probe and it seems almost impossible to determine TDS difference in advance from measuring out granules by traditional means.  It also seems that dissolving epsom salt with luke warm water increases PPM(dissolving?) rapidly, whereas when mixing epsom salt in room temperature water, the PPM increase seems much more gradual, and may go up over time when tested again.

If you start out with the dehydrated bricks of it, it should make great anti-meteorite armor, while also soaking up excess humidity to become harder and more of a radiation shielding. The bricks could probably be glued together by simply moistening the edges and then quickly assembling them before they harden. Then, the hydrated form can be used as a heat shield for the reentry phase, since it can handle a good amount of heat and self-cools by releasing water. Carved shapes of it could  be stacked inside the landing gear to intentionally crush, and absorb impact. Once landed, it can be used for radiation shielding again, but also for moisture control and in-situ moisture harvesting. In the event of an air leak, it should snatch humidity, liquefy, and re-harden. It could possibly be used as an emergency shelter in its hydrate-glued brick form again, but in the shape of an igloo. This time, the absorbed humidity would keep the inside warm, while it forms a hardened shell that re-heals when cracked. Furthermore, it can be turned into sulfuric acid, which is a handy chemical, but can also harvest water from air, but it is normally liquid, and therefore, easier to use in automated machinery.", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T04:34:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cassie Pine", "comment_text": "This is the most time consuming bath bomb I&#39;ve ever seen", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T04:33:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "psycronizer", "comment_text": "and most of the human body is water, and most of that water is empty space, and most of that empty space has actual energy in it......and your worried about Epsom salts ?", "comment_date": "2020-10-03T04:19:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TJ Jewett", "comment_text": "2 thoughts: Thought 1) what would it take to turn that water back into epsom salts? could you just put the powder in the water, dissolve it, and dry it?

That causes the glass to expand and contract differently in different parts of the glass, causing the glass to eventually tear itself apart.<br><br>The second is to be conscious of the properties of the stuff you&#39;re heating and/or cooling inside, especially if it&#39;s going to harden into a lump. You always want to make sure that the stuff cooling inside the glass shrinks faster than the glass, and that the stuff on the outside shrinks slower.

I didnt realize this about epsom. I know what it is i just never really considered the formula long enough to put together that its is mostly water. <br> A few things:<br>1. All water is ancient. The only real way to meaningfully assign an age to water is at the molecularl level and even then its simply a matter of determinging how long that hydrogen has been vibing with those oxygen molecules,  thats kinda pointless and would be impossible to really do outside of burning hydrogen in an oxygen atmosphere to produce water vapor and condensing it then saying that &quot;this collection of water is x old relationally&quot;<br> Otherwise. Most atoms are if not relative to each other pretty closs to the same age, they are so much older than us that the discussion at this broad a level is pointless. A billion years here or there isnt much to sneeze at, and all matter on earth other than perhaps a few odd out of system orignating meteorites is approximately the same age in respect to its location on the earth or in the sol system. <br> IE all water is about the same age since i havent seen any orbital tanker ships dropping any new water off. <br> 2. Your set up ham strung you here. <br> You should have created a large sealed vessle that allowed you to  heat the salt such that it had a very high surface area to volume  ratio. This would have sped up the process of drying it out, and avoided the chunk issue. <br>Heating it up in a ball caused it to become very inefficent at absorbing heat and releasing water vapor. <br> It has to heat up and vent vapor the same way, from the outside inward. So basically, the heat is having to travel through the ball, but it wants to rise, and its going to do this along the surface better than it will through the center, so the ball vents heat better at the surface than it absorbs it at the cente because of the greater suraface area. <br>Once the center does get to temp, the outer salts will be drier than the inner salts, and as the vapor passes through some of it will get trapped. It will get released, but slowly as you saw. <br> Heating it up in a single wide and thin layer will avoid both of these problems. <br> Heres what you should use. <br>To to n automotive parts store and buy a large sheet of high temperature gasket material. <br>Go to a restraunt supply store and buy the largest chaffing dish you can get that comes with a lid that fits tightly. One that comes with its own stand is perfect. <br>Now plumb the lid like you did the flask. Then cut a gasket from the sheet that will fit along the lip of the chafing dish such the the lid will still fit on the pan. Fit the gasket in place and put the lid on, and using small c clamps, hold it in place. <br> Using a small drill bit, drill several holes through the lips of the lid and pan, all the way around. You are putting in holes for little screws to be used to seal the dish, which is the next step, install little bolts and nuts to seal the two halves together. <br>This will be much more efficient. <br> You might have to insulate this to make it more efficient and i reccomend not using direct firing to heat the pan at these temps. It will burn through it.", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T03:34:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azligcks Hibson", "comment_text": "That&#39;s the coolest hammer I&#39;ve ever seen", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T03:32:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Nabours", "comment_text": "Will It blend?", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T03:29:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Tack", "comment_text": "unfinished deathstar v2 vibe", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T03:28:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soraka Main", "comment_text": "Finally some good content", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T03:16:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wildfire", "comment_text": "I still can&#39;t believe it&#39;s not butter!", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T03:13:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Computers Cats and More", "comment_text": "Next time everyone makes a run on bottled water I&#39;m gonna buy all the Epsom Salt.", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T03:12:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryan Stellfox", "comment_text": "This reminds me of the time I discovered liquid desiccants.

Could this be used on planes and boats as a &quot;deserted island&quot; emergency kit to produce potable water? Seems like it might be easier to concentrate the water vapor given off by this than the traditional route, I.e: sea water distillation. It would also make the setup and maintenance easier, you just need three bottles and a tube, one bottle left open with MgSO4 to absorb water from the air, another bottle for the boiling MgSO4, connected with a silicon tube to the 3rd bottle, to collect the H2O. After one of the 2 MgSO4 bottles is essentially &quot;dry&quot;, you just swap it with the other bottle that has been absorbing humidity.<br><br>This would provide a constant stream of water and all you would need for it to keep working is a fire, and to switch the tube every few hours.<br><br>EDIT2: A further refinement would see the design reduced to only need two bottles, one for boiling MgSO4 and the other to receive the vapor; The main bottle would require two tiny tesla valves, one to only let air in and one to lead out to the silicone tube. The diameter of the tesla valves&#39; width would have to be correlated with the speed that water is released from the MgSO4 n-hydrate, to produce a mild vacuum effect.", "comment_date": "2020-09-27T20:39:09Z", "likes_count": 87}, {"comment_by": "Mimi Ja", "comment_text": "I would have put some amount of the water back into the blocks before the second run to help break them down", "comment_date": "2020-09-27T20:35:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rennis Tora", "comment_text": "Huh...
