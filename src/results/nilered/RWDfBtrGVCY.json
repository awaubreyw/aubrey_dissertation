May I ask if there&#39;s any reason you&#39;d not use a heating mantle? All descriptions of the Knoevenagel I&#39;ve come across describe use of a hotplate, or shallow oil bath. Is there a reason for this? I prefer a mantle for heating but find the reaction is slower than descriptions, although raising temperature has improved it. I wondered if the greater heat transfer from a mantle, to the distillation product, in my case toluene/water, (which doesn&#39;t make sense to me) is a problem.  Doesn&#39;t make sense. The heat is intended to push the reaction, but can it be too much? Can it take too long? Is there any degradation of the product or reaction if greater time is taken to complete? ie; 24 hours instead of 5?", "comment_date": "2022-05-09T06:47:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel K\u00fcpper", "comment_text": "I mixed Benzylalcohol with a solution of urea in water, that give 2 layers and strong smell of benzaldehyde.", "comment_date": "2022-05-02T14:50:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GAURAV BHUSHAN KUMAR", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t use parkin reaction?", "comment_date": "2022-03-17T02:59:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Elijah Resuello", "comment_text": "The music absolutely threw me", "comment_date": "2022-03-01T15:10:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RACY", "comment_text": "Is it cinnamon", "comment_date": "2022-02-18T12:39:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Nado Nation", "comment_text": "I dont know why i enjoy listening to the nerd so much, but i have watched probably all of his videos more than once.", "comment_date": "2022-02-16T03:06:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NorthStarrs", "comment_text": "Me, who&#39;s got no idea what&#39;s going on: BUT HOW DOES IT TASTE", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T10:54:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clayton Katz", "comment_text": "Can you make a video about how molar mass works?
