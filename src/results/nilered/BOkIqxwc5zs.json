For future reference, if you ever want to make a silicone mold and don&#39;t have proper molding silicone on hand, you can make something kind of close enough out of silicone caulk and corn starch or glycerine. (Possibly also DOT-3 or DOT-4 brake fluid; I haven&#39;t tried that myself, but if you read on, you&#39;ll see why that might work.) Make sure the caulk is labeled as 100% silicone; you should be able to get plenty at your local hardware store.) When you mix up molding silicone, there are two main components: 1) a mixture that reacts with moisture from the air to form silicone rubber and 2) a hygroscopic component to help pull moisture from the air. Silicone caulk is basically the first part without the second, because it&#39;s meant to be applied in such thin layers that it cures in minutes just on its own.<br><br>How exactly you proceed depends on how fast you want the mold to set and how long it takes to get the mold formed. I would highly recommend you not imitate me the first time I did this and mix one part corn starch to three parts silicone to make a mold of highly-detailed laurel leaves. (It was for the crown on a friend&#39;s costume.) I barely managed to get the mold around the initial clay sculpture before it set too much to manipulate. Smaller amounts of the hygroscopic component will give you a longer curing time. Additionally, glycerine will give you a better working texture, because it does not have the physical baggage of being a basically dry, bulky powder. I&#39;ve also seen molding silicone made by squirting an entire tube of silicone caulk into a bowl of dilute dish soap in water, kneading it a little, then pulling the whole mass out to mold around an object, but I&#39;ve never tried this myself.<br><br>I work as a mechanic these days, so I&#39;m familiar with the fact that DOT-3 or -4 brake fluid is an extremely hygroscopic fluid, which might be good for texture and probably cheaper than glycerine, but I don&#39;t know how it would react chemically with silicone rubber. Since it&#39;s glycol-based, I <i>think</i> you&#39;d be okay, but I&#39;ve never tried it. I&#39;m also not entirely certain it would be <i>called</i> DOT-3 or DOT-4 in Canada, since the DOT refers to the US Department of Transportation, but I don&#39;t know what else to call it. Basically, a glycol-based brake fluid that boils between 205-230\u00b0C when dry.", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T22:00:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jean Pierre Daviau", "comment_text": "Do you sell them on the net<br>?", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T19:13:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charles Leckow", "comment_text": "HA!
