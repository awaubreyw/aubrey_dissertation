I hope your having a great day so far! I just want you to know that God loves you guys so very much. He wants you to be with him in heaven someday and not hell. You see, God out of great love for you sent his only son Jesus to take the penalty and punishment of your sins, by dying for your sins on the cross. The Bible says that he bore our sins in his own body, and that all of our iniquities were placed upon him. Jesus took the blame and  the punishment that you and I deserved. He did this out of his great love for us so that we may be together with him in heaven.  And after his death on the cross, he was buried, and rose from the dead 3 days later. That right there is called the gospel. The word gospel means good news. It\u2019s good news because if you decide right here and now to put your faith and trust in Jesus and believe the gospel, that he died for your sins, was buried, and rose from the dead  3 days later, then you will be saved and will be with him in heaven, having everlasting life( eternal life). God\u2019s will for you is to repent, which simply means to have a change of mind or to turn. So you must realize that you have sinned against him and turn to him in faith and believe the gospel and relay on what he has done for you. You will never know when you will leave here, you could die today, tomorrow, or even years from now. So what decision will you make? Will you realize your sinfulness and believe the gospel? Will you put your faith and trust in Jesus and relay on what he has done for you? Or will you choice to engorge this entirely? It\u2019s all up for you to decide. Guys, life is short, but eternity is long. What every place you end up in, whether it be heaven or hell, you will be there for eternity! This is why the decision that you will make right now will determine your eternity! I have made that decision, will you?  Well, thats all I wanted to say!

I know that DCM is a very good organic solvent for caffeine, but that property tends to lend itself to also being good at attracting other compounds other than what was intended, especially when working with unknowns. DCM is a good choice, I believe chloroform is slightly better at pulling the caffeine, but DCM is the smarter choice given the ready access to removal methods, perhaps the issue isn&#39;t your choice of solvent or drying method, but maybe a kinetics problem. You did allude to this when talking about DCMs love for forming emulsions, and that in working around that you end up with less contact area for collisions to occur. I think trying to get the extraction to occur in the separation funnel isnt working, although the first run was probably going to give a better yield. Instead use as wide a beaker as you can find, throw a stir bar but don&#39;t use any heat and mix the heck out of it of it for a while. From here my thought is to to just pull a vacuum on that to boil the DCM from the solution (I was thinking that maybe some form of column chromatography might work as well) and the remaining water/syrup mix should be closer to what you&#39;re talking about. Its still going to remove whatever flavoring it seems to be latching on to, but your caffeine yield should be higher without it tasting like you licked concrete or something.", "comment_date": "2022-01-12T10:49:00Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Kinang Eagle", "comment_text": "I\u2019m sure you can land yourself a job at RedBull\u2019s drink division, so then it wouldn\u2019t be an outside idea", "comment_date": "2022-01-12T05:28:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "straightpipeK20", "comment_text": "Maybe the disparity in taste/smell is from the container?

Not necessarily painful to watch mind ya, it&#39;s knowing that your only limiting factors is limits on materials and equipment. Now the former I can&#39;t do much about, but the latter... suffice to say I&#39;m one hell of a maker.<br><br>Watching you attemp to draw out as much caffeine as possible without emulsify them was slightly painful, but in the &quot;I want so much more for him&quot; way. Like I said I&#39;m a maker, and I&#39;ve done a fair amount of glasswork (borosilicate included)... if you want some one of a kind devices made from inert materials just let me know!<br><br>More specifically that little scene inpied me to make was a completely glass pump... as dumb as it sounds I reckon it could be a game-chamher. It wouldn&#39;t be too complex either: I&#39;d start with a glass tube and taper one end in a kinda odd way: a sharp step thats turnwd into a long taper, then add two 90\u00b0 bends it until both ends were parallel, and close the non-stepped side (and probably add a small glass fitting, like a 1/8 plastic tube fitting er somethin). Next is pop a hole at the bend of the closed side and attach a tube. This thrid one would continued a short ways before turning 90\u00b0, same as tbe other two, and it would end in a fitting designed to mate with most other equipment. Then I&#39;d add a larger diameter glass tube, seated in the step I mentioned above. Before fusing those two parts I&#39;d have to dry fit ball-bearing in the taper, then fuse them, then glow the ball out. Then the whole works would be annealed for a day or so. In that time I&#39;d double up on the tube/ball thing, and get a third tube with a glass rod that fit perfectly on the inside, the end of the glass rod would need to be put on the end of motor that would slowly pump it back and fpurth. Lastly I&#39;d need to place the balls inside the tapered tube, then taper those tubs. Next I&#39;d have to connect the l first tube with the pump tube so bother were positioned on the underside, up top would be where the second ball n tube would go... and lastly it have to give the part up top a decent fitting.<br><br>This could also be done so the whole thing can be deconstructed for cleaning too... and that weid closed tube with a fitting on it is an archaic hammer-arrester. Just so a serj of energy wouldn&#39;t blow the whole thing up. The fitting on it was there just incase 1) you had a particularly picky reaction and needed an internet atmosphere/ 2) wanted a means of bubbling a gas/ 3) waned a spot to introduce another chemical as the pump would very thoroughly mix them.<br><br>Wouldn&#39;t be too hard nor expensive, lmk if you&#39;re interested!<br><br>Oh ya, and it goes without saying- this would not be a fast pump. I could in theory make a decently high throughput glass pump, but that&#39;s a can of worms in its own right.

Now, coming back to the caffeine, it contains 32mg/150ml making it 33% less then western one - a bit better than yours ;-) I guess you might be able to get it in some stores specialising in imported foreign food products, at least I can find stuff like that in Poland.", "comment_date": "2021-12-30T03:15:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cuda_Clutch", "comment_text": "If anyones curious, stomach fluid is roughly 2 ph, but varies.

BUT IF I&#39;M NOT MISTAKEN:  you can run it through the desiccator again :)<br><br> Just repeat the process with some more clean DCM. The caffeine is being separated from the redbull at the solute phase where the DCM molecule is likely attaching to the caffeine molecule with a stronger bond. When you&#39;re rotating the separator funnel to increase contact of surface area between the molecules you might be limited as to being very gentile with it. Shaking seems to disrupt the system too much for it to sediment-out within an acceptable time range; further distorting your d&#39;S(value) for the reaction to take place. By repeating this phase you may be able to extract more caffeine. Perhaps there is a limit per Caffeine(mg)/Mol you can extract in each DCM(g)/Mol solute extraction w/t S.F. You might also put it in a capped erlenmyer flask. Placed atop the heat plate w/a stir rod turning slowly. Little bit of heat could help too, just hotter than room temp. <br>If your caffeine is roughly 90% you&#39;re doing everything right. I believe Its just that damned surface area issue. <br><br>If that doesn&#39;t work, try adding maybe 15ml of 95%+ isopropyl Alcohol as a chemical catalyst for the caffeine-&gt;DCM binding. To remove the alcohol let it sit over night in the desiccator on no heat. If it ruins the flavor oh well, we tried. But it&#39;s not like people actually love the flavor and drink redbull with alcohol anyways to begin with right?

I would say the pKa 14 is the pKa of caffeine it&#39;s self, because it&#39;s a base (high pKa is an indicator of something weekly acidic or something basic and a low pKa is an indicator of something strongly acidic). Looking up pKa for a base you are often likely to get results for the conjugate acid seeing as the base is not an acid its self and pKa is essentially a measure of acidity.

You could try using supercritical CO2 to extract the caffeine; supercritical CO2 is one of the methods used to commercially extract caffeine out of coffee beans without affecting flavor. The only caveat is I&#39;m not sure if it would also extract other components of RedBull that could affect its flavor. Since Red Bull is normally carbonated, I doubt that supercritical CO2 itself would affect the flavor. In terms of procedure, Applied Science made some videos about supercritical CO2 on his channel; maybe this could be an opportunity for collaboration?<br><br>Idea 2.) I think that your original experiment was viable and maybe just needed some extra optimization of the experimental procedures. Quick note, I am not trying to be critical of the video/experiment since I&#39;m sure that there were parts of the experiment that did not make the video cut; this is just me spitballing possible ideas.<br>A.) You could experimentally test how much pure caffeine could be dissolved in a set amount of DCM at room temperature and work backwards to calculate how much DCM you need to use to extract pure caffeine, then take that number and maybe divide it by 90% to account for the impurities to get your theoretical amount of DCM to use.<br>B.) For the separatory funnel step, instead of rocking the two liquids, maybe swirl them instead to decrease chances for emulsion. Also, while waiting for the caffeine to get extracted in the funnel, you could position the funnel at an angle to increase the surface area between the two liquids.

Uric acid undergoes hydrolysis at the same time to produce aminodimethylbarbituric acid. The latter reacts with the dimethylalloxan to form a derivative of purpuric acid (yellow coloured with a red rim, the reaction is carried out with heating to the point of partial sublimation).

So I think a much larger flask with more dcm would probably extract more caffeine and whatever odour chemicals you took out. Even with the same equipment if you took out 24% using 75mL of dcm, then just do more rinsing steps with at least 4x or 300 mL of dcm....maybe even 500mL just to be thorough.

This quote is the easiest and quickest way to show we are completely being manipulated and lied to by our government, academia, and media: \u201cWe\u2019ll know our disinformation program is complete when everything the American public believes is false.\u201d William Casey, CIA Director 1981-1987.  I only learned this 2 years ago, and this quote was just before I was born.  What does this have to do with chemistry/nutrition?  Well, as much as any other profession, everything.  Control, manipulation, profits, and greed.  Every profession regulated by any government entity in whole or in part will never avoid ANY of these four things.  A 12oz can of redbull has 39 grams of sugar.  Measure that much sugar out on a scale and SEE what kind of a mountain it creates.  You are a chemist and have a scale, so this should be incredibly easy.  Natural, organic glucose is HEALTHY for the body.  The chemically processed garbage sugar that is in 99% of all our food and drinks is the literal definition of poison.  Look up the definition of poison.  Sugar completely fits the bill.   You need to extract all that SUGAR out of it to save your own health.  I drank between one and two 2-liters of pepsi everyday starting when I was a kid, probably for about 25-30 years in total.  Completely stopped drinking sodas 18 months ago, and have never touched them since.  The damage has already been done.

Should get that sugar syrup mostly caffein free, but talking about the processes. <br><br>and lore would say you don&#39;t like the taste simply as much as you&#39;ve been conditioned to the addictive caffeine and super addictive sugar and simply associate the taste.

This might not be as streamlined as what you&#39;re currently doing, but it would allow you to maximize contact between the DCM and the redbull. I also noticed that using your method, the redbull and DCM form an intermediate phase, which, looks like one way that the other redbull compounds are being added to your caffeine. Using a centrifuge and narrower glassware would greatly reduce this. <br><br>Also, this is a lot more work and also expensive, but if you can resuspend your caffeine sample and get someone to run it through a GC-MS or LC-MS (you might have to derivatize it), you might be able to find out which compounds are being captured by the DCM and find a miscibility gap. From my experience, DCM likes to grab onto whatever it can. I&#39;m going to guess that if the smell is leaving, the DCM might be extracting some volatile terpenoids. If this is the case, then I&#39;m pretty sure that you can extract these from the solution using n-hexane or cyclohexane. <br><br>I&#39;m not really a chemist, and I&#39;m really thinking through processes that I&#39;ve worked with.

Increases the temperature to 115\u00b0C. This will work in your favor, as less time exposed to open air allows for less oxygenation. <br>2.) Rather than rocking the DCM, stir it.  You want to emulsify completely.  The time spent separating should prove worth it. You are taking time with the destination. <br>3.) Figure that every step you takes a  molecular toll. Remember, the caffeine has a flavor, and removing it will also alter the flavor. <br>4.) Use less fresh DCM. Reuse the DCM. The goal here is to heat a super saturation solution in the DCM. <br>Also,  (pipe dream though it may be) this will hopefully allow non caffeine ingredients to transfer back into the &quot;Red Bull&quot; solution. <br>5.) Use an appropriate amount of carbonation. Even carbon dioxide has an affect on flavor. <br>6.) Calculate for the volume loss for caffeine, adding precisely the proper volume of water back in before recarbonating.<br><br>These are all just guesses, from more of a food standpoint, with a little science theory thrown in. <br><br>Also,  start with 1L of Red Bull.

The only one left isn&#39;t very acitic as well cause you can&#39;t stabilize the anion via mesomeric effects. So it should be a weak base because a positive charge (n orbital of nitrogen) can indeed be stabilized by the other nitrogen in the \rimidazole part of the molecule.

Why not just repeat your extraction process multiple times on the same sample of red bull to see if you can continue to remove caffeine?

Ethyl acetate is a common choice, although it might be difficult to fully remove afterwards. You would need to rotavap it and maybe azeotrope with CHCl3, which is not ideal because chloroform is highly toxic. Diethyl ether may be another viable option for the extraction since it is relatively non-toxic and highly volatile, so it should be easily removed afterwards. <br><br>3. You could try to isolate the caffeine using flash chromatography (probably with a silica stationary phase). I don\u2019t know if this would work though, because you would need to find (from lit. or experimentally) a TLC system that will give the caffeine an Rf ~0.3 with reasonable separation from the other compounds present (if they are not UV active, visualise them with a dye - see NotVoodoo for more info). If this prerequisite is met, then run the column, collect the fractions containing caffeine and set them aside. Collect any other fractions that are separated for future recombination. You would need to flush the column afterwards to retrieve everything remaining on the column (this is sometimes done with 10% MeOH in DCM, but methanol is toxic so it may not be viable). Recombine everything not containing caffeine, remove solvent etc., dilute with water, carbonate.

Another is that I would guess any scents added (which do contribute to the flavor as olfactory sensation is a huge part of the way things taste) are likely very light molecules which were probably removed, to some extent anyway, under a vacuum. They are meant to be released for you to smell them, so being slow to evaporate is counteractive to their function. A final thing I would contribute is just a general tip, it is best to carbonate liquids at as low a temperature as possible because CO2&#39;s solubility changes when water is colder.

You can actually just use loose silica to make your own column an then sample your stuff through there you want to purify of caffeine. I think I would start with a test run and collect test fractions to see when exactly the caffeine is eluating (hopefully this is the english word for it). You would have to test all the samples for caffeine once though and determine at which times caffeine is coming through the column. Then I think you can use smaller batches (bigger than HPLC though) to run through there and collect everything except for the caffeine fractions and reunite those. <br><br>Problems i can think of for this method might be the larger amounts of solvent needed, if it is even possible to use a non toxic mixture to separate the caffeine as clear as possible. Also im not sure how big your sample can be at once, id have to look that up.

See earlier today i was thinking about how when it comes to the brain only 10 percent of it is actually functional, yet a cell is made up of atoms.. and when it comes to atoms string theory plays a acute roll is holding together atomic bonds because of the energy in which holds it (protons electrons and neutrons), and depending on that atom it can function as like a motor (As like the smallest motor, which is made of atoms with a 99% chance to turn 1 direction only changing for some unknown reason (Which i think is just magnetic poles changing direction).) So Cells like the brain still have energy, just in the form of atomic Energy. With chemicals we create bonds inside our body with the use of matter everyday feedding ourselves so our body can break it apart and reuse it for whatever we need. With the understanding of atoms, chemicals, and cells, I wonder if Even though 10% seems active is it truly inactive? I ask this because energy is still concistent to the idea that energy (Protons electrons, and nuetrons) holds and can bond with other atoms to make cells, and cells make people. So people control atoms, yet Atoms are not living.  So are we really alive? and if our bodies uses atoms that mean how we dream and see, we use atoms to imprint imagery inside our brain. light even is made of atoms radiating with well radiation.. which are chemicals and other things like rocks and magma, yet still atoms. and we shape atoms like our planet &gt; o &lt;  , and our planet is the shape of a Ball, like an atom, atoms hold energy. our planet holds energy. Bonds are unstable over time to so like an atom it can loose mass or energy (Like uranium). Things like this needs to be intergrated in my opinion..", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T15:51:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roberts Vimba", "comment_text": "Me: <b>chugs a redbull and falls asleep like a baby</b>", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T15:48:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Ehrmantraut", "comment_text": "Never noticed that RedBull looks exactly like Urin.", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T15:44:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G", "comment_text": "Stop cutting bits out dude, we all know you took a second scoop of that concentrated red bull ahah", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T15:39:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "John smith", "comment_text": "I love red bull but only for a few sips maybe half a can then it just becomes too citrus .I bet that&#39;s why they have such small cans.", "comment_date": "2020-07-08T15:39:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phillip Duren", "comment_text": "I have an idea that would be interesting,  about how you said flavor and taste use different chemicals.

Ethyl acetate might also be able to extract caffeine and its way safer and more volatile. Then I would suggest doing a &#39;plug&#39; SiO2 extraction on the caffeine to separate ester compounds that gave it the smell. Your TLC looked like it was riding with the solvent interface, so it should be pretty easy, but I would try a few different solvent mixtures to make sure it&#39;s not just hiding within the caffeine spot. Double check the solvent purity and wash the SiO2 before doing this, as it would be very easy to just introduce more impurities from low-grade solvents and SiO2. Especially considering how little of the ester is being saved, just for the purpose of flavour/smell. I would personally just try to ID the ester/flavour/smell compounds that are being removed and then add them back from a pure source (i.e. seperate synthesis or purchase).

Im not sure how that would work on liquid redbull, but evaporating the liquid, then passing supercritical CO2 over the solid remainders could work. probably not very realistic though. hopefully im not misremembering from the course i took 6?ish years ago in undergrad lol.

It was developed by Kurt Zosel, a scientist of the Max Plank Institute, and uses liquid CO2 in place of chemical solvents. It acts selectively on the caffeine, i.e., it releases the alkaloid and nothing else.<br>In the CO2 decaffeination process, water soaked coffee beans are placed in a stainless steel container called the extraction vessel. The extractor is then sealed and liquid CO2 is forced into the coffee at pressures of 1,000 pounds per square inch to extract the caffeine.<br>The CO2 acts as the solvent to dissolve and draw the caffeine from the coffee beans, leaving the larger-molecule flavor components behind. The caffeine laden CO2 is then transferred to another container called the absorption chamber. Here the pressure is released and the CO2 returns to its gaseous state, leaving the caffeine behind. The caffeine free CO2 gas is pumped back into a pressurized container for reuse.<br>Because of its cost, this process is primarily used to decaffeinate large quantities of commercial-grade, less-exotic coffee found in grocery stores.&quot;<br>Good thing you already have a supercritical CO2 chamber dude!", "comment_date": "2020-07-05T16:17:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Albert Hofmann", "comment_text": "How about running a collumn?", "comment_date": "2020-07-05T16:15:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Billy Stanford", "comment_text": "It\u2019s weird I got a red bull ad", "comment_date": "2020-07-05T16:14:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saif ullah Asad", "comment_text": "You could just drink redbull with sleeping pills so then you drink and sleep.

Looking at the molecule you can see that there are no acidic protons. As your screenshot from Wikipedia states: The pKa of the <b>conjugated acid</b> is somewhere between 0 and 1. That means that the non-protonated caffeine molecule you show on screen is a weak base. If it were to react acidic (which it really can&#39;t), it would be a terrible acid with a pKa of between 13 and 14 (remember pKa + pKb = 14). So most of your sources say the same thing - you just have to find out for yourself if they are talking about caffeine as a base or caffeine as an acid. Your other two sources might have looked at something completely different or were just wrong. Edit: Also, your TLC only tells you that you haven&#39;t got any UV-active impurities.

Essentially, they soak coffee beans in water, this extracts the caffeine and the flavour. Then, they throw these beans away.

As the flavours are saturated in the water, it doesn&#39;t pull any more flavour out, but it does take the caffeine out.

However, I think you may have shot yourself in the foot by evaporating the water off before extracting.

You might be able to get close by adding some quinine.<br>Any evaporation will remove a lot of the volatile notes, as you saw with this experiment. The remaining flavour that you were left with is still characteristic, but it&#39;s going to be much &quot;flatter&quot;.<br>If you can find something that&#39;s really specific for caffeine and load it onto a column, you might be able to remove it that way. Maybe a cellulose or silica column? Resin probably isn&#39;t the best choice, because it will absorb too much of the flavour.<br>The easiest way would simply be to go to a flavour house (Givaudan, Symrise, Firmenich, IFF, etc.) and say you want to make a drink that tastes like Red Bull. They&#39;ll all have &quot;taste alike&quot; options that will be much closer than anything you&#39;ll get from an extraction. But of course, where&#39;s the chemistry in that? This video was much more interesting than &quot;Let&#39;s mix flavour, HFCS and a bitter ingredient to make a soda.&quot;<br>Now why can flavour houses give you something that tastes like Red Bull? Well, that would be illegal if they&#39;d analysed Red Bull chemically and just recreated it, or if they actually called it Red Bull flavour, or if they actually are Red Bull&#39;s supplier and they gave you the exact same flavour mix that they supply Red Bull, but if you just taste something and formulate something that tastes just like it, that&#39;s OK. It doesn&#39;t even do much to the brand: A disgruntled employee once leaked the Coke formula to Pepsi, and they just sent it back. Pepsi isn&#39;t wishing they could make something that tastes just like Coke. They certainly can. Consumer perception of a product is hugely influenced by the brand. If I gave a consumer panel two energy drinks, one Red Bull and one Red Bull in differently branded tins, the panel would give quite different sensory impressions of the two products.

Calcium hydroxide is weakly soluble at 1.73g per Liter at 20 degree C. This might make the solution basic enough to push the caffeine out and extract it with DCM. Once that&#39;s done, convert the calcium salt into a less soluble form by bubbling carbon dioxide into the solution to form calcium bicarbonate. If you pull the moisture out of the syrup to dryness, it decomposes the bicarbonate into carbonate on heating. (I&#39;m not sure if the sample needs to be heated to cooking, or merely dried). But calcium carbonate has a solubility of only 0.013g per liter. So when you rehydrate the syrup, you can dissolve all the ingredients of the red bull but filter off most of the calcium carbonate.

It is a bit weird for me because sometimes I need that energy boost but my overall &#39;performance&#39; during my daily life after drinking one doesn&#39;t really change or show any improvements.

Even at low speed, you will have it ready in10 mins. Then, evaporate the DCM and recristalize the caffeine using DCM water mixture. That will get the caffeine out of the solution, so you cann place the non recristalized part in the original red bull and evaporate the DCM traces. You could also do it with a chromatography step, but that would require way more solvent evaporation and Im not sure if the silica powder is something that you want anywhere close to your drink.", "comment_date": "2020-07-04T20:18:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samuel Fryer", "comment_text": "Can someone explain why nile couldn&#39;t just add a lot if water to the red bull syrup to raise the ph to near 6/7", "comment_date": "2020-07-04T20:18:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gameing Prince", "comment_text": "and this should be labled edibale chem", "comment_date": "2020-07-04T20:18:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gucci Jays", "comment_text": "I hate Red Bull\u2019s price but why would you drink it at night?", "comment_date": "2020-07-04T20:18:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raven Drakearud", "comment_text": "To anyone that likes energy drinks, I&#39;d recommend a drink called Reign.

I, for example, really dislike the acidic taste of pink and prefer the light blue ones.
