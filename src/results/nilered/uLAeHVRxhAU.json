Perhaps it would be something for your channel?\r<br>It&#39;s about making a cooling system capable of making CO2 ice using stock consumer products. Essentially a cascade refrigeration system.\r<br>Hermetically sealed refrigeration compressors can handle combustible hydrocarbon refrigerants. You use a compressor as usual, but the high pressure output of each compressor is sent through a DIY heat exchanger cooled by the expanding refrigerant from the previous stage.\r<br>\r<br>Most refrigerants require a licence, but it&#39;s easy to get around that. First stage uses butane or isobutane, sold as camping stove fuel. As long as it comes in a thin wall container, and is <b>NOT</b> the low temperature gas, it will work. The second stage uses propane, you&#39;ll need to get the type which comes in a thick wall cylinder. As pure as possible. Looked into it, and usually the most expensive brands have the purest propane.\r<br>\r<br>The thirds stage uses ethylene. Can&#39;t be bought by private individuals. You can however make it by passing ethanol through a heated pipe filled with aluminium oxide pellets/gravel. From the reactor you&#39;ll get a mixture of ethanol, water, diethyl ether and ethylene. To collect pure ethylene, you pass the gas through two other flasks. One cooled with ice water, this condenses some of the water, ethanol and ether. By collecting some mass here, the next flask won&#39;t heat up as fast as it would if it had to condense all the side products. The second flask is cooled with CO2 ice or CO2 ice with ethanol. This condenses H2O, et2O and etOH, leaving almost pure ET gas. A third flask is cooled with liquid nitrogen, condensing ET. Flask 2 &amp; 3 are of course small enough to be lowered into Dewars with their respective coolants. You have already purged a gas cylinder with nitrogen, pulled a vacuum and you now use a refrigeration compressor to transfer the ET to the cylinder. No oxygen should enter the system, nitrogen gas purging is useful for this, and there are plenty of technical manuals out there. If you know what you&#39;re doing, which you seem to do, you can find them. The compressor can as you know not handle liquid refrigerants, so the compressor the ether is allowed to vaporize in a larger container, and the compressor is run intermittently. If the compressor was allowed to vaporize the ET, the ET would condense in the compressor causing damage. Allow to vaporize from ambient heat, causing it to superheat so it does not condense inside the compressor. Cool receiving cylinder with LN2, since refrigeration compressors can have trouble restarting if the high pressure side is under too much pressure. Though CO2(s)+etOH cooling may work for this, I&#39;m not certain.\r<br>\r<br>The heat exchangers will be the challenging part. Commercial heat exchangers are thin walled, and can&#39;t handle anything more than (at most) propane. Unless you&#39;re going for million dollar scientific equipment. However you can DIY one with some metal parts. The simplest heat exchanger is a small copper pipe containing the condensing, high pressure gas from the compressor of the next cooling stage, placed inside a larger copper pipe containing the evaporating refrigerant from the previous stage. The smaller pipe is just like any other refrigeration loop, the larger pipe can be the challenge. There are copper pipe T connections which have one arm in one diameter, and the other arm in another diameter. Get a T connector with the smaller arm having the inside diameter equal to the outside diameter of the smaller pipe, and larger arm with ID the same as the large pipe. Slide the T connector onto the smaller pipe, with the larger arm directed inwards. Slide the larger pipe over the smaller, and insert its end into the T connector. Do the same to the other open end of the larger pipe. After soldering this end of the larger tube will be hermetically sealed, and the T connector stem can be connected to the expansion valve of the higher temperature stage. You could make multiple shorter heat exchangers connected in series, to make it compact.\r<br>\r<br>As the refrigerant is compressed and condensed in each refrigeration circuit&#39;s condenser, it passes through an expansion valve and the cold gas/liquid mixture passes through the large pipe of the heat exchanger cooling the compressed refrigerant of the next stage causing it to condense. Since most expansion valves are not made for temperatures lower than propane, you can simply use a needle valve, or a length of small diameter copper tube. Needle valve can be fine tuned, but fine copper pipe is more reliable and is used in many refrigeration systems. Your call.\r<br>\r<br>Ethylene boils at \u2212103,7 \u00b0C standard atmosphere, so the expanding et2O will be cold enough to freeze CO2. Simply wrap the evaporator copper pipe around a metal tray which will contain the CO2(s). Use foam insulation to insulate it, allowing it to cool efficiently. The CO2(s) container must be sealed. Using an off the shelf gas pressure regulator, CO2(g) is fed from a gas cylinder into the CO2(s) container. The regulator feeds more CO2(g) into the container as CO2 sublimates into CO2(s). \r<br>\r<br>This type of system could also be used to freeze dry items. By cooling a canner or large pressure cooker, placing frozen items in it, and pulling a vacuum, you could freeze dry items without needing CO2(s). Most freeze drying pressure cookers seem to require using CO2(s), but since this has a low heat capacity it seems to be impractical and expensive. An apparatus like this could lower the cost per run, making it possible to try various experiments and variations.", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T15:54:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Finn S.

You can use a solvents,and emulsifiers that enhance the magnetic susceptibility of the fluid. Aromatic structures in the aliphatic components of the solvent would greatly aide the resolution of the magnetic field&#39;s flux density. The obvious choice is  benzene and benzene-like compounds (Phenol, aniline or para-aniline for instance), but i would consider using five member rings like thiophene and furan to help keep the metal particulates in suspension.<br><br>2. I&#39;d consider using a different metal or even a mixture of two different metals to make a system that maintains things. <br><br>The go to metal for magnetic effects is iron, but that&#39;s more because people are accustomed to thinking about iron as being magnetic than it actually being the best choice. <br><br>Although iron will form a magnetic field in a variety of chemical states, it&#39;s also prone to oxidation. The brown color of the iron particles appear to be an oxidation compound to me. To prevent this you can pair it with nickel, which will reduce the iron compound while oxidizing the organic components of the mixture. The system would be catalytic in nature, but if that&#39;s iron chloride instead of iron oxide, it still might be an issue. <br><br>Both Nickel and Cobalt can form magnetic fields in a variety of charged states. There are a number of methods for making nano-nickel. Both Urishibara Nickel and Raney Nickel give nano powders.

Clean the metal.  Surgically clean.  Bare atoms winking at you clean.  Nothing but base metal clean.  Clean.<br>     Electrolytic iron is very clean stuff.<br>2. Apply an oxidizer/catalyst/something to get the clean metal to rust.  Saline solution works, other salts too.  Fine and even surface rust needs clean metal surface.  See step 1.<br>    Sodium chloride solutions are traditional, some source used salts of antimony or bismuth as it was felt that the rust from these salts had better adhesion &amp; color.<br>    The rusting is carefully monitored to avoid any deep pitting; the rust looks like a slight blush of muddy red over bright steel in practice.<br>3. Rusted article is immersed in rapidly boiling water.  Over a few minutes, the majority of red rust turns brown, purple and finally jet black.<br>    Boiling in water is slow; expect 10-15 minutes for any noticeable change in color.<br>    If the rust comes off at this stage, metal wasn&#39;t clean or the alloy has nickle or chromium in it.  Works only with carbon steel or pure iron!<br>4. Scrub boiled article until no more color rubs off, repeat steps 1-4 until you get the color you want.<br>    Scrub with stiff bristle brush while wet, dry with cotton rags.  Rub a bit of paper here and there.  Any color on the paper means more scrubbing is needed!<br>    The point of this is to dislodge any rust/magnetite that is not bonded to the steel surface.<br>5. At some point, the article will simply not rust any more.  The surface is sealed with inert(?) hematite, all that is left is a light oiling.<br>The process was called rust-cum-scratch or browning.  <br>Depending on the alloy and how long it is boiled, you can get brown, blue, purple, green, gray and black on the same piece!<br>The jet-black coating is pure magnetite; a nearly impermeable coating the stops rust and looks groovy.<br>For making magnetite suspensions, I am guessing that rusted electrolytic iron particles would convert to magnetite under prolonged boiling in clean water.<br>Candidate for hematite suspension: The iron fines would be oxidized in solution, cleaned then boiled in clean water to darken.

One way around this is to first form the organometallic complexes (Fe-oleates) and then proceed with the nanoparticle formation (though these are typically high temperature reactions), the particles will form while maintaining a complete oleate coverage on each particle and remain very small and highly crystalline which will improve the yield of superparamagnetic particles with a high magnetic susceptibility.<br>3) The color changes from black-brown-black during your purifications are (imo) most likely due to aggregation in the various solvents as the overall diameter of the aggregate changes so will the color and the rate of separation. Note that oxidation of the magnetite over time (especially in aqueous solvents) will lighten the material to a lighter brown over time and iron species at the surface will dissolve into solution which can eventually desorb your surfactant and destabilize the material.<br>4) You may wish to degass your aqueous reaction mixture to reduce oxidation.<br><br>As others pointed out:<br>1) Sonication! it&#39;s something I could not live without when it comes to nanochemistry (can get a jewelry cleaner pretty cheap and should work just fine for most uses).<br>2) &gt;98% purity iron salt hydrates are pretty cheap, try and get some.<br>3) NaOH can be used if you don&#39;t need the ammonia-oleate reaction.<br>4) In many cases, the faster nucleation takes place, the smaller and more uniform your particles should be.<br>5) Magnetic stir bars will not adversely affect your reaction as long as you particles remain small and stable enough (as you correctly state they will not separate because their solubility is greater than the magnetic attraction force), however, if your reaction mixture is too large, mixing can become a problem and stir bars typically will not compete with a good overhead stirrer.<br><br>Anyways, great to see you covering some nanochemistry and a room temp benchtop method as well!

Great to see some progress in ferrofluid home production. There might be good information in my playlist for ferrofluid info you might want to look. You are right by thinking that it is possible to make ferrofluid at home by readily available chemicals however it is somewhat pain in the ass. When making ferrofluid at home it will be extremely difficult to get good quality product. That is because of impurities that make significant difference in nanoparticles. The another important factor is oxidation rich environment you&#39;re working in. This is specially important for Fe2+ ions as they get oxidated and turned to Fe3+ ions therefore ratio of Fe2+/Fe3+ ions is no longer consistent. Another huge factor is that you should try avoid magnetic stirrer and use mechanical one. As someone already mentioned optimal temperature is required and  good pracrice would be to add Fe2+/Fe3+ solution dropwise to NH4+ salution. I don&#39;t really know how strong is your magnet but sometimes too strong magnetic field overpowers oleic coating and clumps magnetite particles together. <br> As far as my experience goes I&#39;ve made the ferrofluid both at home and in the laboratory. However spiking wasn&#39;t that great. If you are going to make a process for making this stuff at home, you really want to avoid any contamination by sensitivities so do not use nails + HCL. Been there done that. If you still intend to do this, you might want to boil your preferred iron source in HCL until you get oversaturated salution after that cool it down to make FeCl2 crystals you might want to cover the glassware because the oxygen will ruin your bach of FeCl2 crystals ..

But I think there are 2 possible problems here. <br>1: Adding a stabilizer during the reaction. The problem with making nanoparticles is that it can be a bit of &quot;alchemy&quot;, where conditions like which are of less influence in organic chemistry like stirring rates, volume of the flask and small impurities can play a large role. In general you biggest enemy is a process called &quot;Ostwald ripening&quot; which causes small particles aggregate and fuse making smaller particles (the same process which messes up your beer foam). Therefore it is important you to have you particles coated with an protective stabilizer as soon as they are formed, sometimes the surface charge of the particles can act as a stabilizer but i wouldn&#39;t count on it. <br>2: This reaction seems to be sensitive to oxygen, thus working under protective N2-environment is recommended. <br><br>When was making these particles I had most success with a &quot;reverse co-precipitation&quot; method where very slowly add the Fe-solution to a basic solution with a surfactant as stabilizer. This means every time a drop of Fe(II):Fe(III) is added it immediately reacts and is surrounded by stabilizer and the concentration of Fe(II):Fe(III) is kept very low. This was the procedure I used which should not be out of reach, just replace the syringe pump with an addition funnel and CTAB with oleic acid: &quot;In short, 30 ml of 0.1 M NaOH solution was heated to 85 C and purged with N2. Then 0.3 mmol CTAB was added. Seperately, 15 ml of a Fe(II) lactate: Fe(III)Cl2 solution was made with molar ratio of 3.3:6.6 mMol Fe(II):Fe(III), respectively.  The Fe(II):Fe(III) solution was added slowly to the NaOH/CTAB solution over the course of 1 hour using a syringe pump.  After the reaction was finished the black precipitated was collected and washed 3 times by centrifuging and suspended in 30 ml Milli-Q water.&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-10-17T07:28:58Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "mayesip", "comment_text": "Good job!", "comment_date": "2018-10-17T07:25:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phil Sim", "comment_text": "Cool, i think ill just buy some pre made stuff", "comment_date": "2018-10-17T07:09:08Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Gnome Warlock", "comment_text": "You always seem to lose so much product in transfers in your experiments.", "comment_date": "2018-10-17T07:01:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Samar Hankir", "comment_text": "I went through the whole thing, and as a first year student, all I can say is that you clearly know your biggest pitfalls.

The first is to really use high quality starting materials. Because you are trying to make nanoparticles, the smallest impurities will cause a dramatic change in the final product. I would go as far to say that you should try to get your hands on some ACS grade iron precursors to help reduce the impurities. Likewise, ensuring that the ammonium solution is as pure/clean as possible will help. The next thing to note is that any dust, dirt, or trace amounts of chemicals from previous reactions will cause larger/more poor quality particles to form.<br><br>When you add in the oleic acid your should experiment with how you add it in.(ie dropwise at ~1mL/min, all at once like you did here, etc..). You could also look into other surfactants that can be used.(ie longer polymer chains for greater steric repulsion or try coulombic repulsion based surfactants).<br><br>Best of luck!", "comment_date": "2018-10-17T01:27:14Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Erbond12", "comment_text": "At the beginning  i thought &quot;oh cool, something that I could maybe do by myself&quot; and at the end I was only thinking how much money I would waste and how much stuff I would just breake or damage with that experiment xD<br><br>But I&#39;m looking forward for that second part.
