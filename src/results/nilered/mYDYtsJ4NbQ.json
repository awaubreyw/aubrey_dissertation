These bromosulfuric (BrSO3H and SO2Br2) compounds are unstable above their melting point (which is below room temperature), and decompose into sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, and bromine. The sulfur dioxide escapes, but the sulfuric acid goes on to decompose a further unit of PBr3, meaning it has an effect much larger than the small contamination introduced would imply. The bromine decomposition product is fully miscible with the PBr3 and imparts a yellow color. This would also explain why the yellow color persists even after adding water; the bromine is unreactive with any of the other products and forms a light bromine-water yellow color.", "comment_date": "2016-01-02T10:47:44Z", "likes_count": 72}, {"comment_by": "Kage Hittner", "comment_text": "happy new year", "comment_date": "2016-01-01T07:00:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NN067", "comment_text": "Hey, i noticed in this and some other videos that you &quot;grease the joints with concd.
