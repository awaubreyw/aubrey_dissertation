The glucose is difficult to work with for some types of candy such as cotton candy due to the crystalline structure. It was brown because sugars tend to be brown unless they are processed into white table sugar. Pure cane sugar is brown. The cotton candy melted so quickly due to the humidity in the lab. Sugars crystalline structure changes with different levels of melting and resolidification. You may have had a bit more success if instead of caramalizing it, make a 50/50 syrup and double boiled it until you reached what is called the &quot;hardball stage&quot;. This means when you submerge a drop of molten sugar into ice water it instantly balls up into a hard piece of candy. Then, if you had ground it into a fine powder I feel the cotton candy would have turned out closer to what is industrially made.", "comment_date": "2022-09-07T03:24:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ambush", "comment_text": "This mans class is probably just science in his whole school when he was younger..", "comment_date": "2022-09-07T00:41:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sax", "comment_text": "Turning grenade into lemonade", "comment_date": "2022-09-06T10:03:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ArvinRoido Atienza", "comment_text": "Thanks, Nilered.

Then it will become white and after that the crystalesetion comes from vacuum that comepletely dry out the water in the sugar. The vacuum is also better then overly airdry it, because it does not add heat into the sugar, which can in worst case make it burn. Sugar melt at 160 degrees (or to be exact: 162 degrees Celsius = 323.6 degrees Fahrenheit) if you turn it up just a bit more, it will burn, because sugar is very sensitive to heat as well as cold air or liquid. when you are done, crush the sugar before porring it into the candyfloss mashine. And the main reason for the wierd outcome is deffently the lack of extract of molasses. Molasses is a bit gooey colorfull and watery. I think it most deffently react posetively to high pressure vacuum.

Nile red stains intracellular lipid droplets yellow. In most polar solvents, Nile red will not fluoresce; however, when in a lipid-rich environment, it can be intensely fluorescent, with varying colours from deep red (for polar membrane lipid) to strong yellow-gold emission (for neutral lipid in intracellular storages). The dye is highly solvatochromic and its emission and excitation wavelength both shift depending on solvent polarity[1] and in polar media will hardly fluoresce at all.[2]\r<br>\r<br>Nile red has applications in cell biology, where it can be used as a membrane dye which can be readily visualized using an epifluorescence microscope with excitation and emission wavelengths usually shared with red fluorescent protein. Nile red has also been used as part of a sensitive detection process for microplastics in bottled water.[3][4] Additionally, nile red is a remarkable candidator in fabricating membrane for different sensors to detect environmental changes, such as taste, gas, pH, etc.[5]\r<br>\r<br>In triglycerides (a neutral lipid), Nile red has an excitation maximum of about 515 nm (green), and emission maximum of about 585 nm (yellow-orange).[6] In contrast, in phospholipids (polar lipids), Nile red has an excitation maximum of about 554 nm (green), and an emission maximum of about 638 nm (red).[7]\r<br>\r<br>Synthesis\r<br>Nile red can be prepared through acid hydrolysis by boiling a solution of Nile blue with sulfuric acid.[8] This process replaces an iminium group with a carbonyl group. Alternatively, Nile red and its analogs (naphthooxazine dyes) can be prepared by acid-catalyzed condensation of corresponding 5-(dialkylamino)-2-nitrosophenols with 2-naphthol. The yields are generally moderate as no co-oxidant is used in this procedure.[9] Since the reaction to generate Nile red does not usually completely exhaust the supply of Nile blue, additional separation steps are required if pure Nile red is needed.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Not really related but well...", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T14:18:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uyhn26", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuFizITMdA&amp;t=27m34s\">27:34</a> The candy monster turned around and looked affirmative.", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T13:54:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PennytheFox", "comment_text": "Anyone have been screaming at the screen for him to filter the cottonwateracid mixture since the dissolving of the cotton balls?", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T13:14:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WOLF Games and Animations", "comment_text": "Hey, dirty sugar water is not better than jaclsepticeye\u2019s dirty bean water", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T12:42:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BillBustum", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuFizITMdA&amp;t=3m40s\">3:40</a> What is this article??", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T12:14:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leon K", "comment_text": "Hey  nile, i got an idea.<br>How about you diy some easily but effective nootropics pill, based on whats on the market, and then try it on yourself and see how it works", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T11:27:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jay Zuma", "comment_text": "Bro my shirt is part sugar \ud83d\ude46", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T11:26:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aizawa Sensei", "comment_text": "I only saw two videos from this channel <br>But I am so subscribing!", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T11:18:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "uwu boy patrick", "comment_text": "This is like something you have to figure out in a death game", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T11:13:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tommy Vercity", "comment_text": "bro why no new video???", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T11:05:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SynopticOutlander", "comment_text": "If life gives you lemons, and ONLY lemons- can you make lemonade?", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T10:57:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nara Sherko", "comment_text": "Make a medicine that stops aging!", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T10:30:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dylan Campbell", "comment_text": "This was one of the coolest things I have ever seen...<br><br>You&#39;re wondering if that was a success?

It gets downright depressing when things don\u2019t work, and your boss chews you out. Anyway, watching these videos keeps me motivated because it goes to show that theres always a solution when you need it. Hell, you literally turned cotton balls into cotton candy.

The definition of metal<br>I have noticed in recent times there is a meme floating around in our astro community. It is something like:<br>&quot;Astronomers after classifying every element other than hydrogen and helium as metal:<br>You know, I&#39;m something of a chemist myself&quot;<br>This is so true. This is because most of us usually focus on stars. And stars are mostly made of hydrogen. And stars make up most of galaxies. We sometimes measure the metallicity of stars, i.e, how much &quot;metal&quot; there is in a star. Everything other than hydrogen and helium falls in the category of &quot;metal. Boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, etc are all metals. This is because we need to know how heavy the element is. Any other property of the element doesn&#39;t matter. The heavier elements are metals. People who do these are called astrochemists. And yes, it&#39;s true that planetary astronomers know more about chemistry. <br><br> 2.  Dust meaning<br>In optical astronomy, sometimes people complain about &quot;dust&quot; ruining their observations. Some of them may talk about the atmospheric dust (dust in our atmosphere). But in this case, some may talk about &quot;dust&quot; around the thing they are observing. Let&#39;s take a star for an example. When they see some light being blocked by something inconsistently, they assume it is dust. Usually they can be made from basically anything. Hydrogen and helium to acetic acid and benzene. They would all be considered dust. This is because none of the elements properties matter except for the fact that they block light from the star. <br><br> 3. What is &quot;H two&quot;<br>I remember long ago when my professor asked me &quot;what do stars need to survive?&quot; I said &quot;H two&quot;. She said &quot;no it&#39;s not correct&quot;. I was like &quot;no it&#39;s totally correct. If this is wrong then my whole life was a lie.&quot; After a short argument I said &quot;no. Stars need molecular hydrogen to survive.&quot; She said &quot;yes, that is correct. But why did you say H two at first? I thought you were talking about ionised hydrogen&quot; This is when I learned in chemistry H2 is molecular hydrogen (that&#39;s why I said H two) and in astronomy H(II) is ionised hydrogen (that&#39;s what she thought I said).<br><br>Yes. We&#39;re pretty bad at chemistry. But this does not mean we hate chemistry. We love chemistry. Whenever we see a new phenomenon, and can&#39;t explain it with astrophysics, we want to explain it with chemistry before anything else.", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T05:31:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChocSock", "comment_text": "instructions unclear, cookie monster drank all my doctor pepper", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T05:31:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shawn Rupe", "comment_text": "You mentioned having to take down videos, why is that?", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T04:42:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daxyzeus", "comment_text": "next video: HOW TO MAKE METHAMPHETAMINE.", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T04:36:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sammy", "comment_text": "acid: deadly nilered: i make cotton candy out of it me: am i gonna die if i eat it?", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T04:21:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sammy", "comment_text": "WAIT DID I JUST HERE THAT ICE IS HOT?", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T04:18:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "quirkyedgy", "comment_text": "dope shirt", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T03:59:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brody Huntley", "comment_text": "How do you do a chemical cleanup?", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T02:35:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VIRAT FAN CLUB", "comment_text": "Sir i am from india please teach me chemistry i will love to study by you", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T01:47:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Candy_cat111", "comment_text": "wow u turned that into that tf-", "comment_date": "2021-11-24T00:46:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DogeyPlays", "comment_text": "Next video: turning rocket fuel into an energy drink", "comment_date": "2021-11-23T22:18:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "lIlIlIlI", "comment_text": "You should turn peanut butter into dish soap.

Alternatively, you could use maltase to break the maltose down into glucose for use with other glucose-requiring projects.<br><br>Theoretically you could then use part of the glucose you made to regenerate alcohol by fermentation, which you could use in the amylose extraction above.

Always interesting and usually fun, too. Your problem here is a fundamental error in your use of language. Glucose isn\u2019t sugar (sucrose, or table sugar). Sugar is a mixture of glucose and fructose (about 50/50). Glucose is a saccharide. (In its powdered form glucose is dextrose). Fructose is a saccharide. (Maltose, lactose, galactose, among others are all saccharides.) Glucose has a \u201csweetness\u201d way, way less than fructose. Glucose is the saccharide that comes out of corn. 100% corn syrup is 100% glucose. (Pure corn syrup is very hard to find now. Karo syrup used to be pure glucose.) High fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is simply pure corn syrup (glucose) that has been chemically snd mechanically altered to have anywhere from 40% to 75% fructose. The relative percentages between glucose and fructose depends on the intended use of the HFCS. <br>What you needed to do to make the glucose (it\u2019s not sugar, remember) you \u201cdistilled\u201d from the cotton balls into cotton candy was add fructose sufficient to get table sugar (sucrose)  or convert come of the glucose into fructose the way corn syrup producers convert glucose into sucrose. I believe sucrose as it it found in a bag of C&amp;H sugar, for instance, is 45% glucose and 55% fructose, although those numbers may be backwards. It\u2019s been a decade or so since I read this stuff. <br>Also, to make carnival quality cotton candy you need a little red food coloring. Cotton candy does have a slight caramelized taste from the heat used but it is very slight.

Because I have a little problem with certain supplemental products from 3 different companies. According to the Chemist &amp; writer Raymond Francis, this L Ascorbic acid Vitamin C is the only Vitamin C found in natural food and so human body would take it in well. So, I decided to buy his company&#39;s Vitamin C and it is very expensive. Therefore I researched if there are any other company sell this L Ascorbic acid. and I found 2 companies. One is made in China and the other is Czech Republic. \r<br>However, I found each one has different sourness in taste and the way they react to the water, and I started to have doubt if any of them are claiming false.

Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br><br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. It&#39;s not about following the law - perfectly, as it&#39;s impossible - it&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can&#39;t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. <br><br>NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. Regardless of what you&#39;ve done or what you&#39;re going through you CAN make it through Jesus. <br><br>If you have any questions let me know x", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T11:36:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kaazumi", "comment_text": "My shirt kinda tasty", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T11:34:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Namelss", "comment_text": "Lets sell it mate", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T11:31:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Templar", "comment_text": "&quot;it&#39;s not piss, I swear&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-09-10T11:28:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eron's Entertainment Store", "comment_text": "Fun Fact....

paper. It&#39;s the case with all alcohol. That&#39;s why all alcohol is made with fruits and/or grains. It&#39;s the fermentation of the sugar that does it. You can actually make alcohol out of plain sugar water if you want. Adding celulose is a complex sugar which breaks down into a kind of alcohol eupheisticly called &quot;wood alcohol. It&#39;s an alcohol which, if you drink it, will put you blind, and quite possibly kill you. That&#39;s also the alcohol which, after a great deal more processing, they mix with gasoline to make gasohol, which is a renewable, though not very clean or efficient fuel mixture which the American corn lobby has fooled a lot of Americans into thinking is a clean alternative to more standard unleaded gasoline mixtures. <br><br>The guy&#39;s kidneys: &quot;Noooooooooooo!!!&quot;<br>Some of his now damaged cells: We&#39;re going to silently and painlessly attack your pancreas, and also replicate, and by the time you&#39;re in you&#39;re in your mid-40&#39;s we&#39;re going be multiplying out of control and will be forming cancerous tumors throughout your entire body! Bio-chemistry is fun!&quot;<br><br>Kids, whatever you do, don&#39;t do this. The results, if you are lucky and very careful, will not be immediate, but will drastically shorten your life and will send you to your ancestors accompanied by lots of pain. Lots of Pain isn&#39;t something you want to hang with. You take Tylenol, Advil, and their generic forms to get rid of tiny amounts of pain. You take opioids to get rid of moderate amounts of pain. You take huge amounts of synthetic opioids when the usual addictive opioids no longer work, and those don&#39;t really get rid of the pain. It just makes it so that you no longer care about the physical pain. In fact you don&#39;t care about anything anymore; not even things that used to be fun, so you end up substituting mental pain for physical pain, which you still have, but just don&#39;t care about. You have no choice but to care about the mental pain, and at that point it&#39;s too late to do anything about it because you&#39;re only days or weeks away from seeing the heaven gates. Imagine falling into a vat of the most foul smelling, stomach churning, sticky-ass puss. You won&#39;t care about that either. Your friends won&#39;t want to see you, but no problem!

The smaller you make it, the more surface area you open up to be acted upon by whatever agent you are using. From using a grinder, mortar and pestle, or even a ball mill you can take it smaller and smaller until you have such a fine powder that it&#39;s like talc. At that point there&#39;s hundreds of times the surface area exposed to your reactant compared to leaving it whole. It&#39;ll make the process far easier as it doesn&#39;t have to break the bonds that make up the strands, it just has to act on the material itself.<br>Most people use activated carbon to clean aquarium water. Sugar needs nucleation sites to make crystals, often you use a seed crystal to start the process. Take a cup of sugar and add it to a half cup of water, heat it up and then let it cool off. It&#39;ll harden but there won&#39;t really be any crystals. Now do the same thing but drop in a single piece of table sugar and watch as crystals start forming off of it. It&#39;s an elementary school level science project. <br>The thing about cotton candy machines is they are made for fine crystal table sugar not huge chunks.

save what u dont need for future projects and then focus on adding in whatever is needed and making it pure while giving stuff a ton more time just so it works. i honestly believe that it can be possible to get a pure version of every single component in the world down to the last atom taken out if theres enough persistance.<br><br>and now i think on it a little bit, a ton of components actually need to be heated up which can reduce other components to the point where u have nothing of one component left so id say for something to be pure, itd have to be done in a way where even breaking down every day objects or constantly getting items with the components in them to break will eventually get u 1 or 2 completely 100% pure components within something to store it however at least 99% of other components will never be able to be 100% pure. <br><br>to me, the way people define say carbon as being pure. it means its 100% just carbon stored in something with not even an atom of any other component in it. then if possible make a pure version of solid liquid and gas of that pure carbon. well technically u can never get a pure liquid as it always contains water in it which is obviously h20 and thats 3 components in of its self. so a pure liquid isnt possible a solid can be and a gas has a possibility of it being completely pure. how this would be done though is for NielRed to figure out.<br><br>in a simple conclusion to this all, i just think itd be cool if we can just use a never ending supply of the components. we have some very scientific name for a component. it can be reused for something useful. it evaporates and turns into gas. find a way to collect it or something and use it to benefit us. obviously we dont have a complete endless supply but we do have a near endless. until its possible to extract matter components from space, we will never have an endless supply till then. our atmosphere realeses some of these in gases and we cant yet extract it back so yeah. id even say then if and when we manage to weve by technicallity become gods as we can control all matter in space and time. to manipulate it on the spot is another thing.

When I was in pastry school, one of the labs I did was to assemble a croquembouche (cream puffs stacked in the shape of a tree with caramelized sugar holding it together, garnished with a spun cage of caramelized sugar). The class was in the middle of the summer and I had assembled part of it one day, and put it away to finish the next day. When I got there the next day, the caramel had soaked up a ton of moisture from the air, liquifying my caramel ruining the whole thing, forcing me to start again.

People will not realize how complicated you were trying to do, since it is the same process that is used in bioreactors to make bioethanol, which involves many processes with microorganisms.<br>\r<br>At first I thought which route you were going to choose, chemical or biological. When I saw that you tried the biological route first, I was happy and worried, because although you are a fantastic chemist, biochemistry differs a lot from traditional chemistry. Cellulases are a group of proteins that break one of the most complicated bonds, \u03b2 (1 \u2192 4) of cellulose, whose function is in fact to chemical and mechanical resistance, and that very few organisms generate, most bacteria. To completely break down cellulose into glucose, several types of cellulases would be required. Also, you have to remember that enzymatic catalysts differ from inorganic ones in that they act at a certain temperature and pH, that is why the first test did not work. In addition, cotton is not only composed of cellulose, it also has proteins and other compounds that make it resistant to the action of enzymes. In biochemistry we usually take previous steps to separate cellulose from the rest of the compounds.<br>Then I saw that you finally opted for acid hydrolysis. It is a way that generates more by-products and requires more steps to purify, but without a doubt simpler and that as a chemist you master much <a href=\"http://better.it/\">better.It</a> is very likely that the efficiency was low for two reasons: first because cotton is not cellulose. As I said it also has proteins and other compounds, and you may have calculated that there was more cellulose in total. Second, because, as I have said before, by acid hydrolysis, various by-products are obtained, such as small chains of sugars, or acid sugars that have a charge and that possibly the ionic exchange resin has trapped. Anyway it went well. As a tip, if you want to try next time you can use lugol to see if there are many traces of polysaccharides left. The lugol changes color with complex sugars but not with simple ones, so if it changes color you could check if there are still branched sugars from the cellulose without hydrolyzing.<br>The result has been good and this together with the video of the transparent wood are one of my favorite videos. Every time I see one of your videos it fascinates me because as a biologist I have basic knowledge of chemistry but it seems super complex as well as beautiful all the processes you do. And with these that involve biochemistry that I do understand is like seeing things from a totally new point of view.

There can be no moisture while doing this reaction). Let it sit for 24 hours. The byproduct glycerine will sit at the bottom. Carefully pour the top level of the biodiesel ( esterified oil) off the glycerine byproduct without getting the glycerine with the oil into another bottle. Next step is to add a little distilled water in the separated biodiesel and cap it. Rotate the bottle a few times ( don&#39;t shake) to separate the residual soap it produced during the reaction.

Is the acid just too dilute compared to the amount of water already there to prefer creating more water molecules? does the sulfuric acid prefer the cellulose to glucose?

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019 .", "comment_date": "2021-09-06T02:43:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mhkazofficial", "comment_text": "&quot;Making dabs from cotton balls&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-09-06T02:41:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cryo Gami", "comment_text": "I have basically NO scientific intellect, but I love watching these videos.

You simply failed to do that and hence you ended up with a product more akin to brown sugar. Not the white powder stuff.<br>Cotton ball mollasses would be another story in itself. But I digress. You needed to spin your original product in a centrifuge to separate out the heavier mollasses (which you did not do - your filtering isn&#39;t going to catch all the minerals in mollasses) <b>THEN</b> use the food dryer and produce a product akin to window glass that <b>is</b> sugar.<br>Also, start with more cotton balls.

Where they are putting cyanide in apple, cherry, or peach pie and the main protagonist usually a detective or bounty hunter about to eat a slice but smelling the cyanide in the pie. i was wondering if putting cyanide in pie somehow changes the scent of the dessert.

I assume the difference is that the sugar cup on mine might be a little bit taller and might not require you to break up the hard candy, such as Jolly Ranchers or Butterscotch.<br><br>The sounds you heard while your machine spun around were likely due to an imbalance of weight. I&#39;ve noticed that placing two jolly ranchers in my machine (what the directions suggest), if they aren&#39;t almost exactly across from one another, the machine makes a loud noise as it spins, the weight imbalance causing the shaking. However, if I manage to get the candy to be even, it runs smoothly! <br><br>In addition, what you made was akin to Easter Grass or Fiberglass candy, and that happens when the machine isn&#39;t hot enough!

This is actually the easiest to fix! the chunks of glucose just n33d to be broken into finer crystals: it doesn&#39;t completely fix the issue but allows those individual crystals to be more evenly exposed to the heat and melt much easier and more consistently, so more air can be worked into the base and it will stay soft.<br>2- it looked like your sugar was cooked a bit too long here, which is fine for chewy candies like a taffy or soft caramel but can completely ruin a cotten candy base. It takes a lot of practice to learn what exact color your cooked sugar should be, and that method may not even work here because the sugar is already an off-brown, so drop testing would probably work best. (For those that don&#39;t know, drop testing candy basically means dropping a small amount of the still hot candy into ice water to s33 what texture the candy will be when cooled. I&#39;m guessing Mr. Nilered&#39;s candy was at the &quot;drop tail&quot; stage, when he n33ded it to be at the &quot;hard ball&quot; stage.)<br>3- there may have b33n too much moisture in your lab for the candy to aerate properly. It&#39;s the hardest thing to control, and the most likely to ruin a batch of spun candy. the only real thing you can do to manage this is wait for a low humidity, mid temperature day and try again.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:57:03Z", "likes_count": 45}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin Wood", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuFizITMdA&amp;t=27m35s\">27:35</a> NileRed pog", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:56:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Qwertydex", "comment_text": "i got an advertisement for an Agilent 6470B Liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry machine right when you said you were about to taste it to confirm it being sugar...", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:56:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ajitkumar Pandit", "comment_text": "Finally A Video!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude0a\u263a\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:56:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mololongo The Sequel", "comment_text": "Please make a video with fluoroantimonic acid", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:56:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Parr", "comment_text": "you need to grind the sugar in the small grains", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:55:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nisarg Bhavsar", "comment_text": "You know you have made it as  a science youtuber when the government tries to intervene in your shippings.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:54:54Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "TheNeoCubest 869", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuFizITMdA&amp;t=23m00s\">23:00</a> any comments about my haircut would be banned LOL", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:54:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zippy", "comment_text": "Can you make cotton from sugar?", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:54:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nothing", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHuFizITMdA&amp;t=19m00s\">19:00</a> Am I seeing faces?", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:53:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "XenomiteGD", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t wait till he turn a straw into a candy straw", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T03:53:23Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tom Xia", "comment_text": "wait its all sugar?...
