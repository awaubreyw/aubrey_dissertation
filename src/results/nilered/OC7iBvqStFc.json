So I tried this at home, but during the first distillation step, where the water is driven off, my solution turned bright orange! Any idea why this might be happening, and what is happening? Cheers.<br>Update: When I tried to pour the orange liquid into a bottle, it immediately crashed out of solution and turned into an pale orange solid slushy... When more H20 was added it dissolved again and became a yellow liquid.", "comment_date": "2021-03-12T00:28:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yanziNie", "comment_text": "Can you use hydrobromic acid to make bromine?", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T14:51:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dizzydude", "comment_text": "ahh yes.
