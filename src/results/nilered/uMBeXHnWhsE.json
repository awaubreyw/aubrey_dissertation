They had two other major types of grease. One was called poly-urea and the other contained a large proportion of bentonite and was called aeroshell. There were dozens of different additives like these weird plastic goos, metals like molybdenum or aluminum, pigments,  graphite, and once I used a large amount of acetic acid which I thought was odd. It was added after the lithium had already been pressure contacted with the solid castor oil and some thinning oil, like a bituminous oil or something like that. We used some oil that smelled really off. Every couple of weeks the whole place would smell like a Chinese restaurant and jalapenos. I swear we got recycled oil from restaurants or something. That place was so huge, but it&#39;s gone now, up in smoke.", "comment_date": "2022-09-09T06:36:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Courtneidge", "comment_text": "A very nice video, thank-you!", "comment_date": "2022-09-07T21:50:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nic Wyatt", "comment_text": "Just wait until America finds out there&#39;s oil in soap.", "comment_date": "2022-09-06T15:11:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Galactic canny man 47", "comment_text": "I used to be addicted to soap now I&#39;m clean", "comment_date": "2022-09-06T15:11:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hobodarkness", "comment_text": "What if you add potassium carbonate to cement?

I work with hundreds of gallons of the stuff everyday (in a 50% concentration in water), and what you said about washing is off right away making everything fine... is 100% correct.  I tell my guys the same thing; that if they <i>think</i> they might have splashed a little on their skin to just drop what they&#39;re doing and go rinse it off and they will be fine.  It <i>does</i> take a little while for it to start eating through the outer, dead layers of your skin.  And if it is dry, then it just can&#39;t eat into you.  <i>HOWEVER,</i> the bigger problem we have is when we have a small leak and dries on something in a thin layer, and then someone touches it with bare skin.  Then an hour later, they get sweaty or wet but not enough to rinse it off, and <i>then</i> it will get activated and start eating at them.  This is why that whole part of the plant is strictly &quot;gloves always.&quot;  It&#39;s too easy to touch it while it&#39;s dry, forget about it, and then get sweaty or <i>touch your eyes</i> and wind up getting awful chemical burns.<br><br>This is also why in fight club we see Tyler Durden slowly lick his lips to give Edward Norton a big, sloppy, wet kiss on his hand before dumping the lye on him (It&#39;s unclear if he&#39;s using NaOH or KOH lye, since in soap making can use either, but they should act about the same).  While the lye started acting on his skin way too quickly to be realistic, I do think that if you poured straight, undiluted caustic soda onto <i>wet</i> skin and then sat there and didn&#39;t wash it off, it could <i>absolutely</i> do some really nasty damage to your skin like that.  It burns, but it starts slow and sneaks up on you several minutes later.  I don&#39;t know about it puffing up like in the movie, that always looked more to me like keloid formation than any sort of chemical burn, and IME caustic soda doesn&#39;t really make your skin puff up like a pork rind.  But I have seen and taken photos of people (for examples for my safety training) who have had some pretty horrible chemical burns from the stuff, and it&#39;s basically always from <i>trying to ignore it instead of just rinsing it off immediately.</i>  Luckily, I haven&#39;t had to deal with anyone who had anything that caused any serious or long-term disfigurement or blindness or anything like that, but once you start to feel that burn you have already started to cause damage and it needs to be cleaned immediately (and I stress this all the time.  I would much rather have something be done 5 minutes late because they stopped to go rinse off caustic they touched with a ripped glove than have them in pain and potentially scarred!).  But there are loads of photos online of people who have gotten some horrific burns from lye.<br><br>My point is, telling people that sodium hydroxide is safe to handle with bare hands is <i>not</i> responsible advice to give out.  You likely washed your hands before that lye was able to get wetted and start doing its thing.  It can absolutely fuck up your day or even your life if you get it in your eyes or it disfigures you.  You don&#39;t need to be terrified of it, as it&#39;s not going to jump out of the glass and attack you with a knife, but downplaying it that much is a bit too far.  I also notice that you seem to be handling an almost pelletized form of it, which is <i>probably</i> safer, because it&#39;s not going to stick to dry skin.  But if you are working with it dissolved in a liquid or a powdered form that <i>can</i> actually stick to dry skin, then I absolutey guarantee you that it will not be nearly so kind to bare skin.  I am speaking from personal experience as well as from experience training people to work with it for a couple of years, now.<br><br>One other thing, though, that is realistic from that scene in Fight Club?  Vinegar.  We absolutely use Vinegar to neutralize NaOH spills so we can then either mop the smaller ones up or run the larger ones over with our floor sweeper to clean up!  It&#39;s cheap, fairly safe, and while the smell is certainly strong, it&#39;s at least a &quot;clean-smelling&quot; kind of strong (and it goes away pretty quickly if you air out the area).", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T03:34:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Horst von Hinten", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMBeXHnWhsE&amp;t=00h21m03s\">00:21:03</a>", "comment_date": "2021-09-25T19:01:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jon", "comment_text": "I&#39;m watching this just in case I get transmigrated into a fantasy world and need to get rich", "comment_date": "2021-09-25T01:54:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swish", "comment_text": "this is not butter", "comment_date": "2021-09-24T19:04:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "e", "comment_text": "i eat soap", "comment_date": "2021-09-24T00:51:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Andrews", "comment_text": "Why do i suddenly have the urge to start a fightclub?", "comment_date": "2021-09-24T00:21:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kolby claxton", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMBeXHnWhsE&amp;t=0m26s\">0:26</a> <br>Davie504: interesting", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T14:26:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bagya Lakshmi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMBeXHnWhsE&amp;t=7m57s\">7:57</a>  - touches sodium hydroxide solution<br><br> and tells that he washed it and there was no irritation after<br><br><br><br> also him at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMBeXHnWhsE&amp;t=8m01s\">8:01</a> - anyway(wears gloves )<br><br><br>SSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T12:04:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "What What", "comment_text": "The clean up would be the cleanest clean up", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T01:34:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travis Yelland", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t you add blue food coloring too the yellow base mix to get a green minty color?", "comment_date": "2021-09-22T20:53:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SnickleFritzMcJame", "comment_text": "BASED", "comment_date": "2021-09-22T20:40:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdi", "comment_text": "So this is where Senku found out how to make Dr Stone...", "comment_date": "2021-09-22T10:12:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Capital A", "comment_text": "is this solar sands", "comment_date": "2021-09-21T23:25:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soap", "comment_text": "So thats how I came to be", "comment_date": "2021-09-21T16:26:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Multimotion", "comment_text": "Just don&#39;t drop it", "comment_date": "2021-09-21T10:41:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "antichurch", "comment_text": "I just found your channel and subscribed.. you are amazing kid.

Your skin is actually pretty acidic sitting around 4.5 to 5.5 so when you introduce an alkaline on a regular it has the potential to disrupt the skins hydro-lipid barrier. Since these soaps are so basic there are no pH adjusters in them to lower the pH so these types of soaps can cause disruptions in the hydro-lipid barrier which can lead to bad sensitivities, redness, rashes. acne, infections etc basically your shield against the world has been stripped away.<br><br>Adding things like Cinnamon and Lavender just makes it worse as well because both are known irritants so not only does the soap potentially disrupt barrier function it might cause even more irritation.

Use it only with gloves and to clean objects. For handsoap you should get at least 8-25% superfat so it doesn&#39;t damage your skin that would be a max of 78g NaOH fot this batch, use a diamond scale for the NaOH so you get it exact!!! Very important<br>3. this soap will not get much bubbles when washing because of the high amount of olive oil - so use a better recipe for the oils regarding their qualities <br>4. DO NOT TOUCH THE FRICKING NaOH!!!!!! WEAR GLOVES AND GLASSES!!!! As soon as it gets to the air it will suck in water and that will produce horrible skinburn<br>5. slowly give the NaOH to the water, it may start boiling if put in too fast -&gt; lye everywhere, maybe in your eyes!<br>6. do this in a well ventilated area, the fumes are not good for your lungs<br>7. when adding the lye look for the oils and lye to have the same temperature<br>8. this soap will at least need half a year to be okay to use - before it just will produce slime between your hands<br>9. essential cinnamon oil is irritating to the skin and mucosa, you should not use it in soap<br>10. 3% to weight essential oil is commonly used<br>11. food coloring will not hold it&#39;s color - use specially made pigments for coloring so you won&#39;t be disappointed later<br>12. Menhol is also irritating for the skin - especially in this concentration<br>13. use a spatula when scraping the soap out of the container - it will make things way more easy<br>14. when taking the soap out of the moulds it is not safe for the skin -&gt; use gloves!<br>15. when you see the mould sticking onto the soap - let it sit for a while longer or freeze it - let it thaw after that for 5 minutes - &gt; they will come out way better<br>16. don&#39;t just wait 4-6 weeks, the soap may be safe then, but not pretty good. it will wash away fast and you will be using more than needed. let them dry out at least three months in a cool, dark, well ventilated area<br>17. put them on a wood rack or cooling rack the guarantee the air ventilation - so you won&#39;t have to flip it and it can breathe thoroughly", "comment_date": "2020-01-07T21:38:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lurgutre Nalpak", "comment_text": "I thought he was making soup and got excited", "comment_date": "2020-01-07T20:50:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WhyDidYouWin?", "comment_text": "Like the channel pray you would come too Christ as Lord and saviour and then turn from sin.", "comment_date": "2020-01-07T20:09:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sakeenah Myers", "comment_text": "so I guess lye is not necessary, that&#39;s good", "comment_date": "2020-01-07T15:43:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dein VAdda", "comment_text": "Hmm my soap does not start thinkining up!

Anyway, if you still want to include music, I create very atmospheric electronic music and I&#39;ve always thought electronic one to be quite sciency (if done properly).

If the water boils it changes the structure into something else. Holding it at this temperature for an hour or three and then cooling it off as slowly as possible will yield micelles that are shaped a little differently and arranged in more of a planar shape. I accomplished this by adding the NaOH to water and pouring it in hot. That&#39;s my method at least. In the book &quot;Scientific Soap Making: The Chemistry of the Cold Process&quot; by Kevin Dunn, he dedicates a whole chapter on the topic and has some nifty pictures to explain it. I loaned my copy out and it hasn&#39;t returned so I can&#39;t quote him.<br><br>The technical definition is neat soap is a lamellar structure containing much soap and little water. <br><br>It was my favorite part of soap making when I got to use calculus to find the optimal mix of oils and then more calculus to figure out how much NaOH and water to use to keep the thermals under control.
