If you have a large family, 300 liters isn&#39;t that much pee. Lets say there&#39;s about 1 liter per person per day, now multiply that times lets say 5 people, that&#39;s already 5~ liters per day, now lets average out the months in a year so there&#39;s 30 days a month (to account for Februarys 28-29 days) now that&#39;s 5*30=150 liters a month. In two months you&#39;d already have 300~ liters. Now if you want to go full reclaimer mode, you multiply the 150*12, giving you 1800~ liters a year, and since most of it is water it can be reclaimed and used as non potable water for agriculture, washing, or cleaning use. Basically this process is really only viable (and even then its not very viable) if you absolutely need to reclaim the water and the useful products still left in the pee, like if you were on a spaceship or a Lunar/Martian colony. But you&#39;d probably not use this method and probably a different one that has a more efficient way to separate the different compounds more economically.", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T01:22:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Loughrey", "comment_text": "ugh supercooled pee.", "comment_date": "2022-09-01T01:11:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicholas Babin", "comment_text": "I work at an Ammonia and Urea plant.

How would they have known how they were supposed to live? How would they have known how they were supposed to be in order to please their Creator? So God gave the law of Moses back then. This law was for the people to know how to be. They saw what God expected out of them. God had high expectations from the Israelites. Why shouldn&#39;t He? Should He drop His expectations for love and grace? If He drops His expectations to accommodate what man wants, then He compromised His perfection for man\u2019s imperfection. Does a Perfect God compromise His perfection?<br>So God has expectations once He tells His creation how He wants things. His love and grace gives His creation time to change. He is willing to help them change if they ask Him. Then His creation, while repenting or changing to do His will, see His Beauty. This is a relationship formed now with the Creator. If He is the Most Beautiful Being, which He is, how can His creation not want to obey Him? How can His creation not want to please Him? The reason why is<br>because of foolishness. Man loves his own foolishness rather than God\u2019s wisdom, Jn <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfldS5hqWYA&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a>. Man loves his sin. If anyone loves himself, he will stay in sin. So man who stays in sin rejects his perfect Creator or Father, and exchanges it for his own foolishness.<br>So now fast forward to today where we have God\u2019s True Book. We officially know what God wants. God gave His creation a big help, the Word, to show us how He wants us to live. If we follow His perfect teachings, we all live with perfect peace, love, joy and unity. This is His perfect design for His children&#39;s lives. When we go against His perfect design for what we want, sin, we throw away that perfect plan. We throw away that perfect peace, love, joy and unity. Giving up these things is foolish. So sinning against God proves to be the worst plan for us!<br>God wanted to help mankind. God wanted to save man from his foolishness. He wanted to help us the best way possible because He is Good. The best and only way to do it, as God saw fit, was to give mankind His Son. Why? The Son is the Word, Jn 1:1. The Word always obeys the Father&#39;s will. The Father&#39;s will is spoken through His Word. The Word proceeds forth from the Father&#39;s will and mind. So the Word that God speaks is the pure sequel to what was inside the Father&#39;s mind and heart. Jesus is that perfection manifest. He is the physical embodiment of God&#39;s will and thought. God&#39;s will and thought is expressed through His Word. Jesus, the human part, is the perfect, physical expression of God. Jesus, the human part that walked this earth, came to teach us the perfect will of God. How? He did this by example. This is why Jesus walked this earth perfectly without sinning.<br>So Jesus taught us perfectly. He even was willing to die not only death, but the death He did not deserve since He never sinned against God the Father. He chose to give His life. That&#39;s why Jesus says no man forces Him to lay down His life, He chose to lay it down, Jn <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfldS5hqWYA&amp;t=10m18s\">10:18</a>. God wanted to save mankind. Jesus wants what the Father wants. The<br> Word always obeys the will. He shed even His perfect, pure blood for us. His blood is the fulfillment of perfect obedience to the Father. Why? Because the Son asked 3 times in the Garden, &quot;Take my cup not by my will but by yours.&quot; The Father said the Son still had to shed His blood on the cross. The Son obeyed the Father&#39;s will over His own. So the blood was shed for that purpose. Nobody else had that kind of blood. Nobody else pleased the Father perfectly like the Son. So now instead of the law of Moses showing us the way to live rightly in God&#39;s eyes, we have the Son. This is the New Covenant. In Jesus and His blood, we now obey Him instead of the Mosaic law as part of this new agreement between man and God. So as man wants to live rightly to please His Creator, man now must turn to the Word of the Creator. So obeying the perfect teachings of Jesus brings us to how God wants us to live.<br>The Son conquered the grave. The grave is the end of all who sin. The grave is the payment for sin. Satan founded the grave. How? Because Satan started death by being the first to sin against Almighty God. Jesus destroyed Satan&#39;s creation and fulfills the very first prophecy spoken of the Savior in Genesis 3:15. That&#39;s why Jesus came to &quot;...destroy the works of the devil,&quot; 1 Jn 3:8. Satan came to ruin God&#39;s Creation with sin. Jesus came to ruin Satan&#39;s creation, death, with perfect obedience, which His blood shed proves. That&#39;s why in His blood, there is life. So the Gospel is God&#39;s reconciliation with man. How? Only through the Son. If you disobey the Son, you disobey the Father. Jesus says, \u201cHe who has seen me has seen the Father,\u201d Jn 14:9. Repent and accept Jesus as Your Lord NOW!!! Then start to read the Gospels and obey His commands. Follow Jesus only, no other man, no religion. Only Jesus. Imagine how people were 5,000 years ago without God\u2019s True Book. How would they have known how they were supposed to live? How would they have known how they were supposed to be in order to please their Creator? So God gave the law of Moses back then. This law was for the people to know how to be.

He even was willing to die not only death, but the death He did not deserve since He never sinned against God the Father. He chose to give His life. That&#39;s why Jesus says no man forces Him to lay down His life, He chose to lay it down, Jn <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfldS5hqWYA&amp;t=10m18s\">10:18</a>. God wanted to save mankind. Jesus wants what the Father wants. The<br> Word always obeys the will. He shed even His perfect, pure blood for us. His blood is the fulfillment of perfect obedience to the Father. Why? Because the Son asked 3 times in the Garden, &quot;Take my cup not by my will but by yours.&quot; The Father said the Son still had to shed His blood on the cross. The Son obeyed the Father&#39;s will over His own. So the blood was shed for that purpose. Nobody else had that kind of blood. Nobody else pleased the Father perfectly like the Son. So now instead of the law of Moses showing us the way to live rightly in God&#39;s eyes, we have the Son. This is the New Covenant. In Jesus and His blood, we now obey Him instead of the Mosaic law as part of this new agreement between man and God. So as man wants to live rightly to please His Creator, man now must turn to the Word of the Creator. So obeying the perfect teachings of Jesus brings us to how God wants us to live.<br>The Son conquered the grave. The grave is the end of all who sin. The grave is the payment for sin. Satan founded the grave. How? Because Satan started death by being the first to sin against Almighty God. Jesus destroyed Satan&#39;s creation and fulfills the very first prophecy spoken of the Savior in Genesis 3:15. That&#39;s why Jesus came to &quot;...destroy the works of the devil,&quot; 1 Jn 3:8. Satan came to ruin God&#39;s Creation with sin. Jesus came to ruin Satan&#39;s creation, death, with perfect obedience, which His blood shed proves. That&#39;s why in His blood, there is life. So the Gospel is God&#39;s reconciliation with man. How? Only through the Son. If you disobey the Son, you disobey the Father. Jesus says, \u201cHe who has seen me has seen the Father,\u201d Jn 14:9. Repent and accept Jesus as Your Lord NOW!!! Then start to read the Gospels and obey His commands. Follow Jesus only, no other man, no religion. Only Jesus.

Jesus died that we could be saved. He is actually the only way to get to Heaven. If we put our faith in Jesus Christ and follow God and do his will, repent, be Baptized, and join the true Church of believers following the Bible, we can be saved. The best part, if we honestly seek him and ask, he can come into our lives and give us everything we need to follow him and live lives that are so much more fulfilling  and we can be saved and have everlasting life in Heaven with God.

There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and\u00a0 pray my friends. Wish you all well\ud83d\ude4famen\ud83d\ude4f <br><br>Was the Jesus of the Bible who He claimed He was? Was<br>He really God&#39;s Son? Was Jesus the Messiah?<br>There are over 300 prophecies\u00a0 that point directly to the Messiah. Here is an example of just 8 :<br>The time of His birth (see the Daniel 8 &amp; 9 Timeline).<br>He would be born in Bethlehem. (Micah 5:2)<br>He would be born of a virgin. (Isaiah 7:14)<br>He would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver. (Zechariah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfldS5hqWYA&amp;t=11m12s\">11:12</a>)<br>He would be mocked. (Psalm 22:7,8)<br>He would be crucified. (John 3:14)<br>He would be pierced. (Psalms 22:16)<br>He would die with the wicked, but He would be buried with the rich. (Isaiah 53:9) <br><br>Mathematics &amp; Astronomy Professor Peter W. Stoner has made the statement that the<br>chances of just 8 prophecies (like these) coming true by sheer chance is 1 in 10\u00b9\u2077(100,000,000,000,000,000). That would be equivalent to covering the whole state of Texas with silver dollars two feet deep and then expecting a blindfolded man to walk across the state and on the very first try find the ONE coin you marked (roughly equivalent to the Province of Ontario being 1.5 feet deep). <br>And if we were to add only 8 more similar prophecies, for a total of 16, the odds would be 1 x 10\u00b2\u2078 x 10\u00b9\u2077 or 1 in 10\u2074\u2075 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) <br>Using the same type of illustration as above, if we were to press this many silver dollars(10\u2074\u2075) into a ball and place the center of this ball where the center of our Sun is, this silver ball&#39;s outer edge would be in approximately the same area as the orbit of Neptune (almost to Pluto.). One man fulfilling all 16 prophecies by sheer chance would be like sending a blind-folded person out to find one specific silver dollar that has been marked and has been mixed up somewhere in this huge ball and actually finding it the first time! (Keep in mind that this is a three-dimensional BALL, not a disk like our Solar System.) <br><br>Professor Stoner gives us yet another illustration, but this time, because a silver dollar, and even the atom, would be too large for this one he chose to use just the electron that orbits the nucleus of the atom.\u00a0 The electron is one of the smallest particles of matter known to man. It is so small that if you lined up 2.5 x 10\u00b9\u2075 (2,500,000,000,000,000) single file you would end up with a line that is only 1 inch long. (If we were going to count the electrons in this line one inch long, and counted 250 each minute, and if we counted day and night, it would take us 19,000,000 years to count just the one-inch line of electrons.)<br>Now back to Stoner&#39;s illustration. Using only 48 of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled it was<br>calculated that the chances of one person fulfilling these by sheer chance would be 1 in 10\u00b9\u2075\u2077To help us understand how huge this number is he suggested taking 10\u00b9\u2075\u2077 electrons and pressing them into a solid ball. This ball, made entirely of electrons, would pretty much fill, not just our galaxy, but the entire known universe. (At the time Stoner&#39;s book was written the universe was known to be at least 6 billion light years in all directions. Stoner&#39;s known universe would need to be filled about 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times.) Once again we would mark just one electron, blindfold a man and send him out to find that one electron. Peter Stoner then states, &quot;To the extent, then, that we know this blindfolded man cannot pick out the marked electron, we know that the Bible is inspired. This is not merely evidence. It is proof of the Bible&#39;s inspiration by God--proof so definite that the universe is not large enough to hold the evidence.&quot; Professor Stoner then made the comment that, &quot;Any man who rejects Christ as the Son of God is rejecting a fact proved perhaps more absolutely than any other fact in the world.&quot; <br><br><br>This is the Catholic Church that has the Holy Sacrament of Holy Communion every Sunday Mass. Sometimes in history some of\u00a0 the Priests doubted that the Holy Communion waffer is really the The most Holy Flesh of Lord Jesus Christ. That&#39;s when miracles happened and the waffer was turned to actual bleeding Flesch-the tissue\u00a0that of a human heart, specifically the endocardium.Just Google Eucharistic miracle on Wikipedia or any other site. <br>Science also has proved it. This\u00a0 male AB blood and Flesch is still fresh to this day and one\u00a0 of the first miracles of this type happened during the 700s so we are talking about Blood that never even slightly decomposed during almost 1300 years! The male AB blood type has also\u00a0apparently\u00a0been found on the\u00a0 miracolous Shroud of Turin. The male AB blood type is also found on the Sudarium of Oviedo the Linen cloth thought to have been used to cover the head of Jesus immediately after the crucifixion. There are even\u00a0reports\u00a0that blood taken from some weeping statues of Mary are AB blood type. . The Holy Apostolic Catholic Church is full of miracles that happen on everyday basis and there are also many other Bible verses that confirm its claim as the true Church.

The smell fades away after 30mins and leaves a sweet scent. Aged urine is best for topical use because of the urea and stem cell content being a lot more potent then using less than a week old urine. I use urine as my shampoo/conditioner, for dandruff/dry skin(works great), acne, cuts, and sunburns (works great). There is so much use for urine both aged and new. Works great for just anything.
