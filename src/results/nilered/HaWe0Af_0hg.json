Its also evident that this is the first time you made Glycerin. That is not an instructional video and surely a title like &quot;How to make Vegetable Glyecerin&quot; is misleading as I watch 8 minutes of a Vlog instead of a step by step instructional video by someone who has done this before and knows what there doing. one of the problems with such a video is allot of times this is not the best way or most effective way of producing whatever you are filming. Perhaps recording an instructional video after youve done it 2 or 3 times would make the video more useful. Your video titles should be more like &quot;Trying to make Glycerin&quot; or &quot;Attempting to make ethanol heres what happened&quot;.
