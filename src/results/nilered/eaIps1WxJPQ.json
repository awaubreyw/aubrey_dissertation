I found on the internet that dead sea salt contains quite a bit of bromide, so I started an electrolysis in separate chambers, and, as expected, first the color went slowly to a kind of red-ish orange, but after some time it converted to a pale yellow. I think that the first bit of chlorine produced by the electrolysis was oxidizing the bromide to tribromide (The electrolysis itself might have done that too, at least for a little bit, but as the solution contained mostly chloride this was probably the main anion that was oxidized), but as time progressed, it was further oxidized to bromine, which partly reacted with the chloride to form BrCl2- and partly reacted with chlorine to form first BrCl, which again reacted with chloride to form BrCl2-. <br>That was an interesting result, I&#39;d appreciate if some of you who know that stuff better than me could check if I was correct!", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T00:03:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Judah Layland", "comment_text": "Im disappointed <br>It wasnt used to make brownies", "comment_date": "2018-08-06T11:13:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JamesJimmajome", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaIps1WxJPQ&amp;t=2m02s\">2:02</a> in order to limit l ll lI l_", "comment_date": "2018-08-02T23:54:48Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Dharmender kumar", "comment_text": "Sir make videos on  instruments used in laboratory....

It literally put the &quot;lead&quot; in &quot;leaded gasoline&quot;  <br>      The bromine and chlorine compounds would react with the lead to prevent solid lead oxide from building up inside the engine, which would ruin it. Instead the lead was converted to lead bromide and chloride which are gases/ or liquids(not too sure) at the tempuratures within the engine. These lead compounds would be exausted outside and into the atmosphere, instead of building up as dust inside the engine block. This kept the engine clean and safe!
