The method I&#39;m using to get the basic lead carbonate is to put sheets of rolled lead in plastic containers and use acetic acid and yeast in a closed environment inside a plastic box. The problem is that it takes months upon months for the carbonate to form and I was wondering if there is a faster method to obtain it. A little help would be greatly appreciated.

Having said that, many people will sometimes find a guilty pleasure in sniffing their own trumps. Again, this is instinctive behavior and is done because you can get information about your health in this way and then subconsciously alter your diet slightly - maybe adding a little extra salt to your fries or overdoing your toast slightly for a little-added carbon without even realising you are doing it - all because you sniffed your own fart.
