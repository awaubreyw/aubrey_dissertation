About 20 years ago, I worked for a company that built the computer controls for plastic injection molding machines, and in that job, I got to know a bit about the machinery, materials and methods used.  One method used to produce food safe containers with recycled plastic was one where the container (a bottle for instance) was blow molded by the machine, and in a super secret process which I believe the company may hold a patent on, a thin layer of actual food safe plastic was  injected on the inside of the container.  As close as I got to the machinery, I never quite knew how they did it, but it took place directly after the bottle was blow molded and before it exited the machine.  What you end up with is a normal looking bottle, made out of about 99% recycled plastic, with a layer of food safe plastic coating the interior.", "comment_date": "2021-01-08T03:55:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jalex 84", "comment_text": "Recycling is all about saving money not saving the earth", "comment_date": "2021-01-05T04:15:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Graeme Lastname", "comment_text": "Something I&#39;m very interested in at the moment is how to, cheaply and simply, make polyurethane foam sheets to insulate glass windows.

Put it in the sunlight, it degrades.  That &quot;powderyness&quot; it displayed when it was not totally set, it will display later with time (if it doesn&#39;t &quot;seek its creation&quot; and degrade to the goo that it came from first).  (Have you ever seen a substance both crumbly and gooey at the same time?)  I have seen that &quot;memory foam&quot; and other shipping flexible foams used for protecting expensive optical equipment, degrade into a slimy goo that absolutely destroys optics.  Before it does that, it exudes a smelly, sticky substance that seems to condense on everything in the package, which no known organic solvent can remove.  Even before that, when you open a case lined with urethane foam, there is a Godawful smell like an old chemistry lab.  Urethane paints (very heavy &quot;rubbery&quot; paints) also do the same thing, along with stick-on rubber feet that are supposed to &quot;protect&quot; surfaces.  Are you familiar with the carbon-loaded urethane foam used to insert static sensitive integrated circuits leads into?  After 20 years, the leads are corroded off, and the foam becomes a crumbly, gooey, mess.  I suspect some of this may be due to the plasticizers incorporated to make it flexible.  This is supposedly the source of the &quot;new car smell&quot;.<br>     My &quot;simple chemistry rule&quot; for urethane is URETHANE = CHEAP and URETHANE = UNSTABLE.

And also that I couldn&#39;t wear a respirator because it didn&#39;t do anything.  And then they gave me bullshit food-service gloves so it got on my skin too.<br><br>I really need to get that lawsuit off the ground.<br><br>Seriously folks, be careful with that stuff.  I developed adult-onset asthma which at first was only triggered by isocyanates, but shortly after my state legalized recreational marijuana I learned that I&#39;m sensitive to that too.  Can&#39;t smoke (it might literally kill me) and I can&#39;t even be around it.  I tried a particulate respirator, but that didn&#39;t work and I&#39;ve ended up needing a half-face OV respirator just to take the bus.  (This is weird.  Normally allergens have to be macromolecular chemicals that are large enough to activate an antibody, which means you usually can&#39;t be allergic to a VOC.  However there&#39;s a mechanism where a reactive small compound can attack or bind to a macromolecule and turn it into an allergen. <br><br>These reactive compounds are called &quot;haptens.&quot;   Urushiol is a good example - most people are familiar with poison ivy, but it&#39;s also the source of natural East Asian lacquer (&quot;urushi&quot; in Japanese).  Urushiol polymerizes in the presence of heat and humidity, producing a strong and chemically stable natural thermoset.  Polyisocyanates also polymerize in the presence of water - the product is polyurea - or copolymerize with alcohols to produce polyurethane.  Polyurea is stretchy, sticky, and fairly reactive - it can even be made to re-form covalent bonds with itself after being cut.  Polyurethane is harder (but springy and resilient rather than friable) and chemically stable, useful for foams, paints, and finishes.<br><br>So honestly, the best way to think of isocyanates in the lab or workshop is that they&#39;re somewhat like urushi lacquer - they don&#39;t cause much of an acute reaction but they can be <b>extremely</b> irritating in the long run - and you really don&#39;t want either skin or lung contact.<br><br>\u00a0I also carry a rescue inhaler and my life kinda sucks a little more than it used to.  The resulting polymers are amazing but it&#39;s a shame isocyanates can be so dangerous to work with. Probably the worst was losing my career, which has cut my earnings by about 70%.

Some people from General Motors came to our school and put on a presentation in the auditorium that as far as I can remember was all science related. The thing I remember most vividly though was them putting some chemicals in a clear beaker or possibly just a bottle of some sort and then just holding their thumb over the end as they walked around on stage a couple of minutes shaking it as they described what was happening in the beaker. In the end the guy tipped the opening towards the audience and pulled his thumb off as one would if spraying some one with a shaken carbonated beverage. What popped out of the bottle / beaker though was a pretty good size chunk of a soft white foam that was instantly formed and able to handled with out any stickiness or anything. Whoever caught it was prompted to bring it up on stage and they proceeded to demonstrate how energy absorbing it was and I think at one point even throwing and egg at it without breaking it. I think they may have said it was or was similar to what the padding in padded dashes was made from but I may be wrong. I am almost 70 now so this was long ago, probably about 1965 or 1966. It might make a cool video if you have any idea what they did. Best I can remember the liquid in the bottle was clear to start out but the color might have changed as the guy was walking around and shaking it to a grey color.", "comment_date": "2019-03-10T04:51:54Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Neo Dintchly", "comment_text": "An anime group", "comment_date": "2019-03-08T17:02:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Breezzy", "comment_text": "Sigma balls\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-03-08T02:14:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Arnold R", "comment_text": "I love this dude, he has some very interesting videos and also educative.
