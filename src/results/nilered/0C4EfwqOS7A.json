[{"comment_by": "Steven Gill", "comment_text": "Eoisin Y is a great fluorescor for the luminol/DMSO/t-BuOK system. If you haven&#39;t played with it, it&#39;s a great chemiluminescent system because it reacts with oxygen in the air, no oxidizer needed. Also, like some other CL systems, many fluorescors will work giving different colors, eg dichlorofluorescein, rhodamine B, etc. It&#39;s a little known of many variants of the classic luminol...<br>BTW, have you seen TKDE? (tetrakis[dimethylamino]ethane) It&#39;s oxyluminescent, or simply chemiluminescent with oxygen. It can be purchased, but the synthesis is straight forward, might be fun to try sometime.

I stained my own blood cells using May-Grunwald stain, which is a mix of methylene blue and eosin Y. This is in a solution with a phosphate buffer with a pH of 6.8, which means that most amino acids are in a zwitterion state, and the eosin is attracted to the basic end, the carboxylic group. This dyes them a pink color, while the nuclei are colored blue by the methylene blue. Before the stain was applied, I let the blood dry on the glass plate and washed it in absolute methanol, to remove any lipids that may block the dye from reaching the inner cell structures. I already know methylene blue because I used to own aquarium fish, and this is a commonly used fish medication.
