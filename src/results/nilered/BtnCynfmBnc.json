Most oil paints are NOT just oil and pigment, in fact the ones that are are professional or artist grade and they often run over $30 for an ounce (depending of course on the pigment) most oil paints, especially the cheap stuff are about 5% pigment and maybe 20% oil, the other 75% is just fillers that cost next to nothing, this is so the company can save money. There are, however, different grades of oil paint and the grade depends on how much pigment, oil, and filler are in the paint. Ergo, the higher the percentage of oil and pigment and the lower the percentage of fillers, the higher the grade. So yes, most <b>high grade</b> oil paints are just oil and pigment, but most oil paints in general are mostly filler. So now ya have a bit more knowledge. This can easily be avoided though by buying Gambol artist grade paints as those have absolutely no fillers, are extremely smooth, and are extremely well priced at about $20 for a rather large tube. This is because gambol buys bulk pigments for cheap and focuses more on quality than on their profits, and due to this their customer base is extremely loyal and their profits stay high enough for the company to continue to grow.", "comment_date": "2021-06-28T05:14:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Narri The Synth", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtnCynfmBnc&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> Forbidden Coke", "comment_date": "2021-06-26T00:50:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "One Stop Fab Shop", "comment_text": "It can also be used as a marking compound in setting up rearend gear contact tooth patterns.

As an artist-- yes, when working with oils, you want a very thick paper.

Widely used for many centuries, it was banned by the British in the 19th century when it was thought that the raw material from which the color was refined was essentially a concentrate of urine from cattle fed an exclusive diet of mango leaves and water. The evidence for this is now known to be very probably false. Had it been true, of course it would be an instance of animal cruelty. Since then, various substitutes have been used, most based on cadmium sulfide or arylide yellow.

To make ferrocyanide salt for the purpose of making prussian blue might be a bit silly, as the precursor to the ferrocyanide salt can also be used to make blue ferric ferrocyanide as well as ferrous ferricyanide pigments. However, there likely is a feasible way to make potassium ferrocyanide using easily obtained ingredients, if you need it for other things. NurdRage had a video on the production of sodium cyanide a while back. It&#39;s blocked now but the recipe lives on through the science madness wiki. I have also seen his method in very old texts, and I have confirmed the process&#39;s legitimacy. It yields quite well. The process involves reacting molten sodium hydroxide, carbon, and cyanuric acid. I&#39;d imagine you could use the potassium version of the salts for potassium cyanide. If not, there&#39;s probably a way to convert to potassium cyanide from sodium cyanide. Either cyanide salt can directly produce ferric ferrocyanide with addition of ferrous sulfate (or other ferrous salt) and acid. This is a convenient test for presence and concentration of cyanide in solution as the blue pigment indicates cyanide. However, to make potassium ferrocyanide alone, according to this site you do the same thing minus acid - combine ferrous sulfate and potassium cyanide. <a href=\"https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/iron-in-cyanidation-ferrocyanide-compounds\">https://www.911metallurgist.com/blog/iron-in-cyanidation-ferrocyanide-compounds</a>. <br><br>The same reaction creates prussian blue if acidified so theoretically pH control might allow an excess of ferrous salt.

Thank you for these amazing videos!!<br>Next thing I would like to say is that I&#39;ve watched the video published by Cody&#39;s lab today and he has mentioned a quite decent way of generating Prussian blue using cherry pits... I did an online search and found that bitter almond can be a very good and somewhat feasible source of cyanide, with each almond able to yield 4-9 mg of hydrogen cyanide...<br>I kinda figured out a synthesis pathway that bears possibility of not working in practical experiments but should be able to synthesize small amount theoretically... So in Cody&#39;s lab he collected and grounded a full bowl or similar amount of cherry pits in oil bath and added strong yet non-volatile acid into those grounded pits to catalyze the decomposition of some cyanogenic glucosides, which yields some decent amount of hydrogen cyanide in a time period of 5 hours around. He then separated the hydrogen cyanide using distillation and immobilized those by conducting the gas produced into sodium hydroxide solution.<br>I think in this case, we can try to put the gas generated by the hydrolysis of cyanogenic glucoside into a solution containing iron(II) ions and this should yield us some ferrocyanide ions, which can be used to react with iron(III) ions and form Prussian blue. This experiment should be done in a well-ventilated room, though... Same condition where you produced those elemental bromides should work. Also, the excessive cyanide can react with sulfur to gain a far less toxic ion of thiocyanate, which may work for getting rid of the leakage.<br>There might be some extra chemicals that co-condensed with hydrogen cyanide but according to Cody&#39;s experiment, that should not interfere much with the reaction... Also I think that after filtering the Prussian blue out, the unwanted waste should react with something like sodium thiosulfate to remove any cyanide residue just in case.<br>In all despite just being as a raw, unprocessed idea, I hope this can help with the unavailability of ferrocyanide ions in your experiment rather than buying it from the store...

It was very interesting to see how the pigments are made, since we used prepared powdered pigments. Some advice for your next painting endeavors: Acrylic would&#39;ve been sooooo much easier to make than oil, which I found to be the most difficult to make. But if you do make oil paint again, as you said, don&#39;t add so much oil! Add very little at a time. High quality oil paint has very little oil in it, and is more like a thick paste than what you might imagine &quot;paint&quot; as, it is not liquidy at all. Instead, more oil and turpentine is added later when you use it, this is called &quot;medium&quot;, and adding it later as you use the paint gives you much more control over the color and consistency. For your painting, consider starting with a more transparent &quot;underpainting&quot;, and paint darker in subsequent layers to fill in detail. This technique will give you much more control! <br>We&#39;re all good at different things though, so I hope my tips can be helpful and interesting to you in the same was your video was interesting to me!", "comment_date": "2018-07-26T17:32:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "prestonplayzminecraft", "comment_text": "it sounds like <b>RUSSIAN BLUE</b>", "comment_date": "2018-07-26T08:15:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BirbKangoo", "comment_text": "instructions unclear; made mustard gas instead", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T22:54:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Agatka Grzyb", "comment_text": "omg it&#39;s so pretty", "comment_date": "2018-07-25T19:33:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jen artmom", "comment_text": "I love the process of making pigments.

Many plants produce compounds which are enzymatically catalyzed into hydrogen cyanide as a defense mechanism.  Bitter almonds and apricot pits are probably one of the more available sources for this and seem to be available for bulk purchase online.  By grinding those seeds and soaking their powder/pulp in water you should be able to make a cyanic acid solution. <br><br>From there you could synthesize it from an alkaline aqueous solution of ferrous salts in a single step.  Given your goals and what&#39;s readily available I&#39;d suggest potassium carbonate, which can be attained from brewing supply stores or directly from a chemical supplier, and ferrous sulfide which you&#39;ll probably just have to order.   Hydrogen cyanide should react to form potassium ferrocyanide, hydrogen sulfide, and CO2.  <br><br>Alternatively there&#39;s a more well tested and easier to purify method based on how they do it in commercial production.  By reacting the cyanic acid with calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) you&#39;ll form pretty straight forward calcium cyanide solution.  From there heat it with ferrous sulfate(Iron supplement) to produce calcium ferrocyanide.  This is obviously a step that necessitates a good fume hood.  By adding potassium chloride (low sodium salt) you&#39;ll produce a nearly insoluble double salt of potassium calcium ferrocyanide which will fall out of solution.  Filter and clean it with water.  From there you just need to react it with a potassium carbonate solution.  Insoluble calcium carbonate will fall out of solution and you&#39;ll be left with a crude potassium ferrocyanide solution.  The product can be crystallized out as the trihydrate and purified further from there.", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T19:54:19Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "SuperAWaC", "comment_text": "thin your paints", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T19:51:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nesy", "comment_text": "I&#39;m your 337 th comment<br><br>Edit: Good job with the chemistry projects, keep em up!", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T19:49:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shirokr\u00f6te", "comment_text": "I find it adorable how careful you are about your art skills ^^", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T19:49:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cade", "comment_text": "looked like upside down mushroom clouds", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T19:47:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EUP That's Me!", "comment_text": "I look forward to the cross over videos of @NileRed &amp; @Jazza", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T19:46:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aidyn Wyatt", "comment_text": "you should make some diphenhydramine hydrochloride", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T19:40:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "____________", "comment_text": "can you try prussian blue with kno3 and schugger? to see if the dye can get airborne or suspended in the smoke?
