Just get 25% acetic acid from your supermarket, react it with as much calcium hydroxide (in the cement section of your local building supply store, you might wanna check the web for &quot;brand&quot; names. (Here in germany its &quot;Calciumhydroxid&quot; vs. &quot;L\u00f6schkalk&quot;, which is called slaked lime. If you cant get that, try to substitute for calciumoxide. Beware that this does more damage to skin, so be more carefull. The dry/non-slurry hydroxide is not more dangerous than the acid itself, and that is not too dangerous. It is defatting thoug by creating soap.) The mixing ratio should be aroung 1 volume part calcium(hydr)oxide for 10 volume parts 25% acetic acid. Maybe even <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjmnSoupVoA&amp;t=1m30s\">1:30</a> or so. just try a small scale to get a feeling. You have to barely dissolve all lime, but you don&#39;t want more acetic acid than necessary. Anything above 10% over the required amount could lead to slower gelling. The resulting mixture (mine was a little brown stained, like tea, but that doesnt really show in the gel) can be directly used from between <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjmnSoupVoA&amp;t=1m20s\">1:20</a> to 1:5 calciumacetate-solution to (for my case) ethanol. The key is to mix it before it gells, as that prevents further mixing. I had good results pouring the ethanol into the burning container and injecting a stream of solution with a syringe. Also usefull to get the right dose. Just align and shoot as fast as you can. Try not to touch the syringe into the alcohol, and ofc you do not need the hypodermic needle. Just as simple plastic syringe suffices. If you do touch the alcohol, the syringe might require cleaning. Use cold-ish water (hot might be dangerous for your hands and the plasic of the syringe. Really cheap. Like 5 bucks for gelling a 10l bucket of ethanol. Also the only heat required is to ignite.
