Perhaps the cellulose is more thoroughly dissolved and so is unable to form a linked structure when precipitated. The solutions not left overnight may still contain (colloidal?) incompletely dissolved cellulose which could come out of solution with enough strength to form a fiber. Perhaps the non-thread-forming examples were not saturated with cellulose.<br>Do you have any idea of the mechanism of dissolving the cellulose? What seems to give the approximate weight equivalent of copper hydroxide and the amount of cellulose that can be dissolved?
