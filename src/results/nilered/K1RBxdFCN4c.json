First and foremost, I love your channel. I don&#39;t know if you read comment questions this long after you&#39;ve posted a video, but here goes! <br><br><br>I have tried this reaction 4 times with minimal success. Each time I regenerate more than 90% phthalic acid instead of synthesizing much/any 3/4-nitrophthalic acid. I noticed from this procedure (<a href=\"http://www.orgsyn.org/demo.aspx?prep=CV1P0408)\">http://www.orgsyn.org/demo.aspx?prep=CV1P0408)</a> that they added sulfuric acid first, then slowly add fuming nitric acid, followed by (less) concentrated nitric acid - and the note says that using just concentrated nitric acid first does not work as well. It also seems like this procedure uses more acid relative to the phthalic anhydride (compared to your video), and in my experience this improved my yield. I am getting ready to try a 5th time with some fuming nitric acid, and just wanted to see if you thought this might play an important step? It seems like this reaction starts out as fairly water-sensitive, and it makes intuitive sense that the anhydride would be easier to nitrate. I was just surprised that the phthalic acid seems to completely resist nitration, and that the phthalic anhydride preferred to hydrolize over nitration under what seemed like identical reaction conditions to yours.
