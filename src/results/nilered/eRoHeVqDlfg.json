This is an excellent solvent for sodium oxides and hydroxides, which will comprise most of the surface corrosion on sodium metal, and the effectiveness is increased at higher temperatures. The one catch is that sodium floats in tetraglyme, so you will need to blanket everything with nitrogen or argon to stop the sodium corroding. If you don&#39;t have an inert gas source, you could pour a layer of mineral oil on top - this shouldn&#39;t mix with the tetraglyme since the polarity of the two liquids are vastly different. Just choose a mineral oil that sodium sinks in. This is similar to the method of cleaning up old potassium with 1,4-dioxane.<br><br>Anyway, tetraglyme has a boiling point way above the melting point of sodium - but don&#39;t heat it beyond about 150 degrees C, otherwise it actually starts reacting with the liquid sodium. Anywhere between 100 and 130 degrees C should be safe enough. If you put a large magnetic stirrer bar at the bottom of the beaker and turn the stirring rate up as high as it can go, you should form a vortex, and the melted sodium will coalesce in the middle of the vortex into one big rounded lump, with all the impurities dissolved into the tetraglyme layer. Once it has all melted and collected, turn the heat off but keep the stirring going until it has cooled down enough for the sodium to solidify. Then you can pick out the lump with tongs (or a gloved hand if you&#39;re feeling brave) and dump it in a clean jar with some fresh mineral oil.<br><br>Don&#39;t be tempted to store the sodium in tetraglyme to keep it shiny - this will work for a few weeks or maybe a month, but sodium still reacts with tetraglyme at room temperature, just imperceptibly slowly - and the breakdown products form a sticky black tar-like substance. Tetraglyme is expensive, so you may want to recover as much as possible, but this is easy enough if you have a distillation rig and a high vacuum pump. Don&#39;t try distilling the tetraglyme at ambient pressure - it will decompose too easily, especially with sodium hydroxide dissolved in it. But at full vacuum (as good as a rotary vane pump can do, anyway), the distillation should occur at a much lower temperature, so less of it will decompose.", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T20:42:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "southern 'merican", "comment_text": "At the end,....Dry oil by adding sodium before adding sodium? !?!?!?", "comment_date": "2021-11-07T15:48:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trevor van Bremen", "comment_text": "That&#39;s all well and good, but it&#39;s WAY more fun to &#39;clean&#39; it using soapy water...<br>(Alternatively, I think a 33% HCl &#39;acid bath&#39; would rapidly get rid of any perceived &#39;tarnishing&#39;)", "comment_date": "2021-11-05T13:21:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Davis Hahn", "comment_text": "the forbidden airsoft bbs", "comment_date": "2021-11-01T12:35:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CookingAndJava", "comment_text": "So essentially you&#39;re deep frying sodium", "comment_date": "2021-11-01T08:00:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bazel_the_badger", "comment_text": "So strange how much his videos have changed", "comment_date": "2021-11-01T02:35:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nik plays games", "comment_text": "<b>watching this old video</b>", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T11:49:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shreya Shandilya", "comment_text": "Nile not saying &quot;kind off&quot; every other second in this video is disturbing", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T04:28:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mayday Baeday", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t see why so much sodium was wasted.
