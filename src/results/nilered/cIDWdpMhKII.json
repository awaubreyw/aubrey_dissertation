Although you can read about where to get many things online, the information is often out of date or region-specific. That is the case for potassium nitrate - it&#39;s now very hard to get in any quantity in the US unless you are a business and can order in bulk, although there is the notable exception of stump remover. Same for ammonium nitrate - Cold packs are a source, but most of them have a mixture of ammonium nitrate and some other things.
