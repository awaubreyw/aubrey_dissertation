Whether it\u2019s in a small lab or out in the fields of petroleum and water pump stations, it can be a truly equal opportunity killer! Unfortunately a worker at one of those field pump stations lost sight of that. It cost him his life. Not long after, his wife became concerned that he hadn\u2019t returned and wasn\u2019t answering calls. She loaded their kids up and went to look for him. She found him deceased next to the pump but before she knew it, it cost her her own life. When emergency responders arrived, they were hit with the overwhelming vapors. They had to use full contained suits in order to get to the children. <br><br>These pumps were in a a sizable pump house that was equipped with detection devices, a ventilation system and two large roll-up warehouse style doors. There were so many safety/alarm systems \u201capparently\u201d in place, this should have never happened. Yet those systems were not working. The company gave employees personal detectors but put no emphasis on using them. Had no training, rules or policies about lock-out/tag-out processes. The company\u2019s justification? They had signs on the perimeter fence that read \u201cdanger toxic gas\u201d and they provided pamphlets.<br><br>Pamphlets?! Really?! <br><br>I mention all of this not just because it\u2019s the same chemical but because the industries that should be the experts in these chemicals show less respect for these substances than a young man conducting experiments on YouTube! <br><br>It\u2019s absolutely amazing how the more money that\u2019s involved the less respect that is shown!", "comment_date": "2022-05-01T14:19:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "some dude", "comment_text": "Gonna make  setup like this to eliminate my gopher problem..", "comment_date": "2022-04-16T17:28:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Excel Moves", "comment_text": "How successful will this be in making H2SO4?
