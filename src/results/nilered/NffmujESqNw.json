The toxicity begins with numbness of the tongue, lightheadedness, and visual disturbances and progresses to muscle twitching, unconsciousness, and seizures, then coma, respiratory arrest, and cardiovascular depression.<br><br>CNS toxicity: When the lidocaine dose is increased from 1 mg/kg to 1.5 mg/kg, the risk of CNS toxicity increases from 10% to 80%. Symptoms include the following:<br><br>o Lightheadedness, dizziness<br>o Visual disturbance<br>o Headache<br>o Perioral tingling, numbness or tingling of tongue<br>o Sedation<br>o Impaired concentration<br>o Dysarthria<br>o Tinnitus<br>o Metallic taste<br>o Muscular twitching, tremors<br><br>With progression of toxicity, the patient may experience tonic-clonic seizures and, eventually, unconsciousness and coma. Seizures generally do not occur with lidocaine levels of less than 10 mcg/mL.<br>Cardiovascular: Excessive lidocaine concentration can cause cardiovascular toxicity, although this is less common than CNS toxicity. Lidocaine is somewhat less cardiotoxic than lipophilic local anesthetics\u00a0 such as bupivacaine. Risk of cardiac toxicity is greatest in those patients with underlying cardiac conduction problems or after myocardial infarction. <br><br>Potential cardiovascular effects include the following:<br>Negative inotropic effects<br><br>Effects on vascular tone (with low doses having vasoconstrictive effects and higher doses causing relaxation of vascular smooth muscle)<br>Effects on cardiac conduction include widened PR interval, widened QRS duration, sinus tachycardia  sinus arrest, and partial or complete atrioventricular dissociation. <br>Cardiac arrest has been reported after intraurethral administration of lidocaine.<br><br>Cardiac toxicity is potentiated by acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypoxia, which worsen cardiac suppression and increase the chance of arrhythmia. <br><br>This is important to consider since seizure makes this metabolic picture more likely.<br>Plasma lidocaine levels of less than 5 mcg/mL are unlikely to have cardiovascular toxicities. Levels of 5-10 mcg/mL can cause hypotension by inducing both cardiac suppression and vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Levels of more than 30 mcg/mL are associated with cardiovascular collapse.<br><br>CNS symptoms may be masked in patients premedicated with anticonvulsants such as benzodiazepines or barbiturates. The first sign of toxicity in these premedicated patients may be cardiovascular system (CVS) depression.<br><br>When blood levels are high enough to block inhibitory and excitatory pathways, convulsions cease and the patient experiences respiratory depression or arrest and cardiovascular depression.<br>Large bolus injections may increase peak anesthetic levels to the point where the CNS and CVS are simultaneously affected.<br><br>I&#39;m gonna do eeeeet !!!!", "comment_date": "2019-04-21T08:36:24Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Meliodas", "comment_text": "How to extract ephedrine from nasal congestion tablets lmao?", "comment_date": "2019-04-19T18:32:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Loopy Luvpump", "comment_text": "NERD!", "comment_date": "2019-04-08T04:42:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack", "comment_text": "The DEA wants to know your location", "comment_date": "2019-04-08T00:47:00Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "holling harris", "comment_text": "So, science lab shut down and now i can&#39;t find the solubility for most chemicals. it only tells me if it&#39;s soluble in water or not and that;s it", "comment_date": "2019-03-29T02:33:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Poles", "comment_text": "cool vid man, what about sudafed? how me make a meff?", "comment_date": "2019-03-23T18:16:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "n7 pako", "comment_text": "Extract trenbolone from FInaplex pills, how to sterlize and prep 10/100ml vials, please?", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T17:34:22Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Erin Mayo", "comment_text": "yo can you start with a liquid? like extract the caffeine from a drink?", "comment_date": "2019-03-22T04:57:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DankNoodles420", "comment_text": "Will you do a video of dextromethorphan hbr acid base extraction ?", "comment_date": "2019-03-21T05:24:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ke2", "comment_text": "How to extract table salt from cocaine pls", "comment_date": "2019-03-20T11:52:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DUB", "comment_text": "Can i extract opiate fm anti-dirriea meds?", "comment_date": "2019-03-19T16:27:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jeff ransom", "comment_text": "Your awesome", "comment_date": "2019-03-18T05:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ghost Noodle", "comment_text": "Definetely not for crack....<br><br><br><br><br>I swears officer", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T06:13:41Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Zackery Czonstka", "comment_text": "Title Edit: &quot;Breaking Bored staring HeisenDork&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-03-12T09:28:47Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "CitizenLach", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t understand how you actually got rid of the providone.", "comment_date": "2019-03-10T23:28:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "techgamer15", "comment_text": "Please be a chemistry teacher if you&#39;re not already.
