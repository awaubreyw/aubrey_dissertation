I think normal pressure cookers operate at around 15 psig which is just shy of 19-20 psig at which the boiling point of water would be 125 degrees.  The typical weighted valve used to control internal pressure would just need a tweek or two to raise that the 4-5 psi needed.  Just make sure the safety valve is set high enough to take the increase.  The downside of not being able to see the reaction would be offset by having removed the reason to keep such an eye on it in the first place.<br>Of course, you&#39;d still have to boil off enough water to build the pressure in the first place.  This could be mitigated by installing a valved gas inlet in the cooker&#39;s lid so a pre-charge of nitrogen or something (compressed air?) can be introduced.", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T04:57:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "evil meme lord", "comment_text": "It was used in ak mags", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T14:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VioletTracey", "comment_text": "Could a pressure cooker or autoclave have worked as a bakalizer?

Most likely they would think they had just been handed a snack. A very common part of many human cultures is offering a traveling stranger something to eat when they arrive. This makes sense because it is likely the travailing stranger might be hungry, and sharing a meal is a good way to get a friendship going.<br>     This would hold true (i think) with many alien cultures as well.

In my grandmother&#39;s house, the telephone, the wall sockets (outlets) and parts of her toaster were made from bakelite, for instance. All things made of bakelite I remember were coloured black. They all shared one aspect, they would break easily.. the bakelite used for them was hard, but brittle - it would not live up to any kind of impact. I always thought that that was just what bakelite was like, that it was an unavoidable sort of imperfection of the kind of material. Watching your video however makes me wonder if that brittleness actually rather was due to the amount of fillers that the producents of all those things put into it. I can imagine that using fillers would make it much cheaper to produce things that were made of bakelite. And, if I understand correctly, it was already put under pressure  to cure it in the forms used - which also would have made it very easy to fill them up with a powdery filler first, then flood make that filler and make it absorb a much lower amount of the actual bakelite whilst still in liquid form. And when it was cured its surfaces would be as smooth as the insides of the forms that were used were, and you totally wouldn&#39;t be able to tell by sight that any fillers were in it anyway. .. until you actuality broke the household item that it most likely was what they made, and even then you&#39;d only be able to tell be cause of the grainy inner structure that now got exposed.

Basically not much to learn in terms of lab practice, perhaps gave me just an idea of working with polymers and plastics, or not really. As for theory, studying polymer chemistry came down to memorizing stuff in a similar manner as studying chemical technology/engineering was, not fun to do at all, very much unlike organic chemistry is both theoretically and practically for which all you have to do is understand a few basic concepts, then develop some sort of a sixth sense for it and you don&#39;t have to memorize much other than some name reactions and specialist language which comes naturally by mental association with structures and mechanisms.
