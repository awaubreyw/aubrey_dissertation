Great idea! Kudos (applause), I went ghetto macguyver style making a filter. I am very limited right now on what I can do, experimentally, that is. I grabbed a tee shirt I wore on my way out of prison. I couldn&#39;t just throw the shirt away because I don&#39;t like wasting anything. I cut a six inch diameter circle and a bunch of one inch by eight inch strips, some to aid in the filtration, and some for a different project entirely. Anyways (sorry for the adhd tangents:), using a 20 inch plastic soda bottle that had been cut laterally, about five inches from the mouth of the bottle. (Sigh) yup, funnel. So this make-do funnel was stuffed with a folded six inch circle. I had cut it like that bc I thought I would make a couple coffee filter-like things but realized during a happy accident that the plug approach works very, very well. You take something dyed, like for example, skittles, crush them up mix with water and pour through the plug, which would take hours..
