In order to catch the culprit red handed, they added something to a doorknob I believe, and somehow got a second something onto the suspect&#39;s hands. When that individual ended up touching the doorknob, the two components mixed, and some time later caused a reaction. The resulting effect was that the suspect&#39;s hand had been dyed with a dark color, similar to your experiment here, allowing the protagonists to identify who had touched the doorknob.<br><br>So, my question, is it possible to use solutions A and B to set up something similar, and would it dye someone&#39;s skin for long enough to identify them?
