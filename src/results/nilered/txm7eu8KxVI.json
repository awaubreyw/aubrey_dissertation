The stuff is now about $13/gallon in home improvement stores. Some has a small amount of isopropanol; some doesn&#39;t. You probably but not necessarily want the type that doesn&#39;t contain isopropanol, depending what you&#39;re doing with the result. Hydrogen peroxide and glycerol aren&#39;t issues in distillation nor are small amounts of other gunk.<br><br>I use it to make anhydrous alcohol. I run it through a fractional column fast (many drops/sec) using temps below, dry it over 3A sieves down to density ~ 0.79, then distill that again to get rid of sieve dust.<br><br>Note: <b>Ethylene</b> glycol is <b>not</b> an allowed ingredient in hand sanitizer in the US. (!) Propylene gylcol and/or glycerol are common and safe even in food. &quot;Glycol alcohol&quot; is a synonym for glycerol. Again, ethylene glycol is not allowed in US hand sanitizer. It wouldn&#39;t distill over anyway, nor will glycerin or propylene glycol.<br><br>Isopropanol on the other hand is impossible to eliminate at atmospheric pressure due to a boiling point almost identical to ethanol. Vacuum distilling at low temperature (working up from freezer temp) might work as the boiling points are farther apart under decent vacuum (0.05 bar or lower). I should try that.<br><br>Collect till about 175F (80C). Save that (then dry it). A fair bit will be left in the boiling flask. Collect while distilling to something higher. 195F is good (90.5C). Save that and redistill it later by adding to a later run. You can also save the leftover stuff and redistill that too to around 208F (97.5C), then redistill that etc.<br><br>For the density measurement I&#39;m using a 100ml class A volumetric flask and an analytical balance, but you can actually get a very accurate feel for near 100% by letting a small amount evaporate from your fingers. The feel with even small amounts of residual water is much different than the feel with no residual water -- there is no briefly lingering &quot;wetness&quot; - it evaporates cleanly like acetone, just slower.<br><br>Yield is around 60% (20% H2O + losses getting the sieves wet etc) or a little higher depending how much you redistill the &quot;tails.&quot;<br><br>This also gives you flavorless ethanol, should that be of importance.<br><br>As far as the flavor of the stuff from fermentation goes, fractional distillation (perhaps multiple times) along with activated charcoal would help, but I&#39;m sure there are congener azeotropes that can&#39;t be dealt with. The congeners are important in the flavor of distilled beverage alcohol. Vodka involves multiple distillations and probably charcoal to get rid of them. Adding a pass through vacuum distillation would help.<br><br>You might think of distilling E85 but I wouldn&#39;t bet on being able to get rid of the hydrocarbon azeotropes.<br><br>Sorry for the rambling!

You are trying to get Bill Gates killed, by your lies, just as you have done to other people.  Saying Bill Gates is going to force a vaccine on America.  Trump has been the one behind the vaccine(operation warp speed), where he will have the military administer a forced vaccination to all Americans in 24 hours, by General Gustav Perna.   In Canada it is Major General Dany Fortin, that will vaccinate Canadians.  The military is dealing with corona virus in UK(Britain).  In Australia they have supposedly only 8 cases of corona virus, and armed military is forcing quarantine, including armed checkpoints.   In Canada, Randy Hillier(not the General doing forced vaccinations) revealed the Canadian Government&#39;s concentration camp plans(through the Government&#39;s own documents), Government falsifying of Corona virus numbers and falsification of the hospital numbers, was fired retroactively it seems.  He made the statements in 2020, but there is information spreading that he was let go in 2018.  There is a cover up going on.  It is not Antifa doing this to the world, but your long ruling suppressors.  Read on!  Alex Jones is trying to tear down those trying to make you free, and others who&#39;s businesses jeopardise Trump/ AlexJones/ Big business/ Government/ Pope fortunes.  They are systematically destroying people and businesses.  Alex is Trumps militia leader and propaganda man.  (<a href=\"http://youtube.com/watchv=1wACJloXiBo)\">youtube.com/watchv=1wACJloXiBo)</a> (<a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=yPl_YA4IBO8)\">youtube.com/watch?v=yPl_YA4IBO8)</a> (<a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=JEEt-t3F_ac\">youtube.com/watch?v=JEEt-t3F_ac</a> ). Look at what happened at UC California, when they were trying to find and kill me.  That should wake people up to the reality of what is happening. Trump can make the economy perform well, by guting safety, the environment, and stripping the poor, but in the long run chaos.  The great reset was supposed to be the setting up of a system, where the people of earth, would share in the proffits of the world, with a 24 hour work week, and a highly productive society, where every single person on earth has property to build a home.  The great reset is where society stops recognizing people who follow satanic organizations that enslave people.  Mankind is willing to over look their evils of the past, done in ignorance, if they turn to doing good.  Hence the name, the great reset.  If these evil suppressors don&#39;t change, then they will be considered outcasts of humanity(that is where their weeping and nashing of teeth will be).  They will have brought it upon themselves.  Don&#39;t talk to or listen to them, basically have no dealings with them.  By being against God, they have made themselves enemies of humanity.  These people would not be killed, but just be outcasts, but they are trying to kill all people who might prevent them from continuing their reign of terror.  There are people spreading fraud, that no one will own any thing, which is absolutely ridiculous.  It was supposed to be a system of equalisation, but the Royals and government fat cats, have turned it in to terror, extermination and condensation of power.  The false systems know they are a fraud, so they have resorted to killing, to suppressing freedom, just like they always do.  Most people are not violent like they are, so people do not know what to do to counter their terror, when they control most aspects of life.  They want to bring us back to the past, where they controlled all things.  The Pope of Rome, runs the Vatican City State, which actually is a Country.  He has his own flag, and crown, in fact he has a tripple tiered crown, which is on the Country&#39;s flag.  The triple tiered crown, which is on the flag has 666 written in Latin, on it.  The Pope is the ruler of the City above the Kings of the earth, mentioned in Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18 of the Bible.  It mentions there, that they are clothed in scarlet(Catholic Cardinals) and purple(Catholic Bishops).  It mentions, that in this Church Empire alliance, is found the blood of the prophets, holy ones, and all slaughtered from the earth.  The way to defeat them is for every one to tell hundreds of people about the fraud until every one knows.  They also know this, that is why they keep locking people down, and then going in and slaughtering the people who know.  People through out history have been such cowards, that the system has been able to keep going, unhindered, although many people were oblivious(they had no idea what was really happening in order to act) to what was happening.  Don&#39;t raise up your weapons, but raise up your voice.  A good idea to have a weapon to defend your self though.  The Roman Papal system killed the people of the Americas, those during World War Two, Rwanda, Asia, every slaughter on earth.  The people could stop it all in one day by working together.  England is part of the Roman Empire, but it pretends to have parted ways.  This is a false reality.  The Magna Carta treaty, proves that the Pope controls the nations of France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, England, others and the Countries these nations conquered.   Their &quot;mark&quot; usually hangs from their necks, flags, shields and it symbolizes their religious political system.  Revelation/ Apocalypse 17, 18 calls it the Church riding the Roman Empire(Roman Catholic Church, and daughter religions).  The Bible says, that they force people to worship and accept the mark of the Empire/Church, or be put to death.  From around the year 538 Rome had decread the death penalty, for any one observing the Biblical Passover, or Sabbath.  Just as the Bible had said, but the time period for that ended 1260 years later at the French Revolution, and birth of the US, just as the Bible had said.  That&#39;s when the control of the Empire shifted from Rome to Constantinople(now Istanbul Turkey).  In 1929 Lateran Treaty, Catholic leader Mussolini restored the Papal State of Rome Italy, which was the death blow recovery mentioned in the Bible.  Revelation and Daniel fortold these things(Daniel12:4, 1Peter1:12)  The cross or X symbolizes the belief system of Rome.  The crossing of truth with error.  It symbolizes the 10 nations that originally made up the Empire.  X in Latin means ten.  Daniel 2:44 mentions 10 kingdoms being destroyed by God&#39;s Kingdom.  The Pope is the master of puppets, pulling the strings. (Pay attention to the lyrics(<a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=0obBdrfUMzU))\">youtube.com/watch?v=0obBdrfUMzU))</a>  Alex Jones, has already called for the mass execution of American citizens.  ( <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=sos2d7gtq20)\">youtube.com/watch?v=sos2d7gtq20)</a>. God created man to live for ever, in peace and happiness, and he will return that to mankind.  Prince Charles is talking about going to war, to seize control.  He is not wanting to set up God&#39;s Kingdom on earth.  He has been very happy, living off the people&#39;s money, and keeping them suppressed and in darkness.  If every one on earth shared the earth&#39;s profits, and had their own property and house, this world would see a peace and prosperity like never before.  Prince Charles talks about a marshal plan.(marshal law). Magna Carta, talks about how to deal with people waking up.  It says to take away all their freedoms, so they can not even leave their houses.  Then the Pope will compensate them for their extermination of the people.  If only there were some people, who were not so lazy, that they would look in to things, for the sake of their offspring.  Should I quit telling you about these things?  God says that no coward will inherit God&#39;s Kingdom.  It must be very difficult for people to just say, I don&#39;t care if they rape and steal and kill, I&#39;m too much of a coward to do any thing.  All you have to do is every one tell every one else, until all people know.  Do it very quickly, and then they will not be able to kill, like they are doing under the guise of a corona virus, like they did under the guise of a typhus virus during World War Two.  They exterminated over 12000000 then, and the Pope, had said there would be over 13000000 million exterminated in the US alone and maybe more now.  Catholic Adolf Hitler used pellets of Zychlon B, which turned in to a deadly gas, that would suffocate people, when exposed to air.  They would also put an exhaust pipe in to people&#39;s windows, or pick people up for quarantine with a truck, that the vehicle&#39;s exhaust would go in to the passenger area, killing or causing breathing problems.  Are you willing to do the research, and use your voice to make people know the truth?  The Bible says, you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.  The Bible also talks about the Kingdoms of the world becoming the Kingdoms of God.  Imagine every one on earth being an equal, home owning, productive person.  It&#39;s only greed that keeps this from happening.  The Bible, refers to the Church riding the Roman Empire (Roman Catholic Church) as being responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  Time to make a real change, and not slaughter, in the name of a Church, that God says is fake.  Trump sent a cure, earlier in the year to Brazil, and soon after they were having mass graves of 20 000+.  America never had a cure at that time, so what did Trump send there?  A health expert said that people were dying from the cure.  German(Nazi) BioNtech has vaccine for the military to exterminate you.  Locking of people down in groups, can not be justified moraly or legaly, only sick people need to be isolated, in a real case scenario.  Read the book of Esther of the Bible.  When you go to testing area, no phones allowed, why? Military nurses end your life, no witnesses.  Flu like symptoms come from being radiated.

If you have some kind of food (like apples), you can even use some material from your last batch as starter for your next, and not have to keep using packets.

It is to prevent stressed out yeast that creates off flavors in a wort that lacks nutrients.

This is why it is recommended to use yeast nutrients when making mead for example because honey is also very nutrient poor, being mostly sugar.

Either device is extremely cheap, ranging from $5-$15, with the refractometer being a bit more expensive, though definitely easier to test with since you can just add a few drops of your solution to test.  Either way be sure to test the solution since virtually all the online calculators require a starting reading to get something approximating an accurate result.

I have never had good yields fermenting just pure sugar and water (I have tried). The fermentation also takes a lot longer with lower yield and it tastes terrible. The yeasts need some nutrients. You can&#39;t feed your kids nothing but candy bars for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and expect them to get into a good college. Yeast may be a bit simpler than children, but you can&#39;t feed them pure sugar and water and expect them to thrive. You don&#39;t have to get very fancy to introduce some vital nutrients into the solution. Some people swear by adding  a can of tomato paste, but I think those people are idiots. It does improve fermentation, but the distilled results tastes like ketchup. Using tomato paste makes no sense to me. My favorite technique is to fortify the yeast with one slice of whole wheat bread for every 5 gallons of solution. I use a blender to make breadcrumbs, but it doesn&#39;t need to be ground that small. You can just tear the bread into small pieces. The yeast will grow faster and ferment for vigorously than with pure sugar and water.<br><br>Sterilization is unnecessary. Don&#39;t get me wrong, a fermentation vessel should be clean. I wash mine with hot water, but I don&#39;t get more complicated than that. You are going to be inoculating the solution with about 140 billion cultivated yeast cells. Within a hour the population of your solution is going to be populated by 99.9999% yeast, all healthy and multiplying fast. Any wild microbes will be overwhelmed. If you were making beer or wine then, yes, wild yeasts and bacteria will have enough time to grow and perhaps alter the flavor. So in the case of beer and wine you do need to be more sterile (does Lambic beer count?) But for neutral alcohol distillation wild microbes will not have enough time to develop a competing population that could have any effect on the distilled alcohol flavor or yield. I let my solutions ferment for 5  to 7 days. Once the fermentation slows down everything is immediately put into a boiler and distilled. I taste little difference between one run and another. I&#39;ve never had a batch go off and taste spoiled. There just isn&#39;t time for that to happen.<br><br>Another thing you can dispense with is the fiddly airlock. It&#39;s true that oxygen is bad, but you can simply wrap aluminum foil loosely over the bottle opening (if you are using small fermentation bottles ~ 5 gallon bottles). The foil keeps out air and dust. The airspace in the bottle is quickly filled with nothing but CO2 and water vapor generated by fermentation. There will be positive pressure in the bottle. Air can&#39;t get back in. It would probably be fine even without the foil cover. If you have larger fermentation tanks (starting around 20 gallons) then just try to keep the openings small and minimize the headspace above the solution (run the fermenter full). I use a giant stock pot (25 gallons, 100 quarts, ~95 Liters) with a lid. I keep the lid on snug with spring clips, but it&#39;s certainly not airtight. You don&#39;t want airtight! Once the solution starts to ferment it is going to generate positive pressure in the fermenter. This CO2 will push out any air and oxygen. It will keep doing this during the entire fermentation process and it will keep doing it even a little after since I normally start to distill the solution before yeast activity has completely stopped. Tested with a refractometer I get between 10% to 14% alcohol. I think the majority of the alcohol seems to be formed by day 4. I usually stop the fermentation early, around 10% on day 5. If I wait another 5 days then I might get up to 14%, but it seems like it&#39;s not worth the wait just for an extra 4%. I&#39;ve been meaning to study this to figure out when to best stop the fermentation and move to distillation. There must be a best strategy based on the cost of mixing up a new solution to ferment, the cost of time to wait for each 1% of alcohol, and cost to distill a batch to 70% alcohol.<br><br>Finally, I use ordinary bread yeast. Activated dry yeast works great. I have tested high-yield yeasts and champagne yeasts, but the difference is not significant enough to warrant the expense and trouble. I am suspicious that these specialty breeds of yeast actually yield that much more alcohol than bread yeast. I think the highest I got was 16%, but someone threw out my notes. Can any yeast get much higher? I suspect most of the difference in these specialty yeasts is due to the fact that they always include yeast nutrients mixed with the yeasts. You can buy the yeast nutrients separately and they do help boost yield and speed fermentation time. There is also a difference in flavor.  I think the high yield yeasts yield a distilled product that tastes weird. The results taste like ground up multi-vitamin pills (try chewing a multi-vitamin sometime).

Champagne yeast is fine, but if you&#39;re just going to maximum alcohol it is probably worth spending the $6 bucks.  Also, you don&#39;t need that much yeast.  Those wine yeast packs are good for 6 gallons each and more if you make a starter.  And you really don&#39;t need distilled water either.  True that there are some bacteria on your tap water, but it is quite low if it is meeting drinking standards.  If you&#39;re worried about bacteria, just use some sulfites on the water, cap it with cloth or a fermentation lock, and give it time to dissipate.

A lot of the steps shown here aren&#39;t as important as implied. Local tap water is fine as long as it&#39;s not overly chlorinated. When using a turbo yeast use about 2 1/2 lbs of sugar per gallon. Dissolve the sugar into hot water, it doesn&#39;t need to be close to boiling. Cool down to less than 100 degrees and pitch your yeast. You can stretch turbo yeasts out further than they suggest, I can get (2) 5 gallon batches out of one packet. Closely monitor your wash for the first couple hours as turbo yeasts are explosive and will foam up heavily. After that seal up and add the airlock. He also doesn&#39;t mention that you need to aerate the wash as the yeast need that oxygen in the wash especially during the first 24 hrs. Some use aquarium pumps, I simply use my faucet&#39;s spray nozzle to fill my bucket. After 5-7 days you have up to a 20% wash.

Sanitization is plenty sufficient as anything undesirable will be killed in the remaining processes. Not to mention that their numbers would be so low after sanitization that even (somehow and surprisingly) if one or two cells managed to somehow survive the processing up through the fermentation initiation, the &quot;largest numbers win&quot; factor comes into play too  Star-san (phosphoric acid and deodecylbenzenesulfonic acid [mainly as a foaming agent]), a 2% iodophor solution, a weak bleach solution or a sodium percarbonate solution is plenty sufficient. Make sure that you have a 2 minute contact time with anything that will touch the liquids and you will be set. <br><br>**A note if you do use star-san, don&#39;t fear the foam. You don&#39;thave to get every bit of foam out. In fact, a small to medium amount of foam is actually beneficial to the yeast.<br><br>Also, you should probably make a starter for your yeast, especially since you are using dry yeast which tends to have a much lower active cell count than liquid yeasts do. For that, just make a smaller sugar wash and aerate it well, then place on a stir plate for a few hours to a day with the re-hydrated yeast added. This will build up your supply of viable yeast and ensure that you are adding healthy yeast as well which can improve your yield. I find that a 1L erlenmeyer flask is perfect for this. For the purposes of a starter, the aeration can just be shaking the heck out of the flask prior to the yeast addition. <br><br>Another thing to mention, is that sucrose alone isn&#39;t really the best yeast food. It is lacking in micronutrients that will help them do their best possible job and to give you the highest possible yield. Therefore, I cannot abide by the recommendation to skip the yeast nutrient. In addition to the nutrient, it is advisable to aerate the full wash as well so as to introduce more oxygen into the wash for the yeast to use during its initial growth and reproduction phase. The best method seems to be to bubble just plain air (filtered of course) through the wash from a fine aeration stone (preferably a stainless steel one that is 1 or 2 micron) for anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or so. One nice thing about using plain filtered air is that you cannot over-saturate the wash with oxygen this way. There are people who use oxygen gas through an aeration stone for a few seconds and as long as you are careful and don&#39;t over-oxygenate the wash it is fine to do that as well. However, if you over-oxygenate the water the yeast can start to behave in a non-desirable way (for more details on this behavior, look into the &quot;crabtree effect&quot; on yeast.) So, personally, I recommend sticking with just air.<br><br>These few things will ensure that your yeast is healthy and happy for the longest period possible during the fermentation process and will increase your yields as healthy yeast will generally tolerate higher ethanol levels in the ferment.", "comment_date": "2015-11-28T19:11:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alvaro Reyes", "comment_text": "What concentration or purity does this ethanol would have?", "comment_date": "2015-11-23T02:42:18Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Sor Sor Science07", "comment_text": "i have the same scale! also Ethanol was an organic solvent for dissolving some things and this will work for that?", "comment_date": "2015-11-22T23:43:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "masterbate23", "comment_text": "Is it safe to get drunk as davy jones with it?", "comment_date": "2015-11-15T14:33:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aurelius The Gunsmith", "comment_text": "is this flamable?", "comment_date": "2015-11-12T04:13:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Majed Majed", "comment_text": "did you read about Islamic?", "comment_date": "2015-11-06T09:20:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ms", "comment_text": "\u0627\u0633\u062a\u063a\u0641\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647", "comment_date": "2015-11-03T18:43:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Capt.

Out of all four cuts you only safely keep the HEARTS. You throw the other three cuts out. The first two\u00a0cuts are very toxic and the tails you keep for your next batch. If you do the math it&#39;s about 6.5 oz\u00a0of\u00a0hearts\u00a0per each 1 gallon of 20% ABV mash distilled. You wil pison yourself if you try and filter and\u00a0drink\u00a0anything other then the hearts", "comment_date": "2015-07-08T16:14:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Hicks", "comment_text": "...pretty sure you don&#39;t need that much yeast... ...total overkill. 1/2 a packet is plenty.", "comment_date": "2015-07-08T00:01:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Unofficial Account", "comment_text": "ok so here the thing it&#39;s been 22 days of fermentation and my homebrew its done, but the problem is, its smells and taste like Vinegar, is that normal ? or i&#39;ve missed something ? i cant drink it makes me wanna throw up, im new at this, is there&#39;s a way to fix this ?", "comment_date": "2015-05-22T08:08:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "electronicsNmore", "comment_text": "Excellent job making this video.
