[{"comment_by": "NileRed", "comment_text": "IMPOTANT NOTE1: I have revised my opinion about what it smells like. In the video, I said it was like an indoor pool and I correlated it to the chlorine. However, I think it&#39;s more accurate to say the pool locker room or shower. It is musty/moldy, with a background of pool smell. <br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE2: After posting this video, I got a few messages from people saying that in their experience, cyanide DOES smell like almonds. So, I spent an hour tonight doing some tests, and I think the results are interesting. I did some direct comparisons and the smell of cyanide is distinctly different from the smell of almonds. However, if I EAT the almonds, there is sometimes a faint taste of cyanide. I think this is because sweet almonds still have a very small amount of amygdalin in them, which can release HCN. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to smell in open air, but in your mouth it can be concentrated enough to be detected at the back of the nose. It&#39;s subtle, but it is definitely part of the flavor profile. So, while I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s accurate to say that it smells like almonds, for some people, it might be similar to the taste. To make that connection though, the person needs to a) be able to smell HCN and b) be particularly aware of that part of the flavor.<br><br>I can smell the HCN, but I never noticed it in the flavor of almonds, so I didn&#39;t make the connection. I was even looking for a similarity and eating almonds at the same time, but never noticed it. It was only when I became very familiar with the smell of HCN that I started noticing it in almonds. What&#39;s interesting too, is that now after noticing it, I feel like I&#39;ve started to associate the smell with almonds. It&#39;s no longer just a &quot;chemical&quot; smell and it feels more almondy. However, on the flip side, I feel like almonds taste worse and are more &quot;chemically.&quot;<br><br>But either way, I still don&#39;t think that saying it smells like almonds or bitter almonds is accurate or helpful. However, based on the messages I&#39;ve received, some people are naturally associating cyanide with almonds (sometimes without knowing that this was even a thing and not even knowing they were smelling cyanide). This has piqued my interest and I think it could be fun to get to the bottom of this and to do a trial with a lot more people.", "comment_date": "2020-11-01T03:46:48Z", "likes_count": 19503}, {"comment_by": "Paper towel stuff", "comment_text": "The fake cherry is sooo gross \ud83e\udd22 (I\u2019m allergic)", "comment_date": "2022-09-08T23:40:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gavriel Shemesh", "comment_text": "More like making some cyanide out of almonds", "comment_date": "2022-09-08T22:34:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ExActa", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYagO-nup6c&amp;t=0m30s\">0:30</a> My Ex Girlfriend smelled great tho", "comment_date": "2022-09-08T12:48:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dark night", "comment_text": "i love this video and iam sad to discover it very late and like your curiosity towards chemistry and now let me tell u that u have been going the wrong direction here cyanide smell like almonds what is meant like the almond plant \ud83c\udf31 when the almonds start to grow and it&#39;s not matching the cyanide itself but only when it reacts inside the human body and so i hope you don&#39;t try that one \ud83d\ude02 but i really hope you get this Comment and do more experiments with poisons because they are very interesting", "comment_date": "2022-09-08T02:46:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ezra Mathils", "comment_text": "Dude we&#39;re all on a fuckin list, like for sure", "comment_date": "2022-09-08T01:17:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rustybayonet", "comment_text": "Is 5 grams lethal?", "comment_date": "2022-09-08T00:00:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rustybayonet", "comment_text": "Can you sell me a lethal dose?

I have heard it said that the action of consuming the seeds from 50-100 bitter almonds can produce enough cyanide gas to kill the average sized, 150-180 lb. adult human.  One would have to crush and comsume them very quickly to get enough poison gas to kill, however.  Bitter almonds are from the Bitter Almond Tree.  Both are banned from sale in the States for this reason.  Sweet almonds are from another genus of tree.  These do not have poisonous enzymes in them and they can be readily purchased.  Bitter almonds are used to make almond extract.  If you&#39;ve tasted ALMOND EXTRACT, you know now know what bitter almonds taste like.  Two crushed bitter almonds are enough to flavor 1 cake or a batch of almond cookies.  There are reports occasionally in the China Morning Sun that children in China and/or other parts of Asia and the Philippines are killed because they consume improperly cooked cassava root.  This root must be cooked long and slow.  It is time and heat that destroys the enzyme that combines with stomach acids to make the cyanide gas.  <br><br>Putin will end up committing suicide by cyanide when the war-crimes unit arraigns, tries and convicts him of war crimes in the Ukraine in my opinion, much like Gen.

This cyanide in my guesstimation is a toxin purifier in our bodies, acting as a small stimulant. Although homeopathic medicine is now pure bullshit, I think that the intuitions that led to its creation stem from the observation that just as vaccines are a little of bad to give you protection, a little of some cyanide compounds occurring naturally in our foods helps our body.

When you are around it being woodchipped it does give off a very strong and distinctive smell which I would describe as an almond smell and which to me smells exactly like what marzipan tastes like, and I am guessing that this is from benzaldehyde.

I wonder how effective soaking the bitter almonds would be if they weren&#39;t smashed first and just how free of cyanide you could get bitter almonds simply with water.

There were no chemically-treated indoor pools or similar chemical smells around that most people were familiar with.  Even if some of these smells were around, they were likely not as common for the average person, and so more natural smells are going to be what people&#39;s brains jump to associate with.  You also mentioned that since this experience, almonds have begun to take on a more chemical scent/ flavor for you.  People also used to have a much narrower range of foods to eat, which means that if they ate almost it may well have been that they ate almonds much more frequently than you and in more forms than you do.  If you eat a lot of foods infused with the flavor of almonds, then the different flavor combinations and cooking methods can cause different elements of a food&#39;s flavor to be highlighted (as well as the fact that if you just eat a lot of something, you will become much more sensitive to the different elements of the flavor and smell of it, much in the same way that someone off the street probably couldn&#39;t tell the difference between a $900 dollar bottle of wine and some grape kool-aid mixed with rubbing alcohol whereas a wine connoisseur can probably smell the difference between two different years of the same wine from across the room)  <br><br>It could also  well be that people who work around cyanide for extended periods of time develop a stronger mental association between the two than you have with this short sort of experience.  Not to mention that different people are more sensitive to certain smells.  Just being able to smell a certain chemical doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that you smell it as strongly as the next person or that there aren&#39;t other smells that are more or less weak to you than others that could also be influencing your perception (plus the ambient smells where you are could be affecting you, as well)  Just because <i>you</i> don&#39;t notice the similarity very much just doesn&#39;t mean that you should declare the description as &quot;unhelpful&quot;, there are way too many other factors at play here to discourage people from using this as one of many methods of detecting a deadly poison.", "comment_date": "2021-03-30T02:00:04Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tyler", "comment_text": "Did...

I kept editing this comment as I went deeper into your video because you explained most of the bitter almond composition, amygdalin content and how it decomposes into glucose, benzaldehyde and hydrocyanic acid (HCN). Now, you would need to ingest between 1.6 and 3 kilograms of bitter almonds for a lethal dose of cyanide depending on their concentration, so it is a huge amount for just a try. You can also find cyanide in different kernels, like apricot and peach kernels, and those are easier to find. And I agree with you, it is misleading because you would not &quot;smell cyanide&quot; just out of the bag, you need to crush it and hydrate it, at least with saliva.<br>Moreover, I guess &quot;almond smell&quot; comes from almond oil (that can also be purchased), which only stands out when they are pressed in your mouth and hydrated with saliva. Also in that essence you showed in the video because of the almond oil diluted in alcohol.<br>I do not know how cyanide smells but if it smells like pool locker room, musty/moldy, it is completely different from regular almonds.<br>And another conclusion might be, you all went to Reggie\u00b4s pool lol", "comment_date": "2021-01-20T00:51:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Apocalypticable", "comment_text": "Up to 40% of the population lacks the gene necessary to be able to detect the odor of cyanide.

I&#39;ve personally never purposely smelled it but I can explain why I agree. Cyan is actually the root word for blue or in simplistic terms....turquoise! See blue and green create turquoise, same way our planet it&#39;s majority blue then green. But why does it smell so musty. Our oceans are virtually undrinkable to humans without due process the same way fresh water fish rarely could adapt to salt water but salt water fish could easily Transition into fresh water. SALT!! Its pretty much land of the Earth. Dirt! Sand! Even your processed table salt is..dirty smelly SALT! Some more earthy then others\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. With that being said the clean chlorine water which makes the water clear btw, is soon too become saturated with dirty salted flesh of a days public pool. That smell the bad timers hit the pool way later after countless, questionable people swimming. Sweat, dirt, piss, vomit etc. All swimming in water breaking down the chlorines affect. Basically cyan is a decomposing Alki metal being grinded away by the interfusion of all natural gases, Noble gases, or as I like to call it inferfuzz. The lightest Alki metal meets the power rangers of gas elements. Same it the way but is not as how as space so the smell doesn&#39;t hit as hard but burning even a hair is what it makes earth what she is. So appreciate stinky smells\ud83d\ude0c.

I have expanded chemistry but it often really ends only on paper due to limited funds, so when I get a chance my curiosity takes a hold of me.

Meanwhile my friend (who uses lab almost every day) checked what I have (by sniffing it aswell) and said &quot;oh, it kicks first time eh?&quot; while I kept coughing for few more minutes. He doesnt smell well outside of the lab aswell, Im always the first one to smell when there is some bbq party nearby.

In the video, I said it was like an indoor pool and I correlated it to the chlorine. However, I think it&#39;s more accurate to say the pool locker room or shower. It is musty/moldy, with a background of pool smell. <br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE2: After posting this video, I got a few messages from people saying that in their experience, cyanide DOES smell like almonds. So, I spent an hour tonight doing some tests, and I think the results are interesting. I did some direct comparisons and the smell of cyanide is distinctly different from the smell of almonds. However, if I EAT the almonds, there is sometimes a faint taste of cyanide. I think this is because sweet almonds still have a very small amount of amygdalin in them, which can release HCN. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to smell in open air, but in your mouth it can be concentrated enough to be detected at the back of the nose. It&#39;s subtle, but it is definitely part of the flavor profile. So, while I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s accurate to say that it smells like almonds, for some people, it might be similar to the taste. To make that connection though, the person needs to a) be able to smell HCN and b) be particularly aware of that part of the flavor.<br><br>I can smell the HCN, but I never noticed it in the flavor of almonds, so I didn&#39;t make the connection. I was even looking for a similarity and eating almonds at the same time, but never noticed it. It was only when I became very familiar with the smell of HCN that I started noticing it in almonds. What&#39;s interesting too, is that now after noticing it, I feel like I&#39;ve started to associate the smell with almonds. It&#39;s no longer just a &quot;chemical&quot; smell and it feels more almondy. However, on the flip side, I feel like almonds taste worse and are more &quot;chemically.&quot;<br><br>But either way, I still don&#39;t think that saying it smells like almonds or bitter almonds is accurate or helpful. However, based on the messages I&#39;ve received, some people are naturally associating cyanide with almonds (sometimes without knowing that this was even a thing and not even knowing they were smelling cyanide). This has piqued my interest and I think it could be fun to get to the bottom of this and to do a trial with a lot more people.", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T15:15:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Private Information", "comment_text": "\u201cMy skin cancer fell off\u201d wtf \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T14:49:57Z", "likes_count": 73}, {"comment_by": "ISSSandwich", "comment_text": "This dude is the only person who know the ingredients on food", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T12:51:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Science And Reason Lover", "comment_text": "Friend: what did you do this weekend,<br>Me: I smashed almonds for science,<br>Friend: okay...............I\u2019m going to leave now.", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T11:52:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jelle Annemans", "comment_text": "Smell like nothing? you.... probably have corona.", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T10:57:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crimeo Civcraft", "comment_text": "I used sodium cyanide a lot to clean out equipment in a biochem lab where pathogens could potentially build up, that&#39;s about it", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T10:32:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chap Flawless", "comment_text": "I heard symptoms of COVID include loss of taste and smell.....", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T08:26:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Filip laskovski", "comment_text": "Did anyone else read diamonds \ud83d\ude43", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T07:29:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NonStopSpicyTom", "comment_text": "This guy is a chemist version of Mark Rober", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T06:53:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JAMN", "comment_text": "Is there like some sciencetest website when u get all these materials", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T06:33:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Totally DreamXD", "comment_text": "Almond smell a lot in our country as it\u2019s natural and fresh", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T06:31:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Plover Tech", "comment_text": "Maybe the sulphur made the clorine smell", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T06:01:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jimminydickit", "comment_text": "Another use for cyanide is tablets for your own DIY cult", "comment_date": "2020-12-01T04:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "apb 134", "comment_text": "Actually, almonds smell like cyanide.

You won&#39;t find apricot seeds in the store because they&#39;re toxic if you eat more than a few, although I don&#39;t remember actually getting sick from what I could get out of the fruit. I only recently found out that they contain cyanide and that this is the reason they&#39;re not sold like almonds. Anyway, I think the bitter aroma from some of the off seeds might actually be the cyanide smell. Kinda scary to think back of it.

I can&#39;t say i have ever seen a cooking show where they didn&#39;t make a bit point about roasting your almonds (or just about any other nut) to release the flavor. Also flavor and smell are STRONGLY related. the only place your &quot;brain&quot; is exposed to the open air is the bundle of nerves in your nose that you use to smell. A lot of tasting is actually smelling so an association between flavor and smell makes sense. I also wonder if you need a stronger concentration to really smell it (yes, I understand that this could hurt you and i do NOT recommend you try it) lastly, I have heard that VERY few people can actually smell cyanide (less than 1% of the population). <br><br>as a side note, i think that doing a video on smells that only some people can detect would be interesting. in High school my chemistry teacher gave us a bunch of chemicals to smell and we had to identify them. thing was she didn&#39;t tell us that our ability to smell the chemicals was dependent on our genetics. it lead to some interesting debates in the class. I don&#39;t remember what chemicals we tried except for one that was supposed to smell like banana, which i said smelled super fake but i knew that was what they were going for.  the only other one i can think of is a bit of a mystery. when some people eat asparagus their urine begins to smell.  I say it is a mystery because scientists don&#39;t know what chemical it is they are smelling. this in partly due to the fact that only some people can smell it and only some people produce this smelly urine.", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T21:56:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gina R", "comment_text": "You should make vantablack", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T21:32:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0394\u0397\u039c\u0397\u03a4\u03a1\u0397\u03a3 \u039a\u039a\u0399\u039f\u03a5\u03a3\u0397\u03a3", "comment_text": "Please make chemical crystal", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T19:37:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YY Ngoc", "comment_text": "(I want to die)", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T18:34:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "This Old Boat", "comment_text": "Oh boy, enough to kill an entire city D:", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T18:11:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anish Singh", "comment_text": "Google: cyanide is quite dangerous for human body, never expose yourself to its vapours<br>Bing:", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T18:03:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stunseed", "comment_text": "didnt try cooking the almonds..", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T17:32:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "concretesailors", "comment_text": "Tune in next time when Nile Red will test the smell of chloroform; trichloromethane.", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T17:26:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stunseed", "comment_text": "pretty sure its not that cyanide smells like almonds. its after its ingested someone that died from cyanide poison usually has a smell in their mouth like almonds", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T17:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caioba Beats", "comment_text": "You should buy a slow motion camera for your vids", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T16:32:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carmen Cotlet", "comment_text": "Try and make a video about gunpowder and how to make homemade gunpowder", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T16:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "5t4n", "comment_text": "Your video about mercury reacting with aluminium just got posted to the Independent\u2019s Facebook page <a href=\"https://fb.watch/1XAoIfLPPm/\">https://fb.watch/1XAoIfLPPm/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T15:41:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "erich sertori", "comment_text": "Plot twist : he has covid hence he can&#39;t smell and taste anything", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T15:34:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ANANTHA KRISHNA", "comment_text": "<b>OMG WHY U CAN&#39;T SMELL SWEET ALMOND I THINK YOU HAVE CORONA \ud83d\ude0c</b>", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T13:24:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I'm just a guy", "comment_text": "Wate lets talk about how there skin cancer FELL OFF is this really some kind of cure", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T10:48:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I'm just a guy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYagO-nup6c&amp;t=3m30s\">3:30</a> anyone want one of my femus cyanide shot?<br>No?

It blocks the cytochrome-c-oxidase and effectively stops a body cell from producing ATP which kills it instantly. The result is a mass death of cells which will inevitably is fatal. If you take a lethal dose of cyanide it will kill you more quickly than a lethal dose of an average poison. Given a large enough dose, you would get unconscious while swallowing and be dead before you hit the floor.<br><br>Also it smells like almonds because almonds contain cyanides. To get the smell you have to roast them, not just crush them up and mix them with water. The concentration is too low to produce enough HCN for you to smell. Eating a lot of bitter almonds or roasted almonds can kill you, truthfully only if you ingest ridiculous amounts (upwards of 1kg) but they still contain a toxic compound.

Hi there, I was wondering how you go about searching your local laws/regulations to determine if the product you are attempting to synthesis is legal? I live in the draconian state of Queensland(in Australia), here even owning a buchner funnel or a simple liebig condenser is illegal under the drugs misuse regulation 1987 ( I have finally jumped through all the hoops to obtain the required licenses to own the equipment). However now im having a lot of trouble finding out whether a given product is legal to synthesise. I&#39;ve tried Google and 99.99% of the time thats completely fruitless. I&#39;ve tried searching in our laws/regulations database, however when you search for a given product you get no results and you need to have a bachelors degree in law to make any sense of that chicken scratch. In the past I&#39;ve simply asked our local police, however a situation recently occurred when they got it wrong and I did make a product that was considered illegal, thankfully it wasn&#39;t too bad and I was just given a warning(I think it was mainly because I had the email from the police I asked telling me there wasn&#39;t any issues).

This also explains why they only smell like that when being eaten, becaus the necessary enzyme is in the saliva. I&#39;ve once tried to make cyanide from pure amygdalin with HCl, but wasn&#39;t able to achieve that without the enzyme present. Also, in regular almonds you can sometimes find bitter ones. I&#39;ve once had a job in a lab where, amongst other things, I had to test almonds for bitter ones by eating a specified amount. Funnily enough I never fond one during this job but in a bought pack of almonds shortly after I left there.<br>Though being a chemist myself, I didn&#39;t ever smell HCN, so I can&#39;t say anything about this part.", "comment_date": "2020-11-07T13:44:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mdanie", "comment_text": "I think a key message here is how deadly substances can accumulate when it appears that very little is happening - the use of the CN meter illustrates this well.

Most of the world\u2019s gold is not found in nugget form but as very fine gold powders in rocks. In fact, our cultural demand for gold forces us to mine in rocks that can be as low as 0.005% gold. This means we need industrial extraction to separate and purify gold from all the other materials. After mining and milling, the crude rock mixture is turned into a fine powder and added to a solution of sodium cyanide. The gold forms strong bonds with cyanide molecules and can then be separated from the rest of the minerals because it is then soluble in water. It then reacts with zinc and turns back into a solid.

In the video, I said it was like an indoor pool and I correlated it to the chlorine. However, I think it&#39;s more accurate to say the pool locker room or shower. It is musty/moldy, with a background of pool smell. <br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE2: After posting this video, I got a few messages from people saying that in their experience, cyanide DOES smell like almonds. So, I spent an hour tonight doing some tests, and I think the results are interesting. I did some direct comparisons and the smell of cyanide is distinctly different from the smell of almonds. However, if I EAT the almonds, there is sometimes a faint taste of cyanide. I think this is because sweet almonds still have a very small amount of amygdalin in them, which can release HCN. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s enough to smell in open air, but in your mouth it can be concentrated enough to be detected at the back of the nose. It&#39;s subtle, but it is definitely part of the flavor profile. So, while I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s accurate to say that it smells like almonds, for some people, it might be similar to the taste. To make that connection though, the person needs to a) be able to smell HCN and b) be particularly aware of that part of the flavor.<br><br>I can smell the HCN, but I never noticed it in the flavor of almonds, so I didn&#39;t make the connection. I was even looking for a similarity and eating almonds at the same time, but never noticed it. It was only when I became very familiar with the smell of HCN that I started noticing it in almonds. What&#39;s interesting too, is that now after noticing it, I feel like I&#39;ve started to associate the smell with almonds. It&#39;s no longer just a &quot;chemical&quot; smell and it feels more almondy. However, on the flip side, I feel like almonds taste worse and are more &quot;chemically.&quot;<br><br>But either way, I still don&#39;t think that saying it smells like almonds or bitter almonds is accurate or helpful. However, based on the messages I&#39;ve received, some people are naturally associating cyanide with almonds (sometimes without knowing that this was even a thing and not even knowing they were smelling cyanide).

It was used by lepidopterist to kill butterflies and other insects. The crushed leaves of the Laurel were placed in a glass jar, under a layer of cotton  wool. Insects placed in this &quot;killing&quot; jar, would succumb to the poison, and rapidly  die without their bodies being physically damaged. Crushed Laurel leaves also smell strongly of bitter almonds. The smell does produce a stinging sensation, very similar to chlorine bleach, which maybe why it is described as bitter almonds. The closest most people come to smelling a strong almond scent is from Christmas Cake marzipan,which is flavoured with almond essence. The difference between this and cyanide is the lack of bite and of the threat of imminent death.<br>If you want to smell almonds, the best way is to buy food grade almond essence.<br><br><br>Maybe you should investigate the smell of other disgusting chemicals, arsenic compounds have a very strong garlic smell.<br>Or you might try the less toxic compounds, such as the thiols.

But even the ones prior to that were really good.) They also have a world class narrator, Sheldon Smith.<br><br>The USCSB covers a lot of industrial accidents that involve accidental releases of toxic gases usually resulting in fatalities.<br><br>One that has shown up more than once is Phosgene. Holy smokes, that one is one where if you walk into a small puff of it, you\u2019re fucking dead. You\u2019ll know what I mean when you watch the DuPont plant video with the outdoors Phosgene storage shed with the flexible braided stainless hoses that were supposed to be replaced once a month but were left to be 7 months old and corroded.<br><br>PS: Watch out if you ever clean something with brake clean, and then weld it. The temperature of welding causes any residual brake clean to generate phosgene. I think this is even printed in the fine print of brake clean spray cans. If you catch a whiff of that, it can kill you. There\u2019s a somewhat widespread-shared magazine article about some badass biker-looking tough guy who told the story how it happened to him and knocked him on his ass and he woke up in the hospital emergency room and the doctor said he was lucky to be alive.

The part about some people can&#39;t smell it though, maybe its possible that some people just can&#39;t smell almonds and as such would only detect a chlorine like chemical smell. Personally I don&#39;t even recall raw almonds having a smell, or particular taste at all (just the &quot;earthy&quot; and maybe a Woody smell, kinda like he smelled on the sweet almonds). Might even be a &quot;guy&quot; thing. Maybe a female would be more likely to be able to smell almonds. Maybe even a genetic type thing (while that would explain his bother smelling the same thing, the friend wouldn&#39;t have that similarity, other than still being Canadian.) Who knows, maybe its a Canadian thing, all that proximity to maple syrup has genetically altered Canadian&#39;s ability to smell almonds?<br><br>All that said, yeah he&#39;s right.

Real living cherries don\u2019t smell of benzaldehyde any more than sweet almonds smell like bitter almonds. Honestly the world of smell perception (which I work in) is less about objective measurables and more about psychological factors and neurological quirks. For instance if your brain is unfamiliar with a specific smell it will literally make you perceive a particular smell as something else which your brain IS familiar with. I experienced this professionally with a perfume ingredient called Galbanum - for years whenever a perfume included real galbanum my brain perceived it as the smell of garlic. My brain with no frame of reference for what Galbanum smelt like simply told my conscious mind that it was smelling garlic. It wasn\u2019t until I had fully familiarised myself with real, raw Galbanum absolute that I relatively suddenly began to smell it as it should be - a bitter, dry, green and vegetal smell that has next to nothing in common with the smell of garlic. <br><br>In the case of Cyanide/almond/bitter almond I think there\u2019s a strong case to be made that because much of the cyanide that used to be produced in the historical past was obtained from bitter almonds people began to believe that the smell of cyanide was one and the same as the smell of bitter almond, all the more so since most people would never have smelt strong pure chemical smells all that much in the past. People rarely had access to the kinds of every day chemicals modern people do. Add that to the fact that bitter almond oil was often used to flavour things like marzipan and other sweet almond dishes to boost aroma and add flavour and you end up with an almost universally fixed idea that cyanide smells like \u201calmond\u201d. Nowadays marzipan based foods are less commonly eaten and are not most people\u2019s first point of encounter with a anything that might even be close to having cyanide in it. Instead we are familiar with cleaning chemicals, pool disinfectants, car exhaust fumes, etc etc etc and are readily able to associate smells with the generic \u201cchemical\u201d smell we associate with many of these everyday chemical smell experiences. So it\u2019s probably only natural that to modern noses cyanide no longer smells like bitter almond.", "comment_date": "2020-11-01T12:14:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "F.

That is basically for free, because most people eat the fruit and throw the stones away - the kernels are not used for anything. Apricots are botanically very closely related to almonds and even make hybrids. The apricot kernels are probably somewhere in between of sweet almonds (where the smell is really hard to notice) and bitter (that are too bitter to eat), but that depends a lot on the variety, since apricots were not selected on the basis of their seed edibility and retain the randomness of wild nature. We used to eat a few apricot seeds a day if they are not bitter - 3-4 are safe since they are smaller than almonds. There is amygdalin in the seeds of all other related fruits as well - peaches, plums, cherries, apples etc., although almonds are the largest of them in size and probably more convenient to get in significant total weight. All listed fruit kernels are normally more bitter and toxic than apricots, and not considered edible at all. Even flowers of these plants seem to have a tint of that smell.<br>I used to work with benzaldehyde a few times - and recognized it as the main essence of the apricot/almond kernel smell.

I worked with a lot of pathologists in my career and this doctor was one of the smartest I had ever met. He was the doctor that started figuring the whole thing out. It turned out that some creep wanted to kill his wife for the life insurance, so he laced several packages of Sudafed and planted them around various stores to make it look random.

Sodium thiosulphate is used as antidote for cyanide poisoning as well as fix for photographic film).The only reason I can think of this mixup is that noone have actually dared smelling HCN like this in a safe way and then instead wrongly have assumed that since bitter almonds contain it cyanide would smell like bitter almonds and that assumption have then stuck even it is the benzaldehyde and not the cyanide that gives this smell.

You can use ion chromatography to detect it and more research shows that there&#39;s even a method used to test environmental samples for cyanide.  These detection methods are set forth by the US Environmental Protection Agency.  If you look up EPA 335.4, you find a way to detect cyanide via spectroscopy.  You use a reagent that has a mixture of Pyridine (Has one heck of nasty, fishy smell), Barbituric Acid, and HCL; a reagent that&#39;s a phosphate composition to maintain a buffer; and you use Chloramine-T as the final reagent.

Because it has cyanide in it, albeit at really low concentrations ( around 25 mg of cyanide per kg of almonds). Most prunes (apricots, peaches, almonds) have cyanide in their seeds, to deter animals that crush their seeds while eating them. And the part of the almond we eat is the seed, so it has low levels of cyanide in it. But it&#39;s almost impossible to eat enough almonds to consume dangerous levels of cyanide. An average human needs to eat around 4-5 kilos of almonds to get cyanide poisoning, which is kind of a challenge. <br>The real exciting part is though, how did we domesticate almonds? Because wild almonds, also called bitter almonds have really high levels of cyanide in them. Eating as much as a handful of them could cause serious problems. But maybe 1 out of 1000 wild almonds have a genetic mutation that makes them safe to eat, with low concentrations. So our ancestors must&#39;ve somehow singled out those trees and breed them, cultivating the almonds we eat today. Maybe they observed birds and other animals to determine the safe trees, but still, it&#39;s a huge risk, I personally wouldn&#39;t have taken it.

One of the tanks in there was Potassium Cyanide. It&#39;s used as an electrolyte for copper (specifically, &quot;cyanide copper&quot;, you can electroplate copper also in s sulphuric electrolyte, I can&#39;t remember what the difference is but it has something to do with the metal&#39;s passifying). I was given the same warning about smelling almonds. It&#39;s also used as the electrolyte for gold plating.<br><br>The potassium cyanide tank was high concentration and was an almost syrup. To rinse that off you had to dip the load in the drag out tank (initially water, but slowly would become more and more concentrated with use) and then the sulphuric acid drag out, then mild sulphuric acid tank (+/-30%), back through the sulphuric drag out and then on to the next process. When dipping the load into both the sulphuric drag out/water rinse, and the mild sulphuric tank you could see white plumes of hydrogen cyanide gas forming in the tank. If you skipped any of the tanks in the process or the objects had voids that held the potassium cyanide, the plumes were orders of magnitude larger (watched some imbecile skip two tanks and had to evacuated everyone from the shed).  <br><br>Thing is, I never smelt almonds and these were 6KLtr tanks. I saw considerable plumes generated and never smelt anything. Which made me wonder just as @Nile Red here, if it were true and what I should be looking for in case of a mishap. My theory was I could pretty much kiss my ass goodbye if there was an undetected event, because given the lack of odour for seemingly significant plumes of gas, that there would be little chance of smelling it over the other fumes in the shed, if you even could, by the time the concentration was high enough to kill you.<br><br>Perhaps by the time it smells like almonds, your goose is already cooked?<br><br>As far as using the cyanide for other projects, it&#39;s also used for reactivating passivized metals for plating (might be handy for other things?). E.g. if something is nickel plated and left to stand in the air for too long, it will passivate and the chrome plate won&#39;t stick to it. A 10 second blat through the cyanide tank with the object as the cathode, will reactivate the nickel plating and the chrome plate will then stick to it.<br><br>In the event of Cyanide poisoning, your only chance is Amyl Nitrite, which will buy you enough time for the ambulance ride, after that you&#39;re in the hands of the nurse&#39;s.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Avery Wellsand", "comment_text": "Should bought almond extract", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cameron Castells", "comment_text": "chemical misconceptions as video idea?", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Admiral Mudkip", "comment_text": "I was always told it smelled like bitter almonds", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Torran Stewart", "comment_text": "Idea for using cyanide: poison your enemies.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zerron Kaibo", "comment_text": "Sir, is your sniffer broken?", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Annie", "comment_text": "Reminds me of the video where Cody straight up mixed some cyanide with water and drank it just to show that you need a (relative) <b>lot</b> of it to kill or even affect an adult.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jamie price", "comment_text": "think i remember seeing your tweet on this and i was excited to see the video, glad to see it", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lt JayWagon", "comment_text": "Test what chloroform smells like", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dean", "comment_text": "<b>Immediate Death</b> \ud83d\ude2f", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:40:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dylan jordan", "comment_text": "I want some almond milk now", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Urvag Rawal", "comment_text": "I have smelled almonds, I think they do have a smell....", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Scruffy", "comment_text": "Wonder if this gets taken down... glad I\u2019ve seen it before that!", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Me A Moose", "comment_text": "An Idea for using the cyanide, try and extract metals from circuit boards or general computer scrap components.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrSe66fae", "comment_text": "So i bought a kilogram of cyanide.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "De paus van de Lilith Kerk", "comment_text": "Use it to bake a nice tasting cake and sent it to Bill Gates for his birthday.<br>Edit: the kilo of cyanide ofcourse, not the almonds", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kabir Sangha", "comment_text": "Nice video", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zanthum", "comment_text": "I would absolutely help you smell cyanide but if I remember your location correctly, we are on opposite corners of the continent.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kabir Sangha", "comment_text": "Woah", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Makss Rodionovs", "comment_text": "NileRed: Makes and smells hidrogen cyanide. <br>YouTube: This is fine. <br>NileRed: Throws scissors in the air.<br>YouTube: DEMONETISED", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:39:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gorrila glue", "comment_text": "Jo sniffy", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:38:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebasgr", "comment_text": "NileRed: &quot;Cyanide can kill you&quot;.<br>CodysLab: &quot;Hold my beer&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:38:57Z", "likes_count": 240}, {"comment_by": "Trevor Robinson", "comment_text": "Make some super glue", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:38:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Davestar2048", "comment_text": "D E T H  B O K S", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:38:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cat king", "comment_text": "No, almond smells like cyanide", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T19:38:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin St. John", "comment_text": "You could try and pull some silver or gold out of ore with the sodium cyanide.

For this reason, a small amount of potassium cyanide, was added to the sample containing several heavy metals. This solution had to be boiled then, in the hood of course. One &quot;expert&quot; did this step on his workbench outside the hood and a faint scent of HCN filled the lab. That was also detected by our chemistry teacher/supervisor and the guy was called immediately  in the supervisor&#39;s office for a &quot;briefing&quot;. My next encounter with HCN was a year later, while a laboratory assistent in my neighbourhood carried out a whole series of experiments for the synthesis of Mandelic Acid, starting from from benzaldehyde, 30% NaCN-solution und H2SO4. The HCN was released in situ and added onto the aldehyde to form the cyanhydrine, which was hydrolysed in the next step. Here, one or two times, traces of HCN managed to escape from the vessel.

You know, Alkylchlorines can react with iodides and form the metal chloride and the alkyliodide, however as the Iodide is WAY more reactive it will immediately turn back.
