At the time this video was made, this was also true.  Thiomerosal was agreed upon by committee to be reduced and removed from all vaccines in 1999 [1].  As of 2001, Thiomerosal has been removed from all vaccines administered to children in the US [1].<br><br>A complete list of Thiomerosal-containing vaccines used in the US can be found at [2].  In influenza vaccines, the amount of mercury is minute.  The largest dose of Thiomerosal is 25mcg per vaccine dose of 0.5ml [2].  This may sound like a lot, but that is 0.025mg, or 2.5E-5g.  I could not find trials that specifically test the toxicity of thiomerosal, but absorption is minimal compared to this example.  Dimethylmercury, the most dangerous and readily absorbed compound of mercury, is deadly at 5mg/kg.  Mercury can affect neurons at any concentration, but it appears to cause degeneration around 0.2mg/L (blood concentration) [3,4].  The average human has 5L of blood, so 1mg is meaningfully dangerous.  I could not find how much of the mercury in thiomerosal is converted to biosoluble products, but let&#39;s assume it&#39;s all converted to ethylmercury.  At this rate, it would take 400 influenza vaccines to cause harm to a person IF ethylmercury was never excreted from the body.  Ethylmercury (EtHg) is FAR less blood soluble than dimethylmercury ((CH3)2Hg) and will be converted to biosoluble products at a significantly lower rate.  Additionally, I found the half life of EtHg was about a week, while (CH3)2Hg has a half life of 1.5 months (6 week) [5].  Within 6 weeks, 98.4% of the EtHg is removed from the body.  This means that realistically, you would have to get many MANY more vaccines than 400 to build up any dangerous amount of mercury in your body.  Keep in mind that the flu shot is yearly, and most humans don&#39;t live past 100.  To be deadly, a child at 9 pounds (4kg) would need 8,000 flu vaccines to be deadly (within about a month).  An adult at 150 pounds (68kg) would need 136,000 vaccinations to be life-threatening.  Again, this assumes dimethylmercury is used and not thiomerosal.<br><br>Treatment for mercury exposure do exist and have been found in multiple trials to increase mercury excretion through urine at a statistically significant level.  2,3-dimercaptopropanol-sulfonic acid (DMPS) was not found to decrease blood mercury in most trials.  However, any mercury excreted from the body obviously reduces mercury content in other areas of the body (such as fat and neuronal tissues) [6].  This assumes a patient does not continue to consume mercury, as DMPS does not contain any of the aforementioned element.<br><br>Any reasonable conclusion of my research shows that EVEN IN VACCINES WITH MERCURY, THE AFFECTS ARE LITTLE TO NONE.  Again, FEW TO NO vaccines administered today contain ANY mercury.  Mercury is dangerous, but vaccines can&#39;t harm you with mercury.<br><br>Please do not propagate the fear of vaccines.  Outdated chemicals that are almost never used pose no risk, but fear of vaccines is currently responsible for the deaths of thousands of people with COVID-19.  Also, NONE OF THE VACCINES FOR COVID-19 CONTAIN THIOMEROSAL.  How&#39;s that for peace of mind?<br><br>-------------------------<br>Personal note:<br><br>If you made it this far, thank you!  I spent about 2 hours researching this specifically on top of my undergraduate education in chemistry and biology.  I&#39;ve seen a few things from NileRed which seemed dangerous, but this obviously pushed me over the edge.  I&#39;m not attacking the credibility of NileRed, I just wish he&#39;d practice some lab safety and do some more research once in a while.<br><br>You deserve a cookie.<br><br>-------------------------<br>References:<br><br>[1] Thiomerosal and Vaccines.

Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father\u201d. <br><br>JESUS CHRIST WAS GOD IN THE FLESH; Son of God. <br><br>John 1:1-5<br>\u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it\u201d.<br><br>John 1:14 <br>\u201cThe Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth\u201d. <br><br>How to get SALVATION (be saved):<br><br>1. Admit that you are a sinner.<br>Romans 3:32 <br> \u201cFor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\u201d. <br>Romans 6:23 <br>\u201cFor the wages of sin is death\u201d.<br><br>2. Believe that Jesus paid for your sin at the cross.<br>Romans 5:8 <br>\u201cBut God demonstrates His own love for us: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us\u201d. <br>Romans 6:23 <br>\u201cbut the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus\u201d. <br>Ephesians 2:8-9<br>\u201cFor it is by grace you have been saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\u2014not by works, so that no one can boast.\u201d <br><br>3. Confess that Jesus is the Son of God, and commit your life to him. <br>Romans 10:9 <br>\u201cThat if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved\u201d.  <br><br>4. Repent (What does repent mean and do? To repent is a change of mind, that leads to a change of heart, that leads to a change in actions. This \u201cchange\u201d involves both a turning from sin and a turning to God.)<br>Luke 13:3 <br>\u201cBut unless you repent, you too will all perish\u201d. <br>Acts 3:19 <br>\u201cRepent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord\u201d. <br>2 Peter 3:9 <br>\u201cThe Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance\u201d. <br><br>WARNINGS!!!<br>Anyone who does not have Jesus Christ will always be condemned and their righteous deeds are like filthy rags. <br><br>Romans 1:8 \u201cThere is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit\u201d.<br><br>Isaiah 64:6 \u201cAll of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away\u201d. <br><br>Do not worship/sacrifice to other gods; you will only bring harm to yourself. <br>Jeremiah 25:6<br>\u201cand do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the work of your hands, and I will do you no harm\u201d. <br><br>Deuteronomy 8:19 <br>\u201cIt shall come about if you ever forget the Lord your God and go after other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you will surely perish\u201d.<br><br>1 Corinthians 10:20 <br>\u201cNo, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons\u201d. <br><br>TAKE HEED NOW!!!<br>Jesus Christ wants you to have a personal relationship with him. He cares and loves you more than his own life that he gave it up for you to be saved. Jesus Christ is the ultimate sacrifice for all mankind; to atoned away all of our sins with his precious life and blood, that we may share in his Kingdom (1 John 2:2 \u201cHe is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world\u201d). <br>Jesus Christ is not about being religious but to be in unity with him and allow him to deliver you from the bondage that this sinful body (flesh) is doomed for; eternal hell (John 3:36 \u201cWhoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him\u201d). <br>Only through Jesus Christ will you ever get to heaven (John 10:9 \u201cI am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture\u201d). Seek Jesus Christ only: no other gods can save you from God\u2019s wrath. God\u2019s wrath is not a joke or to be taken lightly (Hebrews 10:31 \u201cIt is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God\u201d). Remember he is our Creator and all things are possible with him (Matthew 19:26). <br><br>May God bless you and soften your heart to discern the truth that is in Christ Jesus, the Lord of Lords and King of Kings; the Savior of this world.", "comment_date": "2021-06-22T07:43:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suzanne Rlnds", "comment_text": "So interesting.

One of the issues with this was that the people who were processing the gold would eat mercury covered gold to steal it and because gold can\u2019t be digested . . . Let\u2019s just say they found it later. The guy whose job it was to burn off the mercury was constantly surrounded by mercury vapor so he dies in five to six years. His children run around the shop, they have six or seven. The guys who ate the gold to steal it had seven or eight but it\u2019s not used anymore except for Alaska and some other places, nowadays people generally use borax.

I avoid mercury like poison today and even old mercury treated photo album paper can give me small clusters of itchy blisters many years later.

Mercury has been historically used as purgative due to its density. Are you constipated (not shitting...)? Then, the doctor would have recommended one drop of mercury. Now, we have other products less... extreme.

It is not poisonous like the stupid propaganda today says. As you saw in the video, he submerged his fingers in it and another person did the entire hand. It could get into your body through cuts, so just be careful not to expose open wounds to mercury. Ingesting it is also relatively safe as it will go through your digestive system and come out intact on the other side if you know what I mean. It is not a good idea to do that just because you could have wounds inside your digestive system (ulcers or similar) and then it could get into your blood there. And as you saw, fish doesn\u2019t have plain mercury but a mix of chemicals which is what makes it bad. While it is not a good idea to play with mercury if you don\u2019t know what you are doing, it is NOT as crazy bad as most people think today. And if you saw the video, you saw the part showing gold being devoured by mercury. It is for real, if you have gold rings on your fingers and you play even with a tiny amount of mercury, as soon it touches the gold, it will consume it, the ring will disappear in front of your eyes. Gone. Bye bye ring. So don\u2019t mix the two elements unless you don\u2019t care about losing money or you have a lab to extract the gold back.

Other facts to mention include the types of toxicity exhibited by mercury compounds, such as their mutagenic, teratogenic, neurotoxic, nephrotoxic, immuno-suppressant, and (probable) carcinogenic properties.

Use a piece of card to gather the droplets together if they are finely divided. Collect any broken glass and other debris into a suitable container.

I met a professor before that will tell you that is bull crap, and only leads to people arrogantly touching poison ivy because they think they have a resistance or a immunity. You don&#39;t risk touching it no matter what. The same with mercury. People did not realize how harmful it is to the body for millennia until the 20th century when they done research to it. It is one of those substances that you only realize it is harming you when it is too late, or after investigating it. That is why you should not trust people saying it is okay to touch it.

Dude where is your fucking scientific method? Do you just say forget it and just do what the hell you want? Yes, you can do that but that is bad science and can give misinformation(like you did in this video).  Your videos are pretty much from copy paste from wikipedia(don&#39;t lie I looked it up and you pretty much ripped it off).  Look if you want to practice real science do some research of your own. Don&#39;t get me wrong wikipedia can be a great place for knowledge. Not understanding it or doing your own research shows you didn&#39;t learn anything from it. Please stop making videos that give out misinformation. AGAIN EVEN THOUGH YOUR SKIN HAS A LOW ABSORPTION TO LIQUID MERCURY IT IS STILL DANGEROUS TO HANDLE IT!!! Don&#39;t you dare say it isn&#39;t because it is. So again please stop making videos and educate yourself on the scientific method and maybe go to college(if you are then you aren&#39;t learning anything).

I have also flagged this video as DANGEROUS and harmful to others. I am also going to report you to patreon too showing all of your videos where you can potentially get some one hurt. I am doing this as you do give out misinformation and could possibly get someone killed. Even though it is a low chance you are the one that made that person think it is safe to do so.
