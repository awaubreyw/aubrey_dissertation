This life is temporary once you die you spend eternity in one of two places so choose heaven or hell. Jesus loved you to die for you. He says you all are valuable if you turn from your sins he will bless you like never before and he wants to call you son and daughter but whenever you sin you choose hell and choose to hate God. Now you may say I&#39;m a good person which is actually not true (Mark 10:18). But did you know that not even forgiving others is enough to send you to hell. Jesus is very serious about sin in fact Jesus says most people go to hell and few enter heaven (Mathew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L8yUY-doNc&amp;t=7m13s\">7:13</a>-14). No sin is worth going to hell for when someone goes to hell you can never escape your there forever and you will feel the pain forever . It&#39;s not worth it You can live in heaven forever where Jesus serves you food and you can be in God&#39;s presence forever where you&#39;re never sad or depressed and have a mansion as well. There is Good news If you come to Jesus humbly and confess your sins and beg him for mercy and forgiveness he will forgive you. But you can&#39;t continue to willfully sin (Hebrews 10:26) Because Jesus also says if you love me keep my commandments (John 14:15) you immediately need to repent from all your sins (Luke 13:3) and follow up with Jesus. Remember Follow Jesus only no religion no man Jesus rose from the dead. We have 500 eyewitnesses of it. Jesus is coming back soon with no mercy, seek the lord now while he may be found. When he rose from the dead he proved everything he said was true Muhamad or Buddha didn&#39;t rise from the dead.

Instead of using PCB etchant though, I just made an electrolytic cell with kosher salt solution and a wad of steel wool as the anode. I used a piece of copper pipe as a cathode, but I don&#39;t think the cathode material really matters. After a few minutes of electrolysis, the solution became basic, due to sodium reacting with water to produce hydroxide ions and hydrogen gas at the cathode, and what appeared to be iron (II) chloride began precipitating. Eventually, the steel wool fell apart so much that electrolysis almost ceased. At that point I dumped the liquid into a beaker, using a magnet to separate out all the particles of steel wool. I put the beaker on my stove and heated it. At a certain point, magnetite particles formed. It was obvious when this happened because the liquid turned black fairly abruptly.<br><br>I was able to confirm that the particles I produced were magnetite because I could stir the liquid, making it completely opaque, then hold a magnet to the side, which attracted all the particles, leaving behind a clear liquid. I intended to acquire some oleic acid and attempt to make a colloid, but then I moved and haven&#39;t really had space to experiment since. It would be interesting to see my experiment to completion. If quality magnetite could be produced with steel wool and salt, one could make a large quantity of ferrofluid very inexpensively.", "comment_date": "2020-04-29T00:24:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sabastion Downs", "comment_text": "Has anyone tried replicating his experiment personally?", "comment_date": "2020-04-28T23:06:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Stig", "comment_text": "You should discover something", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T19:33:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juice", "comment_text": "Cursed coca cola", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T14:28:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zen Beatbox", "comment_text": "I wanna play with that ferrofluid in the water :(", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T10:53:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Francis Balfour", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L8yUY-doNc&amp;t=32m40s\">32:40</a> what caused that second smaller part to refuse to mix with the rest of the fluid?", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T04:28:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omnical", "comment_text": "wouldn&#39;t it be cheaper to just buy ferrofluid?", "comment_date": "2020-04-26T22:33:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack Anthem", "comment_text": "Can you run a test with a crazy powerful electromagnet?", "comment_date": "2020-04-26T19:05:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Geek Cats United", "comment_text": "This is always so satisfying and calming to watch", "comment_date": "2020-04-26T18:42:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "King_Reaper", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s been done or not but I wonder i you could suspend a ferrofluid in mid air?", "comment_date": "2020-04-26T05:44:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "spencer miller", "comment_text": "Who watches these videos but have no idea what the fuck he\u2019s saying", "comment_date": "2020-04-25T20:55:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dee", "comment_text": "I want this", "comment_date": "2020-04-25T20:31:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A", "comment_text": "nice video", "comment_date": "2020-04-25T12:56:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChaosMinecraft", "comment_text": "Hi NileRed.

Reactant A circulated freely trough the large tube, and reactant be was addes into the mixture against the current of reactant a trough the smaller tube. Apparently, they could control particle size very tightly simply by varying flow rate of reactant A and injection rate of reactant B. Can&#39;t find the documentary tough. This might be something you could look into tough. Seems like it would make for a much more controlled setup and eliminate your oxidation problems.

Chemistry completely flummoxed me, starting with the concept of the mole, and the idea of being able to calculate reactions. I had a poor teacher, and I had little respect for her.  Fifty years and two college degrees later, I ran across a HS Chem lecture series by Frank Cardulla of Niles North HS in Skokie IL. It was thirty half-hour videos.  He initially seemed to be a good teacher, and proved to be excellent as the series progressed.  I worked my way through the first half, just enough to know that I could have done well at HS Chem had there been a teacher of his quality involved.  Satisfied, I left chemistry behind once again, since at age 68 there was little need for HS chemistry in my daily life, but at least I can now follow along videos like these as a fan, if not a participant.\r<br>\r<br>You said you bought a \u201cnice\u201d overhead mixer from Amazon.

I\u2019m sure the mixer will have many future uses, but still, throwing down $400+ for the one tool needed to complete one project shows real dedication.

(paints don&#39;t use oleic acid because it never cures, at least not in a useful way) <br>Or rather, to use linseed oil or safflower oil instead of the kerosene (because I see that the magnetite is quite dry powder)? <br>Could you use different materials instead of the magnetic iron compound? I&#39;m thinking that coating each particle with the oil at a nano-level would increase the transparency and the flow of the pigments, I might be wrong tho. But if I&#39;m not, it could spell a whole new age for oil painting, especially for the old-style paintings, like these that use multiple thin layers of paint to obtain depth and vivid colours (it&#39;s called glazing and because each layer contains only one colour and it&#39;s cured between applications, the pigments do not conflict with each other and thus are more intense, Vermeer and Leonardo dV used it, for example).<br>Currently, oil paints are made by straight-up mixing fine ground pigments with linseed oil or safflower oil and while the high-quality paints are really well mixed I doubt they could rival individual coating of pigment particles.<br>I applied to the giveaway but I wasn&#39;t one of the winners.", "comment_date": "2019-08-03T12:16:51Z", "likes_count": 21}, {"comment_by": "Walker Manning", "comment_text": "would you consider making an iron dagger out of the iron from blood? pigs blood?", "comment_date": "2019-08-03T05:51:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "turtle luvr", "comment_text": "Are you ok?

In order to stop myself from completely dissecting this video i&#39;ll keep this short. The best way I see to get more consistent product is during the creating the Fe2+ is to be consistent with the amount used. From watching the video this seems to be the most inconsistent step. having a measured volume of fluid and mass of steel wool added will probably do most of the work for getting a better product. If you want to be more precise, with a bit of guessing you can determine the mass of the original iron chloride in the copper etchant by using a known volume of etchant and get the mass. Combine this with the composition you showed at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L8yUY-doNc&amp;t=2m29s\">2:29</a> will get a decent approximation of how much FeCl3 there is and then how much steel wool to add, molarity, and etc.<br>During the stirring to create the Fe2+/Fe3+ mix, using a consistent way to increase the speed when running a batch could be helpful.<br>Lastly during the washing step, when you separate the magnetite into three separate beakers, if you were to measure the mass to be consistent and possibly do the same with the amount of water/alcohol added per rinse. Also use a stopwatch to be consistent with how long you let the iron settle. <br><br>p.s. maybe creating a small buffer solution to add to your ferrous chloride so you don&#39;t need to keep adding acid or add a bit of CO2 to store it under an inert atmosphere from some baking soda and vinegar.", "comment_date": "2019-07-09T22:14:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karsten T", "comment_text": "Fantastic!!", "comment_date": "2019-07-09T22:05:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zack", "comment_text": "Awesome as always!

Another thing I noticed is that the reaction is much more reproducible and the nanoparticles are much smaller and uniform when the reagents are both as diluted as possible (the water is equally divided between the two solution): is it possible to tinker with the FeII-FeIII and ammonia solutions so that they have the same volume? Maybe instead of starting with a beaker full of water, use only half the amount and add the other half to the ammonia<br><br>The last thing I want to mention is that when you washed your particles using the magnet to filter the good from the bad, you are actually discarding the smallest ones: this is because the smallest nanoparticles remain suspended for a much longer time.

The issue with your method is that the ammonia is mixed into the iron salts slowly, which causes two problems: 1. The growth of particles happens slowly over the course of several minutes which is ideal for growing large crystals instead of nanoparticles. 2. The particles that are formed in the beginning of the reaction is formed inside a liquid with a different concentration and pH than the particles that are formed later (concentration varies during the course of the ammonia addition), hence you will end up with a larger variation in particle size and morphology.<br><br>The best way to make magnetite nanoparticles (that I know of) is to use a T-mixer type of mixing method, where the two liquids (Iron salt mixture and ammonia) is simultaneously and at the same rate pushed/flowed into a T or Y crossing, so that they instantly mix under high speed, and importantly, the resultant liquid and particles flows away into a separate channel and container where they never come in contact with unreacted ammonia or iron salt, this prevents additional particle growth from occurring.<br><br>Here is a short paper explaining such a method written by some colleagues of mine. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237842518_Rapid_mixing_A_route_to_synthesize_magnetite_nanoparticles_with_high_moment\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237842518_Rapid_mixing_A_route_to_synthesize_magnetite_nanoparticles_with_high_moment</a>", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T23:11:09Z", "likes_count": 157}, {"comment_by": "Blombor", "comment_text": "is it possible that you give us the doi of mentioned a paper (influence of the temperature)", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T23:10:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Besogonov", "comment_text": "Why not mix Fe2 and Fe3 under a nitrogen atmosphere?", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T23:10:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jurusco", "comment_text": "What if you keep blowing some pure nitrogen or some other gas on the top in the stiring part, would it help maybe? <br>Sorry if it&#39;s a too dumb question, i&#39;m not good in chemistry.", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T23:10:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Heim-Salgado", "comment_text": "Your final results are amazing, this isn\u2019t just the best homemade ferrofluid I\u2019ve seen but may be the best period, absolutely love this video and this is the first giveaway I\u2019ve actually been excited by", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T23:10:40Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "arthroxon n\u00f6", "comment_text": "Dude the art part is actually a commercial niche that could be very nice overall!

So I suspect the setup you are using causes the lack of reproducibility between batches. Indeed faster stirring will introduce more oxygen into solution, but you can counter that by purging the solution with N2 gas during synthesis. Furthermore, an addition funnel is not a reliable way of adding a chemical if the addition speed is a key parameter. It might be better to use a syringe pump to control the addition speed of the base. Lastly, instead of adding the base in a dropwise manner, you can also slowly inject it into solution. This will limit local pH differences at the solution-air interface which could increase the reproducibility. Anyway, these are just some of my thoughts on the synthesis procedure.
