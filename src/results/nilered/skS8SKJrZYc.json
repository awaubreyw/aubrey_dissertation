Repeated aldehyde adduct precipitations may be in order to complete extraction. Then react the cleaned aldehyde adduct with dilute HCl or NaOH to recover free aldehyde and extract with DCM in a sep funnel just as done in this video.

Such CH3 should appear in the spectrum in a chemical shift lower than the 2.5 where you cut the spectrum, so it makes me wonder if you have another peak that you aren&#39;t showing.
