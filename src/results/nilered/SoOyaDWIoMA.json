At best, your ISP could tell what sites you&#39;ve connected to, but not the page you&#39;re looking at, nor any information you send them, filling in forms etc. All they get is the address of the server itself, pretty useless.<br><br>VPNs are meant for office workers, who want to connect to their company&#39;s network. Instead of connecting directly to the company network with a cable, they use the Internet instead. It&#39;s not a private, off-Internet network, it&#39;s a virtual private network. You use the Internet as the equivalent on a network cable, between you and your office, and it&#39;s encrypted for the sake of privacy.<br><br>If you don&#39;t have an office network to connect to, you don&#39;t need a VPN. If you do, you likely already have one. The VPN advertised here essentially connects you to the Internet, through the Internet! You have an encrypted connection between your computer and, say, Switzerland. Then in Switzerland there&#39;s an Internet connection that you connect to. So you appear to be browsing from Switzerland. That&#39;s really limited usefulness. All the other stuff, virus protection, encryption, you get from somewhere else. <br><br>Most people don&#39;t need a VPN, and those who do, already have one. <br><br>Yes I suppose you could connect to Netflix in Australia. Though you&#39;re still using the same login and password Netflix gave you, so they know who you are and where you&#39;re located cos you have a customer account. At the moment they might allow you to watch foreign stuff on foreign servers. They could switch that off at any time, similarly they could allow users to view foreign content at any time, if they wanted to. It&#39;s a pretty weak reason to do this.<br><br>There&#39;s also the issue of having to trust the VPN company itself. They become your Internet connection. Everything you access, is through them. Sure they make promises about privacy, of course they do. But if you can trust them, why can&#39;t you trust your own ISP? Unless you live in North Korea or something. But I doubt North Korea allows people to connect to VPNs.<br><br>It&#39;s annoying how these ads all contain, if not lies, then &quot;technically true&quot; information. It&#39;s as close to lying without actually lying, some VPN companies have already copped trouble for misleading advertising.", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T22:33:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AnFer", "comment_text": "Ok, the sodium is tarnished, but is it maidenless?", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T21:58:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Watru 7", "comment_text": "Nitrogen is denser than air?", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T09:03:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rudy's Cookaza", "comment_text": "His voice has become heavier", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T06:49:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Connor", "comment_text": "You should mix Plutonium with dark matter and lava.", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T06:23:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "__", "comment_text": "The forbidden cheese", "comment_date": "2022-06-19T06:20:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Numidia Interactive", "comment_text": "Nice ad", "comment_date": "2022-06-18T22:40:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "darabbit333", "comment_text": "Remember when these &quot;long&quot; videos was a thing?

I live smack in the middle of the Sierra Nevada foothills in California, the epicenter of the Gold Rush of 1849.  Even now, 170 years later the small streams in every direction are clogged with inveterate optimists who plan to retire on the profit from the 6 lb. gold nugget they expect to pan out of Squirrel Creek.  It&#39;s ruined the trout fishing \u2014 you can&#39;t cast in any direction without snagging one of these lunkheads.<br>\r<br>\r<br>                I digress.  My patient had been panning up in the hills and was extracting the tiny bit of gold in the quartz dust he held IN A TEASPOON.  He poured a little Mercury into the spoon, and proceeded to heat the mixture over a small flame.  After an hour or so sitting over this process, inhaling the fumes, he realized he couldn&#39;t stand, couldn&#39;t walk or use his hands, and could barely talk.<br>\r<br>\r<br>                As I type this, I notice a thumbnail to the right for a video by the latest genius to hold the crown of The King of Random.

Air is a mix of about 79% N2, 20% O2 and a fractional % of other gases.  N2 has atomic number 7, O2 is atomic number 8  which tends to suggest O2 is heavier than air and N2.  Looking at densities at STP (Std temp &amp; press) O2 is heavier than air (according to the density table I looked at) both air and N2.  I think the reason this works is the flask neck is so small, there is insufficient time for the atmospheric air to enter the flask to mess with the reaction.", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T19:17:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Traor\u00e9 Neymar", "comment_text": "Mais je esq le sodium metabisulte peut donn\u00e9 le mercure gris une couleur rouge vos r\u00e9ponse svp", "comment_date": "2021-09-30T19:28:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Online Shopping Jakarta", "comment_text": "Sodium mercury destroyer.

Now I am an ongoing alchemist with no tutoring. Which means I am studing natural sciences from the olden days all alone. This means I have to read alot of old books on alchemy. But I have nobody with which I can relate this learning with, because I am alone. Now you might say: &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you find somebody!&quot;. Well, the things I am learning about and when I find it, will be so crazy, influential, healthy, wealth empowering and an experimental Jackpot that it is always better to keep a low profile from the get go.. Be that as it may, in the end of your video you were experimenting with ammonia... Pretty flippen close to what alchemists experiment with, only your mercury is industrial. Ours is prepared. The same with ammonia.. Industrial. But just for informations sake and as you mention earlier in your video, you had no referrence about these ratios between mercury and sodium concentrations. Well, the Alchemist does... I won&#39;t tell you, because you haven&#39;t read as much on Alchemy as I have.. This should be an incentive... But this one experiment, is something I will give you. You showed us all that sodium is a cool reactor and does some cool things and as you also showed ammonia did some cool things too. Now, this is mearly a suggestion. I have never tried this like you can, but maybe you will be interested. Take your mercury and put it together with sodium and ammonia. You might want to go directly to the source, because there is a name for these two in one. And it&#39;s called Sal-Ammoniac... But there is a draw-back here. The reaction may not be immediate. It may not even be interesting with Sal-Ammoniac. You might just want to mix Ammonia and Sodium and Mercury together, but as pure as you can get it. But it is these three, in their perfect porportions that the Alchemist.... I believe... have been using to make their wonderful and magical elixer. The Philosophers Stone... Investigate alittle about this... And if you do, be informed that not everything here, has much to do with reactions but more towards development. One of natures most prized secrets...

Once crystalization started, it would take off like a rocket, as such solutions do. Could that crystalization have captured liquid mercury within the crystals? We know this can happen--they&#39;re called fluid inclusions, and can have multiple phases. (I once nearly got tossed out of a jewelry store for pointing out the diamond has a fluid inclusion--which cost them a sale, as to me it increased the value of the stone.) But I haven&#39;t seen it for dendritic crystals. Mercury and sodium are weird, though, at least compared to silicates, so maybe this was happening to a certain extent...This would also explain the &quot;paste&quot; on the surface of the liquid material. The different solid Na/Hg phases would have different melting points, but seem to be (at least somewhat) soluble in the liquid material. As it cools, the phases with higher melting points would fall out of solution. This is called fractional crystalization. It has a lot of uses--for example, you can use it to increase alcohol content of fluids, because water ice forms at a higher temperature than water/alcohol mixture ices do. (No, I&#39;m not recommending it--I&#39;m just saying, I&#39;ve seen it done.) The thing to remember about liquids is that they&#39;re liquid ON AVERAGE. At the atomic scale you get very small, very short-lived crystals forming constantly; they just get dissolved as soon as they from. Random chance can, if the liquid is cooled far enough below the freezing point, produce larger crystals that last longer. This works during any phase change--it&#39;s why you don&#39;t microwave water without something like chop sticks in it.

You just need to electrolyze salt water with a mercury cathode and a heavy current and voila, you have your sodium amalgam. You can&#39;t NORMALLY make much progress making sodium metal by electrolysis of salt water since it would react with the water as you form it, but when the cathode is mercury it&#39;s an exception, because when it is an alloy that is mostly mercury, it reacts much slower with the water, and what will happen is that the concentration of sodium in the alloy will increase until it reaches an equilibrium rate where it is formed and dissolved into the mercury at the same rate that the sodium atoms that make it to the surface react with the water. This is also a viable way of making sodium metal at room temperature, rather than trying to melt salt and pass electricity through it and not have the hot molten sodium burst into flames when it floats to the surface. The only problem is that if you want to have pure sodium at the end, you would then have to distill it away from the mercury, and with that amount of nuisance, you might as well just electrolyze molten salt in a box filled with argon to begin with. Also, without the distillation, the best you&#39;ll probably be able to do is maybe 5% sodium 95% mercury, in other words a concentration where it reacts with the water slowly and resembles alkaseltzer.

You don&#39;t need to even have any pure sodium metal to mix with mercury. All you need is to do electrolysis of salt water with a mercury cathode. The more current you put through it, the higher the percentage of sodium you can attain, since obviously it will react with the water, but it will start as pure mercury and gain in percentage as sodium until it reaches equilibrium. You should be able to reduce sodium into the metal at a rate so that it only reacts with water at the level of alkaseltzer, for about 5% sodium total (by number of atoms.... so that&#39;d be less than 1% by weight, if you want to measure it that way). This will still be liquid at room temperature, but you can make it more pure sodium by one stage of distillation. This is actually a decent method of making sodium metal using nothing but relatively low temperatures.<br><br><br>Also, NO, pure nitrogen is NOT denser than air, it is LESS dense than air. This should be obvious. Air is a mixture of nitrogen with other gases that are all denser than nitrogen.

This is likely how they got the concentration so high before it solidifies.

I honestly admire your hard work that is effectively shaping how science is communicating in the 21st century. But as you already experienced, the research step is really hard and I&#39;m pretty sure it takes a lot of your time to find the information you need to put these experiments together. I see you usually reference videos in the description, but not the actual papers you read. Some appear in the video sometimes (like this one), but showing the references in the description would be very useful for other students and industry people that are interested in the details.<br><br>Think about it - the work you do here has many orders of magnitude more impact than any scientific paper out there. You literally translate and present in a visually understandable way what chemistry is about. You&#39;re highly searchable and visible as a free resource to the public. But you are kinda responsible to reference to these hard working scientists, because they are unfortunate to (mostly) not have the time neither the talent to create videos that communicate with the same level of impact as you do. So think about the low-paid hard-working graduate student in the bottom of the food chain - He would be really grateful if you referenced his paper in a video. As a graduate student myself (in a completely different field, Mech. E.), I assure you that writing a paper most of the time feels like shouting in the void. But I also am understanding that the paper - even though it is a crippled format for today&#39;s technology - is how scientists worldwide get their food in their tables. It is their bottomline. So they kinda have to write like that. <br><br>I wrote a lot but the main point here is that just putting the link or the reference of the papers and the author&#39;s names would be a benefit that should come at a small cost for you (I&#39;m sure you keep track of the relevant papers you found). I&#39;m not even into chemistry and I still do watch your content - and I definitely feel what those graduate students have to do in order to write the papers you see out there. The paper format makes it so bland and cold that it is easy to forget that there are actual people behind it.", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T09:39:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anil Kumar Totakura", "comment_text": "You grew so much so fast.", "comment_date": "2019-01-02T09:33:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dmitry Shintyakov", "comment_text": "I wonder what would happen if you put a drop of guanidinium chloride solution on it.
