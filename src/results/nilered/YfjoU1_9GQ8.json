Going fully anhydrous has the vantage to leave your DNBP stable but also, not bending your paper so much (paper bending and retraction is a massive problem with water-solvent based inks in printmaking). <br><br>Other solution as to avoid a anhydrous-solvent solution (as they\u2019re generally fairly more toxic) is to work, as for screen printing, with an emulsion between castor oil, water, and a siccative agent. Basically a said water-based print screen ink or a transparent acrylic medium should be just fine. With the screen print one though you can have a better control on how you coat your image as you can print an empty frame or alternatively, print your image itself. With the gesso just work like you did. There are transfer gesso/mediums that are designed to avoid bending.<br><br>Also, sunlight is a shit light source for any kind of exposure.

Its primary weakness was lack of (visual) saturation, because the blacks didn&#39;t get very dark, due to a lack of silver salt (chloride and/or iodide and/or bromide) crystals.<br><br>The solution is to make an emulsion.  Modern day emulsions are made from &quot;hard&quot; (acid-dissolved, high melting temp) gelatin, into which the photosensitive chemicals are mixed, and layered on (in, of course, complete darkness, because silver salts are so light-sensitive).<br><br>In the 1800s, such emulsions were made with egg white, to make what was called &quot;albumen prints&quot;<br><br>Albumen paper is made by carefully breaking bird eggs (don&#39;t break the yolks), and pouring off the clear liquid to separate container use while using a coarse barrier to keep the yolks in the original container (even a coffee cup and a finger held to create a small opening for the white to pour out through can work in a pinch.)<br><br>Paper would be hand-coated, by paint brush) with a silver-salt-in-egg-white mixture, and each sheet hung by the corner in a dark room to dry using a paperclip or laundry clothes pin.  After this layer dried, the paper would be unevenly coated, with a diagonal gradient away from the top corner towards the bottom corner.   The solution is to coat the paper a 2nd time, and hang from the opposite corner.<br><br>My understanding is that the egg white emulsion smells TERRIBLE while it&#39;s drying  (So, you might want to do this outside on a length of twine hung in a garage or a shed).  You still want to do it inside a building, because you don&#39;t want dust getting into your egg white, and you don&#39;t want the wind whipping it around.  Putting a fan in the room for GENTLE air circulation isn&#39;t a problem.  Room should be reasonably dust-free.   Putting a furnace-filter capable of trapping dust (not just lint) on the intake side of a box fan works well as a dust-remover.<br><br>If you have ever seen any black and white print on albumen paper with your own eyes, the quality is absolutely startling, even those which were created during the 1860&#39;s, due to the barely visible thickness of the albumen emulsion.  These were all handmade using zero automation, as nobody had come up with a way to quickly dry albumen paper in a horizontal position, and hanging uses so much less space (vertical orientation), and requires far less material (2 nails plus length of twine plus clothes pins, vs tables", "comment_date": "2021-12-27T03:56:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WeebyZack\u30c4", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who thought it was a gummy bear?", "comment_date": "2021-12-25T16:02:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LunaPlaysMinecraft", "comment_text": "rainbow plastic: material that can summon gods", "comment_date": "2021-12-21T19:50:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary_Saotome._.S1mp", "comment_text": "We are all technically colorblind because we don\u2019t see the true color of the thing we see what is reflected", "comment_date": "2021-12-18T01:12:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Osmone Everony", "comment_text": "You want ideas what to make?

Once you nitrate the ortho position of the benzene the reaction will stop there because the tri-nitrated form  won&#39;t form in those conditions. Plus even if you nitrate the ortho position first (this will happen to some extent) the pyridine ring will be &quot;locked&quot; facing in the other direction, definitely covering the other ortho position, thus making the para position even more reactive. So, with those two effects together, I think that the amount of ortho-ortho product will be negligible.

Your results look not dissimilar to Liquid Light, which is a commercially available black and white photo emulsion paint, that you develop using standard photo darkroom chemicals. I also suggest looking into anthotypes, where plants are used to create photographic emulsions, as they could pose similar issues in terms of getting a good coating on the paper.<br>Make sure to use unbleached paper, do multiple coats of your emulsion, use an airbrush if possible (assuming the particles won&#39;t clog the nozzle) and coat vertically, then horizontally as required to get a better result. I would guess you  probably need about 5-10 coats, each thoroughly dried in between to get a good result. In addition I would use a darker transparency and make sure the blacks are really opaque, as required when exposing screen printing screens. The blacks on your negative look like they might be a little thin, a simple solution to this is to layer two identical negatives to increase the opacity, or to print negatives at a higher ink density.<br>I wonder if the photochromaticism of the bears has changed over time?

I wonder if the coating would be smoother if the DNBP was mixed into a photo grade gelatin or albumen and then floating the paper on top? The epoxy bears looked nice and smooth so hopefully the gelatin layer would work the same. The color change may have less permanence than the epoxy bears as well since it is relatively soft.<br>Another method I would try is gum dichromate. Still, this would call for gelatin sized paper. All it calls for is some gum arabic,  ammonium or potassium dichromate and a pigment of choice; substituting the DNBP in this case. If this method works, it would actually result in a &quot;permanent&quot; image. The gum dichromate will harden according to the negative allowing the underexposed areas to be washed away. It could possibly be stored as a latent image in the dark and reveal the image in the sun without having to print the negative. As long as the dichromate and DNBP don&#39;t affect each other that is. Also, this may not solve the coating issues.<br>Third and easiest suggestion, try using a puddle pusher, I still like brush coating, but the puddle pusher is a godsend when I can&#39;t seem to get the coating right.

It could be possible that the lignin and cellulose thermally expand at a different enough rates to cause gaps that the DNBP keyholes into. When cooled down it could have just enough grip to hold DNBP in place, but also create gaps that water can seep into. Once the water seeps in, vascular action could pop it back out, allowing the crystal to rearrange itself again.

The reaction is an easy one, you just need to mix HCl and manganise oxides. And in fact my problem isn&#39;t in the reaction itself. My source of manganise dioxide are zinc-carbon batterys. That&#39;s the problem. The oxides are mixed with a lot of junk like carbon and graphite, metal contamination (zinc, iron) and probably other compounds. As you showed in a previous video i washed the powder from battery to get rid of the electrolytes. Than i reacted the washed powder and filtered (lot of carbon was left in the filter) and the solution had not particles in suspension, but it had a dark brwon color. After some reserch i finded a NurdRage video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2307159617&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=BCmTzZa6ncY&amp;v=BLJgBSrhZI8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2307159617&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=BCmTzZa6ncY&amp;v=BLJgBSrhZI8</a>,  i tryied it twice but the solution was left darker than before, both times... So now i have reacted all the MnCl2 with sodium hydroxide. The plan is to wash the precipitate many times, than convert it back to manganise oxides hopefully purer than before, and react it again with acid. I don&#39;t know if it will work.. i have just hopes for now.
