The other product of the heated carbonate salt is CO2, according to Wikipedia.  Since amm. carb. is plentifully available in anhydrous form, I was wondering if carefully heating the salt in a flask would produce enough anhydrous ammonia without the need of distillation, drying agents, etc.  Of course, the gas liberated is a mixture of NH3 and CO2, so they need to be separated.  I looked up the boiling points of the 2 gases.  NH3 boils at -33.4 C and CO2 freezes directly at  -78 C.  What is the temperature of the dry ice-acetone bath? If it&#39;s between -33 and -78 C, then it would seem that NH3 would condense and CO2 would escape as a gas - unless they re-react after they are evolved from the salt.  If that&#39;s true, then perhaps ammonium acetate could be used in the same fashion, since the acid product, acetic acid, would remain behind in the reaction mixture.  However, Wikipedia says that ammonium acetate is, however, so that may contaminate the products with water.  I don&#39;t have a lab available to me yet, so I can&#39;t try these things out.  BTW the carbonate salt has been used in baking for a long time now!  And by baking, I do mean foodstuffs.  The CO2 puffs up the dough in the oven.  Unfortunately, WikiP. doesn&#39;t explain why your bread doesn&#39;t reek of ammonia.
