[{"comment_by": "WorldAviation 4K", "comment_text": "Would you be able to talk about Aniline in Leather jackets.  When I first bought one years ago, the store had tags with just Leather Aniline.  They said it means the minimal finish which makes the jacket soft and smooth (no water proofing) Or do they just mean, basic dye finish with aniline and that&#39;s it.  Its not special to making it soft?  I would love to know what makes some jackets soft, is it a chemical.  So actually choosing different animal leathers doesn&#39;t make it smooth and soft but it&#39;s the chemical finish.  Perhaps they not make fake leather soft like the best leather because of a chemical that I&#39;ve not heard of.  So by soft I don&#39;t mean like durability where you would choose the type of animal for.", "comment_date": "2022-08-21T03:49:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "50LOT", "comment_text": "I have anillin in powder.
