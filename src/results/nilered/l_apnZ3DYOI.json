The latter subtype is rare, and generally needs insulin therapy very early on.<br><br>Type 3: Something Alzheimer&#39;s related. Not sure on the details and this designation as a separate type of diabetes is considered controversial among doctors.<br><br>Type 3c: Removal of, or extensive injury to, the pancreas. Usually happens in pancreatic cancer patients.<br><br>CFRD: Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes. Related to Cystic Fibrosis, of course.<br><br>MODY: Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young. A very old, and confusing name for what is also called Monogenic Diabetes. There are a few types, but they&#39;re all purely genetic, and we&#39;ve pretty much mapped out the exact gene for each type of MODY. Some types require insulin, others respond well to oral medications in a way similar to Type 2.<br><br>LADA: Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults. It&#39;s Type 1, but slower. Generally only medically detectable after age 30. Sometimes also has insulin resistance come along for the ride. The slow progression, plus the sometimes-present insulin resistance means Type 2 medications often work, until the pancreatic damage gets to be too extensive and then insulin therapy is required. Often misdiagnosed as Type 2, sometimes tragically. This designation is also controversial. Some doctors think LADA should just be lumped in with Type 1 without any special descriptors, others believe treating it as a separate thing is useful for determining the correct course of treatment. Sometimes colloquially referred to as Type 1.5.<br><br>Hemochromatosis: Okay, technically this just a known cause for some forms of Type 2, but worth calling out separately since the mechanism by which it works is actually pretty well understood.<br><br>There are also some other steroid therapy related forms of &quot;sort-of&quot; diabetes that aren&#39;t really considered as such as long as they resolve completely when the steroid therapy is concluded.", "comment_date": "2021-11-16T22:18:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mica Adkins", "comment_text": "I know I\u2019m 4 years late but I\u2019d like to say.<br><br>You missed one.
