Like you said, &quot;once it&#39;s dried, the products will become a paste&quot;. How does someone know that?<br><br>To be more specific, I wanted to do an experiment for &quot;how much Citric acid is in 2L Sierra Mist compared to other soft drinks&quot;. With citric acid being an acid, I thought I could figure this out with excess baking soda. I tried that, knowing the reaction would lead to citrate, water, and CO2, which would escape as bubbles. I also boiled the solution slightly above 100 Celcius and well below the boiling point of citrate, to remove the water. But I had no idea how to separate out the Natural Flavors, Sugar, and other ingredients. Add on top of that, the end result was a black liquid that smelled like molasses. What that told me was that the major ingredient (water) was removed, the CO2 was removed, and the next major ingredient wasn&#39;t sugar, but actually high fructose corn syrup. But nothing precipitated out, so I was at a loss on how to finish this, and the internet had no instances of this experiment having ever been done before, at least, outside of the companies that make the drinks...<br><br>So I had to change the experiment to &quot;how much water is in 2L Sierra Mist compared to other soft drinks&quot; since the CO2 was just a product of the citric acid, so the major losses in the volume of the original and the volume of the black stuff was that all the water was boiled off. Still, my question stands: how does someone figure out how to isolate a component of a particular mixture if that experiment hasn&#39;t ever been done/recorded? Especially when the products are complex or unspecified like &quot;high fructose corn syrup&quot; or &quot;natural flavors&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-06-07T07:14:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick DN", "comment_text": "poo", "comment_date": "2021-06-06T21:57:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LIQUIDSNAKEz28", "comment_text": "I let a few Pharaoh serpents out of my body and into the toilet this morning.", "comment_date": "2021-06-05T17:37:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nicholas Pyle", "comment_text": "Hello future people!", "comment_date": "2021-06-05T12:49:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jax D", "comment_text": "Second experiment is like witching", "comment_date": "2021-06-05T11:57:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zack Pack", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC3o2KgQstA&amp;t=8m30s\">8:30</a> that&#39;s one massive turd", "comment_date": "2021-06-05T09:25:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Miner Cet", "comment_text": "<b>goes to medieval times</b><br>Behold,this is a part of the remains of a demon I defeated at a younger age,which I used my magical energy to seal it.When I lit this on fire,it desparately try to regain power but because of the seal it can&#39;t take on a clear shape and can be easily destroyed...", "comment_date": "2021-06-05T03:04:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amogh Jain", "comment_text": "maggicccc!!!!", "comment_date": "2021-06-05T01:19:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Love muss B", "comment_text": "Looks like those little things plumbers use to test the air pull on a fireplace", "comment_date": "2021-06-04T21:01:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ninja", "comment_text": "Maybe he summoned the pharaoh&#39;s butthole?", "comment_date": "2021-06-04T19:51:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nuts Buster7749", "comment_text": "poopoo", "comment_date": "2021-06-04T13:43:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joy", "comment_text": "&quot;And lo I was born from my own birth&quot;  I&#39;d be wary of touching that in case it came alive and gripped me.", "comment_date": "2021-06-04T11:57:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cory knight", "comment_text": "why not instead add the water to the acid thus removing 1 step of contaminating a additional flask??? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PC3o2KgQstA&amp;t=4m36s\">4:36</a>", "comment_date": "2021-06-04T03:45:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Blogs", "comment_text": "Must be lying, mercury can&#39;t be that dangerous, we use it in vaccines", "comment_date": "2021-06-04T00:24:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jackson McKeen", "comment_text": "warning dont do this at all <br>ok so you need 1tsp mercury", "comment_date": "2021-06-03T21:09:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sean Anderson", "comment_text": "Congratulations, you&#39;ve successfully created a recreation of a butthole.", "comment_date": "2021-06-03T13:30:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chaos", "comment_text": "Wood Style Wood Dragon Jutsu", "comment_date": "2021-06-03T02:46:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandyne Harris", "comment_text": "Never thought I&#39;d watch a ghost take a shit", "comment_date": "2021-06-03T01:00:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "moosesnWoop123", "comment_text": "I love how the West discovers things in 1800&#39;s whilst calling it Pharaoh&#39;s Serpent, which by Egyptian standards is like 12 500 years + old <br><br>More like &quot;rediscovered&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-06-02T07:31:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OPEK ", "comment_text": "Imagine accidentally discovering this. and your experiment chases you..", "comment_date": "2021-06-02T05:17:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lia Aisha", "comment_text": "&#39;Pharaoh&#39;s Serpent&#39;?  looks more like shit", "comment_date": "2021-06-01T00:14:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lola brini", "comment_text": "a moment of silence for the stupid teens who try this at home or in their backyard and were seriously harmed/died from the fumes.

Fireworks cause extensive air pollution in a short amount of time, leaving metal particles, dangerous toxins, harmful chemicals and smoke in the air for hours. Displays are held by companies who are under federal and state regulations on height of display, location, type and disposal of the remains/cleanup. When you get fireworks from disreputable or unknown sources, from other countries, (maybe even your own) you never know what they may contain, they don&#39;t go high enough and the waste always ends up in the air we breathe, the water we drink and the plants we depend on to breathe, eat and harbor life such as birds and bees, which we depend on to survive as a species.
