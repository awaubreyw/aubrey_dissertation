I then boiled I ment to pull it off the stove while it still had water in it but wasn&#39;t paying close enough attention I walked into the kitchen with q dry pan.. so I figured It was ruined but then I noticed a residue at the bottom of the pan I scraped it out and got about 1 gram of the substance it was red sticky and tar like... I did alittle research I think what I made is cin-silin but I&#39;m really not sure I dont don&#39;t think ingesting it is a good idea but I&#39;m gunna try the same thing again with true cinnamon.. If I made what I think I made it can be used as a supplement for people with diabetes or people that are at risk and diabetes runs in my family so I think this might be a good thing for me", "comment_date": "2022-04-08T12:07:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "That DIY Guy Raymond Monk", "comment_text": "Could you help me find something other than DCM as it is banned in my country.
