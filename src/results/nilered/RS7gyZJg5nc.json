Obviously you wet doing so in a hood and were being safe but, it would be a good idea to mention that type of safety info.<br><br>Also, when it came to grinding up the pellets you made in order to further oxidize them, this was not necessary at all. It may not make a lot of sense to people unfamiliar with solid state physics but, atoms in solids are not at all static. The solids will move through a process called diffusion. Increases in temperature and increases in proximity lead to an increase in diffusion rate. This means that when your solids are packed tightly together in a pellet, even though it might take a bit more time for the oxygen to seep into them because of the reduced surface area with the oxygen, it means that if you give it enough time, your product will be incredibly uniform. I would even say you would be better off doing this in a single step where you press the original oxide mixture into a pellet and heat it for a few days. Likely, your lack of oxygen in the initial steps is probably just due to not all of the oxides reacting together due to a lack of diffusion through the fluffy powder. So, the individual oxides were not picking up the extra oxygen.<br><br>You do obviously have to increase the dwell time the thicker your pellets.

I have very much, nay, infinite respect for you, young man. BTW, how old are you, sir? I am 37. None of this matters but I am curious because you have morals and wisdom instilled in you that many others should follow. Like I was saying, you are an inspiration to us all. You built a channel up from the bottom and to where you are now. Not only risking your life almost every single time you make a video, but the authenticity and genuine love and passion I get from this channel. Thank you for all your hard work and dedication to everything you have done. In conclusion bro, I believe we don&#39;t know when out last day will be but at least you will have left this foot print in time. I hope to achieve my goals on youtube and twitch as I set forth on my journey I once again thank you for your inspiration. People like you are hard to find.

Apparently, the oxygen in the oxides and the surrounding air is enough to make a superconductor when in the pellet form. In the experiment, we compressed 2-3 g of YBCO to 4000 psi, then heated it at 900c for 20 hours. It was already superconducting at this point but we crushed it and recompressed it again then heated it to 950c for another 20 hours.

Cold plasma is levitating the objects with the power of the magnet. Its just like a plasma lamp but object can be moved much better. The cold air is plasma. But the magnet is pushing air around and giving it a charge which makes the reaction more powerful. The cold air maintains its form until it dissipates off somewhere else though around the magnet It is given a charge and is extremely cold at the same time. The effect is odd.

I would like to  see this on an even larger scale and then do what ill refer to as pull test, I want to see if at least in the few inches around this happening if it can be used to help launch something.   With the initial launch being a very large fuel consumption even a slight reduction in load would be very good for cost reduction and efficiency.   So my theory is that if you can test with a more accurate version of a fish scale with very quick data recording that pulling the magnet up the first inch or two would take less force than lifting the same object off the surface of a table .

What do you think happens to someone after they die?\r<br>2. Do you think there is an afterlife? \r<br>3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? \r<br>4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?\r<br> \r<br>Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person: \r<br> \r<br>1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? \r<br>2. Have you ever stolen? \r<br>3. Have you ever used God&#39;s name in vain?\r<br>4. Jesus said that &quot;whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart&quot; (Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7gyZJg5nc&amp;t=5m28s\">5:28</a>). Have you ever looked with lust? \r<br>5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? \r<br>6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?\r<br> \r<br>The Bible says that &quot;all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone&quot; (Revelation 21:8) and &quot;Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people \u2014 none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God&quot; (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn&#39;t have to go to Hell? \r<br> \r<br>2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God&#39;s law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus\u2019 death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. \r<br> \r<br>What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don&#39;t trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, \u201cNo one is good \u2014 except God alone\u201d (Mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7gyZJg5nc&amp;t=10m18s\">10:18</a>). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again.

You end up with a better product due to superior mixing, and the reaction proceeds much more evenly throughout the container. Sometimes the bar will stop spinning right before the reaction goes off, but it has still done its job. I recommend high temp stir bars, but honestly the teflon ones survive well enough. <br><br>Source: I used to do these reactions for making an electrode material for fuel cells. Except ours were... much more violent.... explosive even. (Hence why we clamped a bunch of wire gauze on top of the beaker.)<br><br>EDIT: You also need a binder material when pressing pellets. It would help make them &quot;perfect&quot; and it just burns off during sintering so it doesn&#39;t affect your final product. Of course, if you can make them without it&#39;s better, but it certainly makes making them easier.<br><br>EDIT2: Also, you REALLY want to mill the material before pressing pellets. You want the smallest particles you can get and you want them to all be consistent. We would let ours sit in a ball mill for 8-12 hours. You can make one yourself by just getting yourself some ceramic balls (ours were ysz... I think) and just putting them in a flat sided container with your powder, then rolling that container between two cylinders, using a motor to turn one of the cylinders.

This would cause the diamagnetic force to be only from the outside material instead of the entire thing, which would explain why the 1.9 mm worked better at first. With it being thicker, it would make sense that it just required a lot more time. Your pellets weren&#39;t growing in diameter, just in height, meaning that there was little change in surface compared to mass.

AuPt.. gold platinum alloy.. not rare or hard to find.. ubiquitous.. but it has double double covalent bonds like diamond.. diamond passes magnetic energy with no resistance.. and absorbs heat.. has zero heat expansion coefficient... lighter than aluminum.. but double double covalent bonds.. ditto with silicon carbide.. the idea that they pass electricity is not correct.. it&#39;s magnetic energy.. magnetic energy is the chicken.. electricity is the egg.. but we have very few ways to measure or use the magnetic field of our lovely Planet.. it&#39;s like pulling yourself up by the bootstraps.. trying to make measurements from inside the field.. very tough to do.. and all our measurements are from inside the field.. all equipment is inside the field.. Michaelson-Morely were looking for a place outside.. the ether.. like a baseline for our measurements....and they used floating blocks of iron in mercury.... they couldn&#39;t find one.. our Universe has no preferred direction.. it&#39;s said the Universe is flat.. it&#39;s actually cubic, despite R Feynman&#39;s assurance it wasn&#39;t.. it&#39;s the same in all directions.. look at some of my Hubble deep space images.. <br> and.. light is magnetic energy..<br>AuPt dust self assembles into a cubic hexagonal arrangement.. because Au has one more proton electron pair than Pt.. it&#39;s magnetic.. but, unlike iron magnets.. which are caused by the difference of a single electron.. Au and Pt get mixed directions to account for near neighbors in 3 dimensions.. so AuPt has no preferred direction.. I think our Universe is the same way.. that&#39;s why it has galaxies moving away, towards, and sideways to us.. all mixed together.. the Universe is fractal <br> the photo electric effect is responsible for the phenomenon we call visible light..  here&#39;s the catch... what happens on one side of a magnet happens to the other at the same time.. and, within a magnetic field.. all the different magnets are directly connected.. by an invisible, but very strong force..  they are truly entangled.. our bodies create a standing magnetic field between each part of the body and brain.. so we process information from the environment in real time.. the neurotransmitters are staggered.. one group sends.. another group receives.. 2 senders for each system in our body.. and 3 receivers.. and noceceptin.   which allows the standing magnetic field.. very complicated molecule.. it&#39;s not been synthesized as far as I know.. however.. this information is accurate.. new science that allows me to make accurate predictions about the real world.. and our body... I have recently risen from my bed.. after 20 years of being unable to walk.. the Chinese recognize this as Qi.. energy.. and the flow of energy back and forth runs the feedback system that allows the body to adjust and regulate the various functions of the body.. it allows us to pull off a hot stove before we burn the finger ... so.. if light is magnetic energy.. and we are seeing distant stars... we are, in fact, inside the magnetic field.. .. all these years telling people stars are too far away to affect our lives.. I am probably right.. but... it&#39;s new information.. so I don&#39;t cast aspersions quite as much.. there&#39;s a tremendous amount of stuff I don&#39;t know.... but I know that a superconductor passes magnetic energy and absorbs heat..<br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/eH-cm7aQYAY\">https://youtu.be/eH-cm7aQYAY</a><br>this is gold and plastic  around a steel coin.. it&#39;s pretty firmly attached.. but the magnetic energy passes through plastic.. no resistance.. and a pretty good layer of gold on the outside of the coin.. more than plating.. 0.5mm so the diamagnetic property of gold makes it a superconductor.. of magnetic energy.. but it also passes heat rapidly.. AuPt does not get hot.. I can hold it in my hand and drill, polish, drill with a hole saw.. no water.. it doesn&#39;t even get beyond warm..... R Feynman&#39;s QED has a lot to do with this phenomenon.. and the double double covalent bonds.. metallic bonds pass electricity.. covalent bonds pass magnetic energy", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T04:05:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BARDOCK", "comment_text": "Fake", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T01:17:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jonas Morelli", "comment_text": "Welcome back to making meth with NileRed!", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T00:54:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cieran Therrien", "comment_text": "&quot;y&#39;know sPoOns?&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T23:05:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Philip Bass", "comment_text": "that blue color is so nice", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T22:30:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan lloveras", "comment_text": "When you try to make a superconductor, but you accidentally summon a demon fro m the depths of Hell:", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T21:51:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NightRunner417", "comment_text": "So, I was letting this play in the background while cleaning up my kitchen (chicken day, yay!) and when I got done, I sat down to...<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7gyZJg5nc&amp;t=15m37s\">15:37</a> &quot;Whoa what the!&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T19:27:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VaulTex", "comment_text": "So this is what holds 106", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T19:18:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DR.

You&#39;ve already tested and showed us the alternative where you made thicker and thicker disks which showed the magnets hovering lower and lower the thicker the disks got, so perhaps if you went the other direction now making ever thinner and thinner disks we might see higher hovering altitudes out of the magnets instead? Just a guess on my part after you showed us that the thinner disks actually levitated the magnets higher than the thicker disks would, but perhaps the thinner disks kept on performing better aka hovering the magnet higher because the thinner disks have less mass to them. Follow me on this, but less mass and less thickness to a superconducting disk would mean less material involved in said disk&#39;s construction altogether, and less material involved in the manufacturing of a disk could perhaps mean less opportunity for large and more frequent defects to form in a thinner disk. Now, since you said it&#39;s the tiny defects in a superconductor that allows some of Earth&#39;s magnetic field to sneak through the disk and produce the &quot;flux pinning&quot; effect which is what holds a magnet in place while it hovers, then I think it might stand to reason that less &quot;flux pinning&quot; effect (aka less of Earth&#39;s magnetic field sneaking through the disk) would then result in the magnet being able to hover higher. Perhaps a thicker disk kept showing the result that a magnet would hover lower and lower because a larger and thicker superconducting disk would have more defects throughout it, then leading to more of Earth&#39;s magnetic field making its way through a thicker disk which then leads to increased &quot;flux pinning&quot; or tethering effect on the magnet which then ends up pulling the magnet down closer to a thicker superconductor. I think it&#39;d be really cool if you actually saw this comment and end up producing a follow-up video to this experiment to test this theory out for us. Please, oh please!! Thank you btw for this video.

Maybe there&#39;s something going on at these high temperatures I don&#39;t understand, or maybe the ceramic is more porous than I&#39;d expect?", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T05:42:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hubba bubba", "comment_text": "I think you cool", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T05:15:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0560", "comment_text": "God I love this channel.", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T04:33:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0560", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7gyZJg5nc&amp;t=13m21s\">13:21</a> T\u0338\u0305\u035b\u033d\u033f\u0315\u034d\u031ch\u0338\u031a\u0305\u0332a\u0336\u0342\u033e\u033c\u033c\u033c\u0353\u0319n\u0335\u030d\u034e\u031f\u0329\u0356\u032ak\u0334\u030b\u0358\u0302\u0303\u033d\u0333\u0345\u0356\u0320\u0322 \u0338\u0305\u0305\u0315\u032a\u0332y\u0336\u0315\u035d\u032b\u0326\u031e\u0349\u0321o\u0338\u034a\u0312\u0300\u0339\u031e\u031cu\u0334\u030b\u035d\u030d\u030c\u0353\u0331,\u0337\u0357\u030f\u031e \u0335\u0306\u033d\u033f\u0301\u0329\u0345\u031d\u033a\u0345f\u0338\u030b\u0360\u0307\u035d\u0343\u0353\u0354\u0347a\u0334\u0340\u034b\u0301\u030c\u0350\u0332\u0326\u032bt\u0338\u0358\u0303\u0343\u030c\u035ch\u0334\u0344\u031a\u0323\u0355e\u0338\u030f\u030d\u0304\u035c\u033c\u032er\u0334\u0307\u031b\u0300\u0311\u0311\u0331.\u0336\u030b\u034c\u032b\u0348\u031d \u0337\u0352\u0358\u0344\u0304\u0351\u0323\u0323\u0349", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T04:01:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Berserker", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7gyZJg5nc&amp;t=13m21s\">13:21</a> i summon thee Satan&#39;s pp xD", "comment_date": "2020-10-15T23:14:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Landherr", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve seen Sigma-Aldrich charge about 110 USD for 100 mL of 99% pure capsaicin which I needed for a high school project.

We both just put the powdered precursers in a Mortar and mixed it in there. Then we put it in the same kind of oven you used at 900\u00b0C, crushed and mixed it again in the mortar and made a pellet with the same kind of press you used. From there the methods deviated. The Corbonate-Group just put it in the oven under air, the Peroxide-Group put it in the oven under pure Oxygen flow and for a longer time. Both turned out working (we tested it by floating it over a magnet we salvaged from a hard drive), but the carbonate one worked better. Our instructor was also disappointed, that the one with less steps worked better than the one with more.<br>When we looked at the surface of both pellets under a scanning electron microscope we could see that the grains in the peroxide one (with the longer oven time) was more strongly sintered together.<br>That was weird because that one worked worse.

Everytime I would go in a store in fact just about every store I had around me and I couldn&#39;t get any hand soap so what I had left was just about an inch or two in the pump bottle, this was the brand name Dial hand soap spring water sent. So I put pomolive dish soap in with it the regular green dish soap.  At first it was ok then it start to think out and became real real runny like someone adding water to it, I asked everyone who lived here and they all said they didn&#39;t add a thing not even water.  So about a week later I saw that they put out more hand soap on the shelves and you can only buy 4 at a time. So I bought 4 went home and put a new one on the bathroom sink to replace the very runny one.  I didn&#39;t want to throw that away just in case they were sold out and I didn&#39;t have any soap to clean our hands so I put it under the sink. This was about  the month of May when I put it under the sink. A few days ago I was looking under the bathroom sink for some laundry detergent to put on a shirt that got blood on it from a cut I gotten while chopping up onions, I didn&#39;t have any laundry detergent so I saw that watery down hand soap a squirted some out and put cold water on the blood. Cold water is the temp you put on blood stain if you catch it time and not let it set in and it will come out . Anyways when I was running in the soap it smelled like it had Windex in it ,smelled like ammonia.  I want to know why did it change and become real watery and then smelled like very strong ammonia which it broke out my hands bad when I touched it by rubbing the soap in the stain btw? <br>What made it change chemically to ammonia? Please let me know why and is it dangerous to keep because I just shoved it back under the bathroom sink. And there are no small children in this house what so ever if anyone was wondering or worried. Need to why it did that and if it&#39;s safe to keep or should I get rid of it?! Btw it did get the stain out but it would have anyways because I caught it in time and didn&#39;t let it set in.

And, 1 g divided by 0.225 81 is 4.43 mmol. There are 2 molecules of yttrium, so 8.86 mmol indeed. And yttrium&#39;s atomic weight is 88.905 84, so that gives us 787.4 mg of yttrium.<br><br><b>Barium nitrate&#39;s</b> molar weight is 261.337 g, meaning that 0.261 337 g is 1 mmol. And, 3.063 g divided by 0.261 337 is 11.72 mmol indeed. But, barium&#39;s atomic weight is 137.327, meaning that 11.72 mmol of it is 1 609 mg. Divided by the quantity of yttrium, 787.4, that gives us a ratio of 2.043 which is pretty close to 2.<br><br>You got the moles on that one right, so if we take that 1.32 ratio you somehow got to, and divide the amount of barium (1 609 mg) by it, it equals to 1 219. So, it looks like you calculated that ratio from a mixed up yttrium oxide formula where you somehow calculated 3 yttrium atoms (which would weigh 1 182 mg) even though on the previous step you got the moles right.<br><br><b>Copper(II) nitrate trihydrate&#39;s</b> molar weight is 241.60 g, meaning that 0.241 60 g is 1 mmol. And, 8.981 g divided by 0.241 60  is <b>37.17, not 31.2.</b> Given the atomic weight of copper, 63.546, 37.17 mmol give us 2 362 mg of copper. Which, divided by 787.4 mg of yttrium, makes a perfectly good ratio of 2.999 to 3.001 depending on how many decimals you keep during your calculations.<br><br>This means you calculated 31.2 * 63.546 = 1 983 mg of copper. Which, divided by 787.4 mg of yttrium, makes a 2.51-ish ratio, not 3.51. Seriously? You replaced a 7 with a 1, and a 3 with a 2 in the same formula? You better up that handwriting game, I think you&#39;re getting your numbers mixed up because you didn&#39;t take the time to learn how to write un-misreadable numbers.<br><br><br>You were right that they made a mistake about yttrium nitrate hexahydrate, though.

But I won&#39;t give NordVPN my money. You can set up a rasperry pi at your home for 60 bucks. It can run a vpn server in addition to webserver, mail server, intrusion prevention system, have attached storage, backup server, dns black hole (advertisement filter). All of the software is free and open source. The pi takes a maximum of 5V * 2.5A = 12.5W. so 1h of operation is 0.0125kWh. Suppose 1 kWh costs 30ct, then a month of operation costs you 2.70\u20ac in power. Of course the Pi doesn&#39;t run at 2.5A all the time. In addition to NOT sending all of your data to a third party (yes, all your data goes to NordVPN servers and who knows what they do with it), all your data goes to your home. In addition you can have access to your home network resources (eg. printer). So giving money to some company that provides you with what you can set up for yourself for a LOT cheaper and with MORE benefits is ridiculous.<br>And now some education on how VPN actually works: Your traffic is encrypted and sent to the VPN server. The server then decrypts the VPN traffic and sends it to where you want it to go. Not only does the VPN server then have your unencrypted data (if it wasn&#39;t otherwise protected in say with SSL/TLS in HTTPS), you also didn&#39;t gain any additional protection. Your data is still unencrypted from the VPN server up to the destination. The security that VPN does provide is the encryption if your line up to the VPN server is not trustworthy, such as when you are in a foreign network. In such case the VPN encrypted traffic can leave your computer and interception between your computer and the wifi access point or router is secure. Because the former case (traffic is still unencrypted on the internet) is not covered by VPN, there is no benefit to having a third party supply it. The other thing VPN does is it sends out the traffic in your name, so to the destination it appears as though your traffic originated from the VPN server location, allowing to spoof the location. This might be helpful, but there are free proxies. Also did you know that there is LITERALLY a list of FREE VPN SERVERS you can use? Of course I wouldn&#39;t trust them, but for location spoofing over HTTPS it&#39;s quite enough.

Something that can kick somebody into his a.. (to be taken litteraly). Theory of the gravitomagnetic London-moment is explained here: <a href=\"http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/Experimental_Detection.pdf\">http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/gsp/Experimental_Detection.pdf</a><br>To do so, you need a traction SCR (Silicon Controlled Rectifier) from an old electrical locomotive (about 4\u20264.5 kV breakthrough voltage and 2\u20263 kA continous current; that results in 15\u202620 kA surge current). Switching time should not exceed 1 \u00b5s. No cooling is required (pulsed operation). Then, you have to build an induction free stacked plate capacitor from copper foil and PMMA dielectricum with a capacitance of C=150\u2026500 nF at 4 kV. (C=Epsilon\u00b7A/d), while Epsilon is the product of the vacuum permittivity Epsilon0=8.854 As/Vm and the relative permittivity of PMMA Epsilon-r=3). Further, you need some 1/2&quot; copper tubing (skin effect) to contact your YCBO-pellet flat (!) by its faces in a narrow U-shape. Put the SCR in series with the capacitor. The positive pole should point upward. For low impedance without reflections, both tube conductors should be as short as possible and maintain a distance of about 30\u202635mm in between. Then submerge the contacted YBCO-Assembly into a Dewar-flask, fill it with LN and put a stripe from a non metallic substance (e.g. wood, polymer, glass, etc.) on top of the flask. This is your test mass. Load the capacitor to 4kVDC from a high-voltage lab power supply, then fire the SCR by connecting a 9V-Battery (positive to Gate, negative to Cathode). The test mass should fly about 2\u20263m into the air. Caution: This experiment uses deadly voltages. Note: No, you can&#39;t build a flying machine with this setup, since density of Cooper-Pairs is too low. It encompasses a couple of nm. To build something, like depicted in USN UAP-videos, you need a topological insulator at RT (e.g. nanoparticles from Bi), driven by RF (Radio Frequency) superposed with high DC voltage for polarization.

The falling magnet induce a current in the superconductor due to the fact that the falling magnet causes a change in magnetic flux linkage. But the induced current produce a magnetic filed that wants to stop the magnet from falling so it repels the magnet. The moment the magnet starts to move up,down or slide to the sides (even by micrometers), it causes a change in magnetic flux linkage, which induce a current in the supper conductor, which produce a magnetic filed to prevent the change that was causing the current in the first place. Because the superconductor has almost no resistance to current, small changes in magnetic flux can instantly produce large currents, thus large fields to oppose the change. This is the same effect as dropping a thick piece of copper on a large magnet, just that in superconductors  the effect is amplified due to no losses by resistance", "comment_date": "2020-08-03T18:36:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "peter dinkler", "comment_text": "I lol&#39;d at &quot;capacitor goo&quot;<br>edit: holy shit he used the &quot;thonk&quot; emoji.

And 2 of the grand kids are studying fields of chemistry because of you. My eternal gratitude for giving them inspiration and direction in their lives. A couple questions, any health concerns working with the Yttrium and Barium? I know Beryllium is a carcinogen, 100% lethal. (Well the dust from Beryllium ceramics) 2nd question is when you cook down your ammonium citrate you lose 2 or 3 hydrogen molecules. Is that burn off from the nitric acid or gremlins? And you said you added 60 liters of oxygen per hour in your cube, was that right? Sounds high, maybe a leak or mis-read? People dragging tanks behind them use 1.5 to 4 (my wife is 2.5) I think hyperbolic tents run between 9.0 and 14.5 if memory serves me. And before you dump big cash into equipment give me a shout at killerfarm12321@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a> and let me know what you need. If I have the parts sitting here getting dusty it&#39;ll cost you postage. Over 30 years industrial machinist and know a lot of other bored old men happy to pitch in when we can. And don&#39;t worry, if I can&#39;t make the build I don&#39;t have a problem telling you so, (won&#39;t tie you up on a maybe) Oh yeah one last thing, when you were bouncing the YCBO back and forth over the magnets it reminded me of shake generators they had in Belgum doing a factory install. If you added low voltage eletro-magnetic fields on 3 sides would that kickerboard be a source of green energy? Thanks again, got my mind racing.

Couple of thoughts as a Chem PhD student.<br>We did this in Inorg lab a couple years ago.

Liu (J Chem Ed, 2008). It lays out the general procedure you used, with the exact numbers. The paper (and us) started with the pure oxides, which avoids the messy synthesis and allows exact stoichiometric ratios. You mix the three oxides, grind them with mortar and pestle, then press them into pellets with a press. Then bake in the oven. The paper says it can be done in air, but we used a slightly oxygen rich atmosphere. Then it&#39;s fun with LN2 and magnets. Half an hour of synthesis, bake overnight, and done. You actually got to almost the exact dimensions in the paper, but with a lot more effort. Still the process is often the most interesting part. Still, it seems that you could have saved yourself a lot of trouble by starting with the pure oxides (should be available from most chem companies) and following the already discovered procedure. A good literature search can save you a TON of lab work.<br><br>J Chem Ed is a great journal, a lot of cool chemistry things that people have figured out how to do outside a full research lab.

Won&#39;t be easy to work inside it, but at least it can be filled with inert gas, or even vacuum.<br><br>A good stepping stone project would be ferrites -- strontium and barium ferrites being hard (permanent) magnets, and MnZn and NiZn ferrites being soft magnets useful in high frequency circuits (in fact you saw some inside the furnace controller, the black squares with &quot;680&quot; on them are 68 microhenry inductors, enameled copper wire wound on a two-piece ferrite core, glued together).  Indeed, most ferrites are magnets of some sort or another; magnetite itself is ferrous ferrite (FeO.Fe2O3).<br><br>You&#39;ll need an electromagnet strong enough to magnetize the products anyway, and that would be another good project.

You can grind the powder much finer with an agate mortar. If you want to go nuts you could even get a ball mill, which I would recommend if you intend to do more powder syntheses.

I do the solid state reaction but I find the oxide powders and the calcined powders leave a hard to remove residue on my ceramic mortar and pestle.  <br><br>Remember that significatly less oxygen can penetrate your discs at high density, so if you are ever curious to try and maximize oxygen content just fully oxygenate the calcined powder then perform a cold sinter on the powder to achieve a disc at the required density without losing YBCO plane alignment and oxygen content from the high temperatures of traditional sintering.

What came out was caked, and it was broken up and put into the ball mill again.  This cycle was repeated about 3-4 times before being grown into a single crystal about the size of a hockey puck.  Those samples were really cool to play with because they would float a 1 inch cube NdFeB magnet about 3/4 inch above the surface.  You could really feel the magnetic forces.  You could press the magnet field further into the superconductor and then lift the magnet and superconductor out of the LN2 bath, with the superconductor spinning under the magnet.  I really wish I had kept those samples.  Those YBCO hockey pucks were being used as holding fixtures for steel aerospace assemblies.  They would be cooled down inside a dewar container and pulse-magnetized with a large capacitor bank and coil.  They would hold an extraordinarily strong field-many time larger than a NdFeb magnet which would hold the steel part in place against the magnet enclosure.  As long as they kept it cold it would hold the part strongly in place.

I did some of these for a research project with a group of ours that does a lot of work on solid-state reactions (made some Gadolinium-Iron Garnets and derivates thereof), so I have a bit of experience that is a little bit more detailed than some of what you&#39;ve shown in the video.<br><br>As you mention, Cu(NH3) complexes are responsible for the very nice blue color that you see at first, but as you neutralise, what starts happening is that Citrate acts as a complexing agent. All the metal Ions in solution (this is why for these syntheses, you need to use easily soluble salts like nitrates and not the oxides) will then be nestled in a web-like structure connected by citrate ligands. The pyrolysis reaction you got was quite cool. Depending on the reagents used this can also be simply a relative un-spectacular step of drying the mixture: First into a gel, then into a powder. In my case I used Ethandiol as a complexing agent with nitrate salts and so the only think that happened is that at some point I produced some brown NOx gasses. These gels are also quite cool, as they can be used to make crystal-fibers or sponge-like structures that are mostly air (aerogels).<br><br>This technique has a significant advantage. To make YBCO, you could simple mix all the respective metal oxides in the appropriate ratio and then heat those at very high temperatures and thus obtain it in a solid state reaction. It is likely that you&#39;d have to heat and then crush and re-mix it a lot of times but it would work in the end. By first making a gel and then drying that, you achive very even distribution of all the reactands (you are correct to say that after the pyrolysis reaction, what you have is mostly just this very fine distribution of all the oxides and/or nitrates). Because additionally the indivudual particles are much smaller, this brings down significantly (by something on the order of 100-300\u00b0C) the temperature at which you can do the solid state reaction, because the diffusion process has to cover much shorter distances and there is a lot more interparticle contact surface.<br><br>With these Sol-Gel Syntheses, it is common to do two heating steps (sometimes just one) to achieve a very fine result. It&#39;s not at all surprising that the very last superconductors, that you heated again for much longer, turned out way better. Very generally, you want to do a reaction first at relatively high temperatures for a relatively short amount of time, crush the obtained product into a fine powder, and do a second step at relatively low temperatures for relatively long. For this second step I believe I was keeping these garnets at 700-800 \u00b0C for like 18-24 h, but it all depends on what specifically you&#39;re making.<br><br>As a final note, if your final product is an oxide, it may be much more advantageous to do these reactions just on open air, if your oven and your lab can accommodate this. The oxygen content in the air that will naturally leak into systems like this is more than enough to saturate very slow solid state reactions like these, in my experience.<br><br>Cheers.", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:08:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OverRide", "comment_text": "Why be see, ohh??", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:08:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiler Shoe", "comment_text": "So awesome!", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:07:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aco", "comment_text": "I like how you can see some of the radiation coming off the puck in the liquid nitrogen", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:07:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rex Torres", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7gyZJg5nc&amp;t=0m45s\">0:45</a> When he said &quot;Google,&quot; my phone responded. \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:07:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard John", "comment_text": "I missed you", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:07:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony K.", "comment_text": "Your best video ever, it&#39;s high quality, really entertaining and explained very well!", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:07:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RE_4 Merchant", "comment_text": "This is cool as fuck", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:07:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atlas Cove", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7gyZJg5nc&amp;t=27m14s\">27:14</a> what is this, a crossover episode?", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:07:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luke_Foxy", "comment_text": "This is damn interesting!", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:06:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rhyzomect", "comment_text": "This is one of the best videos I&#39;ve ever seen, thank you so much.", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:06:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saraxum", "comment_text": "<b>Yeettrium</b>", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:06:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Naugh Sam", "comment_text": "The sentence &quot;So, I poured some liquid nitrogen into a dish and I waited for it to cool down.,&quot; really made me smile :D", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:05:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sakino Bruno", "comment_text": "I love magnets, and i love how you explain everything down to the smallest detail while still being easy to understand.<br>#1 education channel, atleast for me.", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:05:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mrbrando41", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RS7gyZJg5nc&amp;t=13m20s\">13:20</a> dude i almost thought you summoned a demon", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:05:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Clark", "comment_text": "<b>spends thousands of dollars to perform magnet chemical magic</b><br>&quot;I hope you guys liked it&quot;<br>me with my jaw on the floor: &quot;that&#39;s insane!&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:05:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xClordon_", "comment_text": "What would happen if you dropped just ferrofluid ontop of it?

The ideal heating curve should include 12 hours for sintering at 950 degrees celsius and around 6 hours at 400 degrees celsius for tempering. Between these phases the oven should cool down at a rate of 100 degrees per hour. This process should be repeated a couple times including re-grinding the material into a fine powder after each run.<br>2. You only have to add the oxygen at the tempering phase: During the sintering phase a modification of YBCO is formed which hasn&#39;t superconducting properties. The superconducting modification starts to form at temperature below circa 500 degrees (between 500 and around 300). During this phase oxygen is embedded into the crystal structure while carbon escapes (if you use Barium carbonate of course carbon is present). I think at the tempering phase it goes from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic crystal structure. So you only need the oxygen during the tempering phase. That also means that increasing the time the pellet stays at 950 C doesn&#39;t increase oxygenation. The &quot;quality&quot; of your superconductors only increased because you did the process multiple times. (EDIT: To form a general YBCO crystal structure in the first place you have to sinter it at 950C first before tempering/annealing)<br>3. You can speed up the whole process by starting (buying) with Yttrium oxide, Barium carbonate and Copper oxide directly (EDIT: with &quot;starting directly&quot; I mean the step of heat treating the material/powder mixture inside an oven). You just have to grind them into a really fine powder (for example inside of a ball mill) to make it work. That&#39;s also the reason why Applied Science failed this &quot;direct&quot; method, because he didn&#39;t ground his powder mixture.<br><br>Also good video as always and greetings from Europe!", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T18:41:44Z", "likes_count": 2532}, {"comment_by": "Kirk Braggs", "comment_text": "Impressive work for a first attempt!
