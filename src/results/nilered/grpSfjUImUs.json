Like I said, ghettofied. But VERY effective. Even food dyes can be separated from the desired substrate via this method. Not always necessary, but sometimes absolutely necessary. I found you can even run things thru it more than once, but usually not necessary. Also, it can be washed by hand, using regular soap, though using my homemade soap that had just a little too much lye to be used for anything other than extreme hand washing or for cleaning that filter.

Ergotamine tartrate<br><br>2. Hydrazine hydrate<br><br>3. Hydrazide<br><br>4. Hydrochloric Acid<br><br>5. Sodium Nitrite<br><br>6. Sodium Bicarbonate<br><br>7. Diethylamine<br><br>8. Ether<br><br>9. Flasks<br><br>10. Filter paper<br><br>11. Heating mantle<br><br>12. 2 liter three-necked round bottom flask<br><br>Time: Approximately 36 hours.<br><br>Process:<br><br>STEP 1: In a 2 liter three-necked round bottom flask<br>add to 2 grams of ergotamine tartrate about 1/2 gram<br>of hydrazine hydrate. Exercise caution when adding\u00a0<br>the hydrazine hydrate because it is very poisonous,<br>particularly to the eyes.<br><br>STEP 2: Place a condensing column on one neck of the\u00a0<br>flask. Place a stirring device in the center neck and<br>place a separatory funnel in the thick neck. (Note:<br>hydrazide hydrate may be added through a separatory\u00a0<br>funnel although it is not necessary.)<br><br>STEP 3: Place the flask on a heating mantle and simmer<br>the solution for 2-3 hours while stirring occasionally.<br><br>STEP 4: Remove condensing column from flask and continue<br>to cook for 10-15 minutes or until the original solution<br>is reduced by half.<br><br>STEP 5: After solution has cooled, pour the solution<br>through filter paper and collect the crystals that<br>formed. Wash the crystals in a small amount of<br>absolute alcohol.<br><br><br><br>STEP 6: Dissolve the crystals in about 30cc of diluted<br>hydrochloric acid. (Note: diluted hydrochloric acid is<br>mixed at a rate of 1 part acid to 10 or 15 parts water.)<br><br>STEP 7: To the hydrochloric acid solution add about<br>15cc of a solution of sodium nitrite diluted in water.<br>(Note: one part sodium nitrite to 10 or 15 parts<br>water.) Let this solution stand for about 30 minutes.<br><br>STEP 8: To this solution add about one teaspoonful of<br>sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to make the solution<br>basic.<br><br>STEP 9: Place this solution in a separatory funnel and<br>add to it an equal quantity of ether. Shake this<br>solution gently for about 5 minutes.<br><br>STEP 10: Separate the ether solution from the<br>separatory funnel and keep the ether solution. The\u00a0<br>remainder may be discarded.\u00a0<br><br>STEP 11: Cool the ether solution to 0 degrees Celsius<br>and to the solution add a solution of about .5 gram<br>of diethylamine mixed with ether.<br><br>STEP 12: Maintain the solution at 0 degrees Celsius for<br>24 hours, stirring it occasionally (perhaps 4 hour<br>intervals.)<br><br>STEP 13: Remove the solution from the ice bath and<br>allow it to stand at room temperature for about 2<br>hours, or until it evaporates.
