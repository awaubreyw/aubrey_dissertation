Where there is a sufficiently wide band of red, the &quot;flash&quot; does not erase the reaction nucleus. But you notice that after the flash, many blue spots are erased and the reaction has to start again in certain areas of the dish. I am not an expert, but it seems to me that because this is an oscillating reaction,  the blue flash can be seen as a wave with a different frequency propagating across the dish.", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T17:24:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "instagib783", "comment_text": "This guy is keeping the coffee filter industry alive.", "comment_date": "2020-05-30T21:29:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ejiah10", "comment_text": "That last clip tho!!

Some cellular automata systems also produce images that look like dead-on recreations.  Reaction-diffusion is also related to a lot of models, including some worked on by the venerable Alan Turing, for how pigmentation gets established in animals during morphogenesis.

Or could you add something to the mix that would reduce the surface tension so that the bubbles would at least not be able to stay together?  How does temperature affect this reaction?  Would it speed it up?
