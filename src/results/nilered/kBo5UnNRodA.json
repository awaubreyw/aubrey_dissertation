Step 4, cut into strips. Step 5, the dry purple paper, now will indicate base or acid in degrees like litmus paper with the added benefit of showing strength in the solution. How does it show strength/percentage in a solution? It gives a rainbow effect which can tell you how quickly the solution stops effecting the paper. Pretty cool huh?!?! You can even develope your own pictorial color chart to establish your own tests. So, to wrap things up.... a couple table spoons of wine and a single sheet of paper should give you a pretty good supply of litmus paper.
