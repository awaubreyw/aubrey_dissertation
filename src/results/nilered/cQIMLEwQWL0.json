The aqueous layer can then be isolated and acid can be added to restore the protons on the capsacinoids.

I&#39;m an undergrad. chemist from the university of York UK. To find the concentration of the cadaverine sample you&#39;d need to have access to a UV-vis spectrophotometer (fixed wavelength such as Jenway), and a series of standard capsaicin-ethanol solutions of known concentrations ranging from extremely dilute, say, 0.1gdm^-3, to unfeasibly concentrated, 5gdm^-3, then record the absorbance of all these solutions at 279/280nm and plot them in a graph, excel is exceedingly good at doing that. You&#39;d want at least 15 solutions of varying concentrations, and to do a UV-vis of each at least twice and use the average in your calibration curve, for reasonable accuracy.<br><br>279/280nm is the\u00a0\u03bbmax for capsaicin in ethanol, so this is the best wavelength to use as the absorbance is most pronounced at this maxima. I did this in my teaching labs recently, so take my word for it that that is\u00a0\u03bbmax!<br><br>Then use the same UV-vis spectrophotometer at the same fixed wavelength (279/280nm, whichever you use for the standards) to scan the unknown concentration pepper extract, record the absorbance, then read off that absorbance off the calibration curve of concentration vs. absorbance, to find the corresponding concentration! the &quot;curve&quot; of concentration vs. absorbance should be a straight line which obeys the Beer-Lambert law:<br><br>absorbance = concentration x path length x molar absorbtion coefficient.<br><br>For this method you don&#39;t need the molar absorbtion coefficent, but it is available in the literature, such as from Reaxys, what you need to know from the above equation is that conc. is linearly proportional to absorbance.\u00a0<br><br>That is the solid basis for a good research project, given you have access to a lab. :)", "comment_date": "2015-02-03T00:24:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Camroc37", "comment_text": "Just bought ghost peppers for my dad for Christmas...", "comment_date": "2014-12-19T03:38:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dine", "comment_text": "same basic extraction setup can be used for many alkaloids, including those of more psychoactive categories just sayin&#39; :D", "comment_date": "2014-11-11T23:37:05Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "Chewy Buttdangler", "comment_text": "I substituted  the peppers for weed and made my extract", "comment_date": "2014-09-16T22:41:23Z", "likes_count": 14}, {"comment_by": "jandee1975", "comment_text": "For your information; Only use ethanol for the extraction....
