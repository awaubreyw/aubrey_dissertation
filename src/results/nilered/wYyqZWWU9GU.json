Now, if the store is out of Fair Life brand, I&#39;ll pick up some whipping cream instead. (It has zero sugar). I&#39;ll mix it with some water and then there is a vanilla flavored syrup for adding to coffee that uses Stevia instead of sugar that I squirt into my glass of cream and water. It holds me over til I can get Fair Life. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s lactose free doing it that way, but I don&#39;t seem to have the same digestive issues drinking it as when i drink regular milk.

I also drank the lactose real chocolate milk and it was like I expected it to taste. With that they probably used less sugar in the chocolate powder. So in theory this should be healthier, because of less sugar for the same sweetness.<br><br>What is annoying is some of the misconceptions that people have. For example cheese is is mostly lactose free. A rule of thumb is more liquid, more lactose. Hard cheese does not contain lactose or so less, that most people won&#39;t have issues. I even can eat Creme cheese with no issues, because this is under my limit. <br>Having some movement inside me is also quite helpful. Having a bit more liquid in my waste makes it easier.

Weirdly enough, it also took quite a while for lactase to show up here in over the counter medicine form... the processed lactase free milk and dairy products showed up years before.<br>But now, with this explanation I feel I can make better informed decisions, and also explain it to everyone that doesn&#39;t understand how the thing works. Overtime I had multiple people asking about it, and I couldn&#39;t give a good explanation.<br>I also dunno if my tastebuds are kinda f*cked up, but personally, I almost don&#39;t feel a difference between lactose free milk and... what I remember regular skim milk was.

This gave some problems after with removing the ethanol but all of the lactose was removed. We also used a very small filter (similar to a HPLC filter) to remove the lactose. This also removed the fats and a very small amount of lactose still got through.
