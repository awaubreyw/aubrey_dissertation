Hell nah who the hell would even dare to use it as solvent or w.e they use it for. Ide stay tf away from all this wizardry. To me its strange how bleach and aceton could even possibly make something that would make u fall asleep considering a fact how stinky and not at all pleasant they are to smell. Aceton itself would just get you high and kill a few braincells after sniffing for more then a minute, pretty much as a gasoline. But you cant even call it a high, more like a poisoning because experience isnt pleasant at all and really bad for health (at least the lungs, because u pretty much burning your lunge tissue simply by inhaling it (similar to gasoline)) so that makes 0 sense how does it make ppl fall asleep smelling it. I honestly really just hope people dont try to do this at home because this could end up really bad.... Like really really bad... Honestly tho came to this video randomly without pressing anything.

The point is efficiency and waste you are creating. The bleach can be reacted by adding 100ml per reaction to the bleach, vacuum extract the settled chloroform directly into a separatory funnel, repeating until the chlorine content is depleted or near depleted.

Love your channel and the vids. Solid work, but there is an easier way to test your molarity of sodium hypochlorite. Every chemical manufactured and sold, legally must have an SDS. Every SDS will tell you the concentration but 90% of the time it will be as a percentage, and I believe it is in section 3 (used to have to write these in college chemistry). from the percentage you can do some density and volume calculations to find the mass of sodium hydrochloride and convert to molarity.  Very easy to do and the only way to do it without scientific glass.

Secondly, you must not let the reaction mixture sit for too long, because the side products of the reaction will actually begin to eliminate the chloroform over time. You will also get a low yield if you are impatient and don&#39;t let the reaction occur for long enough.
