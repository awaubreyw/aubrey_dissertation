If you have a basic knowledge of lab procedures it should be perfectly safe. A few suggestions, it is best to use a constant current power supply. I believe an LM 317 can provide that.(An LM 317 will make a power supply that is variable down to just below 2 volts. A good idea is to simply put a couple of high power (10 Amp) diodes in line with the output. that will drop the minimum output voltage to just about 0 to 20 volts.) And the voltage should be kept down to less than 2 volts. even then you are going to produce some hydrogen and chlorine gas, so you need fresh air. The slower you grow the crystal the closer to cubes they will become. the best i have been able to achieve are about like a pencil stub. With higher currents the crystal will grow out like tin feathers, and i mean they really look like a feather. Another suggestion is to use lead free plumber&#39;s solder as your source for tin. Then you can just use a 7 to 10 percent solution of HCL,( muratic acid). the tin will come off of the solder into solution and make the stannous cloride all by itself. Another problem with using pure tin cloride as your starting stock is that you will produce pure tin crystals. Pure tin has the nasty habbit of disintigrating into a grey dust in a few years. I have crystals made from lead free solder that are decades old. And they are still shiny. In conclution DO NOT use lead solder You will probably poison yourself. And yes you can do similar things with copper and silver but they are not as nice, in my oppinion, and i do not know any of the voltage or percentage requirements.", "comment_date": "2018-11-23T22:15:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gardenlifelove", "comment_text": "Great video and thank you for warning peeps about getting zapped.

If the cristals of tin grow large enough to touch both electrodes, there is a risk of short circuit.<br>In the electrolysis process tin chloride solution on the positive electrode (anode) dosen&#39;t boil. Besides of main reaction of oxydising Sn2+ to Sn4+, here take place side-reactions:<br>     2Cl- -- 2e = Cl2<br>     2H2O - 4e = 4H+ + O2<br>Thus, the gas produsing on the anode is basically chlorine with some oxygen.", "comment_date": "2015-09-30T08:12:34Z", "likes_count": 96}, {"comment_by": "Random Experiments Int. - Experiments and syntheses", "comment_text": "Growing metal crystals is always fun to watch.
