So, NaHSO3 is an acidic salt, hence its H+ ions given in water dissociation. I&#39;m pretty sure that the blue color came from the formation of indigo carmine (disodium 5,5\u2032-indigodisulfonoate). Indigo reacted with SO3(2-) ions in the solution to form 5,5&#39;- indigosulfonic anions(1-) wich on their side reacted with the Na cations(1+)[from the NaOH]to form the indigo carmine; the carmine is blue and soluble in water. Adding the HCl acid reacted with it. The Na cations reacted with the Cl(1-) anions to form NaCl and the H(1+)[from HCl], which replaced the sodium ones, just created 5,5&#39;-indigosulfonic acid which later due to the excess of H(1+) ions from the NaHSO4 just dissociated to indigo(which precipitated) and 2 molecules of H2SO3.

This is similar to ligand formation with transition metal cations.  It now acts as a complex with a net - charge the -OH is providing, making it much more soluble in H2O.  The size of the -OH and distance between R-NH-R and =O groups are just right to create this effect.<br><br>The indigo should extract directly from the jeans somewhat with a hot -OH solution, but this is just in theory...as the other dissolved species from the iron-out may act as a &quot;soap&quot; to help drag the indigo into solution through intermolecular interactions.

I understand the indigo turns red and clear in two runs and oxidized.. maybe the reason cs gas is so hard to make and worse things are easy and available is somehow related to why acid causes it to precipitate and how that is so hard to understand.

This is the exact opposite of what we see in the experiment. <br><br>However, after some research (I am an inorganic chemist so don&#39;t take my word as gospel here) it seems that acidic amines do exist. These are amines where the R-groups on the amine cause hybridization where the free electron pair of the nitrogen is delocalized in a resonance structure or has too much s-character to properly bond to hydrogen. One example would be pyridine where the amine group has a pka of ~5,2<br><br>Since I&#39;m no organic chemist I can&#39;t be sure, but the amine groups in Indigo sit very close to aromatic 6-rings and a central double bond, so I think a resonance structure that may delocalize the free electron pair might be possible. If so then the amines may be acidic and the hydroxide can deprotonate it into a soluble anionic form. It&#39;s a stretch, and it goes against the general convention of amines, but it&#39;s also the only thing I can think of.", "comment_date": "2018-09-01T21:50:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Owen", "comment_text": "I tried Audible.

I&#39;ve been working with indigo for a few years during my PhD, so there are a few things you could try.

Older german papers talk about its solubility in either boiling chloroform, or in neat sulfuric acid, but we have typically used it as a suspension in DMF at around ~260 mg in 40 mL. By itself, it is not very soluble, but a lot of derivatives are considerably more soluble because they typically have less inter/intramolecular hydrogen bonding. Salts in particular have higher solubility (probably why you werent getting anything precipitating before adding acid - indigo is fairly acidic because the N-anion is stabilised), and N-alkyl derivatives are fairly well-behaved (i.e. di-boc indigo will dissolve in hexane). Because of the hydrogen bonding and electronics aspects, a lot of derivatives have different colours. N-acetyl indigos are typically red, mono-N-alkyl derivatives are usually blue, and di-alkyl derivatives are green. The really interesting stuff comes from other modifications of the core ring structure, which is what I&#39;ve been working on.

Never thought watching a video about making soap would be so entertaining.
