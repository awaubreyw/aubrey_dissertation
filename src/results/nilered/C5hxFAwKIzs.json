As obvious u need H2 and some time for driving it to completion cause it is heterogenic. In ur example u  1)just wasted a lot of NaBH4 on generating catalyst 2)Hydrolysis of NaBH4 in H2O is almost instant, so most of H2 does not absorb and just flies away. This method could work only if u d used  x30 NaBH4 excess over catalyst.  Really dude, u picked THE WORSTnd u to always ethod for synthesis - its low yielding, not economical and dangerous.

Some tips/ideas for your cadaverine synthesis and lab tricks in general 1) get some Celite for any filtrations with suspensions, emulsions or flocculent solids, after filtering the solid Ni boride, precipate any remaining nickel as the insoluble oxalate leaving your diamine in solution as it&#39;s oxalate salt, filter and strip off water. 3)  an alternative method for converting water soluble amines to their free base from their acid salts is to mix the solid salt with solid NaOH which will liberate the water soluble amine, usually as an oil which can then be extracted more easily. 4) when extracting with lighter than water solvents, decant the upper phase directly from the sep funnel (that is why they have the pear shape).  To separate the last organic extract, drain the aq. phase and dry the inside of the tip after the stopcock w/ a Q-tip, then drain and dry etc. 5)  instead of NaOH, use NH4OH.  The Ni will form a soluble complex which could be treated various ways.  6) If the diamine forms an azeotrope, steam distillation could be another alternative.", "comment_date": "2016-11-04T00:24:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Byrne", "comment_text": "Around the turn of the century, they would have added a salt of a heavy metal (lead, mercury, or silver) to the hot solution, which would form a precipitate upon cooling.
