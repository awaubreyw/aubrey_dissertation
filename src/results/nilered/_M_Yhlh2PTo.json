I&#39;ve got a 30-gram bag of RK from Perfumer&#39;s Apprentice for my own perfumery pleasure; I have to quadruple-bag it (and put it in a freezer) to control its scent from leaking out excessively. RK is not something so pungent to immediately tell you how strong it is; in fact it smells mild even when concentrated. However, it has an extremely low odor threshold AND is tremendously tenacious \u2013 in line with many musk odorants! Even in a \u201craspberry accord\u201d RK is seldom used in more than 10%; 1.5-3% is more typical. In a finished perfume the level of RK is usually much lower.

Ethyl 6-acetyloxyhexanoate (Berryflor) can also go a long way in bringing out the fresh raspberry smell. Use small amounts at low dilution (1-10% is pretty standard.

The process that causes wheight loss in the body that the keto diet is based around is to eat as little carbohydrates as possible so that the body turns fat into carbohydrates in the which also creates ketones. This burns fat, but also sours the blood and if taken far enough turns your own blood toxic and can cause organ failure. This is called ketoacidocis luckily you dont reach this point unless you eat absolutely 0 carbohydrates and only diabetics with high bloodsugar really reaches this level of ketones in the blood as the body starts the process when the cells believe there isnt any carbohydrates in the body because the cells cant absorb them without insulin.

I&#39;ve seen you used TLC to confront this with raspberry ketone you&#39;ve bought, but here is my question anyway : what if your compund is not the wanted ketone ?<br>My idea is that Pd/C hydrogenation might not be very selective and maybe it reduced the intermediaite enone the whole way back to the alcohol. Can you be sure of the regioselectivity of your process ? Sincerely I don&#39;t know either but a quick research on the net gave me feeling that reducing selectively the 1,4 (conjugate) position of an alpha enone is not such an easy thing. Maybe a more sophisticated catalyst would help ?<br>Anyway this doesnt explain the TLC result except if we consider that the produce you have is not the ketone but close enough so as to migrate almost identically with the eluting system you chose.<br>I would be very interested to have your opinion about this.<br>And btw thanks for all those beautiful videos, you really make me remember how much I enjoy chemistry :)", "comment_date": "2019-10-27T18:12:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ken Fullman", "comment_text": "I used to work in a laboratory in a brewery and, at first, was stunned by the sheer number of compounds present in beer that contribute to it&#39;s flavour.

More surprising was that beer could taste like anything from lager, stout, cider, wine or even vinegar just dependent on the variability of this rich cocktail of aromas present.  A lot of these products were created by the yeast.  My job was to cultivate the yeast strains we used to ensure that we were producing the flavours expected by our customers and also avoiding the less desirable by products (some of which can actually be hazardous to the health).  And one of the biggest surprises was, that the amount of Alcohol present in the final product had very little significance in the flavour of the product.  Even though, it was by far, more abundant than any of the other compounds that produced the actual flavour.

Your low yield was probably due to the aldolic condensation you did. Acid alpha-hydrogens from acetone (and ketones in general) do not usually undergo acid-base reactions with OH-, unless you&#39;re working with dicarbonyllic compounds (such as mallonic ester). It is common to deprotonize alpha-ketone hydrogens with LDA. One might argue that since the product is generally more stable, being a alpha-beta insaturated carbonyl compound, the reaction may undergo with OH- as the basic agent, nevertheless it has also been observed that alpha hydrogens specifically from acetone do not react even with such a strong base as LDA (and I honestly do not know why this happens). To have a greater yield in the aldolic condensation shown here, it would be needed to synthetize a reactive intermediate known as enamine, reacting acetone with an amine, usually pyrrolidine. Of course this makes the synthesis longer and more complex.

It is part of the Pea family of plants.<br><br>The toxin from Oleander, Oleandrin, is also a glycoside I have discovered. Stronger than Wisterin.<br><br>Personally my family member just came into contact with a rather large dose of wisteria and she is coming down with a severe reaction that is similar to wisteria\u2019s normal toxic profile of nausea and distress of intestines and mucus membranes. <br><br>But she is really suffering and large enough doses can severely injure children. It seems that adults are stronger against it but some documented cases of severe adult incidents also exist.<br><br>Very little information seems to exist on the internet about this toxic chemical, and yet it is a very common plant. Any helpful information you can find on this would be helpful. Any cures or an understanding of the Wisterin chemical process in the human body, through ingestion and pollen inhalation, even skin contact. My family member is having a severe reaction to it. <br><br>Even just getting the word out to more people through Youtube would be a great public service, because very little information sources exist about it, its chemistry and toxicology, and just spreading the word about the fact that it is in fact definitely dangerous and noxious to humans who get in into and on their bodies.<br><br>Thanks in advance,<br>Tyler Finn", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T06:15:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammad Muneeb", "comment_text": "People are confused by palladium charcoal \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T06:05:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sofia eris bauhaus", "comment_text": "i wanna smell like a raspberry. :3", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T06:03:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xdew Gaming&More", "comment_text": "Dat script and camera placement tho...", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T06:01:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ariel Catli", "comment_text": "Can anybody tell me what set of books is behind him at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_M_Yhlh2PTo&amp;t=26m00s\">26:00</a>?", "comment_date": "2019-04-16T05:55:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Baker", "comment_text": "Hello NR, I would like to make an investigation request.<br><br>This is not related to the red raspberry chem, but related to bird chem.<br><br>Many bird owners such as myself have noticed what we call the &quot;wet bird&quot; smell.<br>It seems that when water is added to a bird, there is a aromatic change (not offensive per say, bit noticeable and very distinct).<br>It lasts only as long as the bird is wet.<br><br>Now, I know that birds excrete their own kind kind of &quot;talcum powder&quot; that they use to lubricate their wings so that they slide smoothly with less less friction, and I suspect that it is this that is reacting with the water.

Not sure about another route you can try with the equipment and chemicals you have in hand though. If you want to make terrible smelling compounds: isocyanides. Not as toxic as you might expect from the name luckily, but from my own experience, these compounds are the worst. You can not only smell the slightest trace from across the lab, but it also immediately enters your respiratory system and leaves you with a dry sensation in your throat and lungs, as if you smoked a combination of an overheated battery charger and the tires of your car...  Butyric acid is another (well-known) malodorant. Maybe thioacetone is not the best idea, but it would be the best malodorant there is! The idea that you want to make more smelling chemicals is great!
