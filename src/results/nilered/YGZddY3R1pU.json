Phosphoric acid is a great first step to purifying dirty lithium (such as from batteries) and salvaging basic lithium compounds that would react with water (e.g. oxidized lithium, etc). Lithium phosphate isn&#39;t very soluble in water, but is very soluble in a solution with an excess of phosphate ions.  Once the scavenging solution gets saturated, you can just pop all things lithium in it and a white precipitate builds up on the bottom of the container. This precipitate can be collected periodically and washed up. In the patent, sodium phosphate is used to get the ionic strength to dissolve the Li3P04.  As the ion exchange continues, the solution begins to build up high concentrations of LiOH. Eventually lithium metal collects on the cathode.  I think this would be a good extension of your video where you play with lithium metal. My theory is that when you got to the point where adding metal to the saturated LiOH solution didn&#39;t do much, you could have then subject the solution to electrolysis and lithium metal would have deposited on the cathode <b>faster</b> than the lithium was reacting with the water.", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T23:36:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JJ Baker", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGZddY3R1pU&amp;t=9m34s\">9:34</a> It looks like pale orange juice", "comment_date": "2019-03-31T20:18:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Irving K\u0101la", "comment_text": "Hello, excellent video, you know some way to extract lsd or lsa or some analog of these ergoloides, there is nothing reliable on the web about this topic.

My son and I are going to do about 500g this weekend and slowly recrystallize in a cooler for a couple days. We are going to try and get some nice ,big crystals.  So, I am just wondering about how much I should add to a 500g run. If its pH based and needs to be made basic I can handle that..Thanks for the video", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T01:07:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EvaMarieHamilton", "comment_text": "Lol he just made pepper meth", "comment_date": "2017-11-01T03:00:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ali yea", "comment_text": "Why the fuck did I watch this to the end I barely understand what&#39;s happening", "comment_date": "2017-10-30T14:31:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Savas Emanuel", "comment_text": "eat capsacium", "comment_date": "2017-10-25T20:37:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eso Teric", "comment_text": "Can this be used to make piperazine?", "comment_date": "2017-10-24T04:38:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "niceroundtv", "comment_text": "It won&#39;t be edible chem, but you should consider preparing piperonal from the piperine by permanganate oxidation.", "comment_date": "2017-10-20T06:35:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Independentfellow", "comment_text": "Do you have a home lab, or access to an institutional lab?", "comment_date": "2017-10-18T17:15:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Ingram", "comment_text": "Jfc that looks like a badass drug", "comment_date": "2017-10-18T14:03:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jigyanshu shrivastava", "comment_text": "Sir make a video on distillation from arsenic water...", "comment_date": "2017-10-18T04:02:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Can", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGZddY3R1pU&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a> ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "comment_date": "2017-10-14T20:15:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M Talha Khalid", "comment_text": "U can also use that in your video uextract nicotine from tobacco", "comment_date": "2017-10-14T18:44:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u5927\u9ebb\u795e", "comment_text": "Can you do piperonal from piperine", "comment_date": "2017-10-13T10:55:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cracked Emerald", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGZddY3R1pU&amp;t=6m41s\">6:41</a> what kind of wizardry are you using to keep that vortex spinning?", "comment_date": "2017-10-12T20:38:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shining Dev", "comment_text": "So...
