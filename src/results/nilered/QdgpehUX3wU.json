Oddly enough, you can go to the orange store site and search dichloromethane and it will bring up a list of products. That store lists data sheets online and must have them tied in to their search engine (could be useful for other products in future). Anyway, I found several that only contain DCM and methane and come in liquid form (I bought a liquid/sprayable 15-minute version that comes with a handy spray bottle). Separation was simple with regular distillation and yielded about 530ml from a quart ($11.99). I hit the first batch with water thinking it might separate the methane and got the emulsion. I kept shaking and separating with the DCM I removed and the emulsion finally broke that way after about 6 separations. This morning, I remembered your video and will use your further filtration suggestion to remove the Methane. Thanks as always for super interesting, informative videos!
