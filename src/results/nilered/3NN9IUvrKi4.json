I would rather personally avoid that step. the decresed amount of methanol shouldn&#39;t effect the results of the reaction since the methanol will be more saturated with the acetylsalicyclic acid while the reaction is occurring.

I&#39;m terrible at chemistry but it fascinates me. I&#39;ve always been curious about everything really but for chemistry I&#39;ve always wondered how they made chemicles from natural plants &amp; elements. I mean everything chemical we have had to come from earth in some way or another and it&#39;s fascinating to find out how. I&#39;d love to see some videos more on that process even if it is the most basic of chemicals. I know this is an old video but I&#39;m actually new to the channel so it&#39;s new to me lol.", "comment_date": "2019-10-22T12:41:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hadiisaboss", "comment_text": "Wait wai wait<br><br><br>Ben is gay?", "comment_date": "2019-10-22T07:10:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ty Ouderkirk", "comment_text": "Do you use a formula for your yields?

I started with 50g of whole 325mg tablets and they dissolved completely within 10 minutes of stirring in a 1L beaker. (aside from the insolubles) <br><br>2: At least for my aspirin, the binders were so fine that a coffee filter completely clogged.  I could have put the filter back in a beaker, washed it and mixed it again, but I figured I had enough.<br><br>3: I used an addition funnel to add the sulfuric acid.  It took more time, but not more of my time.<br><br>4: Methanol doesnt grow on trees where I live so instead of evaporating it, I distilled it.  I think the point is to get rid of it as quickly as possible because as the methanol concentration drops, the equilibrium shifts away from the wintergreen.<br><br>5: Any suggestions here for how to sequester the water during the reflux?  The only thing I had was magnesium sulfate and I wasn&#39;t sure what the magnesium was going to do as it can form magnesium salicylate so I didn&#39;t try it.<br><br>6: I&#39;m not sure ice cold water is the best for the separation funnel.  I had a lot of stuff crash out at the same time as the wintergreen and it formed noodly clumps that I think probably stuck to the wintergreen.  The precipitate also clogged the separation funnel completely and stuck to the sides, making it impossible to see what was being poured.  I had to disassemble it to clean it between washings.<br><br>7: Is there a reason we can&#39;t use something to neutralize the sulfuric acid in the reaction flask while its still hot <b>before</b> removing the methanol?  You could stop he catalytic reaction then and not have to worry about loss of product during the distillation/evaporation phase.<br><br>8: My separation funnel doesn&#39;t have a small drip tube inside the ground glass tube and a lot of wintergreen just gooped to the side of it.  I think the addition funnel, while not designed for separating, would have done a much better job at not losing product because of the drip tube.<br><br>For anyone curious, my H2SO4 was from &quot;liquid fire&quot; drain cleaner (distilled) and my methanol was from de-icing windshield wiper fluid.  There ended up being about 1.2L methanol from a $4, 1gal jug.  Cheap, but time consuming to fractionally distill.  Industrially, methanol isn&#39;t an oil fraction or produced from biological sources.  Its produced on its own from hydrating CO, so it really was pretty pure.

The same rough recipe can be used with meringue and   powdered sugar instead of the sodium alginate gum base for an airy crisp texture that also allows you to stretch the flavors out more.  Wintergreen is personally my favorite single sweet flavor in the world, and I have done many things with wintergreen extracts and flavorings.  I even made homemade wintergreen ice cream (which is pretty good, if a bit weak) and wintergreen pudding (which doesn&#39;t really work very well...wintergreen is just not a strong enough flavor for pudding).  Wintergreen also pairs very well with true cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum/verum), and the combination makes for an excellent flavor base for homemade marshmallows.  The marshmallows are best on their own, but do combine well with crushed pistachios and cream as a sort of pseudo-mousse.  It should also be noted that wintergreen adds excellent flavor balance to hard candies flavored with mastic, lavender, or rose.", "comment_date": "2017-09-01T06:10:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Khanggi", "comment_text": "ben is very gay", "comment_date": "2017-08-31T15:02:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Mashin", "comment_text": "Inject it.", "comment_date": "2017-08-31T09:38:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RageXBlade", "comment_text": "Excelent job!
