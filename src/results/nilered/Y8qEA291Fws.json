That process in itself is very interesting; it looks as if the iron is burning with the oxygen in the air, but it is actually directly uniting with the sulfur, no oxygen is needed for this. Anyway, the even more fun part was of course when you took the resulting FeS and poured some hydrochloric acid on it, and got that reaction which produced hydrogen sulfide, H2S, which smelled like rotten eggs. One day I thought that it would be cool if you mixed powderized FeS with an acid that is in the form of a powder, so that no reaction takes place until you pour water on it. I would then have a stink bomb that I could easily &quot;detonate&quot; at will. The only acid that I could think of was citric acid, which my mother had in the kitchen. So I created that mixture and kept it in a small plastic container with a lid. I brought it to a friend of mine, and we decided to take a small local train into Stockholm. In that train we opened the container, poured some water into it, shook it, and put it into one of the trash cans in our wagon. There were other people in the wagon too. Nothing happened, no smell, and I was disappointed and thought that perhaps citric acid was too weak of an acid. We got off the train in Stockholm (the end station), and spent a few hours there having some fun, and then in the afternoon we went back to the station to catch the train back home. We were a bit late so as soon as we entered the wagon the train started to move. The wagon was totally empty, not a single person, and there was a terrible smell of rotten eggs. We had happened to get into the same wagon as we took earlier that day. Our little experiment had actually worked, although very slowly. Fortunately it was possible to walk from one wagon to another, so we quickly went to the next wagon to escape the horrible smell.", "comment_date": "2022-01-09T17:30:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u2022 Snowy Skys \u2022", "comment_text": "Next video: putting chemicals in fools gold to try and make it close to real real gold so I can sleep", "comment_date": "2022-01-09T01:01:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I only post once a year ._.", "comment_text": "Better gold", "comment_date": "2022-01-08T16:58:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ewanb10", "comment_text": "Fools gold is d&amp;d team that summoned a Tyrasc via karaoke", "comment_date": "2022-01-08T07:47:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JadenSucksAtLife", "comment_text": "To be honest \u201cpyrite\u201d sounds like the word pirate, and the words \u201cfool\u201d and \u201cgold\u201d are usually associated with pirates", "comment_date": "2022-01-08T02:02:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FLUXXEUS", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8qEA291Fws&amp;t=1m08s\">1:08</a> I was told at a young age that &quot;right angles don&#39;t exist in nature&quot;...

Anyway they say the other elements are Mercury, Sulfur and salt. But not any salt it has to be celestial salt. And the real problem was when you tried to break down the atomic structure through a process of breaking down those elements over and over and over mortar and pestle? I\u2019m not however sure if they also used the acid on it more than once then dry it and break it down again and start all over. Then once you weakened the atomic structures of those elements enough you had to break it down with acid I think phosphoric and Citric acids and then you had to hermetically seal it in rock Crystal and heat it to impossible temperatures. At some point you\u2019re supposed to achieve a luminous stage where you see a rainbow effect much like oil on water. And they call that \u201c Ravens Wing.\u201d Once it gets to that stage you\u2019re supposed to go into a dark place unseal it and you had Philosophers stone. Which according to legend you should wrap in beeswax and drop it into molten lead and it would turn it into gold? That\u2019s the story anyway. Oh wait one more thing they say if you put water into the crucible that you made the gold out of lead in and drink it you would become young again? Crazy right.

This is also why ceramics and glasses crack if you heat them too much. If it gets hot enough, then yes, in some minerals, the crystallography &quot;completely&quot; breaks down, whether it be due to chemical processes, or just physical stress put on the crystallography, resulting in a slew of miniature crystals, usually resembling a powder, seen in the porous iron oxide layer.

I dont know if its just the camera making it look silverish tho. This is the first time Ive heard about pyrites, so can pyrites be found inside or in between crevices of river rocks? Ive seen plenty and took a lot of different types of river rocks when I was young, I started to think that gold can also be found inside rocks when I saw this river rock a long time ago near the riverbanks of my home towns huge river. The river was pretty big and is also near rocky mountains that were collapsing due to erosion. Im adding this detail since it may add in as a reason why I saw &quot;the gold&quot; inside/in between crevices of the rocks Ive found. So the first rock that Ive found was a part of or debris of the rocky mountains that I mentioned. The rock was pretty solid and had a lot of crevices, the rock had gold like crystals stuck between the crevices, my first thought was gold, it was a lot. I tried taking them off by picking it with a knife, it was hard so i tried breaking it a part with a rock, after a lot of tries I cracked it open, more of it can be seen inside. I showed it to my parents, they told me its not gold. Theyre not experts and so was I, I took their word and just kept the rock. I began to think maybe it was just metal or iron, I knew basic stuff back then since I dreamed of being a scientist and things like those intrigued me, maybe it was oxidized iron and the rocks was rich with iron and all those times within the waters turned it into rust hence looking like gold stuck on the crevices, since a lot of those rocks in the river was sedimentary rocks. I knew the difference between rust color and gold color, but I just ignored it and guessed it was iron. I dont really know if it is iron but it didnt stop me there. Everytime I visit the river, I would spend my time taking big rocks and cracking them open or sometimes just examine it and see if there are some &#39;gold&#39; stuck on it. Cracking them open was a habit, and saw a lot of goldish crystals and rust colored crystals. It was plenty and collected a lot, sadly we moved countries and didnt even had the chance to properly determine if it really were gold or just iron or pyrite. The river is still there but its getting thinner, still a lot of rocks tho, but since gravel and sand were demanding, excavation business tripled, literally tripled since there was only one guy who was doing the business, I grew up on a small town. Three were doing the same thing and the river literally started getting thinner and thinner, good rocks probably dropped down into a 40% find. The river was also known to be a legit mine, back then old people and tourists would go there to mine using the traditional method. Back when the river was still wide and prolly filled with gold. Now onto the rock that I found that prolly filled with gold ore, I can assume it was gold after all? I dont have a picture of it but it was filled with golden colored crystals, the rock was white or washed out brown colored? The golden colored crystals traces the crevices on the rock.<br><br>TL:DR<br>Is it possible that I may have found raw gold inside the rock/s I found a long time ago? or was it just iron rust and pyrite?", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T15:54:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Milk n\u2019 Coffee", "comment_text": "TL;DW (too long didn\u2019t watch)<br>looks like gold but isn\u2019t, looks <b><i>E P I C</i></b> as hell.<br>Gold looks like a retarded chicken nugget but fools fools gold has more edges, and if you smash you can tell, fools gold shatters, gold doesn\u2019t and gold is <b><i>D  E  N  S  E</i></b> in water, Fools gold isn\u2019t very dense. <br>It\u2019s used in batteries, semi conductive and generates sulfur.

The only approved name is pyrite. Pyrite&#39;s similarity to gold, in terms of colour, may also be slightly changed due to partial oxidation that causes ultra-thin oxide-rich layer on the top (to make the mineral more yellow, as opposite to its typical brass colour). Reactions of many minerals with acids will need larger surface area than that represented by large crystals. Grinding these minerals is actually a way of distinguishing some of them (e.g., dolomite against calcite). The red stuff is, indeed, Fe2O3 (a synthetic equivalent of hematite). The sample you have here is actually from pyrite deposit at Navajun in Spain. The rock in which these cubes sit is a talc schist. Btw, a similar mineral that is even more similar to gold in terms of its colour, is chalcopyrite, CuFeS2. It may, however, be quite easily distinguished due to partial coverage of initial oxidation products that, due to the difference of the thin film thickness, are vivid pink, green, or purple.", "comment_date": "2019-06-14T23:18:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rafa Adya", "comment_text": "<b><i>n o r d  v p n</i></b>", "comment_date": "2019-06-14T11:24:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V\u00edctor GC", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8qEA291Fws&amp;t=1m08s\">1:08</a> ARRIBA ESPA\u00d1A", "comment_date": "2019-06-14T10:12:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lazar Vuksanovic", "comment_text": "Running in forest barefooted and stepping on that would be critical", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T20:43:03Z", "likes_count": 257}, {"comment_by": "Theboss47", "comment_text": "Why does it look silver or not gold", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T18:37:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Borovik", "comment_text": "Ad ends at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8qEA291Fws&amp;t=0m13s\">0:13</a>", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T13:58:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jay Dirt", "comment_text": "Leaverite.<br> Leaverite there it ain&#39;t worth shit.", "comment_date": "2019-06-12T00:50:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Undead Bandit\u00f8", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve never seen this thing", "comment_date": "2019-06-11T19:58:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "My dick is unbelievably small, but", "comment_text": "All I can think of when hearing fools gold is a song by Shipwreck.", "comment_date": "2019-06-11T08:48:36Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "VICTOR MATTHEUS", "comment_text": "I sensed the nordvpn sponsor from a mile away", "comment_date": "2019-06-10T12:08:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shupp", "comment_text": "Why does this guy sound like ISAB?<br>this channel is amazing, and I&#39;m not complaining.

As result there is stress/strain relationships therein  the change in temperature results you get forces building up inside the object until in this case it shatters under the forces usually around the heating site and weak points/stress concentrations. If heating where slower and more uniform this would be reduced, and the object might successfully change dimensions overall without shattering as more ductile materials tend to(eg if the change in strain and stress where uniform due to uniform heating). It is possible for decomposition and phase changes inside a rock to participate in this, such as if rock is quickly heated with water or ice embedded deep enough the steam can cause cracking as well, so the slight amount of gas produced by this decomposition might be factor, but the Thermal Stress is likely your fundamental culprit. Aggregate and fractured rocks are much more susceptible to the differential stresses and strains on differential heating hence the old warning about campfire and rock selection though cautiously with fast enough intense enough fire almost any rock can produce fragments.", "comment_date": "2019-05-25T22:39:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "syed mehdi", "comment_text": "i would like to have video on galena", "comment_date": "2019-05-24T22:30:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "moffettFPV", "comment_text": "How many ppm of h2s would that produce?", "comment_date": "2019-05-24T05:07:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dennis W", "comment_text": "I was high as balls when a friend of mine showed me a pyrite dodecahedron.

They&#39;re structurally one of the most interesting silicates, with a very complex hydration quality leading to their use in drying agents. Their porous nature is also interesting as a filter for the petroleum industry. Catalysis through surface adsorption is also very interesting, and the ability to separate rare earth metals based on pore size for purification from thorium reactors and/or compression to create a safer radioisotope enriched glass for safer disposal is also very interesting. Good video overall as well, I feel like pyrite is one of the common minerals that fascinates everybody as a child. Seeing this just increased my appreciation of its value as a resource and general mineral specimen. Mineral chemistry and physics doesn&#39;t seem to garner as much attention as it should considering the incredible ways they&#39;re used. That being said, it&#39;d also really nice to see a video on calcite. The optics of calcite and its general use in nature in shells, skeletons, and other common uses are very widespread and extremely fascinating. This would be a very good example to highlight the nature of reflective indices and birefringence to tie in some valueable physics relations to the nature of light-matter interactions.
