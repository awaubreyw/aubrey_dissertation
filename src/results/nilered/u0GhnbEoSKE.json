If you want some really nice bright glow, add some chloride based bleach. Else, just prick your finger and add a drop of blood. It will glow for a few minutes. I use this for forensic work. I can whip it up within a few minutes, just need two components, water and later add the H2O2. It is stable for at least a year (use it frequently, so no need to test this) and I only need my jugs of solution and small vial of H2O2 to add at the crime scene. Why running around with two solutions? You can get good (false positive) reactions from copper, some ceramics, dyes, some vegetables, cleaning agents etc. But those usually look much different (short and bright reactions) than blood (slower and longer).
