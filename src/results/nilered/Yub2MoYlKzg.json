That being said there are a few things off with your preparation. First, you are adding base to acid, hydrogen peroxide is a relatively weak acid with a pKa of about 11.6 on the DMSO scale, you can find a handy print out compliments of David Evans <a href=\"http://evans.rc.fas.harvard.edu/pdf/evans_pKa_table.pdf\">http://evans.rc.fas.harvard.edu/pdf/evans_pKa_table.pdf</a> .  Reason is if you add base to excess acid you will get a very exothermic reaction that can take off on you in an uncontrolled reaction. Since you have a concentrated solution of peroxide which is known to readily disproportionate back to O2 and H2O you have a formal for expanding gas explosion. Not what you want. <br><br>Second, the Iodide to Iodine reaction is not specific to lithium peroxide but to peroxides in general. The point being that LiOH readily reacts with CO2 in the air. If your LiOH was not sealed well or particularly pure you could have significant amounts of (Li)xCO3(H)y where x and y are numerical values between 0 and 2. When you buy commercial LiOH it usually indicates the initial quantity of carbonates already present, it can be significant. So you might actually have a carbonic peroxide (probably HOC=OO2Li in short hand formula) instead of the LiO2H or more likely a mixture. <br><br>Finally, as an absolute rule of safety, never never never touch a solid peroxide with METAL such as your spatula!!!!! It is well known that metal is a catalyst for the decomposition of peroxides which can be explosive! Use glass, ceramic or plastic but absolutely not your metal scoupula or spatula, especially if they have any rust! If you ever play with MCPBA in the future which I suspect you will, this can make the difference in losing a hand or eye plus bad chemical burns.
