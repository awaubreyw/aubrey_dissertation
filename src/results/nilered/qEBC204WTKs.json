For extractions, it&#39;s better to use <b>many</b> extractions with little liquid each time, than all the liquid in one go. You used 3x20 mL (for a total of 60 mL). Going for something like 4x15 mL, or even the adventurous 6x10 mL, would make you end up with the same amount of total volume of DCM/benzylalcohol mixture, but with a lot more of the alcohol extracted from the water-layer. Though mainly unpolar, benzylalcohol can hydrogen-bond to the water or the benzoic acid, making it somewhat more soluble (at least I would think), and therefore some would probably stay behind in the water layer. This is just a guess though, and I would probably not think that this would account for all the 19% that you were missing.", "comment_date": "2017-02-02T22:54:48Z", "likes_count": 310}, {"comment_by": "Dan Edwards", "comment_text": "curious as to the application of the experiment? surely you would just do a reduction or oxidation? what is the benefit of both simultaneously.<br>great video! thanks", "comment_date": "2017-02-02T22:53:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J3Xtrom", "comment_text": "Why is benzaldehyde illegal in the US?
