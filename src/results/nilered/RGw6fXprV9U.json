Basically, the amount of expansion &amp; shrinking upon temperature change is different between glass and steel, and uranium glass is a medium, coming right between them with a correct mix of uranium and glass. For a normal vacuum tube this is not necessary, but for a big military transmitter tube, where reliability is important and very high running temperatures are normal (especially at the pins), this is pretty crucial.<br><br>The reason for all of this being important in tubes is that any potential microscopic leak = death, and again in military use that&#39;s not exactly great, especially with extremely expensive, powerful transmitting tubes. But it&#39;s not just when they are running that this matters, it also makes a big difference during the process of manufacture, maybe that is actually one of the bigger reasons, I&#39;m not sure tbh. <br><br>Tubes are extremely complicated, not just from the thermionic side of things, but also, and especially, from the chemistry perspective. For example, one of the most important parts of a tube is gettering and more active filtration, all tubes slowly release gasses, as one would expect for a thermionic-emission device, and also as one would expect, gasses are a big no-no in a vacuum tube. So, over a hundred years of research has been done in the filtration of such gasses. Not all tubes have active filtration however, and the level varies a lot. I have soviet tubes with such an immense amount of active filtration in place, they will never die from gass release, and they don&#39;t even have getter spots because they don&#39;t need it. But, almost all tubes eventually die from degradation of the cathode, except underwater repeating tubes. One thing for sure though, tube are not as unreliable as people think, it is mostly poor device design and the fact that companies like Mullard designed consumer tubes to purposefully prematurely fail, that they have such a reputation.", "comment_date": "2022-03-16T07:16:34Z", "likes_count": 127}, {"comment_by": "Second", "comment_text": "As someone who lives far away from Nile, I\u2019m just glad that I live far way from him\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2022-03-16T07:16:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Morton", "comment_text": "Boy, are you trying to get Cancer?", "comment_date": "2022-03-16T05:31:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chair", "comment_text": "Me with literally anything: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=23m51s\">23:51</a>", "comment_date": "2022-03-16T03:24:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucio", "comment_text": "Imagine if nile makes a gaming channel", "comment_date": "2022-03-15T21:03:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "chexo3", "comment_text": "Your original plan was to <i>refine</i> uranium?

The difference in the counts per second is the counts due to alpha. <br><br>Alpha radiation is very reactive and can easily be blocked by a couple of centimeters of dry air or even the dead layer of your skin.

I was surprised you could buy depleted uranyl nitrate. It was interesting that you ended the vid by telling us that you don&#39;t know a lot about physics. Some notes:<br><br>0) Everything radioactive needs to happen in a glovebox or a similarly-shielded environment for your safety. If you put the 15 grams in a beryllium mirror (don&#39;t) you could get an idea of the total radiation, but you would also create many decay chains and other nuclides. At least two deaths have occurred in the USA from beryllium mirror neutron mirror experiments.<br>1) The neutron from the uranium is breaking off at about 202 MeV. If it hits another atom in your environment immediate environment, you create a radionuclide by the nuclear spallation described by Dr. Seaborg. It&#39;s why Marie Curie&#39;s notebooks are radioactive; there&#39;s carbon-14 in her papers.<br>2) &quot;Solid, but liquid enough&quot; &lt;- That&#39;s incorrect and dangerous; annealing is actually controlling the energy of phase transition so the resulting phase is more crystalline. There&#39;s a variety of annealing processes which can control, among other things, the ability of hydrogen to permeate steel.<br>3) The beta particles &quot;shielded&quot; by the glass are transferring energy into the glass and will wear out the containers over time if they absorb enough energy. Notoriously the government&#39;s been working on tritium storage since the 1970s, but the tritium dissolves into the steel containers, decays, and destroys them.", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T19:12:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emese Bart\u00f3k", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=8m38s\">8:38</a> Mmmmmm, 100 % orange juice. \ud83d\ude0b", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T19:02:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "STITCH 4201", "comment_text": "love ya vids, but seriously, why do u look so uncomfortable talking into the camera. its almost painfull to see some of your mannerisms", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T18:59:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josilyn C", "comment_text": "the uranium looks like cheeto dust \ud83d\ude22", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T18:58:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sweet Ginger21", "comment_text": "This guy loves ebay too much \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T18:55:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MisterTiredGaming", "comment_text": "government: hmm ill allow this<br><br>him: <b>puts cant make bombs</b><br><br>goverment: i disapprove :D", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T18:51:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lineeInc", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=10m00s\">10:00</a> the forbidden cheese", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T18:24:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Potocto", "comment_text": "looks like cheese", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T18:10:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Calvados / Rezo", "comment_text": "They look like pop rocks...<br><br>Wonder how they taste?", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T17:54:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lapeez22", "comment_text": "lol urine", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T17:32:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tolstyy", "comment_text": "urinate", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T17:31:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the2ndhumanttv", "comment_text": "instructions unclear what happens if drink salty piss water", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:51:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Buck Nunley", "comment_text": "Sizable cloud of uranium dust at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=17m33s\">17:33</a> flying clear of the jar.

I&#39;ll elaborate: your glass was shattering because of thermal stresses, as you well acknowledged, and making it a bigger slab was, in fact, a bad idea to counter this issue. Bigger volume means bigger thermal gradient upon cooling and thus higher thermal stresses levels. But, and only but, when you touched that glass piece inside the furnace (at video point above) you prematurely started the relief of such stresses on every point of contact, by means of propagating the cracks. That stress relief happened in higher temperature (your furnace temp and also when you re-heated it) than your earlier tests, i.e. at room temperature or almost completely cooled. <br><br>In short, only because you forced the relief of stresses on higher temperature, you diminished the kinectics of crack propragation, making it stable and controlable. Only by understanding the effects of Uranium compounds inside the glass structure should one be able to precisely counter this by means of glass composition adjusting, but ofc reducing it&#39;s content tend to reduce it&#39;s effect, and if the glow achieved is strong enough, you could try to go for lesser wt.% as a trial and that should work better than before, at the very least.", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T18:03:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S Singh", "comment_text": "This wine glass tastes funny", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T15:07:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zragzy 2022", "comment_text": "Nile shortened his lifespan by like 20 years for this Vid", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T11:51:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "clap", "comment_text": "However,", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T07:30:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Aussiegamer1981", "comment_text": "Does anyone else see a clown face in the middle", "comment_date": "2021-01-26T04:05:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kat", "comment_text": "Dude what did you do with all the filtrate leftovers/uranium water???", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T19:15:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jethro23", "comment_text": "Iranian and North Korean Government: &quot;Hmm interesting.&quot; *Furious note taking.", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T09:16:31Z", "likes_count": 57}, {"comment_by": "Brian M.", "comment_text": "Lol buying uranium ore and refining it... yeah you my friend are certainly on some watch lists.", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T06:19:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Badhacktime QC", "comment_text": "This is how Cheez whiz is made", "comment_date": "2021-01-25T05:21:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Hood", "comment_text": "My god i can resist but to chastise you for your  stupidity.

The Geiger counter can not convert counts into dosage, because it does not &quot;know&quot; what kind of particles it is detecting, and what energy they have.  Also, the increase with the more sensitive detector is probably not because of the detection of alpha particles, because the vast majority are stopped within the glass.  An alpha particle can not penetrate a sheet of paper, so any alpha particles detected by the Geiger counter came from near the surface of the glass.  The increased count was due to the increased detector area, the increased sensitivity to beta particles and gammas, and to some extent the detection of alpha particles.  To asses the dosage from the glass, one should take readings with a sheet of heavy paper between the glass and the detector, and then with a ~4mm sheet of aluminum to differentiate the contributions of alpha, beta and gamma radiation.

So it can be in the air and cold tools when it is molten  or almost molten.  The entire annealing and cooling cycle must be in controlled temperatures.  If you open the kiln, you must start the anneal over.<br><br>When I was learning, I kept wanting to open the kiln and take photos of the process.  What I learned is every item where I violated my rule of thumb would eventually spontaneously crack.  Don&#39;t open the kiln until the glass is cool enough to handle, and some will tell you not to open till it hits room temperature.  In my case I was in a hot garage during the summer, so  handling tempo was only 10 or 20 degrees over ambient.   Patience is REQUIRED for successful glass.  No shortcuts!  Depending on the glass, you need anneal time, and then a slow cooldown of less than 40 degrees per hour.", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T06:12:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scranton Hesser", "comment_text": "Literally what&#39;s in G-Fuel.", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T05:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kenabi", "comment_text": "congrats, now you can make your own dnd glow in the blacklight counters.", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T05:00:35Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Piotr Ko\u0142odziej", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=8m04s\">8:04</a> This man just synthesized a real life smiley face.", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T04:03:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wee Hatz", "comment_text": "&quot;Can&#39;t make bombs&quot; is in the CON column......", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T02:44:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doug", "comment_text": "mans holding wayyy more radioactive material then 90% of us would be comfortable with being in the same room as.", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T02:35:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Cooper", "comment_text": "The windy literature exemplarily applaud because route karunagappally shock against a hilarious avenue. legal, imperfect sturgeon", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T02:14:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lubbers maltby", "comment_text": "The accessible asterisk expectedly shave because relative distinctly float underneath a elderly thursday. maddening, cold galley", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T02:13:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brent Gallagher", "comment_text": "Glass was too complicated to make....so I made uranium concentrate", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T02:08:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Wang", "comment_text": "Thank you for doing this as I could never find similar videos on the internet.", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T01:44:10Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Crested 1066", "comment_text": "Next we are going to learn how to make plutonium from common household items.", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T01:41:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mr scary", "comment_text": "Dezimeter cries of radiation him:3.6 not great not terrible", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T01:22:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=7m22s\">7:22</a>-23 your pour resulted in particles &quot;Flying out&quot; past the beaker opening.

The stresses built up inside the glass can shoot small pieces and particles all the way across the room and put them in the air. Fine glass particles are BAD. By doing an imprecise mix, you probably have no idea what the annealing temperature is. Far better to use a commercial mix (get a sample) with a known annealing temp. Learning to blow glass well takes years. Borosilicate glasses better for molding or torch work than blowing on a pipe. They&#39;re too stiff for good blowing.

Its the same reason I would never drink from a glass made using uranium or any other radioactive material.<br><br>Alpha particulates can be stopped by paper or skin, beta by tightly woven fabric, and Gamma rays only through time, distance, and shielding.  Most people with working common knowledge of radiation tend to focus on the danger of Gamma.  However within my field, we actually consider alpha to be the most dangerous form.<br><br>The primary reason for this is that Gamma simply passes through your body.  However, beta can and alpha does get trapped within your body upon ingestion or inhalation.  This causes it to simply bounce around inside of your systems with no means of escape, continuously bombarding the vulnerable organs within your body with radiation.<br><br>These particulates can be excised through ingesting compounds that bonds to the particulates, but that is something that specialized medical staff would deal with so my knowledge on that subject more general then on the matter of radiation in general.<br><br>I hope you stayed safe and I would warn anyone away from being around materials that release anything above normal background levels of radiation without proper PPE.", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T13:04:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "petrolhead1987", "comment_text": "If you plan on working with uranium in the future, I would advise using a radiation probe that measures in sieverts and a contamination probe that measures in CPS not CPM, just for safety.", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T08:55:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meme page", "comment_text": "Damn never knew uranium screamed YOURE TRASH KID", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T05:43:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meme page", "comment_text": "On this day i will kill myself SLOOWWWLLYYYY", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T05:38:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "word_tastic", "comment_text": "I just love uranium.there\u2019s something about it that is so amazing.nuclear bombs", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T04:22:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ed & Amber Olszewski", "comment_text": "Bruh.

For some background I was a CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiation, Nuclear) subject matter expert in the Air Force.  The installation I was stationed at made the focus of my experience within the field centered around the Nuclear and Radiological aspect.<br><br>I was curious if I missed it, or if you simply omitted wearing a protective mask whenever you were around the materials?  The primary reason being the particulates of alpha and beta radiation.  Its the same reason I would never drink from a glass made using uranium or any other radioactive material.<br><br>Alpha particulates can be stopped by paper or skin, beta by tightly woven fabric, and Gamma rays only through time, distance, and shielding.  Most people with working common knowledge of radiation tend to focus on the danger of Gamma.

We would have had a blast (yeah, I almost made nitroglycerin but thought potentially blowing up a few houses wasn&#39;t a good idea...When I realized I came so close I got goosebumps). My uncle was a chemist and gave me tons of chemicals and I learned a lot. I used to go into the chem lab at school and mix up solutions under the hood early as the teachers needed them for later classes. They trusted me and were right to do so with that one nitroglycerin  exception. Most schools today are not teaching kids things that would excite them, so they turn off. This is by design because they are afraid of people who can think critically and who respect the scientific method. Experimenting to understand what and why is the only thing that has allowed progress, but that&#39;s just what those in control don&#39;t want. It&#39;s not only political, it&#39;s that anything not homogenized and predictable in any way disturbs people. Sadly, that&#39;s how humanity learns, and we&#39;re missing out on so much if we stifle thinking and experimentation. <br>Any way, I Thank You for your inquisitive mind. I believe in questioning almost everything. If I don&#39;t learn I am bored. Cognitive dissonance is the death of thinking. I&#39;m happy to learn I&#39;ve been wrong and why. That&#39;s fundamental. I used to be called crazy because I thought higher level physics was artistically poetic. That was before I learned of quantum entanglement, which altered my thinking on so much.

You would also be receiving about 16 times less radiation (than 0.5 meters) due to the inverse-square law. <br><br>Obviously bigger pieces of glass would be more dangerous, but as long as you aren&#39;t sitting next to them <i>all the damn time</i> , you&#39;ll probably be fine.", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T16:47:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aleks Tobias", "comment_text": "NILE:And it looked like...<br>Me: Cocain<br>Him: Flour<br>Me: Flour.....", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T15:54:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Elijah Richards", "comment_text": "The forbidden orange juice", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T15:15:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Kromer", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=8m54s\">8:54</a> the forbidden Sunny D", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T13:25:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe", "comment_text": "next video you&#39;ll be a ghoul", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T11:49:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lino Davila", "comment_text": "Forbidden Mac n cheese mix", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T11:40:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luiz Fernando", "comment_text": "You should make a bomb, for science purposes", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T11:38:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TSK /TheShadowKnight", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=0m44s\">0:44</a> BUT THATS JUST A THEORY, A GAME THEORY", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T11:14:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PL", "comment_text": "<b>forbidden OJ</b>", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T02:57:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brad Pitts", "comment_text": "\u201cSo I pulled a vacuum on it\u201d", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T00:56:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sleepyTaco", "comment_text": "Welp hope im not on the FBI watchlist after watching this \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T00:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JoeyLovesTrains", "comment_text": "best activity to try in quarantine!

It can not distinguish between alpha, beta, or gamma radiation when it is in the dose rate (Sieverts/hr) mode either.   It treats every count as if it were a gamma ray and applies a gamma sensitivity factor to the cpm rate to get the dose rate.  With a source (like U) that is mostly betas it will hugely over-estimate  the dose rate.  It could be off by a couple orders of magnitude.   Crazy I know.

When glass or many other ceramics change in temperature they experience contraction and expansion depending on if they are increasing or decreasing in temperature. If the outside cools faster then the inside, the outside contracts more then the inside and causes either a stress or an outright break. There is also another reason for breaking in ceramics and that is called quartz inversion (500c - 600c, 573c seems to be the critical point) as during this point there is a change in the physical structure of the ceramic which probably (not sure the science behind it) also causes changes in volume which if not uniform throughout the piece, will cause a break or major stress, slow cooling and heating through this temperature range is vital and you absolutely blasted through this stage so its no surprise you ended with a breakage. We normally go about 60c per hour during this stage just to be safe. Ceramic scientists have this down to a fine art and go through this stage at the maximum rate to maximize efficiency in industrial ceramics, I&#39;m not sure what that rate is but I&#39;m sure you could find it somewhere. This break can also happen after the item has cooled as the stresses created in the piece by cooling too quickly remain in the piece until perhaps even the the coefficient ratio of thermal expansion between the heat from your finger and the ambient temperature is enough to finally make it go PING.

If you can get the initial pour/set to complete without completely destroying the piece, you can look at it under a polarized lens and see <b>tons</b> of rainbowing. This is the stress inside the glass that led to your pieces exploding later. The stress just stays, the glass is 90% solid, and so there&#39;s no practical way for that stress to disperse. Eventually some of the glass fails, and it&#39;ll cascade. If you instead allow only the very first cooling to occur, and then anneal, it&#39;ll allow the piece to settle and disperse the stresses. The temps involved vary, depending on your initial casting temps, but with borosilicate glass I work around 2500F, anneal at ~1200F, and then slowly bring it down to about 800F before slowly coming to room temp (as slowly as equipment and patience allow, no more than a day or two). Trial and error is a good teacher for this, and a polarized lens lets you check your work. As long as the piece doesn&#39;t shatter, you can generally back up and repeat steps as well.<br><br><br>Once annealed in this way, basic borosilicate glass should be <b>very</b> tough, with very high shatter and abrasion resistance.

I work with molten glass and sometimes glass blow. The shattering you are experiencing is due to your glass not being annealed. Annealing causes the stress inside the glass particles to be released. Otherwise the glass can spontaneously shatter. This can occur hours, to days after cooling. How to anneal your glass? I&#39;ll give you the rundown: have a furnace that has programmable temperature adjustment, put your still hot, but solid glass in,  have furnace a around 900 F, then program it to slowly cool glass to room temperature over 24 hours. Smaller pieces (marbles) don&#39;t always need annealing, but it is still good to do. If you don&#39;t have a furnace, put all of the small pieces onto some glass insulation, and then cover the top with more insulation. This usually gives small beads and marbles enough time too cool down,  ~45 min, don&#39;t uncover them, this ruins the process.

A friend had a university job working for the professor in charge of it and helped with experiments and as a gofer. He was one of those guys best not left unsupervised. The local pizza chain sold glass pitchers etched with the university logo with free refills on soda with a pizza purchase every time you brought it in during football season. My friend did his own &quot;experiments&quot; while left alone, usually involving various items from the lab being lowered into the reactor and seeing what readings he got. During a particularly boring shift he had the bright idea to lower his pitcher from the pizza place into the reactor. It was heavy glass. Well, it came out a nasty shade of green. He had no self protection filter so he showed it to the professor like a toddler showing off the new magic marker mural on the living room wall. The prof thought it was hilarious and determined the impurities in the glass caused the reaction, but the pitcher itself was perfectly fine,  just ugly as hell. So, boy genius shows us his &quot;new&quot; pitcher and being male college geniuses ourselves, we unanimously decided to continue the discussion at the pizza joint, taking his pitcher along with all of ours. The rest of us got our free refills, but genius was told it, being green, (obviously) wasn&#39;t their pitcher. We showed them the etched logo to prove it was, indeed, their pitcher. The server naturally asked why it was that ugly green, and genius happily told the truth. The manager was summoned, and we were politely invited to remove ourselves, and the nuked pitcher, from the premises.

(There&#39;s two different certifications, depending on the manufacturer.) BTW, you can&#39;t mix different types of glass for fusing, because of the different CoEs. As the piece heats and cools, the piece will eventually rip itself apart. You CAN make a single glass by melting all of the pieces to a molten state, and let the mixture cool, however, you&#39;d only be able to work with it and not other bits of glass.<br><br><br>Also, the recipe you wanted was 80% silica, 13% boric oxide, and 4% sodium oxide with 2\u20133% aluminium oxide for color and clarity stabilization. Remember, you can dope your glass with metals to get different colors.

It cooled too quickly and unevenly. The way to fix this is to let the mixture cool in your kiln to about 900-1200 Deg F (482 - 649 Deg C), hold and soak at that temperature, and then VERY VERY SLOWLY (like five degrees an hour) reduce the temperature to room temp. With such small samples, you might be able to do five degrees every fifteen minutes, but it has to be slow.<br><br><br>Also, if you want to see if your glass has stress fractures, get two pieces of polarized film and a light table. Place one piece of the film on the table, put your piece on top of it, and then the other film on top of the glass piece you made. Then turn the top polarized film so it&#39;s 90 degrees from the bottom (blocking light). The glass piece should show up as it&#39;ll bend light. Then look for what should look like cracks in the piece. If it&#39;s homogenized and relaxed, it should have no stress fractures.

I\u2019d like to explain why the glass got more fluorescent as it cooled. Fluorescence occurs when an electron in an excited state relaxes to a ground state. This is a high energy transition and usually takes place in the UV through visible range. However, if there are a lot of different vibrational states then the excited electron can actually relax vibrationally which means it will give off heat but no visible light. When the glass is hot we are seeing thermal deactivation of the excited state, vibrations, and hence little to no fluorescence. I\u2019d be willing to bet that getting the glass very cold would increase fluorescence output (quantum yield) even more.", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T18:55:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Saliman Latti", "comment_text": "Nile red now called Are you ready to die", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T18:54:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "INTP INFJ", "comment_text": "I wouldn&#39;t wear it as a necklace, me no want uranium that close to my thyroid", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T18:53:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Victor Widell", "comment_text": "Did your bottle perhaps block the UV light? @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=12m40s\">12:40</a>", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T18:53:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mathew Zacharia", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGw6fXprV9U&amp;t=10m15s\">10:15</a> why the hell does it look like mango ice cream and very appetizing is it only me?", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T18:50:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caleb", "comment_text": "i&#39;ll be surprised if youtube doesn&#39;t flag this video, be careful my friend", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T18:48:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mori Shep", "comment_text": "&quot;Death Clouds&quot; aka radioactive heavy metal, cancer-causing, brian rotting powder.....<br>everything about this just makes me scream no no no no no NOOOOOO", "comment_date": "2020-02-17T18:45:51Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "Impatient Ape", "comment_text": "Too much hands motion -- very distracting.

I was wondering do you think you could make a video making real Silly/Thinking Putty with silicone Oil and boric Acid(both are not toxic to my knowledge) but when heated and mixed make silly putty, though there are a few other ingredients that help bind them like silica I believe but those are the two main ones. I&#39;m trying to make it myself but I need to get a beaker, hot plate and something to mix it with. There&#39;s a russian chemist on here who did it via a microwave but he said it took him several times and he used something toxic in his for some reason but he did say you don&#39;t need that to make it just boric acid and silicone oil as the main two ingredients. Would really appreciate it if you did this in one of your videos. Most make your own silly putty videos are the bootleg, kiddy version with glue, borax, water and food coloring. Obviously it&#39;s for kids and easy to make, but I rarely if ever see anyone making the real deal silly or thinking putty!!

My advice would be to return it to your electric furnace, at a temperature that&#39;s below the melting point, but still respectably high.

The gamma is what\u2019s dangerous when you hold it. That reading you had with the mazur is mostly alpha radiation which can\u2019t penetrate your skin.

The Canadaian Nuclear Safety Commission has a maximum allowable, annual dose of radiation to a person of 5 Rem per year to a nuclear energy worker. Although across nuclear generating and research facilities in Canada the annual dose to a nuclear energy worker is enforced as 1 Rem per year. That being said you are most likely not a nuclear energy worker, so the annual dose to a civilian is enforced to 0.1 Rem annually. Although that&#39;s not alot of radiation, it&#39;s not wise to introduce more radioactive sources into your everyday environment. The reason being that every dose has a risk, and that a person&#39;s dose should be kept ALARA (as low as reasonably acheivable). As some words of advice to keep your lab from being a hazard, it would be wise to check all of your equipment with direct readings from and indirect readings with your radiation meter (direct is using the meter directly on something, indirect is using a swab or tissue to try pick up contamination and check it on the meter elsewhere). Keeping with ALARA it would be wise to try to keep any contamination levels as close to your backround readings as possible where the beta/gamma levels was 15cpm, and alpha should be as close to 0 as possible. And of course you want to try and keep yourself from creating any more radiation hazards, to go about doing this is simply to keep the uranium items and waste away from anything with a high atomic mass (when beta and alpha particles shoot off near heavy atoms, they bend around them like an asteroid around a planet, this causes them to lose energy in the form of gamma rays that would shoot off around your lab), so anything plastic or glass is a safe bet for storing uranium waste in to prevent gamma rays from being produced.", "comment_date": "2020-02-15T23:38:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DeadlyAnemia", "comment_text": "The forbidden banana pudding :drool:", "comment_date": "2020-02-15T23:38:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mat\u00edas Tripaldi", "comment_text": "Oh wow, poor Andy from HTME struggled for months trying to make clear glass and our man NileRed goes and makes perfect glass in one attempt, kudos to you", "comment_date": "2020-02-15T23:38:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AxoIotIl", "comment_text": "The forbidden mustard", "comment_date": "2020-02-15T23:38:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VerdantElucubrator", "comment_text": "for ceramic glaze making they use porcelain ball mills to grind the mixed glass powders in a slurry of water until they&#39;re very fine, so you probably could&#39;ve ground the wet uranium in the mortar an pestle and not worried about dust", "comment_date": "2020-02-15T23:38:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Enjoyer of Youtube", "comment_text": "I&#39;m foreseeing a pretty hardcore NileBlue cleanup video from this", "comment_date": "2020-02-15T23:37:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valkyrie612", "comment_text": "Why am I so addicted to this channel?? ;)", "comment_date": "2020-02-15T23:37:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthewv1998", "comment_text": "How radioactive is the old glass though?", "comment_date": "2020-02-15T23:36:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Agamemnon", "comment_text": "You really shouldn&#39;t wear these as a necklace!
