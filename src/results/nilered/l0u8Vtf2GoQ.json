You didn\u2019t need to have a Dr in front of your name to be able to make these observations and get down to the bottom of them.  Personally I did assume that the yellow was from the air or beaker and you did a great job of showing why and measuring it.  Also showing that when we saw less yellow in most cases the yellow was not reduced just the other colors had increased!<br><br>So dude great job!  Out of ALL the plasma microwave videos this one was my ABSOLUTE favorite because you did what is taught in middle school!  I really feel like so many of my peers are failing at their jobs or life in general because they don\u2019t understand some very simple concepts that they should have learned in middle school.  Like making observations or one of the most important things imaginable (correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation).<br><br>So people like you that get normal people and especially children interested in science are very important to humanities future!  People are learning differently!

However when i saw your video you also could only generate sparks and no plasma with the forks. It got me thinking . Further the aluminum foil gauze matches all had very thin layers of metal. Hence is it possible that it was relatively easier to heat the aluminum foil etc to a point where it emitted ions and hence the plasma . But the fork in ur case and spoon in mine was very thick and hence didnt get hot enough to emit stuff. Just thought it might be interesting to figure out why the spoon/fork didnt create plasma .

Joe died about 8 years ago and considered himself a scientific &quot;parasite&quot; because he would attach him self to real scientists in order to make money somehow based on &#39;new&#39; developments or discoveries etc.  Anyway, this chemist discovered that by grinding up magnetite and glass and heating it in a crucible, in a microwave, to (I believe it a yellow glow or maybe it was red) for several hours, say four, that the glass and magnetite mixture (maybe among other things) turned into small amounts of gold, silver and platinum!  Now you may say &quot;no way&quot; but YOU CAN&#39;T PROVE IT unless you try it your self.  You are the man to do this experiment, if your patrons will even let you.  He (the chemist) had a theory that gold exists in an atomic state in the atmosphere and that the magnetite sequestered it with the heat from the air around us.  You had to have an adjustable microwave oven though.  This was the hard part.  I&#39;ll try to dig out his name and video dvd from years back.  Now old Joe had three mining claims her in Arizona and was planning to sell, to the Chinese, his magnetite claim when it was &quot;blocked by the Udall&#39;s people: rich congressman/lawyers from Arizona that had invested in CAP (water channels to southern Arizona) according to Joe.  They were (are) extremely rich and powerful which in my mind means that they are controlled by even greater power possessors.    Now we all know the gold and silver discovery and or production will upset power&#39;s plans etc.  I digress. Joe had another way to make gold, or so he claimed: he had some specially designed pressure plates that consisted of some materials, he spent a lot of money on,  (he never told us) that squeezed hard together to supposedly produce gold better than the microwave oven experiments.  If this is bull then why did someone come on his property, west of Tucson, and shoot his(identical) twin brother (killing him) and steal the plates and other things?  The sheriff did little to investigate the murder, Joe said.  Political reasons? Joe had other projects, like his solar &quot;paper&quot; with other scientists, that got mysteriously burned down and his lab near the airport that got burned down.

It still cooks food good enough, so manufactures penny pinch wherever they can (to the point aluminum is also used in the transformer windings, and will generally fry if you leave the micro running for more than an hour at 100%).", "comment_date": "2020-06-01T11:51:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "a smol bean", "comment_text": "This is why phone cases are important", "comment_date": "2020-05-31T07:32:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Denton Fender", "comment_text": "Would Mercury produce a plasma that produced ultraviolet light as in a fluorescent bulb?", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T23:46:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Denton Fender", "comment_text": "What would happen if you put some sodium chloride in the microwave oven?", "comment_date": "2020-05-29T23:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "spooktime", "comment_text": "man really made a bite sized sun", "comment_date": "2020-05-28T16:44:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NintendoSense", "comment_text": "This was really cool thanks NileRed", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T18:26:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis P\u00e9rez", "comment_text": "Now I am confused then because paraffin candles have that yellowish color they also contain potassium and sodium ions when paraffin is alkaline hydrocarbons that only contains carbon with hydrogen and oxygen.", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T06:24:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis P\u00e9rez", "comment_text": "It\u2019s possible do remake in vacuum conditions?", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T06:12:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis P\u00e9rez", "comment_text": "If you smell the nitrogen oxide produced into microwave you can be anesthetize you or to laugh?", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T05:50:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RSD N/A", "comment_text": "Whoever&#39;s microwave that was used way too much salt on their food...", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T02:41:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RSD N/A", "comment_text": "You&#39;re the epitome of dumb a very smart person.", "comment_date": "2020-05-27T02:33:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Esther F.", "comment_text": "Might have to mess around and mess up a few microwayes", "comment_date": "2020-05-23T20:21:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Squidballs", "comment_text": "Moral : grapes are healthy", "comment_date": "2020-05-23T03:47:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Takahiro Hirata", "comment_text": "Very neat experiment and thanks for uploading.<br>I just remembered that when I heated a glass tube with a torch to make a capillary, the tube was surrounded by bright yellow flame as soon as it started to soften.<br>This might similarly be due to sodium ions inside glass as your experiment.", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T21:31:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Redella", "comment_text": "I learned today that NileRed has a dad!", "comment_date": "2020-05-22T00:01:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Elias Papa", "comment_text": "Video idea: Putting a vial of argon or neon into a microwave.", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T04:18:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Drake Matheson", "comment_text": "Your poor beakers omfg I hope you didn\u2019t keep those", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T03:45:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reghard Stoltz", "comment_text": "I tried it doesn&#39;t work", "comment_date": "2020-05-18T17:01:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roger Wicki", "comment_text": "I&#39;m actually surprised that the plastic survived so long...", "comment_date": "2020-05-18T12:08:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "American Viking", "comment_text": "Ooh!

The microwave plasma exhibits strange and peculiar properties. First, we must consider some details to solve the mysteries. The plasma color not only depends on the chemical components, but also on the emission generated by the energy released by the plasma resonance. This is difficult to calculate because we must solve the Maxwell\u2019s equations into a specific shape and conditions. As we can see in the video, when the plasma is contained into the glass a better stability is shown. It could be produced due to the container geometry, which can work as a resonance box as well when the plasma gets into a resonance state. <br><br><br><br>Another detail is that plasma is a very efficient tool to clean surfaces. Is widely used to clean the interior of high vacuum chambers in industry. When the plasma gets in contact over a determined surface, the plasma \u201cvaporizes\u201d the impurities over the surface. This is a common problem in experimental thermonuclear assemblies, in which the plasma is maintain away from the vacuum chamber walls by high magnetic fields induced by powerful coils. This is to avoid contamination into the thermonuclear plasma. In the case of the experiments showed in the video, the plasma gets in contact with the glass walls, so it doesn\u2019t matter how much you \u201cclean\u201d the glass, contamination is inevitable. <br><br><br><br>Maybe should be a good idea to repeat these experiments but now trying to get more data to solve the following questions: Can we measure the temperature inside the plasma ball? plasma temperature gives us important information about their conditions. How much the plasma depends on the atmospheric conditions? Is well know that in lower pressures is more easy to form plasma conditions but here.. what is happening? And also, we know the magnetron frequency, the power emission, the resonance frequency of the oven, the geometry of the glass and an approximate volume of the plasma ball, so, Can we simulate/solve the Maxwell\u2019s equations of the plasma ball? this is in order to determine the resonance emission and more magnetohydrodynamic properties. <br><br><br><br>Another thing\u2026 Could you share the resulting spectrum data emissions? Could be interesting to analyze this information, maybe I can find something else.<br><br>Regards.", "comment_date": "2019-09-04T17:38:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zorkz", "comment_text": "I once tried to record inside my microwave and fried my SD card", "comment_date": "2019-09-04T14:10:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michal \u0160tein", "comment_text": "Try growing Ammonium dihydrogen phosphate crystals!", "comment_date": "2019-09-04T13:31:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "short bastard", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t get anything he is saying but it&#39;s interesting", "comment_date": "2019-09-04T06:52:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stunt Wzrd Flayv", "comment_text": "Nile, For your next video extract heme from your stool and make an impossible burger.

Just friendly advise from a old lab tech who enjoyed your Lil&#39; experiment!))<br> I have to say (though I&#39;ve not yet watched to the end, at about15 min mark) I think your assuming the yellow is from sodium. And that&#39;s poor science.  First, did you get a base line spectrum on the materials/gases existing in every plasma? And.... Was that the main goal of this &quot;experiment&quot;, to discover what compounds cause color changes in plasma??? I originally thought your &quot;Microwave/Plasma&quot; experiment was pretty cool! ANd I still do, only that your tangent on why it was yellow for me kinda ruined the whole microwave/plasma ordeal. (well, maybe not ruined the whole deal. Just the wrong focus) Oh by the way when you struggled to reproduce the plasma after removing the rotation factor, I think you jumped to conclusions with rotation when, in my opinion, it was quite possibly height that made the difference!! With the glass turn table turned over your object was then over an inch higher in the microwave cabinet!And as you learned the microwaves travel through the inside of the cabinet in somewhat of a pattern. And it&#39;s a repeatable pattern which is why the turntable is important when heating food! I&#39;m willing to bet if you were to lower your objective (or sample and beaker) to near orig height and didn&#39;t rotate it, you&#39;d once again see the plasma return! If you dont think im full of it and are willing to try it I&#39;d love to find out if I am  right or not! Now having watched it all I do think you jump to alot of conclusions...but still I think we both learned alot from everything you did, And... it was fun!! All in all I got to say, Good job man! <br>Question though: do you know if your microwave had a rotating deflector above the cabinet ceiling or not? Oh, and when your rotating attachment kept catching fire...well once you burnt it you put carbon traces all over it and then it was doomed to relight every time!

Another important note, is that the incandescence you referred to actually still follows the same emission spectra as other sources of excitation, and so &quot;soot&quot; wouldn&#39;t really explain a sodium peak, except for the fact that your soot contains <a href=\"http://sodium.as/\">sodium.As</a> for where the plasma is coming from, and how it&#39;s sustained, I&#39;d say it&#39;s pretty obvious that the initial sparking of the metal is coming from current being induced in the metal by the changing magnetic field of the microwave, which actually helps to explain how the plasma ball is sustained, and why it happens with fire as well.  Plasma is relatively conductive, so a current can be induced in it by a changing magnetic field, just like in metal, this current helps to sustain the plasma, and in some cases make it bigger, which makes a larger conductor, which is in contact with more changing magnetic field.  This also explains why the plasma breaks away from the fuel source, it&#39;s no longer &quot;fire&quot; sustained by fuel, it&#39;s free plasma sustained by a magnetic field.

As far as I understand it the hydrogen just needs light to give it the energy to bond with the chlorine. From there I guess a fan at the top of the flask would force it down to another chamber of water. The big question I would be struggling to answer would be, How do you know when you&#39;ve got the concentration to the right amount? One thought comes to mind, if you know the concentration of the salt water and you know how much current is going through the solution then the rate of hydrogen chloride evolution would be known. From there you just need a timer to cut off the power and let the fan finish moving the hydrogen chloride to the other chamber.

As a suggestion, try perhaps gypsum plaster (CaSO4), Copper, non-ROHS solder, Magnesium. Be cautious of the fumes. I also suggest investigating four mysteries: 1) why Aluminium only creates blue plasma in electric plasma, and why that color won&#39;t show up while it&#39;s burning, or in flame tests. 2) Why copper almost acts the opposite way, and its blue-green color doesn&#39;t readily show up in an electric arc of up to about .5 Amp, but it can be seen in flame tests. 3) Color of magnesium in electric plasma, if there&#39;s any. 4) That&#39;s probably the most challenging to reproduce (and it&#39;s okay if you pass this one). You often see this briliant blue-green color in high amperage high voltage arcs.

I wanna suggest way of making indigo carmine which needs much less cleanings. First step is just indigo and sulfuric acid reaction. After you need pour it in cold water with cracked ice, all heat of diluting sulfuric acid goes to ice melting and blend stays completely cold. Neutralize extra acid with sodium bicarbonate and add some sodium sulfate. Put it in fridge for a night and filter it with coffee filter. Final step is dissolving it in hot water ( you can do that with product on coffee filter, just take it off when all diluted, that makes lesser loss ). Add 1:1 or 1:2 isopropanol and put it in fridge. Filter it with coffee filter and wash with some extra isopropanol. And while it still pasty put in into a bowl to dry.

At the end...during talking about why it was 120Hz, I feel a detail could have been added and then expanded upon that might be kinda interesting. You didn&#39;t mention whether this was a newer solid state microwave, or the older and much more common standard microwave(with just a diode/capacitive doubler) . The latter would be a likely be that the magnetron is being ran on unfiltered pulsed DC and so is, in your case, 120Hz rectified AC (it&#39;s 100 for us in the UK, ofc) and then chucks out something like 2.45GHz into the cavity 120 times a second (uhh, dusty area of brain memory information, please correct if all or any is incorrect.) Varying that frequency might give you some interesting results (if a total pain).<br>I&#39;m not sure if the more modern solid state microwaves still operate in the same way(err minus the whole bit before actually powering the magnetron), or still pump the magnetron with totally unfiltered pulsed DC like that. That miiiiiight be worth looking at, and might give you more scope for fiddling with the output and seeing what happens and if it&#39;s anything cool. Just do it very fucking carefully ahaha. &#39;However, my biggest concern wasn&#39;t really safety&#39; will absolutely get you killed if you&#39;re playing around on the inside of the microwave, too...or operate the magnetron out of the/a cavity...y&#39;know, the fun stuff :p", "comment_date": "2019-08-15T09:46:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0414\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u044a\u0440 \u0414\u0437\u0438\u043c\u0431\u043e\u0432", "comment_text": "get to the bottom of why rain makes charges", "comment_date": "2019-08-15T09:46:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Matt Lew", "comment_text": "I remember doing it by burning paper or twigs.

Of course this is some form of salt most likely a carbonate and of course the ever-popular table salt. The purplish flame purplish blue that you got above the match was a great example of the potassium that&#39;s in the match head. But also I found it a great explanation that you gave for why it would go from yellow to Blue. As per chemistry instead of using heat in that theory I believe it&#39;s quite possible the sodium attached itself to the glass became some form of glass silicon I don&#39;t know. That would explain the color shift from yellow to blue blue being from the nitrogen in the air. This is of course all conjecture except for the experience I have with sodium which I could say you have to wash everything in order to get the true color from anything non sodium like copper for example. There is so much sodium around there is so much sodium around Copper is supposed to be blue fire but because of the sodium very small amounts all the metal (from oils on skin etc) it normally gives off that typical green that we see. As for the blue fire from the foil turning yellow on u i must ask: waa this the beaker that had the yellow plasma that turned blue from earlier? This would lend creedence to my na theory.

The substrate being etched must be the cathode, attracting positive ions, which are accelerated toward the substrate through a &quot;sheath voltage&quot;.
