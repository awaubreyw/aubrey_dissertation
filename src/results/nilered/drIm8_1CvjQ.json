The <br>main ingredient was oleo oil derived from tallow (beef fat). To make <br>margarine choice grade, edible tallow (with a melting point of <br>approximately 49\u00b0C or 120\u00b0F) was ground and heated in water at <br>relatively low temperature. A little potassium carbonate and the <br>stomachs of two sheep or pigs were added per ton. The pepsin from the <br>stomachs (enzymes were just then coming to be understood) was supposed <br>to break down the fat tissues, aiding in extraction of the fat. The <br>liquid fat, which floated to the surface and was decanted off, was <br>called &quot;oleo stock&quot; in English or premier jus  in French. This <br>was poured into shallow pans and allowed to crystallize slowly at about <br>30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F). The resulting granular mass was wrapped in filter cloths <br>and pressed hydraulically. The resulting liquid, which comprised about <br>60% of the volume of the oleo stock, had a melting point lower than that<br> of the original tallow, about 31\u00b0C or 88\u00b0F. This liquid was called <br>&quot;oleo oil&quot; in English, but &quot;oleomargarine&quot; in French. Note that at <br>typical room temperature oleo oil would become a soft plastic semisolid,<br> with much the same &quot;melt in the mouth&quot; consistency as butter at room <br>temperature. The solid fat remaining in the filter cloths had a higher <br>melting point than the original tallow (about 52\u00b0C or 126\u00b0F) and was <br>called &quot;oleostearine.&quot; Now, to make margarine, 30 kg of cooled oleo oil/<br> oleomargarine  were mixed with 25 kg each of cow&#39;s milk and of<br> water in a butter churn fitted with an agitator. To this was added 100 <br>gm of macerated fresh cow&#39;s udder, which was believed to contain an <br>enzymelike substance that promoted formation of milk emulsion in cows. <br>The mixture was agitated at the body temperature of a cow for 2-3 hours <br>and the resulting emulsion was then handled by the butter making <br>process. Ice cold water was added to the churn to solidify the emulsion.<br> The mixture was finally salted and excess water was drained, then <br>kneaded out. The plastic mass was pounded into barrels for sale as bulk <br>margarine. A good butterlike flavor resulted, not from the intended <br>enzymatic digestion, but from a bacterial fermentation and souring in <br>the milk. If the new product had not been tasty, the sophisticated <br>French palate would not have accepted it so quickly (Schwitzer 1956). It<br> should be emphasized that, considering the state of the art at that <br>time, Mege-Mouries&#39;s invention was an extraordinary development. For the<br> first time, even though by accident, it established the principle of <br>treating fats other than butterfat with milk to produce a flavor like <br>that of butter.", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T09:52:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Willydilly 21", "comment_text": "How to pronounce it in Australia, MARJ ARE REEN", "comment_date": "2018-03-21T09:10:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maracachucho", "comment_text": "You forgot the salt, very important!", "comment_date": "2018-03-21T06:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A E S T H E T I C", "comment_text": "No its not butter nvm.", "comment_date": "2018-03-21T03:45:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrSparkle", "comment_text": "If you try it again, make sure you salt it before you taste it.", "comment_date": "2018-03-16T06:05:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ester Grant", "comment_text": "came for the science, buttttt <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drIm8_1CvjQ&amp;t=10m50s\">10:50</a> <br>\u201ccis or trans\u201d", "comment_date": "2018-03-15T17:29:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "idan istaharov", "comment_text": "Ahhhh, its looks like earwax", "comment_date": "2018-03-11T18:55:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan Adams", "comment_text": "Your margarine had no taste because you forgot the key ingredient: salt!", "comment_date": "2018-03-06T12:21:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vinchelo Fourie", "comment_text": "&quot;Becel&quot;  is known as &quot;Flora&quot; here, in South Africa.", "comment_date": "2018-03-04T12:08:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarkozy Gaming", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drIm8_1CvjQ&amp;t=12m24s\">12:24</a> &quot;a leak in the system&quot; Well it&#39;s hydrogen gas so yeh it&#39;s leaking basically everywhere", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T23:24:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J the Welsh Warlord", "comment_text": "You needed some salt in that", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T17:08:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atticus", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drIm8_1CvjQ&amp;t=14m48s\">14:48</a> got me thinking of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLSypRa2JA4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLSypRa2JA4</a>", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T01:04:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Royalty", "comment_text": "Yummy!", "comment_date": "2018-02-28T17:30:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "What Man", "comment_text": "Make butter margarine is horrible", "comment_date": "2018-02-24T20:05:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ian inc", "comment_text": "Cis.

I would imagine that your dropping funnel ended up etched and the glass barrel of the stopcock would probably also be damaged.<br><br>You can also control the rate of hydrogen production by altering the current flow (by changing the voltage), which directly translates to rate of reaction in electrolysis. So you could even rig it to send the hydrogen directly into the hydrogenation flask without using balloons. You wouldn&#39;t necessarily need a valve either, since the hydrogen flow could be stopped immediately by cutting power to the electrolysis cell.

I don&#39;t have much experience with chemistry as a science, but I do have a lot of experience with applied chemistry (ie: cooking), so I noticed some things that might improve your product, if you want to do a real edible chem video on this later, like when you redid the capsaicin videos. From a cooking perspective, I&#39;m thinking that you need:<br><br>1) Far less lecithin. Seriously, that looks like little enough product that a single egg yolk would be enough---and there&#39;s a lot of stuff in egg yolk other than emulsifiers---and it looks like you used more lecithin than the volume of an egg yolk.<br><br>2) More unsaturated fat mixed into the final product. That&#39;s just a guess, though.<br><br>3) Less water. With an emulsifier like lecithin, you should be able to get more than 2 parts fat to 1 water by volume. (I&#39;ve made mayonnaise (which is basically the same thing as margarine, but with almost all unsaturated (liquid) fat out of a few tablespoons of water-based liquid and several cups of oil.)<br><br>4) Some flavors. Even if the texture came out perfect, just partially hydrogenated fat emulsified with water won&#39;t taste like much of anything. You need some salt at the very least, and maybe some butter flavor (available in most supermarkets, at least in the US, and I can&#39;t imagine they wouldn&#39;t be available in Canada).<br><br>5) Far more vigorous stirring. The most important part of making a decent emulsion isn&#39;t the emulsifier, but the stirring. The emulsifier prevents it from separating over time, but in order to make the emulsion in the first place, I&#39;d&#39;ve used a stir bar. For larger amounts, a whisk can be used (although your arms will probably be numb by the time you finish), or an immersion blender. A food processor or bar blender can also be used, but you&#39;ll have to be careful not to over-mix. Another advantage of using blenders and whisks is that you introduce more air into the mixture. Since you&#39;re past the hydrogenization step at that point, air isn&#39;t a problem chemically, and air bubbles help to soften the final product.<br><br>Hope this helps in your kitchen if not in the lab. Now I&#39;m thinking of picking up some partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (probably a mix of shortening and olive oil, since I don&#39;t have a lab setup) and seeing if I can make margarine at home.", "comment_date": "2017-08-13T19:56:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Furest", "comment_text": "This map of the 1870&#39;s tho...

If there is a random hydrogen atom on the wrong side of the carbon chain, no second hydrogen atom on the cis-bond side of the chain and that hydrogen has an &quot;empty&quot; site on the corresponding site of the carbon atom in front of and behind it in the chain, it can&#39;t be used by humans and can&#39;t be identified by scavenger receptors once they&#39;ve entered the human body. That&#39;s why they have such a significant impact in the form of causing earlier morbidity in several otherwise age-related diseases. Completely different mechanism compared to cholesterol but almost identical long term effects.<br><br>Perhaps the medical definition of &quot;trans&quot; differs from chemistry? As long as there is one continous row of hydrogen atoms on any one side of the chain, it&#39;s considered cis.
