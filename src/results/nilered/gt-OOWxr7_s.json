Do you know that you are saved? Don&#39;t wait, if you can&#39;t honestly answer this. Today you can be saved, if you will come and seek God. Pray to him and ask him to come into your life and save you. If you do this and be Baptized into a Church that follows the Bible in truth and do the will of God, putting your faith in Jesus Christ for salvation and following God, you can be saved and spend eternity with God in Heaven. I hope you will consider this. God can give you many blessings and help you greatly. Our sins have created so many horrible things on earth, but if you follow God, he can make everything new. This isn&#39;t to say that he will make everything easy , but he can help us in ways you can&#39;t imagine.

Here&#39;s my question: I know that many computer parts are made with many precious metals, not just gold. Are there processes that will recover those other metals, such as platinum, palladium, silver, etc.  (Ooh, I see tantalum is used. But reading more about that, I&#39;m not sure I want to deal with that stuff... not as an amateur.)", "comment_date": "2020-08-15T01:00:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jun imperial", "comment_text": "Hm per kilo of scrap can you send it to the Philippine?

Don&#39;t spend money on the old tech junk - just take that crap off of your friend&#39;s and family&#39;s hands. Don&#39;t overlook your employers either. I&#39;ve emptied many back rooms worth of tech graveyard for my boss at no cost to me. I&#39;ve been doing this for years as a side hobby. I collect every dead motherboard, every dead PC, every dead printer, every replaced hard drive, every old video game system, old TVs (the old cathode ray monsters, plasmas and LCDs), every old phone and every broken electronic toy. I even collect everyone&#39;s old smoke alarms and anything else that has even a small PCB in it. You can pass the same solution through several slightly different processes to get all the gold, silver, platinum, copper and aluminum out of it. All of those metals have value and if you&#39;re going to the work of this anyway it doesn&#39;t make much sense to just wash everything not gold down the drain. I mean seriously you only spend twenty minutes to an hour doing something and then you&#39;re leaving everything sit for a night or a couple of days or a week so why not. Also don&#39;t overlook the computer cases and motherboard trays. Some of the cases and motherboard trays are aluminum and can be cut up and processed to get rid of the enamel, glues, solder, etc as well and they add up. Aluminum isn&#39;t worth what gold or platnium is worth but when you get it for free it adds up pretty quickly.<br><br>In the six years I have been doing this as a hobby I&#39;ve made enough money selling the precious metals to local jewelers and the aluminum and copper to a local metals supply house I&#39;ve bought myself a very nice a Mesa Boogie tube amp head with a Mesa Boogie 4 x 12 slant cabinet and built a very nice custom Jagstang and a Jazzmaster from bodies and necks I custom ordered from Warmoth and filled out with my choice of amazing parts.

In E-Waste, you have lot more issues: Most of the gold is in an Tin-Silver-Copper-...-Gold Alloy (if you are lucky - lead or bismuth were or are used as solder alloy component). Then there was a time, when the silicon in semiconductors was connected with Gold wires to the leads of the housing. To get this gold, you would have to dissolve the epoxy chip housing (and hope that there is Gold and not aluminium wires). At least when the chip has gold bonding, then it is pretty pure gold, so that&#39;s lucky.<br><br>The video was awesome by the way: As an electronics engineer, I am always interested how a chemist handles solid and liquid metals", "comment_date": "2016-07-20T19:09:55Z", "likes_count": 48}, {"comment_by": "Emir \u00d6zkan", "comment_text": "Can I make CPU like that?", "comment_date": "2016-07-20T19:07:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rhodanide", "comment_text": "IM ROD BRADBERRY <br><br>I&#39;m so sorry...", "comment_date": "2016-07-20T19:07:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Fer B.", "comment_text": "Maybe using coal inside a can may be helpful for melting the gold instead of useing a torch.", "comment_date": "2016-07-20T18:58:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nikola Tesla", "comment_text": "I really loved the miniature extraction.
