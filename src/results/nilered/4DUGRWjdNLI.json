They slip over the inner cone of the &quot;male&quot; end of the joint. If you use these, you can jam the joints together as tightly as you like, and they will not seize up. This also means that you don&#39;t have to use anything else to lubricate the joints. If you can&#39;t find the sleeves, then you can use ordinary plumbers PTFE tape instead, which you can just wrap around the &quot;male&quot; cone. Use at least two overlapping layers of tape - it&#39;s tedious to do and tends to disintegrate a bit when you twist the joints apart again, but you can always re-do it since the tape is cheap. Neither of these are of much use if you need to pull a high vacuum on the system, because the seal will not be 100% perfect. But for any other purpose, it&#39;s good enough.<br><br>Also, please for safety sake put some old rubber or plastic tube on the curved metal prongs of your clamps - bare metal clamped against glass is an uncomfortable sight. The large difference in thermal expansion between metal and glass means that either the clamp can come loose, or worse - it cracks the glass joint. Some tubing covering the prongs provides a cushioning effect and increases the friction between the clamp and the glass - so it won&#39;t crack the glass if it&#39;s a bit too tight, and won&#39;t slip out if it&#39;s a bit too loose.", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T04:31:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ejonesss", "comment_text": "can you lower the boiling point by pulling a vacuum?", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T22:06:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joy L", "comment_text": "So basically concentrated sulfuric acid is like Xenomorph blood?", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T09:45:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CopperVial", "comment_text": "I love that you made use of the already damaged flask.

So as the temperature of the sulphuric acid inside the receiver cools, new hot acid will be at a different temperature and so will still cause light distortions. Did you experience this problem?
