I wanna suggest way of making indigo carmine which needs much less cleanings. First step is just indigo and sulfuric acid reaction. After you need pour it in cold water with cracked ice, all heat of diluting sulfuric acid goes to ice melting and blend stays completely cold. Neutralize extra acid with sodium bicarbonate and add some sodium sulfate. Put it in fridge for a night and filter it with coffee filter. Final step is dissolving it in hot water ( you can do that with product on coffee filter, just take it off when all diluted, that makes lesser loss ). Add 1:1 or 1:2 isopropanol and put it in fridge. Filter it with coffee filter and wash with some extra isopropanol. And while it still pasty put in into a bowl to dry.

It neutralizes excess sulfuric acid to form BaSO4 (which can easily be filtered off) and converts your free acid into the clean Barium salt. The Barium salt can then be easily converted into the Sodium salt with Na2SO4, precipitating BaSO4 (another simple filtration step) and leaving you with pure Indigo Carmine.<br><br>As sulfuric acid should be neutralized first (because precipitation of BaSO4 shifts the equilibrium), it should even be possible to remove all excess H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2 and then convert the free acid into the Sodium salt with NaOH. In practice, this would mean you&#39;d have to know the amount of H2SO4 in solution (take the amount you started with minus two moles per mole of indigo used, assuming 100% conversion) or you&#39;d need an electrode to measure exactly when H2SO4 is fully neutralized. This is a bit more difficult, but saves the ion exchange step (though I would still prefer the first approach as it seems quite simple).<br><br>Disclaimer: I haven&#39;t actually tried this, it just seems like a much easier approach to me. The only thing that could go wrong here is that the Barium salt of Indigo Carmine might not be sufficiently soluble in water for the separation to work (The only way to know that would be to try, or calculating the solubility parameters). There&#39;s also the fair point that Ba(OH)2 is a lot more costly than NaCl, so this method is only applicable on a small scale.", "comment_date": "2018-04-22T21:38:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "funnyyylock", "comment_text": "Love your videos.
