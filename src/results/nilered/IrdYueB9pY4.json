Dont forget that despite the struggles in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can&#39;t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. <br><br>NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus. EVER. Regardless of what you&#39;ve done or what you&#39;re going through you CAN make it through Jesus. <br><br>If you have any questions let me know<br>Xx", "comment_date": "2021-12-26T00:10:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muhammad Kaif", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s appreciate him for showing some important stuff apart from all internet", "comment_date": "2021-12-25T12:51:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Len512", "comment_text": "So this is how it make 3d printer\ud83e\udd28", "comment_date": "2021-12-25T04:47:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RAE", "comment_text": "theres a reason that ive always liked chemistry", "comment_date": "2021-12-25T04:11:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MoroFullmetal", "comment_text": "Lesson in: <b>How To Grow Things Out of Thin Air</b>", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T19:06:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Jeon;)", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrdYueB9pY4&amp;t=6m13s\">6:13</a> yaaaaahhhhhh sevennyaaaaaaaa........", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T17:00:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u30b7\u03b7\u03b1\u03c9\u03b1\u0493", "comment_text": "It&#39;s Looks like had soul", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T15:21:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RilGames", "comment_text": "it looks like a banan", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T07:02:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baah.", "comment_text": "I dont know this but its interesting as f", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T05:12:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AAA CCC", "comment_text": "bootyhole you have to send a picture to you later on lol i is going in and the car lol i lol i\u2019m is just leaving work tomorrow lol i don\u2019t want you too late lol", "comment_date": "2021-12-24T00:20:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "King_hydra", "comment_text": "You should try tungsten, I doubt it would do anything because tungsten is so strong, but it\u2019s worth a try!", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T18:10:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "  \uff2d\uff2f\uff24", "comment_text": "&quot;Claim your \u201chere within an hour\u201d ticket right here.", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T13:13:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "  \uff2d\uff2f\uff24", "comment_text": "hii", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T13:13:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "That short guy :)", "comment_text": "A sponge 1.000.000.000 years ago lol", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T04:07:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "That short guy :)", "comment_text": "Just oxidize the Mercury for 12 minutes and remove the aluminums protective layer using 100\u00b0f for it to work", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T04:04:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Basanti Bhoi", "comment_text": "He will make u luv chemistry", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T03:48:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sensi Productionz", "comment_text": "Bravo!<br>My favorite channel", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T03:12:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HGMRICK", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve whatched all your videos still don&#39;t know wtf is going on here", "comment_date": "2021-12-22T18:34:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sky walker", "comment_text": "I&#39;m bald , wish I can put mercury on my head and grow some hair like this.

NASA, pentagon, the highest echelons of scientists and millionaire elites of the world that only represents if perhaps 1% of the world&#39;s population already know it but they will not show all the images of Voyager 1 and 2 to the rest of humanity as such as they have done with other transcendental news of the cosmos, such as the existence of alien life and superior to us, shamelessly manipulating that information and in order &quot;supposedly&quot; not to create world chaos but as always &quot;NASA, pentagon, scientific elites and elites millionaires of the world that only represents 1% of the world population &quot;treats 99% of humanity as if we were garbage or without importance that we do not deserve such spatial information of world interest. Likewise, I suggest that we force the great elites of scientists and millionaires, pentagon, and also NASA to tell us or keep us informed with the truth about the latest updated astronomy news, including the interaction for several years that human beings already have with beings. smart from other worlds and other galaxies. And also ask all those elites of scientists and millionaires what security or survival measures they are taking seriously in order to keep alive all human beings on other worlds in other galaxies that are not Andromeda or the Milky Way. This can be achieved by uniting protests worldwide to uncover the mysteries of Area 51 and supporting the collective Anonymous, self-styled &#39;hacktivists&#39;, or cyberactivists and also the information provided by Juli\u00e1n Assange who is a programmer, journalist and Internet activist . Since all of us who were born in this world are human beings and we have the same rights and duties to be informed and to remain alive, including our descendants, even if they are in other worlds of other galaxies that are not the Andromeda galaxy or the Milky Way. that cataclysmic events are approaching in them. Likewise, I inform you that the human being must stop being selfish, ill-intentioned, conceited, believing himself to be the only rational or intelligent being in the universe and neither should one think that some catastrophic asteroid or meteorite is going to destroy humanity or life on the land or part of it. That it was by chance that the asteroid that exploded in the Tunguska-Siberia-RUSSIA airspace on 06/30/1908; What if it really happened is that the 10,000-year-old Black Knight extraterrestrial artifact that orbits between the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired a beam of energy to prevent further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile approaches or orbit close to it. He also reported that it is false that the dinosaurs were extinguished by a huge meteorite or asteroid that collided with the earth and the oil came or is the product of that extinction. What DOES really happen is that the aliens were modifying the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs in order so that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem. And scientifically or technically, oil exists before the dinosaurs or since the planet earth was formed since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Oil in Rock or Crack and buried at high depths the oil is liquid or molten since the rock of oil crack due to high temperature and pressure under the earth or at the bottom of the sea this becomes liquid or molten also as is the case of iron at the level of the earth&#39;s surface or in mountains and away from the core of the earth it is in iron form solid instead in the center of the iron-nickel earth is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that are there creating the famous magnetic field that protects us from the gamma radiation and neutrons that come of space especially the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is a product of the extinction of the dinosaurs then I ask, is it perhaps that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or purebred dinosaurs lived only in the North Sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA?. In our universe there are asteroids, planets that contain iron, gold, liquid diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; also petroleum in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest reserves of oil in rock or crack are in the U.S.A and the technology to melt or exploit it was transferred or rented to the Republic of CHINA since they have huge amounts of crack or oil in rock; The reserves of petroleum in stone or crack of the U.S.A exceed the reserves of liquid petroleum that VENEZUELA and OPEC countries have. There will always be only wars: &quot;conventional as all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will later come to this in order either to unjustly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia and China since there is more old or elderly population alive than young people. AND THE OTHER REALITY OR TRUTH IS THE CATACLISMIC DAMAGE OF EVERYTHING REPORTED AT THE BEGINNING OR BEGINNING OF THIS INFORMATION WRITING AND REQUESTING THE GREAT POWERS OF USA, RUSSIA, CHINA, ISRAEL, ETC, ALSO TO THE GREAT ELITES OF MILLIONS, PENTAGON, ELITES.

The family&#39;s vehicle had flipped over.<br>As the young man came to after being knocked unconscious he heard crying and mumbling.<br>He couldn&#39;t stand because he\u00a0 was badly injured so he started crawling toward the sounds in the darkness.<br>As the sounds grew louder he noticed a bit of dim light coming from the other vehicle.<br>As he crawled through broken glass cutting his body and as shards pierced his hands he could now make out that he was on the passenger side of the vehicle.<br>The vehicle was upside down and the noises were coming from inside . Inside the vehicle were two small children and their parents. The father was pleading with him to help him and his family out of the car. He was able to help the man out of the vehicle and free the mother. The father was trying to get to the children from inside the vehicle but his injuries just wouldn&#39;t allow it. <br>The young man started crawling inside the car towards the children and noticed the dim light was actually a small flame towards the rear. The roof was crushed<br>in to the point he couldn&#39;t get all the way to the children. The parents were pleading with him to get their babies out of the vehicle. He sucked in his breath and managed to get to the children and unbuckled their car seats so he could free them. He passed each child through a small opening to the father. He tried sucking in his breath to free himself and go back the way he came in but realised he was stuck.<br>He cried out to the father but the father couldn&#39;t remove him. The flame grew larger and quickly engulfed the car with the young man inside. <br>The young man died in the very car they all were trapped in.<br>Thats similar to what JESUS CHRIST did for you and I.<br>HE saved us no matter the pain HE had to endure and even giving HIS last breath to get to us and dying in our place on that CROSS.<br>And not only did JESUS take our place in Hell HE arose and is alive today and offers us a place with HIM for all eternity in HEAVEN free for the taking.<br>Will you grab HIS hand today and get pulled from this dying and burning world ?<br>PLEASE turn to JESUS HE will save you from the wreckage on hwy 316.<br>John 3:16\u00a0 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T05:34:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ciantrex", "comment_text": "Welcome to another episode of: Where has quarantine brought me", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T03:44:39Z", "likes_count": 563}, {"comment_by": "Unibrow Gaming", "comment_text": "I learned that the acid was trying to warn us of the oversimplification on the discord logo <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrdYueB9pY4&amp;t=5m03s\">5:03</a>", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T03:24:17Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "gay_t1tties", "comment_text": "hey can i borrow that blade... he.. he..", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T02:14:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miniflint242", "comment_text": "Bro just get me as your student at this point", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T01:58:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cloudy _", "comment_text": "It looks like the aluminum is taking a shit lmao", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T01:24:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ying Jia Lim", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrdYueB9pY4&amp;t=6m15s\">6:15</a> looks like the last boss in a video game appearing", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T01:17:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sir Snailson", "comment_text": "me nodding my head like I totally know what he&#39;s saying \ud83d\ude36", "comment_date": "2021-05-30T00:38:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Auditor\u2667", "comment_text": "This is how mother Miranda became to big.

Dude literally says this in the video. It is very dangerous if it can enter your body. Vaccines enter your body if I&#39;m not mistaken. But while the amount of mercury may not be much considering that during the average adults life time they will be exposed to a certain amount of it in their environment anyways which amounts to more than is present in a vaccine anyways. But what mercury we get exposed to is happening over time and our bodies adapt to it slowly and it gets filtered out. An infant that has been here only a few days and is not always ready to process an immediate barrage of chemicals all at once. It matters not what an adults system gets exposed to over time in regards to what a newborn with a Virgin system  gets exposed to immediately in combination with the plethora of other chemicals that are given in addition to the vaccines containing mercury. All together all at once. Autism was never proven to not cause autism in any studies that weren&#39;t paid for by big pharma therefore cannot be counted as credible. There is a reason why the vaccines in question no longer contain the mercury. It wasn&#39;t removed because it was good for people. It caused problems. Autism being one of those problems and they had to pay put some cash because of that. Do your own research.

She died of mercury poisoning at the age of 48 due to accidental exposure to it. The protective gloves in use at the time of the incident provided insufficient protection, and exposure to only a few drops of the chemical absorbed through the gloves proved to be fatal after less than a year.<br><br>Wetterhahn would recall that she had spilled several drops of dimethylmercury from the tip of a pipette onto her latex-gloved hand. Not believing herself in any immediate danger, as she was taking all recommended precautions, she proceeded to clean up the area prior to removing her protective clothing. However, tests later revealed that dimethylmercury can, in fact, rapidly permeate different kinds of latex gloves and enter the skin within about 15 seconds.<br><br>That Incident should be more than enough proof that <b>mercury is not a toy</b> nor is it some High School chem class experiment or a fun at home project.", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T17:57:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marko Rakipi", "comment_text": "Can you cook some cocain for me plz \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T17:39:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zainab Abdelghaffar", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23savesheikhjarrah\">#SaveSheikhJarrah</a> .", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T16:58:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mc GetRekt", "comment_text": "Aluminium*", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T16:34:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Birb Sae", "comment_text": "hmmm mercury noodles", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T16:14:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PyroLegendz", "comment_text": "Aluminum string cheese", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T15:45:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Endlock Animation", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrdYueB9pY4&amp;t=6m13s\">6:13</a> ghost", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T14:40:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kl3ry", "comment_text": "why do I find this more interesting than school \ud83d\udc80", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T13:45:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Paulmark Santos", "comment_text": "I miss the thermometer with mercury some student play with it the next day no more school", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T13:09:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hubsenct", "comment_text": "you need to add sodium chloride", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T12:49:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pop Clutch Co.", "comment_text": "who else thought they had made a weave from scratch in the thumbnail", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T11:45:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DOWN BAD", "comment_text": "My potato brain-&quot;confused danga banga&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-05-13T10:38:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Adek", "comment_text": "Oh yeah I think I saw that on LockpickingLawyer, he used it to weaken a Lock so much that it almost broke apart in his hands.

It was coming into southern hemisphere winter and one morning I turned up to the undercover outdoor dining area to find a weird growth looking like a stereotypical palm tree from the tip of a tungsten scribe someone had left point up in a cup on the table. This tungsten tip scribe  was basically a pen shaped body of aluminium with a magnet and pocket clip on one end and a threaded collet style clamp end holding an aluminium rod with the tungsten scribe tip inset. Well  this structure that grew overnight caused a stir, photos were taken, the material was poked and prodded, it collapsed, regrew, wind made it collapse again, regrew over night again, finally stopped on third day. We collected all of the material that &quot;grew &quot; into a ziplock bag and noticed that a small amount of aluminium had been consumed from the replaceable scribe tip.

You be careful playing with that mercury. If it gets into your bloodstream it will enter your brain and between the synapses between neurons you will have little mirrors in your mind.

I only did this a few times as a kid for about 5 months off and on. But like the mercury I quickly found that while I thought I was in heaven and chewing a straw. The amalgamation was eating holes in my mind. I didn&#39;t know who I was or who my family was for a week afterwards I was really out of my mind. I also noticed a week later when I unpacked my clothes and had put a X pill into a piece of aluminum foil. The X pill had eaten it&#39;s way through the aluminum foil through amalgamation.

In Trump&#39;s America you go to prison for 10 years for killing a (Exodus20:4) statue, but for killing a Black person you go free.  This is the man who says, that he has done more for Blacks than any President.  That would imply that no President has done any thing, as justice should be the very lowest form of support, which Trump has brought zero justice for them.  America, please keep reading to see, what I am talking about!  This is what is happening in America?  It seams to be under attack by the Roman Catholic Church.  There was a man shot, who some say, that the man attacked Police, but I say where did you get your video of the Philadelphia shooting, because the one I seen, the guy never attacked the Police?  Two Police officers shot him from over 10 feet away.  He wasn&#39;t even facing their direction.  Is Trump who he claims to be?  Remember Herod, the Roman Governor of Judah at the time of Jesus.  He was restoring the Temple of his day, but when he heard of the Messiah&#39;s soon arrival, he had all the children in that area 2 years and under put to death.  The Roman Empire is a master at deception.  Please keep reading to learn more!  Antifa means anti Fascists.  The Fascists are those people like Hitler, and Mussolini, which directly killed 12,000,000 human beings and 60,000,000+ through their war.  Fascism is the joining of government with fake religion. Where they exterminate people.  Antifa opposes the extermination of people. Trump is an unbelievable tyrant.  We seen George Floyd get suffocated by 3 Police officers, Jacob Blake shot unarmed in the back, a Black woman shot through a window by Police while she was playing video games with her nephew, and many more killings by Police of unarmed people.  The person shot this time was 10 feet away from apparently full grown men with guns, so why could they not have subdued him with out killing him.  Why be so quick to shoot for one thing?  Why not use the baton to knock out the knife, if he had one. He was not charging at them.  They could have shot him in the shoulder.  This could be a Trump staged event, as he is a tyrant.  There is a fake video that shows him swiping at the Police, but what really happened was, when the Police fired all those bullets(5-8?)he dropped down to the ground.  This could be like the German kid(Kyle Rittenhouse)(</b><b><a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=rqSjCtOPY8I)\">YouTube.com/watch?v=rqSjCtOPY8I)</a></b><b> Trump sent in to kill in Kenosha, to cover up the killing of Jacob Blake, so that people will associate the violence to the wrong group.  Kyle was sent by the police to Kenosha to kill some one, so as to create a smoke scream for the killing of Jacob Blake.  The police throw the semi automatic rifle holding group some  bottles of water from a Police armored vehicle, including Kyle.  The Police thank them for coming.  Kyle doning his blue latex gloves(same gloves the Police use when they kill) kills a person, after the armed group tells people to quit filming.  Kyle runs from there after calling to say he killed.  He runs to the group of armored police vehicles two blocks away,  but not before killing an other man who tried to stop him because of the first killing, and shot a third person also, blowing half his bicep completely off.  Kyle walked right by the Police armored vehicles still carrying his semi automatic rifle and left the state, even though the police must have heard all the shots, and people yelling to them, this is the guy who shot all those people.  Police are not that stupid, evil but not stupid.  This was a staged event.  The blue latex gloves show the premeditation.  The armed group told people to turn of their cameras(this is on video).  This is the Pope waging war on you America.  This was to make you hate Antifa and BLM.  Some one from media should ask Trump, why Antifa has been labeled a terrorist organization!  Was it because they shot these three people.  It would have been.  The Pope has a Greek false prophetess falsly prophesying your destruction .  There is also a so called Christian prophet who prophesied (announced the planned pandemic) before it happened, also says that democrates will disappear after the election.  They are telling what they are doing, in advance.  The Roman empire still exists today.  It is controlled by a religious leader, the Pope.  He is the man sitting in the Temple(false temple), who is the King above the Kings of the earth of Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 of the Bible.  The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State.  That is the only place in the world with a King ruling over a city, and definitely the only one ruling over nation states.   He controls the Empire, including Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Britain, Turkey, and Italy, along with the territories they conquered.  There was 10 kings before and will or already is 10 kings again.  Although the prophecy of Revelation/Apocalypse17,18 belongs to the Papal false religious system that rides the Roman Empire, it tries to make America to think it is you.  Trump is working with Rome, to destroy it&#39;s enemies around the world.  Rome was responsible for the Nazi holocaust of world war two, by two Catholics Hitler and Mussolini.  Hitler used a fake typhus epidemic to round up people in to concentration camps, and extermination camps, but before that he smashed, burned, looted and destroyed businesses.  Today the same things are going on, accept it is a Corona virus, and it is different people&#39;s livelihoods that are being destroyed.  Alex Jones is an other participant.  He has already falsely called for on many many occasions, for the killing of people, and is a lap dog of Trump, where Trump can do any thing and get away with it.  So much for Alex being a champion of truth.  He had a reporter at the Kenosha protest, and knows what went down there with Kyle.  He is totally compromised.  Alex Jones now calling for the mass killing of Americans, and asking Trump to issue mass death warrants.  Alex Jones is complaining about Hollywood being full of pediphiles, when actually it is the Catholic Church, that is full of them.  Hollywood made a documentary on it, so that is why they are attacking Hollywood.  There was over 90 little boys molested by Catholic Priests, in (one) city alone.  This false Church/Empire are responsible for all slaughters on earth.  Revelation/Apocalypse18 near the end says, in her was found the blood of the prophets(John the Baptist beheaded by the Roman governor of Judea, Herod), Holy ones(all through history, including Jesus(crucified), and all those exterminated from the earth(Jews and others WW2, Rawanda, slaughter of the Americas, etc...).   Another extermination like during world war two is going on right now.  A false Christian prophet foretold the pandemic in advance, and the disappearing of the Democratic party, but now says, that plague is not the answer, but to start praying for famine, and here is the video (</b><b><a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=HIKOXyxlhag)\">youtube.com/watch?v=HIKOXyxlhag)</a></b><b>  Does this mean, because I exposed the fake pandemic, that now they are switching to famine as the attack.  Keep reading!  Over 2,000,000 acres of America has burned, cities have been wiped from existence.  America, you are in a war right now, and your current President has betrayed you.  Was &quot;Operation Dark Winter&quot; the training manual for this global war of the Church, on the truth.  &quot;Operation Dark Winter&quot; was a training scenario of an epidemic, and all the results of it.  The German Nazis would stick an automobile exhaust hose in your home&#39;s window, or pick people up for quarantine with a truck, which had the engine exhaust going in to the back, where the people were.  The Nazis also used Zychlon B gas(which I think was hydrogen sulfide pellets, which became an odorless gas, when exposed to air), which would suffocate people.  Today people are being radiated, with electromagnetic radiation.  It  can leave you short of breath, your stomach swells, and your brain swells and becomes sore and hot, and your muscles can twitch.  Look in to what a Faraday cage does, to get some relief.  There is a continuous hissing sound.  I noticed they start radiating about a half hour after your light and TV go off, so they have some way of determining that(coloberators?).  There is also a type of weapon that can make your heart palpate funny, like you are going to have a heart attack(an upside down pot over your heart can stop that).  Some people will have not even known this was happening while you sleep, but you would be getting run down and irritable.  The German Nazis would cremate the bodies, which I know is going on in NewYork state, and Italy at least.  The Bible mentions that Jesus&#39;s(Yeshua&#39;s) followers sold all their possessions, and had all things in common.  This is a form of communism.  The false church hates it and wages war against it, and that is why Trump is trying to start a war against Russia and China.  People of earth must resist tyranny where ever it appears.  There is a self described Christian leader Kevin Zadai, who says, that Christians are very powerful, and he invites his (</b><b><a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=puiMoHT5Vt8)\">YouTube.com/watch?v=puiMoHT5Vt8)</a></b><b> followers to join him and Trump, as they do a historic cleansing.  Is this guy openly talking about a holocaust like extermination?   The police took part in rounding people up for Hitler, and they can be seen as not very people friendly.(they get paid by the state)  It is not just Blacks being killed, but Whites and minorities as well.  Watch the video on YouTube, &quot;Will Trump Bring About Genocide And World War&quot; parts 1 and 2  Trump doesn&#39;t want to leave, because he knows that he will be tried as a war criminal.  I pray that America will not be a coward like Germany was, as no coward will inherit God&#39;s Kingdom.  America, you are fighting for your life, world, I should say.  *****Locked down for a virus, that has to be tested for because you can&#39;t tell if some one is infected, and the recovery rate is over 99%.

And after the 2nd. World War Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born in the 20th century he was a child or poor infant and as an adult he is a social resentful since until the year 2036 he is the dictator of Russia and \u201cantichrist= Criminal-Mentally Ill\u201d of the 21st century and is the most billionaire man of this world, with the power of destruction of the nuclear button and creating anarchy, chaos, pandemics, violence or currently protests of racism among others. I am not a religious fanatic; But to prevent him from submitting to humanity, we must apply the corrective of ending once and for all with the secrecy of all anonymous bank accounts or without personal data of their owners that they do have active in the banks of SWITZERLAND, Island Cayman, VATICAN bank that can be immediately verified by any world security or police agency, call INTERPOL, DEA, SCOTLAND YARD, HaMishtara HaTzvait- ISRAEL among others, since they are breeding grounds for demon allies or helpers of the antichrist of the century 21 and these helper demons are: \u201cterrorist FARC, ELN, ISIS, jihadists, murderous dictator of Nicaragua, communist-Argentine POPE of the Catholic Church Francisco, WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Chinese empire, Turkish empire, Iran empire, Cuba, dictator of North Korea, of the narco-terrorist dictator of VENEZUELA failed \u201d. In the specific case of the narco-terrorist demon dictator of VENEZUELA Nicolas Maduro Moros who has ill-gotten 5,000,000,000 dollars deposited in the Vatican bank not including the ill-gotten billions of dollars that they constantly deposit in his anonymous Swiss bank accounts and through millionaire economic resources that it exploits and extracts from Venezuela such as: &quot;Gold, diamonds, thorium, coltan, oil, uranium, aluminum, iron, etc&quot; a small part is sold to the previously named helper demons of the 21st century antichrist but really Most of those riches are sold primarily NOT to Russia but directly to the current 21st century antichrist and owner of the Russian state oil company Rosneft. And the antichrist of the 21st century and all his &quot;helper demons including Nicolas Maduro Moros- Venezuela&quot; have these anonymous bank accounts active and use them to harm or subdue the inhabitants of a specific country or in a general way to harm or submit to the humanity. In the world there were two (2) great events and there will be a third event, and these are: The 1st. Event: It was the birth of the human being called a caveman or caveman. The 2nd. Event: It was the disclosure as a state secret of the INTERNET since it is currently NOT only for military use but for the public domain, since the technical or scientific information between the sky, the earth and the bottom of the ocean with the INTERNET is nothing hidden . And the 3rd. Event is the disclosure to humanity that will be announced no later than or MAXIMUM in the year 2035 that we are not alone in this world and we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe; since there are aliens that live with us. Since the missing link of our ancestors between the clumsy and slow cavemen and the current hybrid or modern human being are the aliens. There will always be only wars: &quot;conventional as all those that occurred after August 6, 1945, also trade wars (such as the current USA-CHINA; among others)&quot;, there will also be unjust pandemics such as the current COVID-19 and other pandemics or viruses that will later come to this in order either to unjustly purify humanity of children and sick people and of the elderly or elderly population that are not productive and that represents a huge social expense of retirement or cure payments especially for the government of Russia since there is more old or elderly population living there than young population and also due to mishandling of batteries as the capitalist communist republic of CHINA did. Now, the current human being is a hybrid since aliens modified their DNA just 10,000 years ago. Hence, my theory comes that the current nuclear age that began on August 6, 1945 was the AWAKENING of the hybrid or modern human being, and since that date there have been more than 15 attempts at self-destruction wanting to unleash the 3rd. War or nuclear hecatomb but the aliens prevented it since the only and total losers would be: &quot;The whole of humanity, animal and plant life, and the aliens that live with us&quot; and that is why we must end several myths that seem Childish or stupid to think or continue to believe in them, and these are: 1) That the human being was created in the image and likeness of God since our DNA for about 10,000 years was modified by aliens, 2) That the dinosaurs They were extinguished by a huge meteorite or asteroid that hit the earth and the oil came or is the product of that extinction. What DOES really happen is that the aliens were modifying the DNA millions of years ago to each animal of each species of dinosaurs so that they could evolve with the human being in the current ecosystem. And scientifically or technically oil exists before the dinosaurs or since the planet earth was formed since at the level of the earth&#39;s surface it is called Oil in Rock or Crack and buried at high depths the oil is liquid or molten since the rock Oil crack due to the high temperature and pressure under the earth or at the bottom of the sea this becomes liquid or molten also as is the case of iron at the level of the earth&#39;s surface or in mountains and far from the core of the earth is in solid form iron, on the other hand, in the center of the iron-nickel earth is super liquid or molten and not solid due to the high temperatures and pressure that exist there creating the famous magnetic field that protects us from the gamma radiation and neutrons that come of space especially the sun. If we continue to believe that oil is the product of the extinction of the dinosaurs, then I ask, is it that all dinosaurs lived in Venezuela, Saudi Arabia and some OPEC countries, and the most exquisite or purebred dinosaurs lived perhaps only in the North Sea since the oil there is purer than the rest of the members of OPEC and VENEZUELA ? In our universe there are asteroids that contain iron, gold, diamonds, coltan, thorium, uranium, lead, bacteria; also petroleum in the form of rock or crack bound with other minerals such as calcium, lead, etc. Currently the largest oil reserves in rock or crack are held by the USA, whose technology to melt or exploit it was transferred or rented to the Republic of China since they have huge amounts of crack or oil in rock and this oil reserves in rock or crack of the USA surpass the liquid oil reserves that VENEZUELA and OPEC countries have. 3) That there is fresh water on the earth&#39;s surface and in no other part of this world and universe. Since there are huge reservoirs of fresh water below the earth&#39;s surface, as in several comets, planets and asteroids they are sources of frozen fresh water supply. 4) That man did not go, did not step on, or did not reach the moon, since on 07/15/1969 he did arrive and colonize the moon and at the end of the 1970s he arrived and colonized the planet Mars and currently dominates the anti gravity technology see plane TR-3 Black blanket. 5) By mistake of the impact of a missile, it exploded on 03/08/2014 to MALAYSIA Airlines flight 370 MH370 / MAS370. Since all its passengers were pure international scientists who were going to give a conference and news about the vaccine and cure of some cancer and AIDS &quot;as I affirm or confess on 06/16/2020 Donald John Trump President of the USA&quot; and also They were going to warn of the possible pandemic such as the covid-19. 6) That it was by chance that the asteroid that exploded in the airspace of Tunguska-Siberia-RUSSIA on 06/30/1908; What if it really happened is that the 10,000-year-old black knight extraterrestrial artifact that orbits between the earth and the international space station &quot;ISS&quot; fired a beam of energy to prevent further damage to planet earth, I don&#39;t know if you have noticed that no satellite, old space stations: &quot;Skylab-USA, MIR-RUSA&quot;, shuttle or private space rockets or missile approaches or orbit close to it. There is a trace recently discovered that in our ancestor with more than 5,000 years old before the Christian era in our world there were detonations of nuclear weapons products of advanced technologies of wars between extraterrestrials. Everything that happens in this world is for a cause-effect either for &quot;Human evolution, slavery, self-destruction&quot; and NOT by mere chance. And all the uncertainties, myths or legends: Who and why John Fitzgerald Kennedy was assassinated; how long did Adolf Hitler live and where did he die, The universe is limited in time and size, including those related to the Blessed Jesus of Nazareth from the time he was conceived in the womb of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Nazareth until his resuscitation will be answered or revealed with more precision by the extraterrestrials by being witnesses or direct participants from millions of years ago from the evolutionary facts of planet earth. It seems primitive or childish to me that in the middle of the 21st century in my beloved and beautiful Jerusalem-Israel, its pilgrims go to the wailing wall to insert or send written pieces of paper or hit their heads against the wall or speak to the wall and believing that God or the wall : &quot;He will answer: either in writing on the same or another paper, or spoken or by telepathy&quot;.

You clearly state that there is an oxide protective layer on the aluminum. When you added the Mercury nothing happened so you tried scratching the surface and then drilling. Still nothing. This is where your explanation doesn&#39;t fit. The oxide layer is just a thin applique, so when you drilled the crater, obviously that should have been enough to remove the oxide layer; think about it you drilled way enough of the aluminum which would have removed the oxide layer, but it didn&#39;t work still. The only times it worked, you cleaned it with hydrochloric (extremely caustic) acid and just did a perfunctory wipe. There would be trace acid on the surface still. I think that&#39;s what started the process, it makes sense; and I do seem to recall that there is a chemical component (hydrochloric acid in this experiment) within the amalgamation process. The aluminum would react immediately to the trace/residue acid, even though you wiped it, the acid had already etched micro fissures which still contained trace acid, the acid is still active because it had not been chemically neutralized. It&#39;s the only explanation that works.

This is a very interesting experiment. But, you need to be extremely cautious doing chemistry with Hg.

When i was a kid they had these hand warmers. After they were used, you would boil them down until the clouded hard paste substance  turned back to a clear gel. What i always found fascinating was that the thing that started this chemical reaction to make it produce heat was a flat metal slightly concave disk that when bent and then made a pop or snapped would cause the reaction to start. At the disk the clear liquid would turn into a white silicone putty and expand out until it filled the entire bag. IT would stay hot for awhile. After that you could put it into a boiling pot and wait until all the white putty was gone.  it could then cool off for days or weeks and as soon as that metal disk snapped the stuff inside would crystallize and put off heat for a time. The metal disk had a very porous surface and im assuming that is what started the reaction again. I posed this question to my college chem teacher and he acted like i was crazy. I came across this type of hand warmer twice in my youth. The second time there were like 50 of them and most of them the disk had been bent too hard or were defective and if it coudnt&#39; make that snap or pop felling it wouldn&#39;t work. Also if you didn&#39;t let it boil long enough when you took it out of the pot it would just re-crystallize again. Anyway your problem of the aluminium oxidizing before you could make enough surface aera for the mercury to react is what made me think of that.

The crazy part is that the aluminum is a solid yet the Mercury penetrates it anyways. There&#39;s not alot about the mechanism that is known, but what we do know is that the Mercury actually slips in between the grain boundaries of the aluminum and spreads. That&#39;s why the base of the amalgum tower expands instead of staying local to the Mercury pellet area. The aluminum won&#39;t react with the air to form the amalgum tower inside of itself where there is no oxygen, but the Mercury is still there between the crystal grains. This causes a mechanical phenomenon called &quot;liquid metal embrittlement&quot; which extends as far throughout the aluminum as the Mercury has invaded. Embrittled aluminum from this mechanism is much weaker than before, which is the real reason Mercury is not allowed on planes. It can cause widespread weakening of mechanical components from a very small mercuric intrusion.<br><br>Recently, we in the aerospace field have discovered another metal on metal embrittlement phenomenon that is even more shrouded in mystery than Mercury on aluminum. Frequently aircraft use steel fasteners which are plated in Cadmium to form a sacrificial anode for galvanic corrosion to protect aluminum pieces that are bolted together. Aircraft also use Titanium, however, and Cadmium plated fasteners cause this exact same embrittling mechanical phenomenon to the titanium as Mercury does with aluminum. It&#39;s called &quot;Solid metal embrittlement&quot; and it doesn&#39;t result in titanium oxide towers growing like Mercury does with aluminum, but the Cadmium does invade the titanium crystal grains and drastically reduce the strength of the Titanium.

Isnt this what the drug chemist wants... yeah something like this since it would still retain its most reactive properties... i think that most chemistry using mercury aluminum amalgam simply uses strips of aluminum that have been treated with mercury salts dissolved in inert solvent then the strips are added to the reaction vessel along with all of the other chemicals and solvents before the strips have time to react with oxygen... definitely not sure how it would work because how would you know how much mercury got dissolved into the aluminum? ok i think im understanding this a bit more... so if the reaction was not taking place in a solvent that would dissolve the mercury or convert it into a salt then the aluminum strips would continue to deteriorate within the reaction mixture similarly to the way that it deteriorates under an oxygen atmosphere. so basically the aluminum amalgam is good for reactions where an oxygen molecule is to be removed... or something like that i still am not sure but this video really helped me understand chemistry more thank you.", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T08:52:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "romy jimmy", "comment_text": "lovechem...", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T08:51:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "152drake164", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrdYueB9pY4&amp;t=6m14s\">6:14</a>  Sadako rising :D", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T08:51:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xD", "comment_text": "Pls no more arrows", "comment_date": "2017-08-14T08:48:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Risto Paasivirta", "comment_text": "I really like these sort of reactions, they look so ethereal and eldritch.
