It was first used in the 19th century when uric acid was discovered as the causative agent in gout. People jumped on the uric acid bandwagon and started thinking it was the cause of many other disorders, including bipolar disorder. They knew back then lithium dissolved uric acid, so they used it to treat bipolar disorder. They stopped when the gout fad faded, and because of toxicity. Lithium chloride was then used as a salt replacement in the 1920s when scientists discovered the role of sodium in causing hypertension. People realized the calming effects then, too, and it got to the point it was included in the original 7-Up recipe. This caused a lot of overdoses, which is what lead to it being banned. It was used as a treatment for bipolar disorder following Cade&#39;s experiments in the 1950s onwards but didn&#39;t become commonplace until the 1970s when adequate blood testing became available. Lithium is unique among the medications for mental illness in that it is not only the first true effective psychiatric medication, it was actually discovered three times.", "comment_date": "2022-05-14T00:08:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gracie Trethewey", "comment_text": "you explained bipolar disorder better than my psychiatrist", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T03:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Garbe", "comment_text": "turning batteries into medicine sounds like turning shit into gold.", "comment_date": "2022-05-03T11:18:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grumpy Cat", "comment_text": "Well, I tried one, and I think my kidney is failing.

A signal representing the ongoing electroencephalographic (EEG) signal of a brain preferably is obtained from the electrode location on the scalp known as CZ or P3 in clinical notation. A signal processor converts the ongoing EEG into electrical signals which are converted into music by synthesizers. The music is acoustically fed back to the brain after a time delay calculated to shift the phase of the feedback in order to reinforce specific or desired ongoing EEG activity from the scalp position of interest. The music is comprised of at least one voice that follows the moment-by-moment contour of the EEG in real time to reinforce the desired EEG activity. The music drives the brain into resonance with the music to provide a closed loop or physiological feedback effect. Preferably, the musical feedback comprises additional voices that embody psychoacoustic principles as well as provide the content and direction normally supplied by the therapist in conventional biofeedback. The invention contemplates numerous applications for the results obtained.

Types 1 and 2 are of equal severity, but in different ways. Type 1 - what I have- is where a person experiences extended periods of mania and depression. Type 2, however, is where a person experiences even longer periods of depression with periods of brief relief with hypomania. Cyclothymia, however, is much less severe, as the cycles don&#39;t go all the way down into depression, and the hypomania doesn&#39;t last for more than a day or two, and it is usually treated with anti-convulsants instead of lithium salts.

Absolutely not true! When it comes to bipolar disorder, lithium is gold. It can treat <i>all</i> phases of bipolar disorder, and prevent or slow down the cycling between phases; no other medication can do that, or is nearly as effective. As well, lithium is one of the few medications in modern psychopharmacology that can reduce obsessive thoughts about suicides, as well as reduce deaths from suicide. <br><br>The downside is that it requires close monitoring, both in terms of watching for symptomatic side-effects, as well as watching for blood levels, white blood cell counts, and kidney function tests. However, I humbly submit that any competent psychiatrist should be able to use this drug safely, and with confidence. It&#39;s almost as old as dirt, so there won&#39;t be many surprises. We&#39;re very familiar with its side-effects, and know very well how to prevent or manage them.<br><br>The only advantage of the newer drugs is that they&#39;re more &quot;user friendly.&quot; The blood levels don&#39;t fluctuate as much, and in many cases, they don&#39;t require monitoring of blood levels at all. There&#39;s room for debate whether they have fewer or less severe side-effects. <i>I</i> believe it&#39;s a toss-up there.

I feel I am maybe closer to the type 2 I have been medically diagnosed, but never told there were more then one type. I definitely don&#39;t have 5-7 day episodes but my brain loves depression. I usually get so down that I feel worth less then dirt and that I can&#39;t even get out of bed most of the time when it comes over me. Then like nothing ever happened I randomly for no reason feel better, usually all within about an hour or two. <br><br>I also will say I don&#39;t take normal medication. Most of the medication I have been put on have made me feel worse or just not myself and more like a zombie. I at this point found the only thing that lets me feel like myself without feeling like someone else or worse are certain marijuana strains. I obviously don&#39;t suggest everyone with bipolar disorder to go start using marijuana, and it is important to note I also have Asperger&#39;s and adhd. (Though some doctors say it is just my bipolar disorder appearing as if I have adhd.) I figure those things also impact what my brain goes through regularly. I also feel this is why most traditional medication doesn&#39;t work and why marijuana seems to be more effective. <br><br>I definitely will also say to those who don&#39;t think this is true, I can say from experience there are withdraw symptoms and it is addictive. I generally feel irritable, down and a strong want for it for about 2 to 3 days after prolonged use. Lately I have been trying to moderate myself and only vape (Your lungs will thank you.) when I feel I am having an episode. I still probably vape more then I should, but it does help and I don&#39;t know if I will find anything else that works this good for me. I will say though you must talk to your doctor first, and make sure it is a viable option before you just go out and start buying it. I don&#39;t want to mislead anyone nor do I want to cause issue.

As person who suffers from bipolar 1 disorder, I was at my wits end, having gone through so many different types of medications to help with it. It wasn&#39;t until I realized that SSRI&#39;s actually made things either worse or unbearable, that I stuck with an atypical antidepressant which barely scratched the surface. At one point, I had a doctor that ordered an anticonvulsant, carbamazapine for me; being that I had briefly taken it before and it significantly helped with the mood changes; only to have him call me before I got home from that appointment telling me that it was contraindicated with my heart condition. He tried me on a drug that was new and I couldn&#39;t afford and really didn&#39;t help much. I finally ended up having such a bad manic episode that I came home from work and literally crept to the window with every sound, convinced that my coworkers had sent men in white coats to come and take me away. (This is particularly unusual as I am a nurse and know very well that the system does not work that way.) I went to my doctor in desperation and begged him to try me on one of the only two other meds I had not tried before. I chose Lithium and he said the only way he could do it responsibly, given my agitated state, was to have me placed for observation in a psych ward while I was started on it. Again, out of desperation, I agreed. I have never been better since. Lithium really is a miracle treatment for bipolar disorder and even my doctor said that the reason it is so rarely prescribed is due to the its unpatentablity that doctors don&#39;t get kick backs from the drug companies for prescribing it. I have also seen in my career many people who do very well without it but on newer meds and with some investigation, it turns out that they perhaps only have a mild form of bipolar disorder, if at all. While many who really do have the tried and true symptoms, still struggle very much without Lithium while those who do take it do very well. In my experience, only about 5-10% of those with true bipolar disorder are on this medication. There has also been research done on people in towns whose water supply comes from aquifers that have higher than normal trace amounts of Lithium and they are among the most peaceful and happy folks around. <br><br>The major two dangers of consuming Lithium is toxicity if regular blood levels are not being checked, and the fact that if you do not keep hydrated enough (it has a tendency to make you more prone to dehydration) then the levels in your blood can rise, causing toxicity. This is why it is dangerous to consume alcohol regularly while taking it and why people who work in extremely hot conditions where it is difficult to stay hydrated (like my mom who used to work out in the fields) should avoid it. Among the first side effects of toxicity is tremors. I found that the co-prescribed medication to help the tremors was worse than the tremors themselves, and if I get them, I just hydrate myself better and they go away. <br><br>Oddly enough, &quot;Lithium water&quot; is a real thing you can buy at health food stores without a prescription. I know one lady who completely controls her bipolar disorder with it alone. But again, not being under the supervision of a doctor who can regularly test blood levels, this is potentially dangerous as well.<br><br>BUT...
