I may be wrong but I suspect the blue color of the surface oxide that forms on it is due to the specific thickness that the first order oxide layer as it stabilizes, and that causes some interference effect with light at that wavelength (sort of like the effect of opal and labradorite). <br>From what I remember in my research in to  chromic anodizing, the thickness of the oxide layer is what corresponds with a wavelength of light that will be reflected instead of absorbed the most when going through it and that becomes the &quot;color&quot; you see.  When you anodize aluminum , titanium or rhodium, you can vary the voltage and electrolytes used to achieve a certain &quot;color&quot; effect on the surface of the metal that in itself is not a dye or tint but yet produces an almost eerie effect of only allowing a specific narrow band of light to escape from it&#39;s surface. So by controlling the exact thickness of the oxide layer to reflect or maybe &quot;re-emit&quot; light of that wavelength you achieve an array of surface color effects.<br>The principal is that the potential for oxygen bonds is initially going to be high on a conductive metal surface when no oxide layer yet exists, as seen by the rapid formation of the oxide layer when the potassium was exposed to air, but as that layer of much less electrically conductive oxide thickens, it will quickly reach a point where the potential energy to overcome the oxide layer exceeds the input energy and it stabilizes there.

(Lewis acids and/or stuff by Mikhail Usanovich might be interesting/pertinent to what you&#39;re doing here.)<br><br>Alcohols can be de-protonated, but steric bulk can slow or moderate their ability to donate protons to a reaction. Isopropyl groups ( which are a type of tertiary alcohol) and secondary alcohols react more slowly than primary alcohols  (ethanol/methanol/phenol)because the carbon/hydrogen bulk gets in the way of their reactivity and spreads out the electron charge (notice: not electric charge). That is to say, steric properties of the molecule interfere with the bulk kinetic reaction rate and local ion effects. <br><br>This is kind of the next part of that... the gel you were seeing was a condensation product, probably caused by the isopropanol losing it&#39;s hydroxyl group and then reacting with the mildly acidic vinyl hydrogens of the toluene to form a hemiacetal. The hemiacetal would go on to further react and condense more toluene, but, especially if the potassium oxides (as a collection of related oxides not a specific oxide species)was oxidizing things, rather than directly donating electrons to the process, it could react further to make a large polymer. <br><br>Lastly, since i mentioned steric effects vs kinetic effects, the potassium ion is said to be more basic than sodium, which is a stronger base than lithium. This is because the size of the atom is physically larger in that mentioned trend. This increase in size makes it more &#39;chargable&#39; for lack of a way of describing it. This polarizability makes it slower to move away from a molecule which has an opposite charge. <br>This is interesting because the blue color you noted in the video matches very closely to the blue color of the sodium azide you made in another video, varying only in the concentration with which it occurs. The blue color of new sodium azide, in general, is noted as being the color of free solvated electrons from a theoretical level of quantum mechanics (the point where physics and chemistry are interchangeable.).
