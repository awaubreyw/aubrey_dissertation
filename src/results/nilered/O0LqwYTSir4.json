I deleted a lot of my videos when I was intensely depressed for an unrelated reason, wish I still had them backed up. I used to be utterly obsessed with chemistry, but it became too painful to indulge the hobby and watch chemistry videos so I stopped for a while. Now it really saddens/worries me that my knowledge of chemistry has gotten rusty because I haven&#39;t been able to practice it for so long. I&#39;m just catching back up with the chemistry YouTube scene and I&#39;m happy to see how much it has grown and improved. Its also sad to see other great channels get abandoned such as myst32yt, alchemical garden, and so many others I can&#39;t recall right now. I&#39;m struggling in college too because of my ADHD and it may be many many years before I have a place to do chemistry again. I feel lost. I almost want to quit everything and follow my passion and start making chemistry youtube videos fulltime again, but I doubt that would be sustainable and I&#39;m concerned that I wouldn&#39;t have anything unique to offer to the YT community that your channel and many other excellent, popular, Youtube channels aren&#39;t already covering.
