Then put a fitting on each end on the side of the sewer pipe and make it so you can pump cold or ice water through the pipe to cool the alcohol so it can be reused (if you use the still for extraction.).

I\u2019m pretty sure the source of the lead hits they were getting was from lead in the copper plumbing solder. I think public water sources like municipal water supplies were able to control the level of copper contaminants by controlling the pH of their water.
