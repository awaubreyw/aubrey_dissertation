This pattern of tiny circles is why they never come out smooth and why the cracking looks the way it does and is unpredictable....Capillary action via many various sources of internal pressure pulling inward thereby pulling the whole thing into multiple pieces.<br>When looking\u201csideways\u201d through the grain of the pieces cut with the grain you are looking through the thinnest part of each individual grain; a series of hollow cylinders stacked on top of each other, rather than than trying to look through a densely packed pattern via the densest perspective of its cross-section. I promise It would result in a much smoother finish than the cross cut sections as it wouldn\u2019t present the sand-like grain pattern created by a bunch of tightly packed circles, but the \u201csides\u201d of a mere fraction of the number of grains, which actually have strength of uniformity not provided by the easily crumbled cross-cut pieces, aligned in a way that they present longest and smoothest part of themselves . <br>I know it\u2019s much harder to penetrate the center of those pieces as the distance is so much further, but I see the benefits in cracking that code will be exponential", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T20:33:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sam Simington", "comment_text": "So THAT&#39;S why firewood looks weird in its charcoal state.

Wood always warps like that when it dries. It&#39;s called &quot;cupping&quot;. You need to figure a way to clamp it while it&#39;s under vacuum pressure.<br>I think if you look into how people stabilize birch plywood for making knife scales and the like that you may be able to borrow some ideas and techniques from it.", "comment_date": "2020-11-27T21:37:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bunnie", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1H-323d838&amp;t=7m14s\">7:14</a><br><br>&quot;*Source: Wikipedia*&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-11-27T14:50:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nerdystick_boy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1H-323d838&amp;t=6m11s\">6:11</a> W o o d  B e e r", "comment_date": "2020-11-27T02:18:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maxwell Edison", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1H-323d838&amp;t=33m43s\">33:43</a> transparent wood over the word wood in the text", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T19:48:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dmitrmax", "comment_text": "Dry the wood with the same technique which is used in aerogel, i.e. supercritical fluid ) Would you get aerowood? )))", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T10:00:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ilana torres", "comment_text": "\u00a8in any case\u00a8", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T04:17:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Justin Morris", "comment_text": "Lignin deez nuts lmao", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T03:27:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devils Slayer Trance", "comment_text": "Please research for transparent aluminum.

You can test to see if there is any remaining in the wood by taking a thin slice and treating it with a drop or two of phloroglucinol which stains lignin bright red.. I doubt you really need to go to such lengths but some woods do contain quite a lot of lignin in secondary thickened areas. The lignin thickening is a major source of the tensile properties of wood so of course as a composite it might lose some of that. Some difficult to work burl woods are treated with resin impregnation to render them stronger and more easily worked on a lathe.<br><br>If you just want transparent wood rather than a composite (which is obviously much stronger) its just a matter of gradually removing the sodium salts in water then removing water gradually through first increasing concentrations of say Isopropanol in water and then from pure isopropanol through increasing concentrations of xylene in isopropanol.or use any other solvent with a refractive index as close to that of air as possible. That way you can obtain something with the minimum translucency and maximum transparency.  It will never be completely transparent because of light scattering by the cellulose fibers.<br><br>A similar technique is used in microscopy", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T16:29:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrMrannoying", "comment_text": "You know... why would we need transparent wood covered in epoxy?

You might even layer two masking tapes for a more sturdy surface.<br><br>Turning on the SAW and raising it, you will naturally cut EXACTLY the &quot;Kerf&quot; of your blade (Kerf: df. the Width of the cut, REGARDLESS of what style teeth your saw has.<br><br>NEXT.<br><br>Return to using your fence, WITH AN ADDITIONAL BOARD, clamped (or better double sided tape it to the fence. This Board PROVIDES a free falling away from the blade, so your wood will not have &quot;Burn Marks&quot; on it.  The End of the Board on your fence, should be where the saw blade begins the cut.<br><br>Finally, Always use a &quot;PUSH Stick&quot; Say a 2X4 about 20 inches long, and push your BASS WOOD through the saw blade As Well as the Push Stick. KEEP YOUR FINGERS SAFE!<br><br>Now, about me, a bit: I have worked both Hard Wood &amp; Soft woods for Sixty Years.<br><br>After I retired I started doing things like MAKING wood Book Markers, about .035 to .040 Inches thick. I really know how to cut such thin pieces, and I used some very exotic woods.<br><br>the First thing I did AFTER CUTTING THEM, was almost flood them with thin viscosity Super glue, to get into those fibers! I would then use double sided tape and stick them to extruded Aluminum that was very flat, and start my sanding.<br><br>I would reapply that super glue, as needed, and sand to 1200 Grit!. I soaked off the double sided tape with Alcohol, applied it to the SANDED SIDE and sand the other side until 1200 grit!<br><br>These book marks were TRANSLUCENT, and held to a good white light, you would see everything your Chemical baths removed, Some Birds Eye Maple pieces looked like Butterfly Wings !!!<br><br>Keep on doing your experiments, MINE started in 1957, building my first Radio!

Sure a small piece of metal would be in the final product, looking kind of like frame to the wood, but it may be able to be removed after the curing, and the added bobby pins would weigh the wood down so it wouldn&#39;t float, but also keep it slightly raised enough so the wood would always be surrounded by resin, creating a smooth finish,  while also staying completely straight.

I think the best solution here is to skip the epoxy and use the cactus juice they use for stabilizing wood. then you can vacuum draw the fluid into the wood indefinitely. As an alternative, degas the resin parts a and b separately along with the wood all separate to remove atmospheric gas dissolved in the fluid at atmospheric pressure. The wood will just fill back up but perhaps not as densely. Then, mix your resin in a vacuum chamber and add the wood. no air = no bubbles so there is much less to vacuum off. Then as a final step, cure the resin in a pressure pot.

Your video is really nice ! <br>I think I have an idea of why the wood isn&#39;t transparent at the end... Understand that I&#39;m an engineer in mechanics, so, I&#39;m not really in my domain here :-p<br>What I think is that when you cut your wood, you should polish it to have a very nice finish. <br>In fact, when cutting, I&#39;m pretty sure you crush the micro tubes making the structure of the wood. By doing so, you prevent the epoxy to get inside the wood.<br>I would recommend to cut your wood at 4 - 5 mm thickness, then polishing it perfectly. <br>To do so, glue your sand paper on a flat surface, and work the wood on it at hand.<br>Start with sand paper with a grain of 100, and ALWAYS polish it in the same direction (right to left for instance).<br>Then, with sandpaper with a grain of 200, polish it, but with a 90\u00b0 angle until the marks of the first polishing disappear (turn it or go &quot;up-down&quot;).<br>Turn it back of 90\u00b0, then polish it, always the same direction, with sand paper of grain 400 until the previous marks disappear<br>Repeat, turn 90\u00b0, then sand paper 800<br>Again with 1000 or so then 2000.<br>In the end, you can start to polish by doing circles with a piece of fabric and tooth paste (it&#39;s a very small polishing paste in fact ;) )<br>This is the method used to renew old transparent plastic sheets, like cars lights cases and have it perfectly transparent.

Also after treating the wood would heating it slowly in an oven for while perhaps remove water and open the pores a bit? Then perhaps degas it a bit in the vacuum chamber before applying the epoxy. Also could a process of alternating repeatedly between high vacuum and high pressure perhaps be helpful? My thinking is that hitting it with higher pressure shortly after degassing it with vacuum might help push the epoxy into the wood. Would methanol be slightly better than ethanol? Would agitation, perhaps by having the entire vacuum chamber/pressure pot sitting on top of some kind of vibrating platform possibly help? Also I think looking for the lowest viscosity and longest pot life epoxy might be worthwhile, through it seemed the one you were using may have already have such properties. Perhaps talking to an epoxy manufacturer could get some tips on finding an optimum formula resin. Also, I think there might a temperature sweet spot for soaking the wood in the resin. Higher temps will obviously lower the viscosity. and might open the pores of the wood a bit due to expansion. However, higher temps will also shorten the pot life and speed the setup up of the resin. As such there might be some sweet spot temp to balance those factors against each other.

Not always possible, but Youtubers should hew as close to this standard as they can. Overall excellent and fascinating video that transmits both knowledge and technique. I once used alternating positive and negative pressure to impregnate plywood with a resin. The plywood was porous and finely laminated enough that permeation was good even without denaturing the wood beforehand. I wasn&#39;t after transparency, but strength, which was imparted by my resin curing method and did wind up with a super strong material that could withstand any mechanical abuse I subjected it to with no specialized testing equipment. I am sure that with digital tech, modern fabrication techniques and polymer science, wood can become the dominant construction and fabrication material once again. It would be environmentally friendly (with a number of positive side-effects relating to carbon), simpler, easier to work with and easier to dispose of.

But why don&#39;t you use the &quot;sap replacement process&quot; (also called Boucherie process). You pressure-force the liquid by the butt of a pole, and it goes through the fibers following the natural path of sap. <br><br>It was quite difficult to find good references for this process, cf <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/an800e/an800e00.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/an800e/an800e00.pdf</a> on page 57, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUffe_kZYRc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUffe_kZYRc</a> . My father did visit a factory some 50 years ago where they were treating telephone-line poles some 10 meters long this way, with creosote. With high pressure (I don&#39;t have the figures...), the liquid was pouring at the other end like through a hose... So, with a thicker resin, you should be able to go through at least tens of centimeters.<br><br><br><br>Then, after treatment,  you could slice the pole in any thickness, and get full planks along the grain, which is the end goal if you want big surfaces of &quot;wood glass&quot;.<br><br><br>B) I also see that you are afraid to fully dry the wood before injecting the epoxy, because you are much afraid of the shrinking. But I&#39;m not sure that the resine+alcool is fully transparent. May be you could try 1) the transparency of just epoxy + 10% alcool, and 2) with a well-dryied plank, now that you can have some in any dimension...<br><br><br>C) did you try thin CA glue? it runs thinner than water and, if you can apply it it absence of moisture, you can choose when to start the hardening process by introducing the catalyser (either simple H2O or a dedicated hardener). Then even if you don&#39;t have the same final strengh as with epoxy, you can quickly test for the transparencey. My cheap provider of CA glue is hobbyking : 50g for less than 3$ : <a href=\"https://hobbyking.com/fr_fr/hobbyking-super-glue-ca-50g-1-7oz-super-thin.html\">https://hobbyking.com/fr_fr/hobbyking-super-glue-ca-50g-1-7oz-super-thin.html</a> ; check there also the &quot;Insta-Set CA Accelerator&quot;.<br><br><br>D) may be you should try sandwiching the plank between 2 sheets of glass (covered with unmoulding coumpound?), and some weight on-top, during the hardening of the epoxy.

The epoxy bending like that could be due to an improper ratio of the two components. I don\u2019t know about the one you used but most have to be measured by weight. Also you pouring them into separate containers first could leave different amounts of residue on the different containers screwing with the mixing ratio even further. The best practice here would be to put the container on a precise scale, set it to 0, add the exact amount of compound a, set it to 0 again and then add the exact amount of compound b.

Wood is naturally under stress, every time you cut it, it releases some of that stress. The form, in which the wood takes after that stress is relieved is entirely\u00a0based on the wood. That is why woodworkers start with larger pieces so they can make minor corrections (like planing or sanding) to keep the wood from twisting, bowing, and/or checking/cracking. The first problem with what you&#39;re doing is making stupidly thin pieces and removing the lignin, the glue, that keeps wood fibers together. Next problem is the resin infusing. Having the vacuum is a good start to draw out the air but, you need a pressure pot to force the resin back in simply because of the ethanol displacement in what is pretty much a sponge at this point. The final problem is curing. The best idea I could think of is a form fitted mold that can be sealed. That way, the resin can cure without the risk of the wood twisting, bowing, and/or checking/cracking.

Firstly, in your molding process you put the wood in considerably more epoxy to dry than when you let them sit on the drying dish. I think that you might be able to get the same sort of clean edges using the mold by simply using less epoxy. Second It might be possible to get additional time running the vacuum by using a UV hardening epoxy. You could get several more vacuum cycles to allow the epoxy to better permeate the wood, then use the light to harden it once you were satisfied with the permeation.", "comment_date": "2019-02-09T22:03:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Val Lanche", "comment_text": "why would you even want to make a transparent wood?...", "comment_date": "2019-02-09T15:21:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lolo shepheard", "comment_text": "neet but is it really wood now??", "comment_date": "2019-02-09T14:26:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diatomic Porcelain", "comment_text": "How are you getting dislikes??", "comment_date": "2019-02-09T11:50:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "first last", "comment_text": "but the epoxy and other chemicals are not renewable resources?", "comment_date": "2019-02-09T08:42:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "irk hayner", "comment_text": "The curve could be caused by shrinking and swelling due to differences of permeability of the two surfaces.

The Specific resins are selected with consideration for curing temperature and generally need curing conditions elevated above room temperature for practical set times. And most are post-cured at hot temperatures; maybe 40-50c for initial cure(important not to get hot spots here, it is exothermic and the main polymerization has an ideal temp) followed a day or two later by several hours at 70-110c [depending on the exact product]. The post cure greatly increases strength, but not just by accelerating the final bits of cross linking, as the strength from a high temp post cure is higher that that achieved with several weeks of moderate temperature aging. <br>Lastly most structural composites are made under pressure, the vacuum cycling you used is a step in that direction but the next step is to bag the item with a special multi layer bag and draw a vacuum to compress the item (somewhat like vacuum bagged foods) and reduce resin and void content.

You might also benefit from looking into different ways of reducing the resin with a solvent. Usually the datasheet of resins will specify if there is an acceptable or specific solvent to use for this. Sometimes there are also options for controlling the flash and cure properties of the catalyst, although this is usually more common with polyurethane clear coats that are used in much larger quantities and environments where they need to be perfected. <br><br>   You might also try a vacuum bagging process where you draw the resin across the wood in a controlled manner. That&#39;s one popular way structural carbon fiber composites are done when dry fabrics are used for the composite layup.<br><br>  BTW, I painted cars and did custom graphics for many years. When it comes to getting a polished surface. The standard is to smooth the surface with 1500 grit wet sandpaper. Use a bucket of water with a couple drops of dish soap like (or specifically) Palmolive to clean the paper and surface as you go. Follow this up with 2000 grit, then 2500 grit in the same wet sanding process. Be sure to completely remove the scratches from each prior step. Then use 3M Perfect-it 2 polish compound on a heavy foam polishing pad with a polishing machine set to around 1000-1200rpm. The trick is to remember the compound does the work. Never let the working surface go dry while never adding too much polish that it gets slung off the pad. The surface will begin to get warm if the pad is doing the work instead of the compound. Also, never sand through the epoxy to the surface underneath. This is harder to do on the edges where the epoxy is thinner. All polishing steps must stay in the epoxy layer. To use wet/dry sandpaper, tear it in strips in a size you like (2-5&quot;\u00d79-11&quot;) and fold it in thirds. Let dry paper soak in water/soap mix for 10-30min before use too. This will soften the folded corners of the sandpaper and prevent them from causing deeper scratches than the specific grit. <br>  If you sand by hand, always sand like your hand is the x-axis of a cnc machine - left and right. If you sand with the direction of your fingers you will create an uneven surface. The pro way is to use a soft foam block that is designed for backing up sandpaper, but I have a collection of ~50 blocks for all the different applications and preferences. For small things, you don&#39;t need this just use your hand. Perfect-it 2 polish is the best machine polish for transitioning from sand paper scratches to a polished plastic. It isn&#39;t really a finishing compound. For instance, if you use it on a black car it will leave a haze and swirls on the surface. This type of compound is usually followed by a medium and light machine compound to get an absolutely perfect finish, but these depend on the application. With light colors like silver or white cars the final finish can often be achieved with just Perfect-it 2 because of how light reflects off the surface. There is a Perfect-it 3 compound too but I never liked it as much as 2. Most compounds tend to have fillers that deceptively make the surface look better at first while the job isn&#39;t really done. They are basically filled with oils that make the surface look okay at a glance. In my experience Perfect-it 2 does tbe best job of creating a truly perfect surface ready for the next step without artificially hiding problems or burning/damaging the surface.<br><br>  I think you were also on the right track with the glass dish cured product. Carbon fiber composites sold in flat sheets are usually made with the cosmetic side formed against a sheet of glass. You would probably benefit from a cheap and flatter piece of glass from the hardware store.<br><br>For a fun challenge, I wonder if you could seal part of the wood and process an image into a wooden substrate like this.

Thin fiberglass layers can be nearly clear, as the glass fibers in resin minimize scattering of light, and though highly translucent the glass adds dramatic strength that the grossly denatured wood fibers have lost by the time the process has broken down cross-linking, and pulled out opaque tannins, natural dyes, etc. Manufacturing modern polymers and cheap glass fiber cloth is likely far easier and cheaper, and less environmentally adverse when done under EPA/OSHA standards, than trying to basically turn a perfectly good material like wood into something it is not - clear. So, aside from the curiosity side of this, there are lots of videos showing shop-level resin impregnating success for woodturning etc. which let wood look like wood, yet gain dramatic strength. I hate when TV &quot;decorators&quot; paint any decent wood surface, and similarly, I see no value in losing the aesthetic property of wood to make some other less aesthetic end product, especially if the goal is to make the final result no longer recognizable as wood.

Generally, whatever you&#39;re trying to rinse out is going to distribute itself evenly among all of the water, both inside the wood and outside of it. So if a third of the water in your beaker is in the wood, then no matter how long you leave it to soak, only about two thirds of that stuff is going to leak out of the wood.<br><br>This is one reason that when a cook is making stock, they&#39;ll use a lot of water for the extraction process and then boil it down later, rather than just aiming to have the desired volume by the end of the extraction. And it&#39;s also why the ingredients are removed before boiling down. The less water they use, the more of the stuff they&#39;re trying to extract will stay in the ingredients. And if the ingredients are left in the stock while reducing, as the concentration of the stock increases, a portion of that goodness will diffuse back into the ingredients.<br><br>Another analogy would be using a towel to dry a rug. The towel is not going to take all of the water out of the rug. Rather, the best you can do is get the towel and the rug to be &quot;equally wet&quot;, so to speak. So a smaller towel means a wetter rug. You&#39;ll have to wring out the towel more times to get the job done.", "comment_date": "2018-11-27T06:21:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Jenkins Cornish V", "comment_text": "Procedures I&#39;d Attempt<br><br>1. The video only shows two different grain cuts. The third grain cut is singularly diagonal to the grain. The fourth grain cut is doubly diagonal to the grain. Slice the wood diagonally across the grain in both directions. This would mean that the wood has tube openings on all six sides of the treated piece. This involves some serious measurements to obtain the most porous borders capable by the wood. The diagonal arrangements of the wood tubes only extend the tubes about half as much, but their orientation retains rigidity through the rest of the procedures. Thoroughly sand the wood piece for smooth edges and sides.<br><br>2. Use the same chemical mixture as described in the video. Place one piece (not a bundle) of wood in the chemical bath.<br><br>3. Heat the chemical mixture and soaked wood piece.<br><br>4. Once heated, place the hot mixture and wood piece in the vacuum chamber to completely saturate the wood with the chemical mixture.<br><br>5. Once the air is pulled out of the wood, remove the first chemical solution and wood from the vacuum chamber. Pour off the chemical bath.<br><br>6. Apply as many water rinses as needed until the saturated wood no longer colors the water.<br><br>7. Allow the piece of wood to dry.<br><br>8. In a fresh water rinse, place the chemically saturated wood in the vacuum. This should color the water with the trapped chemical within the wood and extract air from the wood.<br><br>9. Allow the piece of wood to dry.<br><br>10. Apply the original second chemical mixture (not bleach) to the wood piece.<br><br>11. Add heat to the second chemical mixture to open the pores of the wood to saturate with the second chemical.<br><br>12. After appropriate heat is applied, place the heated wood piece and second chemical mixture into the vacuum chamber. <br><br>13. Once the air within the wood is extracted and the second chemical mixture thoroughly penetrates the wood piece, remove from the vacuum.<br><br>14. Apply as many water rinses as needed until the saturated wood no longer colors the water.<br><br>15. Allow the piece of wood to dry.<br><br>16. In a fresh water rinse, place the second chemically saturated wood piece in the vacuum. This should color the water with the trapped second chemical within the wood and extract air from the wood.<br><br>17. While the wood is still wet and pliable with water, apply the resin mixture in a flexible plastic (not rubber) mold.<br><br>18. Place the resin mixture and wood piece in the vacuum chamber. Keep the vacuum applied until the resin sets but not hardens completely.<br><br>19. Remove the set resined wood piece from the vacuum chamber and let it dry completely.<br><br>20. Once completely dry, do not pry the dried piece of wood from the mold. Instead cut away the flexible plastic mold from the finished piece. Use an eyeglass cleaner cloth to shine all exteriors of the resined wood piece.<br><br>The results of these procedures should yield better results in strength, clarity, saturation of the resin, and finished shape of the resin.", "comment_date": "2018-11-27T06:18:59Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "longraptorjesus", "comment_text": "Random is a bad word!", "comment_date": "2018-11-27T06:15:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ramiro Ramos", "comment_text": "bass wood has very fine pours, what if you tried a wood with larger ones or use a resin thats much thinner than the one used. or some combination of both?", "comment_date": "2018-11-27T06:04:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrTarfu", "comment_text": "Cringing at the table saw use, especially the free hand cutting.", "comment_date": "2018-11-27T06:03:40Z", "likes_count": 34}, {"comment_by": "WYFWOJ", "comment_text": "Daily dose of nvm", "comment_date": "2018-11-27T06:02:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexandros Atsalis-Gogel", "comment_text": "Love this!

The one reason I was able to not only get it as clear as what you did here, but with thicker wood samples is the extra time with the vacuum chamber.\r<br>     1.) Unlike most others... you actually notice the increase in volume when adding something  to a measured volume of anything else (Adding anything to 500 would be over 500) &lt;-- common sense isn&#39;t common !    &lt;GOOD CALL&gt;\r<br>     2.)  I got the Sodium Sulfite and Sodium Hydroxide to a boil and after half an hour I gave it a brake from the heat and put it in the vacuum chamber to get as much of the air out of it as possible. I pumped the air out and let it back in then returned it to the heat for another half hour. I did this three times to make sure it was soaked all the way through and the mixture can reach the lignin at the innermost parts of the wood.\r<br>     3.) after I cleaned it all out and it was ready to be placed in resin I placed it in the vacuum chamber a fourth time but with RO/DI Water and a few drops of a latex paint to give them a tint when finished.\r<br>     4.) When placing it in the resin I started with a flat mold and let a 1/16th inch layer dry at the bottom with the wood pieces placed on top (not pushed in to it) that will give the mold a flat base AND hold the wood down so it won&#39;t float to the top while it&#39;s setting.\r<br>     5.) I used slow setting epoxy because to remove all of the air bubbles you&#39;ll need to vacuum it and let the air back in at least three times so you&#39;re replacing all the air bubbles with the epoxy deep inside the layers of wood. That and heating it up with a heat gun between vacuums takes more time than you&#39;d think.\r<br>     6.) at least 24 hours later, pop it out of the mold and using a dremel, starting off with 400-grit sandpaper, work your way up to a glass finish.", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T01:00:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "orion khan", "comment_text": "I\u2019d think <b>Cactus Juice</b> would be a better resin to use than the one listed...    it <i>very</i> easily penetrates wood with a good vacuum :)", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T00:56:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AdamAlexander", "comment_text": "who said the epoxy wood needs to be perfectly flat?

Ultimately, all one is doing by doing any and / or all of this, is preparing a lattice like medium to hold epoxy (liquid epoxy) while it cures.  One could just use a simple translucent mesh weave... something similar to what is used to enforce a repair area pre epoxy, etc... The wood part is the neat part and all, the actual chemistry part.... But.... it&#39;s also the MOST unnecessary part of all of this...

It&#39;s a two part can O chems that makes a clear resin result even with the renewable substrate...

I wonder if covering the samples with a book after the samples cured enough not to be sticky would help impose a flatter form in the final piece. <br><br>I also think the 8% peroxide solution would work better than the 3%, if not preheated and slowly brought to a low boil. If you dont prewash so vigorously, or use slightly thicker pieces (like in the first batch), the sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide solution will soak more into the center of the thicker wood slivers, which I think you&#39;re right in assuming will help the hydrogen peroxide step. <br><br>I think the molds are a good idea, but perhaps it could be improved. Letting the piece partially cure, then covering it with another layer of partially cured apoxy is a great method. To get the pieces to cure flat, maybe using a second silicon mold, stacked on top (like one fits cups together in a stack) and filling the top mold with some sand or something of decent mass after the apoxy becomes viscous enough to not squeeze out, might also help keep the cured mold flat in the plane of the wood. This flat silicone mold on top might also help maintain a smooth finish on the plane of the wood after curing. <br><br>I really think the first run would have been just about perfect, as far as apoxy fill is concerned, at least, with the new vacuum pump. The bubbling was much more vigorous, and may have allowed you to try a 4th or 5th vacuum cycle to see if that helped with the apoxy back fill. <br><br>In any case, awesome experiment!

I&#39;ll never forget being 12 years old seeing his exhibition at the boston museum of science; there were thin slices of plastic filled blood vessels and muscle fiber which you could likewise read text through. If memory serves, he had some super complicated process that involved removing the liquid water from cellular plasma while simultaneously replacing it with some plastic or apoxy like resin, probably in a vacuum chamber. I think it involved salt or something, I cant imagine how gentile of a process that must be to dry out cells withough bursting the membrane and making a plastic solution with low enough molecular size and low enough viscosity to make it through the cell membeains without damaging them.

If you have a good source of air for this, it shouldn&#39;t add that much time to the process between the multiple runs of pulling a vacuum. For resin castings, this is particularly useful as it crushes air bubbles caught in the form and any gas bubbles generated as the epoxy cures, but it also forces the resin deeper into any nooks and fine details of the form. In theory, this should push the resin further into the capillaries of the wood.

Weigh down with a large heave ptfe stir bar etc. Without drying, dump the alcohol and top off with a heat or UV cure expoy thinned to less than 100cps. Again, vacuum &amp; weighed down in the resin. The alcohol will vaporize if it can see the vacuum. Diffusion will take the remainder. Pull the samples and sandwich in FEP film, polymerize normally.

Question: Do you think that repeating the sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfite would have helped clarify the wood?

Bleaching is not the same as removal and I feel like the tubes of the wood needed to be cleaner.  Also, that Aeromarine epoxy is wonderful stuff.  So incredibly clear.  As an alternative for future projects, you might find a product called Git-Rot useful because of it&#39;s extremely low viscosity.  It may have a very slight yellow color to it but is otherwise clear.      ..One idea I had while watching the vacuum process is perhaps using a pressure differential to force the epoxy, etc, through the wood.  The wood could be supported on a strong grid or a tight screen to hold it while the epoxy was forced thru.  Pressure or vacuum could be used.  This might help in the washing process also. <br>  That having been said, I think you did an amazing job and might be sick of playing with all this by now.

Also a tip if you want to retry this, don&#39;t use a table saw. You are ending up with a lot of grime on the wood. You have paint from teh blade and other crap that can be causing a problem.
