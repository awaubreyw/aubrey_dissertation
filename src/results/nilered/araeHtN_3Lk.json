Adding the 2-propanol does indeed result in precipitation of DNA but in this case you are also collecting massive amounts of debris. Ideally you would first break up the strawberrys as much as possible, perhaps by gronding it through a Filter, with this cellular suspension you would then continue. Ideally, wash this with PBS or other buffers to clean up the suspension and transfer the pellet (after centrifugation) to a new container. use a lysis buffer (not a simple hypotonic solution) to burst the pellet of cells and incubate this on ice for roughly 30 minutes. Add Sodium Acetate and alcohol or 2-propanol to the solution and let it sit at -20 for about 2 hours or otherwise overnight. THIS precipitates the DNA but youre not there yet. After incubation, centrifuge the entire suspension at max speed (13000 RPM if it fits in an eppendord) for about an hour to pellet the DNA (+debris). Wash this pellet with 70% ethanol once and let the pellet completely dry. Resuspend this dried pellet of CLEAN dna with water and voila, you got your pure and clean strawberry DNA.

You don&#39;t try to make things more interesting then they are. You restrain from words like &quot;awesome&quot;, &quot;cool&quot;, unless they for real are valid. You edit the videos perfectly, there is not one second that I would skip or speed up or pause or get back to (though impatient that I am, I usually watch videos at 1,25 or 1,5x speed). You speak clearly, consisely, interestingly. You try to keep the amateurish apporach inside the videos to make us rely to the thins you do, though clearly you could edit out the stuff that went wrong.  Also it cracks the barrier between us, amoeba viewers, and you, a chemist that clearly knows his stuff.<br>To conclude, I think you totally have a knack, you are a natural youtuber, a storyteller, who happens to be interested in chemistry.

The shown process should have lead to sufficient protein precipitation due to the pH shift... I here assume your soap isn&#39;t interacting with the salt like a buffering solution would. As far as I&#39;m aware most dishsoaps these days don&#39;t really have that basic character classical soap might provide though, so the solution very probably has no pH buffering properties. This leads to problems when you take a look at DNAs structure and realise how important ionic hydrogen bonds are for it&#39;s packed state and how high H+ avaliability would make them fall apart...<br>But let&#39;s keep going. You denaturated your proteins (at least partially) and then filtered a big chunk of them out, but surely not all of them and a bunch of them are enzymes... and even if you actually did filter all of them out, they are your main problem. <br>The cells have a lot of DNAse and RNAse type enzymes and while you were squishing your plant matter, they already went to work. As long as your temperature is somewhat in their range, they will cut away at any piece of DNA/RNA you exposed, snipping it into fragments at a remarkable speed. The Question that we have to ask ourselves is: what is DNA? Nucleotides are their own category of molecules and short pieces of assembled nucleotides have been observed &#39;in the wild&#39; so to speak, without being directly linked to life. They just tend to do this thing where they snap together nicely... so you would have to define DNA as such nucleotide containing molecules, with &#39;sense&#39; information written in their sequence... <br>But if you let DNA sit out (nucleus destroyed, contents of cell organelles spilled around it) at room temperature in a ion rich environment like that for anything more than 5 Minutes, there will be basically no readable code left. We isolate our nucleotides on ice for a reason and even the centrifuge has to be precooled to near freezing temperatures, to ensure a successful extraction. Most of the time we go so far and freeze our tissues with liquid nitrogen, crush them in that state and add a buffering solution while the tube is still way below freezing point (yes, the solution freezes too, but will start acting as buffer as soon as any mobility returns due to thawing) <br><br>I agree you chose a good fruit to work on, since modern strawberries have accumulated lots of DNA during our cultivation (polyploidy isn&#39;t all that rare in plants we eat) and their cellular makeup is quite simple + their cell walls are barely deserving of the term &#39;wall&#39;. That sure made extraction quicker and easier. You also used a lot of fruit - in the lab we tend to use ~10-100 mg (depending on tissue type and plant type) and that yields us a barely visible little flake in the tip of our eppi tubes. And if you are working on a tricky plant with contents that interfere with your protocol, or are to slow or sometimes just... I don&#39;t know, sometimes it feels like random cruelty... you still can&#39;t isolate anyting of use from your tissues...<br>I think what you have there isn&#39;t really DNA. Is it short sequences of assembled nucleotides, sticking together in the apolarity of the solute? Sure! But is it readable? I really doubt that!<br><br>But very nice video that gives people a kind of realistic idea of how modern biology works! <br>And yes, we have to deal with a lot of chemical randomness, since life throws these crazy complex molecules with funny folding behaviours and functions at us. <br>All.

After this step mixture of phenol, CHCl3 and isoamyl alcohol is used to denaturate all proteins followed by centrifugation. DNA stays in upper water layer while most of the proteins and debris remains in organic layer as solid. pH &gt;7 also results in RNA being quite well hydrolized (which is not an option when you are extracting RNA). Then I&#39;ve usually added equal parts of ice cold IPA with 3M potassium acetate solution and set whole mix for about an hour at -30C. After this spin tube at about 20k g for 15 minutes and you&#39;ll see tiny pellet of DNA which you need to wash with IPA, dry and dissolve into water or Tris buffer with pH of 8,0. This works for plasmid DNA.

Naturally occurring hormones drive two concurrent and coordinated cycles that last about 28 days. The ovarian cycle controls the production and release of\u00a0eggs\u00a0and the release of the hormones\u00a0estrogen\u00a0and\u00a0progesterone. The uterine cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the lining of the uterus (endometrium) to receive a\u00a0fertilized\u00a0egg.\u00a0Menstruation, a &quot;period&quot; in common parlance, begins on day one of the cycle, and lasts for about five days. Around day fourteen, an egg is usually released from the ovary. Estrogen stimulates the uterus lining to thicken to accommodate an\u00a0embryo\u00a0should fertilization occur. If\u00a0implantation\u00a0does not occur, the lining is released during menstruation.\u00a0Menarche\u00a0(the first period) usually occurs around age twelve, and menstrual cycles usually continue for 30\u201345 years until\u00a0menopause.

Despite these barriers, 57\u00a0United Nations\u00a0members maintain relations with Taiwan on an unofficial basis. To serve these locations and other places throughout the world, 92\u00a0semi-official representative offices\u00a0are utilized for matters that would otherwise be handled by embassies or consulates. Taiwan has established informal representation in China&#39;s two\u00a0special administrative regions\u00a0as well. In\u00a0Hong Kong, the\u00a0Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Hong Kong\u00a0provides services similar to a consulate, while relations to\u00a0Macau\u00a0are handled by the\u00a0Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Macau.

My teacher- who I&#39;ll call Mr S- was teaching us about organelles and when we came to the nucleus he decided to show off how he could spell deoxyribonucleic acid. I decided to note it down because maybe, in a wild twist of events, I would need that information. However, Mr.S wiped it off the whiteboard before I had finished. I was annoyed, (try telling an 11-year-old autistic child who is obsessed with science that it wasn&#39;t a big deal) so I decided to be petty. Mr S- who was bragging about being able to spell deoxyribonucleic acid after years of being a scientist- was about to be outsmarted by an 11-year-old who had less than a year of study on science. That night I spent 10 minutes learning how to spell deoxyribonucleic acid and, after that, I proceeded to think of a theory that, although scientists had already thought of it, was pretty complex for me at the time.

The beaker with the strained strawberry solution should be tipped slightly and thecold isopropanol should be slowly run down the side of the beaker. I think this is to create a concentration gradient where the majority of the isopropanol stays on top as it is less dense than water. DNA then precipitates out of the solution where it is in contact with the isopropanol and because it is a long chain, it pulls more DNA out of the solution. The dumping and stirring most likely fragmented the DNA as well as precipitating out a lot of contaminants while leaving a considerable amount of DNA dissolved. That is why you had a hard time picking it up with spoon. The DNA was in short bits by then, not long strands. <br><br>When pure DNA dries, it loses volume to the point it looks more like a thin white slightly crystalline residue, not a clump. And when DNA becomes extremely dry, it is actually quite difficult to get it to dissolve back into a solution. This means that likely none of what you tasted was DNA, as it was not in your mouth long enough for any to dissolve.<br><br>It is also interesting to point out that another reason strawberries are great for this demonstration is that commercial strawberries have an octoploid genome. That means that unlike humans, who have 2 copies of their DNA, or a diploid genome, the strawberry has 8 copies. Polyploid plants are quite often larger than their diploid versions and also have increased plant vigor. Many commercially grown plants are polyploid. Wild strawberries are often diploid, and that is the reason for the size difference from what is bought in store.", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T17:44:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juli\u00e1n Gross", "comment_text": "Such a good idea", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T00:09:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FearInjustice", "comment_text": "&#39;&#39;looks delicious!

I&#39;ve extracted a lot of DNA and RNA using similar methods for research purposes, and I&#39;ve often wondered what it tasted like. After all, the flavors of the other big macromolecules are common enough. Some things: Using cold isopropanol is an old method -- thought to be essential -- but is now discouraged as it strongly increases co-precipitation of salts (although a lot of people still insist on using cold methods). Your DNA would probably be a lot less salty if you had just used room temp stuff. And saying DNA strands pair by hydrogen bonding isn&#39;t really right -- they could hydrogen bond with the water molecules just as easily. The hydrogen bonds are required, but the driving force is the hydrophobic effect from the nonpolar components of the nucleotides. Just oil and water not mixing.", "comment_date": "2020-02-16T08:13:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Sir", "comment_text": "That looks like chewed gum", "comment_date":

Don&#39;t do that plz lol. Do something like this for ex: the cell membranes have these things that look like bobby pins with heads. The pressure that is applied by my fingers, causes every cell to clump together and squish each other. This squishing makes less and less space, in turn causing the little bobby pins to break under pressure.&quot; I know this is not anywhere near accurate but its hypothetical. explaining all the names and going deep into what everything is and does actually just shifts my focus away from the main idea, which ends up confusing me in the long run.

This is however not true, genes can be read from either strand depending on their orientation. The orientation is determined as DNA is always read from 5&#39; to 3&#39; refering to the positions on the deoxyribose in combination with other factors.  These other factors are things like promoter and terminater sequences, the methionine codon which indicates the start of the gene and other regulatory sequences (inhibitors and enhancers).<br>The other misconception is that DNA is always stored in the form of tightly packed chromosomes, this only occurs during mitosis, if DNA was consistently packed like this there would be no space for mRNA to be synthesised. DNA is stored in the cell as chromatin fibers which are, indeed, wrapped around histones in some places, but free in others. This is part of a field we are just now beginning to understand called epigenetics. By having some parts of our DNA wrapped and inaccesible to RNA polymerase the sets of genes that can be transcribed differ from cell to cell, this is in addition to other epigenetic features such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation/methylation and others.

One of the reagents gets very sudsy if I shook the bottle too much, which now I realize it could have been some sort of soap. We warm the sample overnight with that reagent and some protease, in order to break up the proteins and release the DNA. I imagine if you warmed your sample as well, you could have extracted even more DNA. Given your starting sample size of 10 strawberries, that&#39;s probably not gonna make a significant difference. The washing buffer also requires addition of 100% pure alcohol; the rest I imagine are probably some chemicals to stabilize the DNA. So all in all pretty similar stuff.<br><br>The video also reminds me of phenol-chloroform extraction I used to do on cancer tumor samples. I used Trizol (which is a pretty nasty reagent that breaks up proteins) to dissolve the samples, and then used phenol and chloroform to help precipitate out the DNA.
