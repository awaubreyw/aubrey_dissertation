Development of severe Myopia can be a reason for detached retinas later in life due to the elongation, and therefore the suggested treatment with Theobromine medication during youth may not only reduce levels of Myopia as an adult, but also hinder blindness due to detached retina. Trials of the treatment are being conducted with placebo experiments, on children, after development and testing on rabbits. Lab animals were fine, and a significant reduction of development of Myopia was detected in the groups of children who did receive the Theobromine.

Most of the time, you never find them again.<br><br>I have a Primus Eta Solo stove that I love. The prominent feature is that it has metal fins sticking out from the bottom, like a heatsink, giving optimum heat transfer even during unfavourable conditions.

To make it short, I used paraffin heat candles instead of the isobutane burner it was designed for. The butane burner never leaves soot, and when you pack the Eta up, everything packs pack into the boiling vessel.<br><br>The heating canles worked (a tribute to how well the Eta works), and I was able to keep my body heat up. However it left significant soot marks on the heatsink structure. This is a problem since the Eta&#39;s boiling vessel IS the outer packaging too. This means that the heatsink leaves black stars on all my clothinkg.<br><br>I have no idea what surface treatment it has, but I don&#39;t want to damage it.
