Urgently look at a hidden message on Ste. Peter&#39;s Basilica, in Rome Italy!  Encoded in the statues on the building, for telling WW3!  Look at these bible scriptures as further proof, Romans1:23, Deuteronomy5:8, Romans1:25, Revelation/ Apocalypse 17, 18, 18:4,6,24;John the Baptist, Jesus....  This is information hidden in plain sight till now(Daniel12:4). War is starting to hide this.</b>  The Mark of the beast is on the shield of the Empire and on top of their buildings.  666 is on the three level crown(vicarius filii dei). <b>Germany is now concealing historical information about WW2 and that Nazi war on Russia, which killed more of their population than almost all other nations involved combined.  Was this a war of the Roman Empire?  Both Catholic and Protestant legs of the Roman Empire.  History shows a lot of evidence in that direction.  The Pope never spoke out about the atrocities, even though he had a vast network of informants.</b>  The French and Bolshevik revolutions infuriated Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18, and that is why both Russia and France were attacked.  <b>1798, the French Revolution ended the Bible&#39;s for told 1260 years of complete subjugation of the world, including the death penalty for observing the Sabbath (which is not (sun)day) and for Biblical festivals, like Passover(538AD, the beginning of the death decree, by Roman Consul).</b>  The UK also had a secret they wanted hidden by the fog of WW2 war.  NATO Countries setting up the ministry of truth, to control their people&#39;s minds.  <b>Turkey is where Gog and Magog are of the Bible&#39;s Ezekiel 38, and is surrounded by seas, which to be driven in to as per the Bible&#39;s description.  Turkey is also directly north of Israel, and where the bible calls the &quot;seat of Satan&quot;.  Rosh in Hebrew means head, but just because Russia sounds like the Hebrew word for head, doesn&#39;t mean it is the head(Rosh) of Gog and Magog.  They are not even in the same Country.  Search them out, and don&#39;t start a war on falsehoods!</b>  A sovereign city is under attack in Florida USA, by an American Governor, for speaking about Biblical matters.  <b>Ron Desantis</b> says Acts2:44(communism) of the Bible must be overthrown, so the Pope can take his rightful place as 1John<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Kn-kIsVu8&amp;t=5m19s\">5:19</a>.  <b>He talks how it is waking people up, and must stop.  World, take notice, the US claims to believe in Democracy, but are attacking a sovereign state in the United States.</b> The US is about to slip in to complete darkness.  <b>80% of US money has been printed in the last couple years, with the stock market just better than the drop of the great depression of 1929 and still falling.</b>  NATO must be broken up, as the greatest obstacle to peace in the world.  The time is quickly approaching for all nation to seize assets of non residents and take control of oppressive business holdings of NATO Countries.  Take away their terror production ability.  NATO has been calling it their war from the beginning.  Changed the name of Ukraine&#39;s Capital from a Russian word to some thing else. Refused to talk peace.  Stockpiles of NATO weapons were found in bunkers in Ukraine.  This is an alliance of evil.  The evidence to invade Iraq, still has not been given, or Syria. NATO nations have military bases around the world(800+).  Christians are creating a fake uprising about abortions, so that they can attack people upset about the Bible&#39;s Revelation/ Apocalypse 17,18 being exposed, and attack them as if they are protesting some thing else.  They are masters of deception, and misdirecting anger.  Revelation 18:6,24. The church claims they are the new Jerusalem, and the Vatican represents God&#39;s temple, so the Pope is the one sitting in the false temple with 666 in his crown and the sign of the religion and empire in his hand(the cross).  <b>US Senator Lindsay Graham said that Ukraine&#39;s war is the US war, and that the year 2017 would be the year of offense(wow).  That was before this so called invasion.  Graham also called for the assassination of Putin.  US&#39;s Mike Pompeo(possibly named after Roman General Pomp\u00e9, who greatly expanded Roman territory, just as now happening) also said that the war would start in 2017.  President Donald J. Trump said over 21/2 years ago that the US would soon be at war with Russia and China.  Christian networks, behind the scenes are fomenting a war against China, using false attacks on Taiwan.  These people are totally evil. NATO is the military arm of the beast system with the cross(mark of the beast every where).  People pledge an allegiance to its supposed ideals.  Those who don&#39;t accept it, have fire rain down from heaven in the sight of men.  Remember this!  No man has greater love than this, that he give his life for his friends.  *Joe Biden now says, that the weapon stockpiles in Ukraine were there preemptively for when Russia attacked Ukraine.  So when the attack came that Lindsay Graham, Mike Pomeo and Donald Trump were talking about in advance. Russia entered Ukraine because weaponization in Ukraine against Russia and because of killing of so called Russian separatists and sympathizers.</b> NATO Countries are stealing Russia assets claiming on account of the war, but it seams to be the other way around.  NATO was attacking Russians in Ukraine and militarizing for an all out assault.  The West would not negotiate with Putin to prevent the escalation.  So seaze NATO property, confiscate their money in your Country, stop their monetary transactions and send them packing.  Do to them, what they were doing.  <b>Why does the Roman Empire and Church(called Roman Catholic Church) exist, when the Bible in Revelation 17,18 says it is evil and responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth?  Verse 6 of chapter 18 of Revelation says to pay her back double for what she has done to others.</b>  Is Donald Trump a prophet, or was he just ahead of schedule proclaiming wars with Russia and China?  Think!  The war with China hasn&#39;t even started yet, but it was Trump saying that the corona virus started in China.  He thought he could get you to start a war through that.  It is not China spraying your cities just before outbreaks. <b>Trump authorized &quot;operation warp speed&quot; to force vaccinate the US through the military.  He authorized death by poison gas, electrocution and  firing squad to the already authorized lethal injection(lethal injection, by military nurses, which caused the expiring of Americans (1 out of every 350 people approximately so far).</b>  Starting to see the evil?  Trump is big business, but was supposedly fighting against them, but they were not attacking him.  America you are fighting for your life, but you have chosen cowardice.  <b>The world collectively belongs to all mankind.  It is greedy people who try to usurp the resources and control.  All people deserve dignity and their fair share.</b>   So supposedly Roman Catholic Joe Biden loves Ukrainian children, but it is him that has shut down baby formula plants, and now importing formula from a Roman Catholic Country. That 50 Billion includes money for the making of a Ukraine government.  This is not NATO helping Ukraine, but a NATO take over of Ukraine and war on Russia.  Biden stopped the gas pipeline, even though there was a contract, and stopped all exploration in Alaska, but didn&#39;t even envite the largest electric car company to an electric vehicle fair of the US government.  Does he have your interests? Biden elimates food plants.  <b>How many nations of the world will be attacked by an alliance that the Bible calls satanic before people realize it must be stopped?</b>  Revelation 18:4 &quot;Get out of her my people&quot;   NATO-Rome/UK attacking Acts2:44. <b>Research Boris Johnston&#39;s &quot; plan A&quot;, corona virus deaths not stopping people from talking about things so WAR!</b>  New vaccines for new variants, with out testing and very quickly, how?  I think this is an attack on America, but not by Russia, but Rome/UK.  <b>Prince Charles was recorded hugging the Pope and congratulating him on his war.  What war?  It is on the Royal Family&#39;s own channel, so obviously it is true.</b>  NATO is planning to go to war with the Solomon Islands if they militarize, but Russia had no right to defend themselves from the NATO aggressors militarizing Ukraine with the goal of destroying Russia, and attacking Russian loyalists. Share this information and pray for Russia and Ukraine,  Thanks!  Ukraine Nazis kill all with out blue arm band, and other political parties banned. Democracy? Populations of Africa, the Americas and many other places around have been exterminated under the M.O.B. system.  Bow to what the image represents or die.   Look at Countries with M.O.B. on their flags.  Some Countries claiming to want to join NATO are militarized to the teeth, and on Russia&#39;s border with M.O.B. on the tanks and flags.  Think!  Remember the German Nazis putting people and bodies in train cars, bodies in trains in Ukraine.  German tanks coming through Sweden and Finland(swastika on planes till 2020) to Ukraine with MOB on tanks.  When media disallows commenting, it is because of lies and fabrications that will not hold up to scrutiny.  The US just invaded another African Country.  How can some one say they are helping a Country at the end of a barrel of a gun or missile?    2400+ Nazis of the Azov steel plant surrendered to Russia.  NATO is headed for a trap that they will not be able to get out of. A company opposing Daniel12:4 about to declare bankruptcy,. So <b>Ron Desantis,</b> what will your future bring?  Former US President George Busch admits the US lied to Russia, and is behind the war. Unless the US people stop what is happening, get out of the US, get out of the US!  Roman Catholic Joe Biden is making moves, like Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler.  Rome&#39;s cronies attacking businesses and products.  Corona/monkey/leopard pox lockdowns about to arrive world wide compliments of Rome/UK.

You can see that the clasp piece has some gold coming off of it with silver exposed underneath. Although he didn\u2019t specify which year this watch came from, Rolex watches from that same time period (likely 80\u2019s or 90\u2019s) did not use gold plating. Also, if you look closely at the gold links and their sides which also belong to the Rolex bracelet, they too appear to have an exposed silver colored under metal where there might be gold plating scratched off but it would have been hard to tell without seeing them in person. He also made the statement around the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Kn-kIsVu8&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> time stamp that the pieces all felt to be less than 14k gold and if that was the case, Rolex had never used anything other than pure 14 karat or 18 karat gold in their precious metal watches. Rolex does not use 24 karat gold since it is too soft. My suspicions of gold plating are also confirmed around the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Kn-kIsVu8&amp;t=20m27s\">20:27</a> time stamp on the video when he processes the disassembled \u201cRolex\u201d bracelet. As he shows the processes the bracelet pieces, he states that the gold all seemed to be plated or seemed to be made of low Karat gold. You can also see the plating dissolving off of the bracelet pieces during the processing segment. There are also several things that also stick out to me as being off on the watch itself such as the magnification of the cyclops lens and the font that\u2019s used for the date. The majority of all Rolex watches have a 2.5x magnification and a very specific date font and if you do a side by side comparison to other photos of other Datejust watches from this era, it looks off. The printing on the dial or \u201cface\u201d of the watch are also not super crisp and the gold plating on the crown and bezel of the watch are wearing away exposing the metal underneath. If this watch is truly from the time period its appears to be from, its impressive to see an automatic movement rather than a quartz movement that typically comes in a Rolex clone from this time period. I am about 99.9% sure its a counterfeit but the best way to 100% confirm its authenticity or lack thereof would be to take it to a Rolex jeweler or a trained watchmaker who would be able to confirm after removing the case back and observing the movement. It is also possible that even if it is a clone that it used a high amount of real gold for plating since there are several tiers of counterfeit Rolex watches with some ranging into the a few thousand dollars at their most expensive. My best guess would be that the majority of the gold that remained after he processed the watch bracelet remnants came from the added pieces of jewelry scrap and gold chain. I would also have to guess that a good part of the silver that he harvested from the nitric acid around the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Kn-kIsVu8&amp;t=27m50s\">27:50</a> time stamp was the metal that was beneath the plating on the bracelet links.

However through many many books I\u2019ve seen variations where some said you needed a tiny amount of actual gold to seed the process. Others claimed that it was Fools gold used in the process. Also that this process of achieving what they called \u201cThe Philosophers Stone\u201d takes some time. Maybe even years of dilution, hydrating and Dehydrating and pulverizing the elements to weaken the atomic structure. The dilution process again was also mixed as I saw Phosphoric Acid and Citric acid and a few other acids. Never saw Nitric Acid however. Finally at some point you reach a certain point and the elements were supposed to be hermetically sealed in rock Crystal and then heated to a high temperature and that process is repeated for some time. Then in the final stage you reach a point where the elements become black but have a rainbow appearance and thus is called \u201cRavens Wing.\u201d At some point you see a reaction that looks like stars and then it\u2019s supposed to be taken to a dark place and unsealed and the substance is supposed to be kept in the dark sealed. A small piece was supposed to be taken and wrapped in beeswax and then dropped into molten lead. The reaction is supposed to change the  lead into gold. The secret they don\u2019t say in all the versions of this formula I read was that if you succeeded in changing the lead into gold. You remove the gold from the crucible and then add water to the crucible and drink it. It\u2019s supposed to make you young again. Some say immortal? Other versions say the water has to be drunk from the rock Crystal the \u201cRavens Wing\u201d which successfully made gold. Is any of it true? IDK but I read a lot about it over the years.

Bicarbonate is alkaline and neutralizes the acid secreted by the parietal cells; this produces water in the process. The continuous supply of bicarbonate is the primary way for your stomach to protect itself from the acidic environment and keeps the stomach from digesting itself. This is what your esophagus burns/hurts when you have acid reflux/throw up, since it doesn\u2019t have that same protective coating. (P.S. stomach acid isn\u2019t purely HCl, in fact it makes up very little of the overall mixture. Other components include potassium chloride (KCl) and sodium chloride (NaCl).)<br><br>I know it\u2019s probably slightly weird I know all this but for the record I copy and pasted most of the more specific information since I\u2019m horrid at explaining things on my own. Plus I knew roughly how it worked I just couldn\u2019t name a lot of specifics....or (and still) don\u2019t know how to pronounce some of these terms/words. Namely epithelial. I\u2019m like 80% sure how I try to pronounce it is correct. TvT.<br><br>Also I knew roughly how it all worked because I was in chemistry class one day, we were talking about acids, thought of stomach acid, asked my chemistry teacher about it, she didn\u2019t know but she said I was welcome to google it, and google it I did. \u00d9w\u00da\u2728", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T15:32:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ALIENATEDBRAIN", "comment_text": "I too can do that bro.. please send me gold\ud83d\ude10", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T12:34:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simardeep Singh Matharoo", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Kn-kIsVu8&amp;t=30m16s\">30:16</a> i can confirm that", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T09:46:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Poptart916", "comment_text": "Breathed a sigh of relief when you saved that watch face", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T05:07:12Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Francesca D'Agostaro", "comment_text": "This is so beautiful", "comment_date": "2021-06-24T02:49:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Liam Ortega", "comment_text": "Who in their right mind dislikes this?", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T19:11:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gream dream", "comment_text": "PURE!?!?!!?!", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T15:48:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T\u00fa T\u1ea1 Tu\u1ea5n", "comment_text": "The meek panther conversantly occur because hill orly present pro a tasty daisy. brief, diligent canada", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T13:40:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "S h 1 n X", "comment_text": "I thought his shirt was a p*nis-", "comment_date": "2021-06-23T13:14:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Oi!", "comment_text": "23/6/21.

They have exploited the current youth base, making them unemployed &amp; people of low quality like the current CM of my state Arvind Kejriwal whom I didn&#39;t voted as he is not capable &amp; won elections on the basis of favourism given to his puppets like Kapil Sharma &amp; many others, &amp; created so many such businesses which are fake. <br><br>It was started when I was a child went to buy home decor stuff to Karol Bagh/Pitampura/any other branch (I don&#39;t remember) at Baba Jewellers or his connects I suppose; my father would have better idea. There I saw a flower similar to golden flower floating on Flipkart these days; I bought the entire vase &amp; bunch of golden roses for home.

I didn&#39;t agreed &amp; said no to my father &amp; took my father&#39;s hand &amp; left the shop.<br><br>Then the person of that shop thought what to do to make easy money by fooling others. These people are not agreeing to invest in my business &amp; incur losses by getting cheated.<br><br>Then he came up with the idea that what if I sell this gold plated things the girl bought &amp; assure that it won&#39;t go black &amp; is true gold at abnormal rates &amp; call that thing as &#39;Gold&#39; making the golden colour liquid super precious for the masses. <br><br>So, that the moment anybody would wear the gold; a thief would come &amp; take away the chain, ear tops &amp; other ornaments. Daily chain or other jewelry snatching was done in my locality at that point of time when few idiotic women in my surroundings wore gold to marriages &amp; in street:-). <br><br>How the masses would ever know whether gold turns black or not? \ud83d\ude42<br>\ud83d\ude02<br>Because of fear all the uneducated people have kept their gold in banks &amp; are paying rentals for the below(image of a silver ring) in golden colour.\ud83d\ude42 <br><br>What a business? <br><br>In the locker, it is packed away from air and the process of oxidization.

Diamonds lose more value than a brand new car just driven off the lot.<br><br>Unless you have a GOOD inside line on scrap gold material, and inside line on the tools, glass, acids, and safety equipment you WILL lose money. <br><br>The market is spiking to give Trump the finger, which has dropped gold again, but the falsehoods will only last for so long.

One can write a book about\r<br>different hidden and subtle forms of scam connected with these\r<br>offers and how buyers who have fallen prey to these fraud under the\r<br>guise of gold sale from Africa. From all these innumerable\r<br>experiences, we have learned our lessons and have set pre-conditions\r<br>for conducting our buying dealings. \r<br>\r<br>It is our policy that we will\r<br>not visit any African countries to do any transaction of purchase of\r<br>gold nor \r<br>\r<br>- we will pay anything upfront to any seller or meet any cost\r<br>of the seller to deliver the gold at Dubai Airport. \r<br>- We do not issue any form of bank instruments such as BG/SBLC/LC/BCL , sponsor any\r<br>visa for any Seller or issue any E-Tickets to anybody. \r<br>- We do the buying transaction only if the seller delivers the gold at Dubai\r<br>international Airport on CIF terms of delivery.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Genuine and bona fide Seller, who is capable to deliver 100\r<br>kilograms or more and is willing to present through the Seller\u2019s\r<br>bank to the Dubai Bank (EMIRATE NDB) the following verifiable\r<br>documents, namely,\r<br>(a) the Bank endorsed SKR, as proof of holding stock by the Seller\r<br>(b)Documentary evidence of logistics of shipment of the offered gold consignment to Dubai Airport, in the form of\r<br>A letter from any of the international Courier companies based in\r<br>Africa such as BRINKS / FERRARI /G4S, or from Airlines Air-Cargo\r<br>service company at the loading Airport, we are ready-willing-able to\r<br>arrange from EMIRATE Bank the Proof of funds(POF) transmitted to the\r<br>\r<br>Seller bank.\r<br>\r<br>The procedure :\r<br>\r<br>1. Official FCO from the Seller with copy of export permit,\r<br>Passport copy and Bank details\r<br>2. Signing of the contract\r<br>3. Bank endorsed SKR &amp; letter from an internationally known\r<br>Security-Logistic-Handling company undertaking the shipment of\r<br>the Dore Gold bars to Dubai Airport\r<br>4. Shipment of minimum quantity of 100 Kilogram of Dory gold\r<br>5. Our customs clearing company clearing the consignment from\r<br>Dubai Airport customs &amp; security transport to Refinery\r<br>6. Payment after the Assay of the gold to the nominated bank account\r<br>of the Seller The price either to be quoted on LBMA market price, less\r<br>\r<br>An acceptable percentage of discount or at a fixed price. \r<br>The Payment will be done within 3 banking days upon release of the assay\r<br>certification by the Gold refinery.\r<br>\r<br>-2- All cost from the point of delivery at Dubai Airport - customs\r<br>clearance charges , security transport /insurance cost for delivery\r<br>from the Airport to the gold refinery, assaying cost are born by the\r<br>buyer.\r<br>\r<br>In Dubai, we have an excellent base and gold dealing structure. Both\r<br>the Seller and the Buyer are well secured to do the gold transaction\r<br>in Dubai without any form of cheat or scam.\r<br>\r<br>Everybody connected with this trade are well aware of the\r<br>criminality that are associated in this field in Africa. For that\r<br>reason, the gold refineries in Germany and in many European Union\r<br>countries have stopped accepting alluvial gold offers from this very\r<br>unruly and disorganised, non-industrial-small-mining-sector in\r<br>Africa. This source is increasingly used for financing terrorist\r<br>activities in Africa (Northern Mali, North-east Nigeria, Cameroon)\r<br>and also as a source of financing rebel conflicts in DRC and Central\r<br>African Republic. UN/EU/USA have enacted special regulations to\r<br>restrict sale of the so called \u201cblood gold\u201d declaring the alluvial\r<br>gold trade in Africa similar to that of \u201cblood diamonds\u201d trade now\r<br>being monitored by UN through the introduction of Kimberly\r<br>processing certificate. Soon such a certification is going to be\r<br>introduced by EU to restrict trade of so called \u201cblood gold\u201d.\r<br>EU based banks have put strict compliance factors on money\r<br>transaction connected with the gold dealings with Africa.

If you&#39;re looking to make a buck with your body, your best bet would be to sell individual organs, but since that&#39;s illegal, an alternative might be to tan your hide for use as leather. Your skin would be worth about $3.50 if it were sold at the price of a cowhide, which runs around $0.25 per square foot. If you take a dollar&#39;s worth of elements plus the value of your skin, you might be able to get $4.50, which you can round up to $5, so you can feel a bit better about your chemical value.<br><br>If you could harvest every organ and chemical in your body, you could make a $45 million\u00a0.

The Night Journey (Al Isra Wal Miraj) <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azRV6zSEXvo\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azRV6zSEXvo</a> /35.1 Surah An-Naazi,aat. Quran surah (79).<br><br>I recommend you to watch every video start with 1 best. Then decide for yourself what you want to believe in. It doesn&#39;t matter who you are, how old you are, how you look, what race you have, what skin color, your social status, Man or Woman everything doesn&#39;t matter, it doesn&#39;t matter! This message is for everyone for all of humanity, to show you the truth.  It&#39;s up to you if you can accept it. you have your own will and your heart no one controls it. Your decision is for you alone. <br><br> <br>You don&#39;t want to become a Muslim, even after you&#39;ve watched all the videos no problem, you don&#39;t want to watch the videos no problem everyone can live as they want in islam there is no compulsion. but remember i  bring you the truth to save you. on judgment day you will not be able to say no one cleared me up, no one told me the truth i was influenced oh please forgive me, but then it is unfortunately already too late because this life is a Test and it ends with your death. oh Allah forgive us guid us ....<br><br>Important if you have a problem with that things, that i say. blame me not Islam. Islam is perfect i\u00b4m not. If you strugle with the qestion, why i waste my time for this videos or similar, dont lie to your self. you waste already your time. The first thing that the Devil try is to bring you away from the truth to his way.<br>Example you watch films, series, something on TV, play games and other things that pass the time. that bring you fun, but not everything that is fun is good for you. in the end you lose time. so you could think of these videos  from the links as a kind of series, wich is very exciting btw. and watch a video every day as an example, or every week as you like. in the end, even if you can&#39;t do anything with it, you have at least learned something about Islam one of the Bigest Religions in this world and the fast growing.  And you really can&#39;t see that as a waste of time, can you?  Why ? Because knowledge is power.  but remember the Devil and his follower will try everything to keep you away from this knowledge and to distract you with worldly things.<br> if you disagree with what I say and mark it as a lie prove to me that I am lying but pls watch first all videos that saves time.<br><br>Of course you can  make kritik on me, for my bad grammar and English skills. I know that im not good at this,  but i hope i write it in a way, that you can it understand. Thats  the important thing. I know that my brother dont make this mistakes  he is a english,history teacher and make his Doctor and have much more knowledge than me. even at his acts he is better than me.  Maybe he laugh when he se this and see how bad my english is haha i will laugh with him. The point is im not my brother he have also his mistakes,  like me like you and every human being. Muslim, means,the one who submission to the will of allah. Not that you a perfect person. <br>In the eyes of Allah it is important how you behave and decide wath in your heart is, and not your reputation, your knowledge, your appearance, even if you are a King who looks good, who knows a lot and does good. A person who has nothing, doesn&#39;t look good, has little knowledge and does good; can be much higher in the eyes of Allah.<br><br>Example Even if I did not believe in Allah and his Prophet, I would have to admit to myself, after all the knowledge I have acquired about Islam and all the things I have seen and heard, that Islam is the most logical and best way for people , Animals and this world.  Look at this beautiful world, how the animals, trees, all life lives in harmony with this planet and everything around this complex system that clearly comes in harmony and  how balance this exists.  And now look at the people we have Good and Bad , who are using this planet and acting in their favor, all of these bad qualities and not living in harmony. Where&#39;s The Justice, Why are it  The people who don&#39;t belong here and seem out of place. If You Come with a open mind and heart you will see that Islam is the only logical way that gives you the answer. At the End  you can belive in atheism, or evrey other Religion  for me its fine i have also non Muslim Friends and i respect every human i dont want to hurt anyone its your choice no one can force you stay with love ^^. <br><br>Do you accept islam, do not think that you have to change your life completely now everything comes with time inshallah<br><br>Inshallah means, so allah wants, because nothing happens without his wil<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgm3puP3tMA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgm3puP3tMA</a> /The 99 Names of Allah.<br><br>You only need take Shahada in Arabic and your language with full believe to become a Muslim: that is the seed that that you put. With time you give the seed water, thats the way .when you learn something ,thats your water, when you do something good ,thats  your water, when you follow the rules of Islam thats your water, when you pray thats your water,  that you give to the seed.  So your seed grows slowy with this inshallah, you will become a flower. Wath happen when you stop giving water to a flower ? so dont stop :) pray to allah  guide me und you get never lost inshallah.<br><br>F\u00fcr Alle die ein Wenig, oder keine Englisch kenntnisse haben, Google \u00fcbersetzer kl\u00e4rt schon :D <br>k\u00f6nnt nat\u00fcrlich auch Jemanden fragen den ihr kennt das er \u00fcbersetzt, die Frage ist A: Dauert  das l\u00e4nger ? und B: Sagt er mir die Wahrheit ?\u00b4\u00b4", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T03:53:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jethro Mendoza", "comment_text": "I never knew i was going to watch a Chemistry class instead", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T03:05:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex L.", "comment_text": "Trending b*<b>*</b>", "comment_date": "2020-11-05T02:53:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chef Ha", "comment_text": "man just finessed a roley", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T23:22:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xSnips", "comment_text": "This Rolex could be still worth 2-3k glad he didn\u2019t melt it", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T22:06:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oscar", "comment_text": "He sounds like android 17", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T21:35:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anthony Miller", "comment_text": "The water spinnny boi is sick", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T21:23:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabi SNS", "comment_text": "Where does he get all of that stuff from", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T20:44:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tokyobrazy", "comment_text": "How much is that worth??", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T19:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Duncan", "comment_text": "This is worth even more money now, like $5K", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T19:00:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vickie Sanders", "comment_text": "Me: Oh a video making gold bars, pretty simple.<br><br>Me after I watched it: How does he know this stuff?", "comment_date": "2020-11-04T17:27:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MISCHIEF", "comment_text": "Outstanding video.

Too many chemistry teachers and random level amateur chemists (as we can see most of them on youtube) repeat this whitout understanding that it&#39;s not a &quot;complex based&quot; reaction, but a redox reaction.<br><br>Neither NO3- anion nor H+ cation can oxydize Au, because this metal needs more than +1,5V/SHE to be oxydized (highest redox potential of ALL metals). In Aqua Regia, HNO3 and HCl reacts to form atomic chlorine radical Cl* and nitrosyl chloride (NOCl) and this molecule decomposes also readily to NO* and Cl* radicals. It&#39;s this reaction : <br><br>3HCl+HNO3 -&gt; 2Cl*+NOCl+2H2O -&gt; 3Cl*+NO*+2H2O<br><br>Then the formed chlorine radicals attack and oxydize Au metal by being reduced to Cl- in the process : <br><br>3Cl*+Au -&gt; AuCl3 <br><br>This AuCl3 can&#39;t be formed by the direct attack of HCl on Au because HCl contain Cl- anion, not Cl* radical, Cl- anion doesn&#39;t have at all the oxydation properties of Cl* radical. Then AuCl3 fixes a free HCl to form HAuCl4 which is itself a strong acid and completely dissociates to H+ and AuCl4-.<br> <br>This reaction is possible because the chlorine radical Cl* oxydizes Au easily, being a very powerful oxydizer with much higher oxydation potential (around +2,41V/SHE) than Au(+1,5V/SHE). In comparaison, HNO3 has &quot;only&quot; an oxydation potential around +0,8V/SHE  on metals and it&#39;s +0V/SHE for H+ cation [it&#39;s the reason for why HCl or dilute H2SO4, both sources of H+, can oxydize some metals like Al, Zn, Mg, Co, Ni and Fe which have all oxydation potential less than that of H+ (0V/SHE), but the same acids can&#39;t oxydize other metals like Cu, Ag, Hg, Au, Pt, Ir, Pd which have all higher oxydation potential than that of  H+]. <br><br>And this Au oxydation is also possible with KClO3+HCl (potassium chlorate and hydrochloric acid) or NaClO+HCl (sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid) mixture, because the same radical Cl* is produced again (ClO or ClO3 removes the only electron of Cl- to turn it to Cl* radical, like NO3- does the same with Cl-). The same thing happens with NaNO3+HCl or HNO3+NaCl, no need for absolutely 2 acids together. The oxydation of Au by HNO3+HCl is a simple redox reaction, nothing more. And another powerful oxydizer acid, called selenic acid H2SeO4 can also oxydize and dissolve gold. <br><br>The only &quot;complex based&quot; attacks on gold are made by Lugol&#39;s solution (complexation by I3-), cyanide solutions, thiourea solutions and some other complexing compounds.

No currency has ever lasted 50 years they all reach their intrinsic value of 0. And this is in the event that those dollars or the coinage is not made with silver or the paper currency backed by gold, as well as the people&#39;s labour. But anyway this guy has no silver just like the majority did not have silver during hyperinflation. Consequently they lost all their savings because they kept it in the currency. Those that were able to preserve their past labour and savings did it with gold and silver gamma Alyssa has been the case for thousands of years despite the propaganda that you cannot eat gold and silver, this is propaganda created by the Eden eats themselves so that you don&#39;t understand the importance of, all throw thousands of years of History we&#39;ve had periods a very limited food yet there was always the ability to exchange gold and silver for food. Time is of the essence when you consider anything I&#39;m sure during extreme periods of famine people only have food on their minds oh, yeah when these periods ended gold and silver reign supreme once again. thousands of currencies have gone to their intrinsic value of 0 and everyone that held their Savings in that currency lost everything. Central banks are hoarding buying and amassing as much gold as possible. Some countries use silver as a strategic metal to hold for the preservation of their power because ultimately there are soldiers are paid in silver even if they are paid in currencies. Currencies coupons whatever you want to call them they were at times redeemable for the actual physical gold and silver that represented the purchasing power and value of that coupon or currency or dollar did you see why the currency is became so popular, people were fed up of seeing the destruction of the purchasing power of those coupons they held that represented the fruits of their labour oh, it is a kind of stealth tax a hidden tax that continuously erodes the purchasing power of money and all these silly arguments that wages went up so salt purchasing power went down yet we just went up so there was a equilibrium and this is just not true. 25-cent piece purchased a gallon of gas back in the 50s and $0.25 continues to buy you one gallon of gasoline today you asked how is this possible? this is possible if you are holding a 25-cent piece that was made before the mid-1960s because it had about 80% silver in those coins. Do not fall for the hype about silver and that it&#39;s going to shoot through the roof price is going to go so high, it will not it will go up with the increase in cost of living eventually despite the fact that they are suppressing the price of gold and silver at some point they can no longer contain this price control, and silver and gold will be able to purchase products at True Market Value what&#39;s the true price Discovery mechanisms in place the most certainly will become a reality. You must only look as gold and silver as insurance you are not holding the physical form to watch the prices go up and down and hoping that it&#39;s going to shoot through the roof. That is not the point. They will always be a juice especially for silver as it has thousands of industrial and Manufacturing purposes everything from I thought bacterial properties applications to nanotechnology. while there is a limited supply of the silver on the planet there is an endless supply of paper or plastic prints in print or manufacture this currency endlessly until it has no more purchasing power too much of anything reduces its value. If bananas grow like weeds in all types of conditions anywhere then they would have no monetary value as you can simply just go out and pick them as they are plentiful. This examples to demonstrate that even currencies are subject to the laws of supply and demand there&#39;s too much of something and the price and or value goes down not enough of something that is in demand the price generally goes up unless of course those who dictate economic policies use price control mechanisms to try to suppress the price yep in due time true price Discovery mechanisms naturally take effect", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T13:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "llsc and galaxy", "comment_text": "Everyone liked that", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T12:30:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ADEEL HASSAN ADEEL HASSAN", "comment_text": "Today i learned something", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T12:23:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ADEEL HASSAN ADEEL HASSAN", "comment_text": "its good", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T12:22:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eugene Hill", "comment_text": "Can you melt down a cell phone and retrieve the gold?", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T11:37:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PikaGaming / PikaVlogs", "comment_text": "make NileRed the movie", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T11:17:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arjun", "comment_text": "Gold Vijayan ithokke kand padikkunundavum", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T08:09:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Albert Renshaw", "comment_text": "Lol @ the rolex... this stuff was def stolen", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T06:21:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James G", "comment_text": "Walter White over here", "comment_date": "2020-08-05T01:54:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manoj Kumar", "comment_text": "%#$*)\u00a5351", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T23:35:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Travelin JOHN", "comment_text": "nice video. heres a question, i am traveling doing metal detecting and flee market hunt. now the question, if i sent you a bunch of  jewelry and coins or whatever, would you be willing to do this  50/50 split on the resulting bars? yes i know refiners would pay melt or the gold but id rather work a deal with someone to get something of all resulting metels. we could disguss a deal privately. but  i thaught id offer a 50/50 split on all metals, and aybe a bit of cash for your material used", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T19:00:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CPT Sarge", "comment_text": "forbidden  gold cider", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T18:56:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LAPD", "comment_text": "Nobody: exists.<br><br>Him: So then I added some more concentrated hydrochloric acid.", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T18:40:08Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Zach Pierce", "comment_text": "Can we just take a second to realize, this guy just gave him a Rolex and Gold chains to be melted for a YouTube video...", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T18:25:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Val\u00e9ria", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the name of the machine at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37Kn-kIsVu8&amp;t=17m06s\">17:06</a> and what&#39;s that thing that spins in the middle?

I&#39;d like to set forth an idea that is turning around in my brain after watching this video to help boost viewership and subscribers for my channel.   <br><br>I don&#39;t know a thing about chemistry because I was a business school major.  However, I think I can get some buff colored dirt that resembles gold dust, a box of different kinds of food coloring, some beakers and other chemistry set tools, and create a pretty realistic looking knock off of this video for my channel.   A little blue, green, and yellow food coloring mixed into some water and poured over the dirt, then swished around with some mumbo jumbo about dissolving, diluting, condensing, washing, drying, and spin cycling the matrix into gold should be convincing to everyone who watched my faked video except of course the one or two people who actually know how to do this sort of thing.<br><br>At the end of the video, I&#39;ll put a cloth over the beaker, wave a magic swizzle stick around over it, then whip off the cloth to reveal three cute little gold colored bars which I will have carved out of soap and spray painted gold.   I might even do a couple of silver painted ones for effect.   <br><br>I&#39;ll take a bow to the camera, then drink all the food colored water, ie. &quot;acid&quot; and grin to let the audience in on the joke.   I may actually do this so I am inviting all 5.8 million viewers of this video to subscribe to my channel and hit the notification bell so that if I do make a fake video you will be the first to see it.<br><br>Meanwhile, do this poor starving chemist who knows how to extract gold out of scrap junk a favor and help him get to 6 million viewers so he can earn a little revenue from You Tube.   <br><br>I have only one question for my high school guidance counselor.

It&#39;s a shame Kitco&#39;s XRF is off, that wouldn&#39;t fly with me. The reading should be 995 or 996 with the remainder in silver. That&#39;s why 995+ is both the LBMA and Comex standard. The Miller Process is required above that, or electrolytic process. Undoubtedly, you also have gold left in solution. By the calculations you gave and the .5% that Kitco is out, your process is only about 96% efficient unless you recover what is left in solution. Likely less than 96% efficient as you took the dust weight, not the post melt weight. Something that you assumed was plated was also clearly not, I would guess the small chain was 10k. The plated stuff really isn&#39;t worth the process unless you have a kilo or two. Of course if I&#39;m right, that leaves even more left in solution. Hopefully you didn&#39;t dispose of it as there&#39;s probably at least 200 good reasons to run an electric current through the chloroauric acid. At the end of the day, doing all this yourself isn&#39;t worth it.

Gatorade bottles<br>2 Mason jars<br>3-4 ft. of aquarium tubing<br>aquarium air pump (optional)<br>fine coffee filters<br>a funnel<br>75g 100% lye<br>130g 15-0-15 fertilizer (no weed killers)<br>2 96 ct. Pseudophedrine (crushed into fine powder)<br>Coleman lantern fuel<br>1.5g Ice<br>2 AA lithium batteries<br>Iodized Salt<br>Liquid Lightning (drain cleaner)<br>Pipe cutter<br>Needle nose pliers<br>Xacto knife/Scissors<br>The process:<br>Take your 2 gatorade bottles and clean them out using a coat hanger and paper towels, making sure there is no liquid in the bottles. Rinse with a little lantern fuel and repeat. The goal is to get the bottles clean of everything. Once clean, drill 2 holes the width of the aquarium tubing into the cap of one of the bottles and set aside. This will be your \u201csmoke bottle\u201d. Take the other bottle and combine the lye, fertilizer, pseudo, and lantern fuel. Add enough fuel till the mix is to the line aprox. where the top of the label would be. Recap and let this mix sit for 24 hours. Once this is complete, take your pipe cutter and open the 2 lithium batteries, exposing the litium strips inside(they look kinda like tin foil). Cut up these strips into small pieces and add them to your mixture. Then add your 1.5g of ice(just a little bit! 1.5g ice isn\u2019t much). Immediately cap and begin to shake. The water from the ice and the litium will begin to react and you will see it \u201cflaming up\u201d inside the bottle. Don\u2019t freak out and throw the bottle/run from the room etc., as this is natural. Constantly shake your bottle, and take note of the pressure building inside of it. When the bottle becomes hard from the pressure(kinda like a shooken up soda), you will need to burp your bottle. Stop shaking and quickly burp the bottle, making sure your hand is over the cap so it doesn\u2019t fly off from the pressure. Once burped, close and begin shaking again. Repeat this until you notice that it isn\u2019t building pressure anymore(usually around 1 1/2-2 hours). Your liquid should now be clear again like the lantern fuel before you started.<br>Filter this mixture into one of your mason jars, using 3-4 coffee filters and your funnel. Throw away the filtered gunk into your gatorade bottle that you just used. The liquid in your mason jar is good dope, but we need to smoke it now. Take your other gatorade bottle with the 2 holes drilled in the top. Put equal pieces of aquarium tubing into each hole, making sure they fit snug into the holes. Attach one end to your aquarium pump (or you can use good ol\u2019 fashioned lung power, but I disadvise since this stuff is pretty toxic). Now combine your salt and Liquid Lightning(I didn\u2019t give amounts, but you can fill your smoker bottle with 1/4 cup of salt and a couple of drops of the LL). You will notice the mix starting to give off smoke. Cap your bottle and let the smoke build. Once this has happened, either plug in your pump or begin to blow into one tube. The other tube should be sitting in your dope mix. Now here\u2019s a kicker so you don\u2019t have harsh dope\u2026swirl your smoke in your dope for only a sec or two, just until you begin seeing the crystals fall into the bottom(kinda like a snow globe :-P) and then stop! Filter the mix into your other mason jar and throw away filter in first bottle. This introduced the smoke to your mix, and now you can smoke your mix to get the good stuff. Smoke your mix again, but this time continue smoking it until you stop seeing the snow fall. This \u201csnow\u201d is now pure crystal meth. Filter again, but keep this filter, as it contains your dope. Repeat smoking process again to get all the leftover meth out of your mix, and filter it with your \u201cgood\u201d filter. Allow to dry and enjoy! Throw leftover mix into first gatorade bottle, along with used coffee filters. Dispose of discreetly(not in your trash!!!!).<br>P.S. When shaking your bottle, be very carefull not to get distracted and let the bottle just sit. Also, be mindfull of the pressure in the bottle and burp when needed. Failure to do either of these could result in your face getting melted off.", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T04:39:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rich Thill", "comment_text": "Can you make meat glue (transglutaminase) and see if u can make a steak with it?", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T04:38:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CrimFerret", "comment_text": "Doing it by inquarting the gold is actually the best way to do it with karat gold like that jewelry.
