It has been 20 years ago, but I remember it was a &quot;safe&quot; way to see the liberation of hydrogen gas as the sodium metal in the amalgam reacted with the water. The amalgam (HgNa) sank to the bottom of a flask and immediately started bubbling. No sodium left the amalgam until it all converted to hydrogen gas and NaOH. <br><br>I&#39;d like to see that again. I caution you though. I directly added about 10 - 20 grams of sodium directly to mercury and the sodium caught fire as it alloyed with the mercury. I really don&#39;t know why the sodium caught fire when making the amalgam. Perhaps the mercury stripped any (somewhat) protective oxides from the sodium including what it was stored in - kerosene. (The kerosene did not catch fire.) This was outside when it was warm and humid. But once the sodium was alloyed, you could pick it up (with forceps) out of the mercury. I didn&#39;t have it for long (I reacted it all with water) and I wonder what would happen if it was just exposed and left out - no longer needing to be in a waterless, dry liquid like mineral oil or kerosene.<br><br>Do me a favor and bring back that memory. It was very cool to see a very bright silver solid lying on the bottom of a beaker full of water and bubble strongly. Soon, the mercury was back. Albeit in a very basic solution. I&#39;d like to know if the amalgam can be stored in the open air (and not have the sodium oxidize) and if the amalgam makes a more metallic sound when dropped or tapped. I think the amalgam was much more stiff than the original, taffy-like sodium and broke or snapped when bent.<br><br>Would make a great video with just two ingredients.  Great for your element series, too. Also, I want you to make it safely first before I go bother doing it myself again. I want to know how to store it. If it is just going to be a bother and decompose quickly on its own, I am not going to keep it. But if there can be a away to keep mercury and sodium together in a container without the necessity of mineral oil or kerosene; I&#39;d love to know. (And bring back memories. It was so cool seeing super bright mercury bubbling.)
