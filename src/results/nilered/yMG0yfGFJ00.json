I know this was an older post, and I don&#39;t know if you ever came back to this work.  One thing I wanted to point out is that filter paper may not be the best choice for this work.  As you may know, untreated paper fibers should just disintegrate in water very quickly.  This would not be good for a piece of filter paper.  Therefore, I am assuming they treat filter paper with the same chemical that is used to give paper towels their wet strength.  This molecule is called polyamidoepichlorohydrin (PAE) and goes by the tradename Kymene.  It is essentially a Nylon-like polymer with built in reactive crosslinking functionality known as azetidinum groups.  It&#39;s all really cool stuff, BUT if you are trying to make pure di/tri-acetate, then this material would be one of your impurities.  Since it&#39;s essentially a glue, it might have also lead to the cloudiness, but I don&#39;t have enough experience with this process to be sure.  If you try this again, I would go with a different cellulose source.   Paper still usually has traces of lignin in it.  You could go with NSK (northern softwood kraft) paper with a very low kappa number, meaning it was bleached very well.  However, I&#39;m wondering if cotton might be a more pure source of cellulose.  I believe that is what is used in cellulose-based rheology modifiers such as CMC (carboxy methyl cellulose) ...another fascinating thing to explore.

A lot of the cracking seen in the end products in the video I think were due to the disuniform grains and imperfections already created inside the end product; the strength along those grain planes would be so much weaker than the mass product that it could easily fall there. No doubt the impurities were also involved, preventing stronger internal bonding, but I think the mechanical side for these end products contributed more than the chemical side.<br><br>How to do this in practice: could you put it in boiling water or something? (If the test tube is graded to stand that level of heat) Then, if it&#39;s not hot enough, then maybe you can stick in the heat gun. Then at least you have a more uniform heating environment and you can sort of just let it go for a while until the mixture becomes more uniform and the grain boundaries dissolve as it melts, until it resolidifies. Probably time is the key for that again.<br><br>As for spinning plastic at home... maybe just get like a yarn extruder or something? Like a small box with a hole where the entrance region is a large cylinder that tapers into a smaller, thinner nozzle and a motor at the end side pulls the product through and wraps it around itself (you pull it rather than push/extrude it for yarns for better quality, for big things like steel you just push stuff through the extruder). Then, optionally, you could spin it along a couple different motors/cylinders after the pulling motor to keep the shape uniform and store it. Most factories have several iterations of extruder box and motor-pull coils  to get a thin fiber width, since there&#39;s a limit to how much thinner you can make it on each iteration. If you have a motor I think you could jury rig something that would look sometihng like a mini plastic yarn-spinning factory. Could be pretty fun.<br><br><br>(Diagrams online can probably explain it better than I can lol, but point is, I think you could definitely due it with a slow-spinning motor and maybe even a hand-made box with a tapered cylinder hole. Just need to make sure that the hole coating doesn&#39;t stick to the plastic you&#39;re pulling through and your taper isn&#39;t too too big.)<br><br>And really, awesome video.

Now, pumping air is dangerous at the volume of that container and it&#39;s going to explode. Hence the very basic or easiest way is to just juggle the liquid between to containers by pouring it in one container, and pouring it out to another and so on.

You should make 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline from phenylethylamine via pictet-Spengler reaction. I find it really interesting and has a bit of nostalgic history behind it for me.<br><br>One time during my career making pharmaceuticals a research company once asked me to make for them anhalinine and also another chemical which I named N-methyl-anhalinine so they could do testing on any possible medicinal uses for it. I didn&#39;t ask them the results of the studies, I imagine they would be too psychoactive and have too high of an abuse risk for them to use successfully as a medicine. I thought this was my oddest job I&#39;ve ever done though because the starting material I had to use was Mescaline, so I non-nonchalantly had hundreds of grams of mescaline in the lab. It was really queer, and anxiety enducing to have it. I thought the laboratory would get robbed everynight I was working on it.<br><br>Anyways I hope you see this comment and that you give this a try. I said to try and make the 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline from phenylethylamine because obviously if you made anhalinine from mescaline it would be taken down and you possibly could get arrested or fined.
