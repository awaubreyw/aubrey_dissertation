This will not only insure our future.\u00a0 It will create millions of new jobs and bring in a new era of technical jobs that pay.<br>The time has come to take the drugs off the street.\u00a0 There&#39;s no reason for children to be subjected to things like drugs. In this day and age they have enough on their plate. It is it&#39;s time we help people that have a drug problem. We can&#39;t keep filling the jails with our mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts and uncles.

The days of paying income tax on your hard work or over. The wages of yesterday will not support the needs of today therefore you will be earning a fair wage that will support you and your family. <br>I will impose a flat tax on everything we buy. Excluding food and food products. <br>I will take the federal government out of play on the issue with marijuana.\u00a0 I will ask that all states legalize and tax it appropriately.\u00a0 At the same time giving an average individual the chance to own and operate a dispensary. The days of a few Monopolizing an industry are over. <br>I intend to turn every home in America into it&#39;s own power plant.<br>Giving every American a chance to have a little more.\u00a0 <br>It&#39;s time that we take control of our government.\u00a0 I intend to cut government by half.\u00a0 There is no need to to employ lazy criminals/politicians.\u00a0 American&#39;s have to work everyday. Therefore so should the politicians we employ.\u00a0 <br>As for the bad men of the world you are done. There will be no more terrorizing people. Anywhere. My first day in office I will BRING freedom to a war torn word. War will end and the killing will stop. There will be WORLD peace. ......................... VOTE for The AMERICAN PARTY. ...
