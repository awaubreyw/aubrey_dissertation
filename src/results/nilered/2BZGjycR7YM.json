But i would, LOVE it, if you could do one, on how to extract penicillin,  from bread mold, and or how to make it. Im not a little kid, im a 55 year old man, with children.  So keep up the good work. I know it takes money and time to make these videos,  but if you can, take my request , i would be more than happy to donate.

The spontaneous decomposition of it hints at an equilibrium reaction occurring with the sulfuric.

Since you spent several thousand dollars on the Aerogel project, I thought it was worth mentioning since this purchase could be used on multiple project. Plus I just want to see more use of that camera. The Chronos 2.1 version can get up to 1080p resolution at 1,000 fps, and higher fps at lower resolution. I feel like a lot of people don\u2019t know about Chronos cameras as a relatively low cost, relatively high-speed option, so I wanted to make sure you were aware of them. \ud83d\ude42", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T11:19:57Z", "likes_count": 71}, {"comment_by": "Meli Draws", "comment_text": "&quot;This chemical really doesn&#39;t want to exist&quot;<br>Honestly?<br>Same", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T10:37:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Something 88", "comment_text": "Dont make short vids i love the huge ones, your vids are soooooo interesting \ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T09:46:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mystery", "comment_text": "Wow just like my parents relationship<br><br>I dosen&#39;t want to exist", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T09:01:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Miranda", "comment_text": "Cool spells bro", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T08:29:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ryan christopherson", "comment_text": "Manganese Heptoxide : I decompose effortlessly<br><br><br>Azidoazide Azide : Hold my beer", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T06:37:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xander LastName", "comment_text": "shrodingers chemical <br><br>I can&#39;t spell shrodingers <br>m8 you know what I mean", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T05:56:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chase Lemens", "comment_text": "It seems weird to me that the rocket fuel would react hotter and less explosively as I would think that heat would just be lost energy that could have been propulsion as in the others.

This seemed far too interesting for me to not look up and upon doing so I realized I should come back to this video. From what I understood it seems that the experiments that first brought the existence of supercritical fluids to light were stumbled upon in the context of sound and how different fluids made inconsistent sounds in the context of canon fire. Perhaps when you were getting those vastly different sounds it had something to do with supercritical fluids being created by the exposure of heat from the reaction and  the pressure differential of an explosion?
