My job was simple...every hour I was to call in to the control center to report all is well topside with a loaded tanker trailer, filled with oxidizer(if in fact all was well ie: no leaks). Watching this video really drives home the idea that the Air Force was using me (and other young Airmen) as a sort of canary in the coal mine? I am so thankful to God that I never got hurt while in the Air Force. BTW in case your wondering, I was in the ELAB shop at McConnell AFB as a technician in the service of the Air Force. Normally my job was to maintain the electricals on the Titan II missiles and associated ground equipment.

You could do a whole video on how different materials actually stop corroding in the presence of stronger and/or more concentrated acids, oxidizers, etc. even though that seems counterintuitive.  And I don&#39;t see any videos on Youtube that actually explore passivation chemistry in detail.<br><br>Here&#39;s an example you might consider using from us chemical engineers that&#39;s rather important in industry.  A very common process from removing H2S and/or CO2 from gas streams is absorption with an amine such as MEA, DEA, or MDEA mixed with water.  Amine plants are full of places with corrosion potential.  You would probably expect H2S to be the bigger corrosion threat in the absorption column, but that&#39;s not actually true.  It&#39;s usually CO2.  Both of them react with the iron in the column which corrodes the steel.  However, the iron sulfide layer formed from the H2S forms much quicker and adheres much more strongly than the FeCO3 layer from CO2.  And once a solid FeS layer is formed, it actually protects the steel from further corrosion.  So for H2S, we actually DESIGN the column to corrode and form that passivating FeS layer to PROTECT against further corrosion.  With CO2, you have to take a completely different approach, because FeCO3 just continuously sloughs off, and you can lose a column much faster in the presence of CO2 because of that.
