To answer your question about its resistance to being melted, you&#39;ll have to stop thinking in terms of chemistry and get more into physics. Some folks here are close but not quite. <br><br>The microstructures of the lead and zinc compounds are arranged in such a way as to form something akin to a coal miner&#39;s lamp. They use a tightly woven cage to contain a flame to provide light but doesn&#39;t ignite the surrounding air that would sometimes be filled with coal dust and other flammable particulates. This design is what&#39;s used to form the flameholder in a jet engine and the bottom surface of the space shuttles.<br><br>These work by having any heat directed to  them drawn away from any part of the cage to another cooler part that&#39;s larger in area. This allows for a dissipation of heat that is faster than the rate of heating at that particular point. And while there are limits to this bleeding of heat, this effect does keep the material cool enough not to melt while tanking lots of heat to the point of radiating light. In fact, NASA has a video that shows a very similar lighting pattern with the stuff they use for the space shuttle. <br><br>As for why it loses that resistance after the zinc is gone, the structure has changed to the point that heat can&#39;t flow as easily so dissipation gives way to absorption. Whatever matrix that was formed , it had to have been either highly crystalline or at least dentrite-like in nature. That&#39;s the only way any of it would work. <br><br>Hoped all this helps.

(This is probably going to be written off as crazy talk but oh well) So for simplicity, basically I have &quot;memories&quot; (lack of better terms) of multiple lifetimes across time and space (so yea, hence the crazy talk comment). But in essence, what you have done is basically making a substance which according to my personal experience (well... At least memories of that experience) have discovered a substance which shouldn&#39;t be existing via the means made, now granted I am not discussing the actual material or substance which should be made due to me trying to avoid chemistry issues of timeline (Given that to my knowledge the one I know is meant to be discovered in a few years, also I don&#39;t know the name in this language, heck for all I know <b>this</b> may be the origin of it). But I would suggest to try and place the &quot;Lead Sponge&quot; into a mixture of nitrous oxide which is dissolved into a mixture of (I believe, having to based this off memorized elements from the place I know it and this current version of the periodic table, which isn&#39;t exact due to some discoveries in the future) water, carbon, magnesium, and gold. This full mixture should be around the same volume as the &quot;Sponge&quot; if this is the substance, which I am assuming it is, the &quot;sponge&quot; should turn a green color when drying in the open air. I believe that I got the correct elements, and yes I am aware that this mixture is going to be a major pain. WARNING: If you go and do this I should be clear about the fumes and heat involved. The substance I am aware of when placed in this mixture will be getting to about 400 C (Speed is variable). Some of the fumes involved are obvious but I believe that there&#39;s a side product fume made which isn&#39;t currently known and is dangerous, but a fume hut (I forgot spelling for the thing) should work. Being outside, might be preferred but I also believe the fumes will float around the substance without a breeze. This is about all I got. Thanks for reading, no need for credit if this is made into a video or something.

But I used to work in a hot dip galvanize plant. We use zinc and lead heated at I believe 984 degrees. With a few secret ingredients. (Gold powder and silver powder) used nitrogen to clean sides. Anyways. I was explained that with proper mixture it causes the galvanization process. Basically with proper treatment of metal (hydrochloric acid) it binds to metal. It creates a bond. The hot dip once cooled. You actually can sometimes see the crystal patterns in the galvanize plating. They are beautiful. But galvanize is weird. It becomes part crystal and metal. Once the process is done. Not even welding will melt it. It will explode and create dangerous zinc/lead oxide gas though. Basically think like asbestos on micro lvl. What you made was Basically a version of galvanize oxide. It has all the correct colors and properties. It looks exactly like the junk I had to scrape off the hot dip tank. It&#39;s grey. Doesn&#39;t melt. You created a crystaline waste product that most hot dip companies will give you for free. To test my theory. Try it out. But you might have to go to Zack Steel in St Paul MN. It used to be off St Anthony Blvd. I used to work there as maintenance person. The plant was founded in the 40s so it was grandfather  caused. That&#39;s why they still used zinc/lead instead of zinc/tin. The amount of lead is only around 2 percent. But I always felt bad for my co workers grinding. Always got on theim for not wearing masks. I myself started wearing a FRICKING gas mask rated to protect me. Yeah they had a supervisor start a fight with me. I still to this day wish I dropped him in the hot dip. See these people hire people that don&#39;t have enough education to understand the dangers of prolong exposure to zinc and don&#39;t tell theim there&#39;s lead in the hot dip. So I was educating theim to wear masks at minimum. Even buying theim for the employees. That and other things. I kept a locker in the back stocked with food, masks, protective gear and heat pods. I cared. My employer. Yeah.. lol. No. Remind you. Most labors were immigrants and fellons. My employer deemed they weren&#39;t worth taking care of. As he had plenty to replace the ones who got sick. I do miss that place in a way. I welded, built and created some amazing things. I also rebuild almost every grinder there so employees had safe and reliable tools. I also learned how to work and fix forklifts. Also brought a 20 ton rail craine back to life. It was dead for 20 years. Had to actually build some parts and change some things. But yeah. Had a guy named Gary tell me he had been working there for 45yrs and never had a maintenance person like me. I didn&#39;t just fix things nobody could, not even professionals, but I also took time to take care of the people I work with. He told me this after I fixed his punch press. His punch press hadn&#39;t been working correctly in about 13 yrs. They had it rebuilt like 7 times. Never would work correctly. You would push peddle to activate it. Then it would just go. And go.  Like 5 or 20 times. I never rebuilt a press before. But I figured it out and where the problem was. I seriously almost took the whole machine apart. Then I found the problem. Welded new metal. Ground it to shape. Sanded it smooth. And vala. Working like brand new. I miss being able to do things like that.

I noticed when you were filming the various melting tests that once a decent amount of lead oxide started to form on the outside of the sponges, the flames developed a purple color, at least to some degree. The first test was definitely the most pronounced, but I believe I saw small traces of purple show up in the flames during the other melt tests once lead oxide started forming on the sponge.<br><br><br>2. The gases in the flames from the burner you were using had some kind of direct chemical reaction with the sponges, leading to other compounds being formed/burned off during combustion.

It seems plausible that the heated portions might reach a temperature that allows the metal to burn, especially since the portions of the sponge not directly heated are not cooling the sponge.

The first might be whatever causing the reaction when in air causing either a structural or chemical change in the sponge.

You might wish to air-dry the sponge under nitrogen gas; this would exclude both the potential structural and chemical changes, leaving only the &quot;water not properly reentering&quot; interpretation.<br><br>Regarding drying under a vacuum: a rapid recompression would probably cause the water pressure to rapidly compress and hence damage the sponge; perhaps a more slow recompression might better preserve the sponge.

Why does the acid treated pre-dried sponge have such a low meltion point? It appears to melt even easier than elemental lead.  Lead Dioxide Melting Point: 290 \u00b0C (554 \u00b0F) &lt;---Lower melting point than lead.<br><br>Lead<br>Melting Point: 327.46 \u00b0C (\u200b621.43 \u00b0F)<br><br>Lead (II) Oxide<br>Melting Point: 888 \u00b0C (1,630 \u00b0F)<br><br>2.) Where did the purple flame come from in the first couple tests?  Band gap energy / intervalence charge transfer between specific lead and zinc ion valence states.  (Ti IV and Fe II ions exhibit this behavior in sapphire as the intervalence charge transfer shifts Ti Ti IV to Ti III, and Fe II to Fe III.)  This produces a characteristic absorption in the electromagnetic spectrum.<br><br><br>3.) Why doesn&#39;t the fresh lead and zinc sponge melt, and instead light on fire?  Zinc and lead have a high affinity for each other and easily form an alloy that is difficult to separate without high temperatures.  (see the Imperial Smelting Process)<br><br><br>4.) Why does treating it with acid allow it to melt?  Does the zinc have some sort of role to play in this?  Superficially it does as the acid penetration does leach out a fair amount of zinc, but the zinc and lead are still alloyed together since total dissolution at high temperatures did not take place.<br><br><br>5.) Putting it back into water doesn&#39;t seem to make it soft again, so what is going on?  The oxides form a less malleable / more rigid structure engulfing the entire sponge surface of the alloy.  Since the zinc and lead are not in stoichiometric proportions in solution, there is an abundance of lead which allows it to initially be soft/malleable.  Once dried, the oxides form a passivation layer and at the elemental/molecular level the lead and zinc have also had more time to form it&#39;s own crystalline structure as an alloy.<br><br><br>6.) Why does the drying process seem to be irreversible, even when oxygen and CO2 are excluded?  It&#39;s incredibly difficult to separate the zinc from the lead due to the affinity for each other, so it&#39;s still an alloy of the two elements.  If you bring it to a high enough temperature in an oxygen free / inert atmosphere, then you can vaporize the zinc leaving almost pure lead behind.  This is the reason borax flux works to purify elemental lead so well.<br><br>7.) Did it change structurally as it dried, or was the water just not able to get back in or something.  The oxides form a crystalline layer covering the elemental and/or alloy of the zinc and lead so water shouldn&#39;t have any effect once reintroduced.  Zinc is a lot more reactive than lead, but since they readily form an alloy, the molecular structure is a variable mix of the lead and zinc alloys as well as the oxides.", "comment_date": "2018-04-16T17:00:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "12thealchemist", "comment_text": "+Nuovoswiss has very good answers to your questions.

The first being with zinc and I got the same results on part of it under the blow torch.  I then used boric acid and covered the remaining dried sponge.  The boric acid is used as a flux to protect the lead from oxidizing from heating, and it also allows other contaminates to leach out of the molten lead.  The zinc ions and some lead gets into the flux and will form yellow and orange colored oxides in some of the bubbles on the flux/slag.<br><br>Once cooled you can break the flux away from the lead ingot.  The next time you melt the lead, very little oxide will form on the surface and is virtually zinc free.<br><br>The other method I used to form a tree of Saturn was strictly with electrolysis, forming lead dendrites on the carbon cathode.  It was just as amazing, if not more, than the zinc method.  The advantage is that there is no zinc contamination, so just use boric acid or just borax as a flux and you&#39;ll lose very little lead through oxidation.  The flux breaks free from pounding the lead bead on an anvil/flat chunk of metal and a hammer.  You can recover very close to a theoretical 100% yield.

The sponge is covered with an oxide layer. What little metal there is clings to this and cannot form large metal droplets. This also acts to insulate the rest of the sponge. You can see a similar effect with slag, especially lead slag and the spongy lead you get in some car batteries. In fact I&#39;ve found about the only way I can get lead out of such slag is to reduce the oxide in some way, and it can be remarkable how much metal gets irretrievably bound up in it. (Worse though is aluminum slag, at least in my experience, maybe because the metal is less dense.)<br><br>2.) The yellow\\orange flame I an get, either carbon or sodium which are EVERYWHERE. The purple naively looks like potassium, but that makes no sense. Maybe some weird molecular species?<br><br>3.) WATER. Dear LORD water. Have you ever dropped water onto hot zinc powder? Boom! Aluminum too. That stuff is hydric acid and packed a LOT more densely than atmospheric oxygen. Just try heat wet zinc powder as a comparison. That sort of stuff is dangerous.<br><br>4.) My guess here would be that the acid strips away the oxide layer; if an acid treated sponge were again toaster dried, how would that react? Is the change permanent or does some time standing in air negate this? The sponge is evidently VERY reactive if it can start steaming in air.<br><br>5.) The strands of metal are getting tangled. You&#39;ll see this with a lot of plastics such as PVA; they&#39;ll start out dispersed in water (Or another solvent) but will get hard on drying as the strands pull together and tangle. Then adding water doesn&#39;t reverse the change since the structure itself has altered. You might try hot water but I doubt that will have much effect either.<br><br>6.) The drying process seems to take some time, and the sponge again is VERY reactive. What happens when you use a solvent like alcohol to displace the water then dry THAT?That should minimize the time the metal will be able to react with water and oxygen.<br><br>7.) Answered above.

It is composed of very small particles held togheter by friction forces (like you said in the video), but IMO the water is trapped between these particles when they are formed, acting like a lubricant which reduce the friction, so the particles can move relative to each other. As we know, if the particles forming a body can move realtive to each other, that body is malleable.

This change in metal composition results in a change in melting point and the formation of a eutectic (tl;dr alloys have lower melting points sometimes, kind of like azeotropes in distillation).<br><br>2) Potassium impurities are the simplest explanation, but I have no clue. It may be a result of the metals giving off a combination of different flame colors.<br><br>3) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iqb_tXO-YGg&amp;t=14m50s\">14:50</a> The porous sponge is less thermally conductive because of the formation of convection currents within the air pockets of the sponge, so it didn&#39;t melt but instead reacted with heat (this is the basis on why aerogel and styrofoam are such good thermal insulators). The air bubbles were isolated from each other because this time the sponge was not treated with acid (allowing the currents to form and insulate, unlike in the other runs), and because it had not dried there was still fresh lead that was not covered in an oxide coating. This combination of high surface area and fresh exposed lead is also what lead to its rapid oxidation, as shown by the sparking and brilliant flame released.<br><br>4) Treatment with acid dissolves the oxide coating, which prevents the metal from melting by being a thermal insulator and having a high melting point as an ionic salt.<br><br>5) When the sponge is exposed to air, its high surface area causes its oxidation to be faster than normal, so an oxide forms such that the water cannot penetrate the oxide to &quot;soften&quot; the sponge again.<br><br>6+7) It might be like you said, the water cannot re-enter the small spaces in the sponge once it is dried. For example, water is trapped between the metals as the sponge is formed, but it&#39;s not thermodynamically favorable but rather a &quot;kinetic product&quot; of the reaction. Thus its &quot;hydration&quot; is irreversible. As for why it is softer when wet, that seems to be more of a materials science problem, but I suspect it was something to do with water separating the strands of metals, such that when the water is removed the strands just rub against each other and crack under friction.<br><br>This was a really neat video, and it reminds me why I&#39;m majoring in chemistry next year.
