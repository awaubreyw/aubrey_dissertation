Thanks to you, chemistry is now a subject I am most interested in, as it seems being able to do this and make chemicals from these liquids make me look ahead of my future and I would be sad once you pass because I won\u2019t have anyone to inspire and lead me into chemistry and guiding me. Overall, you remind me of my dad, who is great at explaining science and chemistry. <br>Thank you again, <br>SimplyDaisy", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T10:44:07Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "geoff3610", "comment_text": "Ngl, the garage wall is actually a very cool looking background", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T09:42:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J O", "comment_text": "In the most calm way possible, he sounded serious when he said no nuclear weapons.", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T08:47:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wonseok Song", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIfIZqXaR0g&amp;t=5m30s\">5:30</a> is that a Cybertruck?", "comment_date": "2021-09-27T08:09:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kowboy USA", "comment_text": "&quot;Homesickness for the gutter.&quot; -- Emile Augier \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2021-09-26T22:17:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yxng Zeus", "comment_text": "Your parents are so sweet!

Bromine displaces hydrogen from saturated hydrocarbons and adds to unsaturated hydrocarbons, though not as readily as chlorine does.<br><br>The most stable oxidation state of the element is \u22121, in which bromine occurs naturally. But oxidation states of 0 (elemental bromine, Br2), +1 (hypobromite, BrO\u2212), +3 (bromite, BrO\u22122), +5 (bromate, BrO\u22123), and +7 (perbromate, BrO\u22124) are also known. The first ionization energy of bromine is high, and compounds containing bromine in positive oxidation numbers are stabilized by appropriate ligands, mainly oxygen and fluorine. Compounds with the oxidation numbers +1, +3, +4, +5, and +7 all contain covalent bonds.<br><br>Production And Use<br><br>The chief commercial source of bromine is ocean water, from which the element is extracted by means of chemical displacement (oxidation) by chlorine in the presence of sulfuric acid through the reaction<br>Equation.<br>The product of the reaction is a dilute solution of bromine, from which the element is removed by blowing air through it. The free bromine is then mixed with sulfur dioxide, and the mixed gases are passed up a tower down which water is trickling. The following reaction takes place in the tower:<br><br> Equation.<br><br>resulting in a mixture of acids that is much richer in bromide ion than seawater. A second treatment with chlorine liberates bromine, which is freed from chlorine and purified by passage over moist iron filings.<br><br>Commercial bromine generally contains up to 0.3 percent chlorine. It is usually stored in glass bottles or in barrels coated with lead or Monel metal.<br><br>The industrial usage of bromine had been dominated by the compound ethylene bromide (C2H4Br2), which once was added to gasoline with tetraethyl lead to prevent deposition of lead in the engine. Since the renunciation of leaded gasoline, bromine compounds have mainly been used in flame retardants, but ethylene bromide is still an important compound because of its use to destroy nematodes and other pests in soils. Bromine is also used in the production of catalysts, such as aluminum bromide.<br><br>Bromine has other uses. , as in making various dyes and the compounds tetrabromoethane (C2H2Br4) and bromoform (CHBr3), which are used as liquids in gauges because of their high specific gravity. Until the development of barbiturates in the early 20th century, bromides of potassium, sodium, calcium, strontium, lithium, and ammonium were used widely in medicine because of their sedative action. Silver bromide (AgBr), an important component of photographic film, is, like silver chloride and iodide, light sensitive. Traces of potassium bromate (KBrO3) are added to wheat flour to improve baking. Other bromine compounds of significance include hydrogen bromide (HBr), a colourless gas used as a reducing agent and a catalyst in organic reactions. A solution of the gas in water is called hydrobromic acid, a strong acid that resembles hydrochloric acid in its activity toward metals and their oxides and hydroxides.<br><br>Analysis<br><br>A sensitive test for bromine is the reaction with fluorescein to give a deep red colour caused by bromination of the organic molecule, or by its reaction with fuchsine dyes in the presence of sulfurous acid, to give a deep blue colour. A more common test involves heating the sample with dilute sulfuric acid in the presence of potassium dichromate; the bromine is then extracted with chloroform, and, upon addition of potassium iodide, the pink colour of iodine appears. The presence of bromine may also be recognized by the evolution of hydrogen bromide containing some brown bromine vapour when a solid sample is treated with concentrated sulfuric acid. Alternatively, chlorine may be added to an aqueous solution of a sample containing bromide, causing development of a brown colour (free bromine)", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T20:42:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asa Bould", "comment_text": "So when he was pouring the bromine vapour at the end he&#39;s actually losing bromine?", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T20:18:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "filthy_peasant_the_one 2", "comment_text": "ok, now make meth", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T19:45:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hFilms", "comment_text": "Why are you so against froot loops?", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T18:49:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "I drink your milkshake", "comment_text": "Dangerous game", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T18:39:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hFilms", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIfIZqXaR0g&amp;t=20m39s\">20:39</a> bromine germany", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T18:38:11Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Holy Wobbles", "comment_text": "From a Firefighters standpoint this is fucking terrifying.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T18:04:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noah W", "comment_text": "My favorite science teacher", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T18:02:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Afonso Jos\u00e9", "comment_text": "the smashed tabletes look like cocaine", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T17:49:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ud835\ude70\ud835\ude99\ud835\ude91\ud835\ude8e\ud835\ude95\ud835\ude92\ud835\ude8a", "comment_text": "Nile it&#39;s been 3 months, I&#39;m so excited for your next video :]", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T17:38:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GalaxyDoesStuff", "comment_text": "Does anyone else realise what my dude goes through to give us content?

Disclaimer: This is still a terrible idea, and it gives you double the risk of dying. (Not actually. Still super dangerous, though.)<br>I just realized after watching the video almost 2 months after I initially watched it that the method used is exactly the same as one I &quot;created&quot; to make bromine with similar chemicals. Also, I forgot that I had hypobromous acid, not hydrobromic acid. (I of course didn&#39;t attempt anything because I kept forgetting to even write a spreadsheet on the reaction so I didn&#39;t know the essential components.)<br>You can also make bromine by making hypobromous acid, which is made by mixing aqeous solutions of both sodium hypochlorite and hydrogen bromide together, which will produce sodium chloride and hypobromous acid. The hypobromous acid can be isolated via boiling on low heat, and the sodium chloride will not vaporize. The water that will partly vaporize is not an issue, as you next should mix the hypobromous acid with water. Unfortunately, it is unclear weather it is a solid, liquid, or gas at room temperature, but due to what causes it&#39;s instability, it is likely a gas, so mixing it will water is for safer storage. Simply add water ice and wait for it to melt. Repeat until there is very much a lack of vapor forming. Now, it will simply slowly decompose from ultraviolet light. This will produce bromine. It is a (NOT extremely) slow, but worthwhile process, which can achieve significant production of bromine on an industrial scale.", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T01:25:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tom", "comment_text": "&quot;Bromine- It&#39;s one of my favorite elements.&quot;<br>Don&#39;t let the UN hear you say that, xD", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T23:43:56Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "MARBLE HELIOS", "comment_text": "he and micheal reeves need to collab", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T22:43:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "piyush kalyani", "comment_text": "Soon he will be making meth in van\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T19:04:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "rusiru Sathkalana", "comment_text": "love it when he go<br>&quot;oh no..&quot;<br>&quot;but anyway&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T15:22:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Esoteria", "comment_text": "<b>*cries*</b>", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T15:10:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Girisankar Suresh", "comment_text": "New video?", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T14:49:51Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "LilThiCKPanda", "comment_text": "i think nilw is moving,he didnt post for months", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T12:28:40Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Tayeba kafil", "comment_text": "Who hear doesn\u2019t understand him but still likes to watch him \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2021-04-04T05:14:01Z", "likes_count": 22}, {"comment_by": "corporalchaos666", "comment_text": "It&#39;s sad when he&#39;s too young to say &quot;stop Hammer Time&quot; when breaking the tablets...

I especially enjoy coding assembly for the 8052, which is a microcontroller from the 1980&#39;s. I also dabble in 8086 assembly, which is an Intel CPU again from the 80&#39;s. And of course, I like to dabble in 6502 assembly, which is the CPU that powered the original Nintendo, the Commodore 64 and many other iconic pieces of technology. I also like to play around in a 64 bit port of QBasic, which was a variant of BASIC again from the 80&#39;s, or early 90&#39;s.<br><br>I could use an Arduino or C++ or something similar that&#39;s been kept up to date over the years.

Now, this is actually one of my strongest understandings of chemistry, as I used to work as a service tech in the pool industry for many years. We dealt with a lot of these chemicals and reactions. Now, I agree, this man has enough knowledge of chemistry, I have enough knowledge of this chemistry from years of experience in the trade. But I must echo the &quot;DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME!!!&quot; part. Here is the ugly of it. <br><br>Pool chemicals can be extremely violent and volatile if &quot;fooled around with&quot; improperly. When I first started, we had some guys that would screw off on the job. One day, while cleaning the shop, they mixed two types of shock together, and closed the bucket. It was loaded on the truck, the next morning, I opened the lid, and leaned over the tailgate to see how much I had before leaving. no sooner did I lean over, my vision went black and my eyes watered, I began coughing, and couldnt for the life of me take a breath. I was convinced I was dying. someone came up and sprayed water in my face and I gasped, taking sips, and finally was able to breathe. It began smoking in the container. To this day, I have a cough that won&#39;t go away. My brother, being a new homeowner with a pool, ran out of trichlor tabs, so instead, put powdered chlorine in the auto chlorinator, no sooner did he seal the cap on and turn his back, the slow trickle of water coming in had activated the chlorine and BAM! blew the vessel apart in every direction around the yard along with heavily chlorinated water, and plastic shrapnel gave him a pretty decent gash down his side. He got lucky. I have walked into equipment rooms where a new cleaning guy forgot to open a valve on a chlorinator when he was done reloading and I had to clear people out of the area, because the heat and pressure stretched and ballooned the chlorinator to three times its normal size. <br><br>These chemicals can severely injure, disfigure, or KILL you or others around if you don&#39;t know what you are doing.", "comment_date": "2021-02-02T08:18:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "kinetikx", "comment_text": "You&#39;re trying to be punk rock with that whole line of reasoning at the top of this video. <br><br>Keep doing that. <br><br>Stop doing &quot;collab&quot; videos with people like William Osman. <br><br>While I really like Williams videos on their own- they aren&#39;t remotely like the things you used to do.

Or something like your uranium glass stuff was also great because the end product glows or absorbs energy. In saying that, most chemically exciting processes use clear or white liquids, powders and produce mostly clear gasses.<br>Bearing the above in mind, are their any chemically interesting processes that can be set up and done over a long period of time that with the help of a time lapse camera can also have a visually interesting effect? Long time I&#39;m thinking of weeks or months. Similar to grass growth, and chemicals that make the grass change colour.<br>Overall you timelapse stuff is amazing and probably some of my favorite stuff you&#39;ve done.

I&#39;ve no intention to ever make any, just watch out of curiosity.  I&#39;ve heard of bromine, but the only use I can think of is &#39;brominated vegetable oil&#39; which is one of the ingredients in Mountain Dew.  Your parents are FANTASTIC parents, by the way.  Too many parents approach their task of parenting as &#39;I have to protect my kid from all dangerous things&#39;.  They completely neglect their actual duty to PARENT the kid and encourage them in becoming a capable independent adult.  Your dads approach of &#39;if you were a musician, you&#39;d be playing music, if a football play you&#39;d be exercising, etc&#39; is quite right!  I am a software engineer and during my teen years, I wasn&#39;t working on chemistry, I was working on and playing with and exploring creating software.  You asked your mom &#39;what if I was just overly confident in my abilities?&#39; but I think that&#39;s where them knowing you as a person nearly as well as you know yourself comes in.  Parents know whether their kid has a tendency to either over or underestimate their own capacities, whether they are careful or reckless, and stuff like that by the time the kid is 10 probably.  Being careful, modest, reasonable, etc are pretty fundamental personality traits and they don&#39;t just get isolated to one area in a persons life.

I was pretty hungry at the time, and I know they have some good burgers, so I thought it was worth a shot. When I arrived I went to the drive through, but it turned out it wasn&#39;t actually open. This was because when I went, I didn&#39;t realise that they only open up drive throughs during the day. And because it was late at night, I would have to go order from the counter. Anyway, I continued with my plan to get some food, and I told the person my order. I ordered a milkshake with fries and a hamburger, payed for it, and then waited for them to make the meal. When I got it, I checked the content of the bag, and at first glance it appeared everything was in order. But in actual fact, this was a complete mess up. The order that I had received wasn&#39;t what I had ordered. And although it had the milkshake I wanted, it didn&#39;t contain the burger that I was hoping to get. I&#39;m not entirely sure how this happened, but I think it&#39;s because of how the ticket order system burger king has in place. When they make the order they shout out a number, that was assigned to you on your receipt. My number was </i><i><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%230372\">#0372</a></i><i> but when they shouted out the number they said 372. Leaving out the 0 at the start. So someone probably took my order instead and I took theirs by accident. If anyone knows anything more about this, please comment down below. Anyway, in the end I got a 100% yield.
