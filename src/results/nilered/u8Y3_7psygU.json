For instance, we know that the electrolysis of pure water produces an acidic environment at the anode and a basic solution at the cathode; so I was wondering if one could use an apperatus consisting of 2 non-conductive containers, each containing an unreactive electrode, which are connected through a relatively narrow, non-conductive tube that has a non-conductive shut-off valve at the center. Then one could simply ramp up the voltage to compensate for the developing overpotential and once the power supply reaches its limit, you could then close the valve, discard the basic catholyte and replace it with either some new, pure water (or perhaps even with half of the acidic anolyte solution)and finally open the valve again and repeat the procedure...

About 25 years ago I came across a bottle of slightly viscous fluid from an old paper manufacturer. It smells kind of strong but not unpleasant, its clear in colour and it bleaches skin like hydrogen peroxide. There is no label on the bottle and I only have about 50ml of it. I kept it just to find out what it is, sometime in the future, but I never did. I can send you a sample and your task is to find out what it is. I can also include another chemical in powder form that also is missing its label. I think it is hydrokinon but i&#39;m not sure.", "comment_date": "2017-01-29T18:56:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "piranha031091", "comment_text": "I wonder, could you do the opposite and make acetylsalicylic acid from acetaminophen?<br><br>I guess removing that NH and placing a carboxylate group on that benzene ring might be quite a challenge.", "comment_date": "2017-01-29T18:56:35Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Adam Mazurek", "comment_text": "Nitrous oxide or Q&amp;A :D", "comment_date": "2017-01-29T18:54:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Si da sci guy inc", "comment_text": "very well done!", "comment_date": "2017-01-29T18:54:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Denaro", "comment_text": "Would love to see the caffeine total synthesis!
