I love your content and it&#39;s as calming as it&#39;s interesting and very well presented. It makes me marvel at our universe while watching you perform &quot;magic tricks&quot; as you combine and extract stuff in various ways. I even started reading up on some things as i got really interested in chemistry, little did i know you made this series all those years ago. Since it doesn&#39;t seem to be a dedicated playlist either, would you consider a short series about the very basics and goals of chemistry in general? I think you old videos hold up pretty well, but there also is much improvement over the years for sure. So an updated series would also fit. I take it you are not that kind of educational channel, explaining everything for complete laymen, but if you threw an old fart like myself a bone to spread knowledge about chemisty i would really dig it. I was so very concerned when you tasted things which went through multiple steps getting dissolved in nasty stuff and to my uneducated eyes barely &quot;cleaned&quot;, but as i start to make more sense of these processes it&#39;s fascinating to unterstand more about whats happening and why it&#39;s pretty much guaranteed to be pure at that point.
