If so then I have some good news for you. Here it is. In the beginning God created everything, like trees, animals, fruits, sun, moon, stars and even you and I. God gave humans a choice and we chose to disobey Him and try to do things our own way. That choice caused sin to enter the world so we live in a fallen creation. Worst part is, the relationship we had with a Holy, Righteous God was severed because of our sinful nature. God gave humans rules to follow known as the 10 commandments (Moral Law) but we kept sinning against Him. God knew we could never be perfect so 2000 years ago He sent His only Son named Jesus. Jesus died on the Cross for our sins taking the punishment that we deserved. The Bible says the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23) so when we do things like lie, steal, use blasphemy (Oh my G-O-D), get jealous, hate other people, gossip, make idols above God  we deserve death and hell for our sins. However, through Jesus Christ He died for us and rose 3 days later so we can have a relationship with God again and we don\u2019t have to go to hell. Jesus loves you, He loves you so much He died and rose again to wipe away your sins. He knows the very number of hairs on your head and you have so much worth to Him. All He wants is to have a relationship with you, you get that by having Faith in Jesus, repenting and asking forgiveness for your sins, and getting to know Him. Being a good person can&#39;t save you because nobody is good but God {Mark 10:18.} Tomorrow isn&#39;t promised and I&#39;m telling you this so you can choose Jesus. He will make your heart love what is right, give you all the fruits of the Spirit {Galatians 5:22} (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control), He will take away fear, and you can have confidence in Him. It is horrifying to think that if today was your last that you would end up in hell, which is why I say this to you. You have your  life in front of you so please choose Jesus. He has a plan for your life, plans not to hurt you but to give you hope and a future {Jeremiah 29:11.}  Jesus died in your place so you can choose Him and have everlasting life {John 3:16.} That is the good news, the Good News of Jesus Christ. Jesus loves you and so do I, so please choose Jesus.  Thank you for listening, have a great day and God bless!

This is a great video but I just wanted to give some commentary about the dye concentration you used. Fluorescence is highly efficient and more concentrated solutions (even just a few mg) will self quench the fluorescence. It may seem counterintuitive, but try even less dye for more light output. Dye molecules are flat and nonpolar and will form non fluorescent aggregates at high concentrations. This is a static quenching mechanism. Dyes can also deactivate excited neighbors through collisions, so-called dynamic quenching.Colder solutions will also be brighter due to decreased thermal deactivation of the excited state. This may not be noticeable though because dye excitation in a glow stick is based on local collisions in a reaction mixture where reaction kinetics determine light output. Higher temp will give faster rates therefore more light output. I would be curious to see if you could achieve comparable brightness in a fridge with the added benefit of extending the life of the glow stick.

A better method of isolation would be to perform washes of your organic phase using an acidic and alkaline solution (and probably add some kind of solvent to solubilise all the TCPO), then evaporating the solvent. <br>But I guess that in the context of an amateur chemistry, it&#39;s much more easier to filter and wash than to get your hands on a rotavap!", "comment_date": "2017-07-08T19:26:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "M Talha Khalid", "comment_text": "how many of you watch nurd rage video he also made TCPO", "comment_date": "2017-07-08T19:17:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jasmine B\u00e9dard", "comment_text": "I absolutely love your videos.
