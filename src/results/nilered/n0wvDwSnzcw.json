Buying diamonds of eBay is questionable in and of itself, as rough diamonds are more resourses instead of full products. They need to be polished. Also, most countries require licences to sell raw diamonds, as they are very prone to be used in moneylaundry. The ebaylisting stating it comes with a KPC (Kimberly Process certificate), means effort is put in to rule out the chance on blood diamonds. But you didnt get a KP (at least I  wasnt shown in the picture), so that is questionable as well. These are however almost certainly mixed origin due to an ebay listing (a real diamond dealer would never put origin stones on ebay) meaning the value is lower.<br><br>- 2. What you bought is considered to be diamond powder in a lot of countries. Seeing the rough stone is smaller than 1 mm, its considered powder for KPC and custom standards.<br><br>- 3. These stone are almost certainly industrial goods, seeing the size. diamonds this small are rarely polished, even if they are of a high quality. you could only use them on hourdials in watches for example (you have to account of a 60% loss in size when polishing)<br><br>- 4. 5 carats (1 gram) of rough diamond is WAY WAY cheaper than the polished versions you are describing in your video. Of course it&#39;s only one of 4 parameters (carat, color, cut and clearly), but size on rough is very important. To give an example I saw today on my job:<br>A 9.02 carat (just under 2 grams) polished stone costs more than \u00b119000 carats (almost 10 kg) rough. these are severely different quality, but for your video that&#39;s okay.<br><br>- 5. looking at the footage, this clearity is quite nice, but the shape is mediocre at best for cutting. cutting a brilliant out of a triangle is hard. You putting it on a black background however makes it harder to tell the color. Putting it on a bright white background would tell more about the purity of the white color, telling more about the quality. So hard to tell..<br><br>-6. putting all the diamonds in separate bags is very common. it is in fact the right this to do, as not to accidentally mix quality and non-quality. The bag you got them in are very common, except them.having a description on the bag of the size, shape, clarity, color and weight in carats.<br><br>-7. All and all: did you have a good deal?<br>46.79 / 5 = $9.75 for 1 carat (which is the unit.of measuring). Which seeing this size , it being unknown origin and probably industrial (to a point where it is actually powder)this price is about right. Would you have been able to cut it, then you would have had a great deal<br> To compare, the stones that end up in a Rolex for example are about 800$ -1000$ a carat. but to be fair, those wouldn&#39;t be on ebay like this ;-) But for the experiment you did, it&#39;s a fair price. <br><br>BUT!!! What is a deal is the shipping!! Most countries (including the USA) apply valuable rates for diamonds as a given, meaning it goes with armored vehicles. You paying only $15.00 shipping is very cheap to move diamonds as a rule.", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T21:50:01Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Shadow, who games", "comment_text": "New drink for the elite just dropped", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T21:29:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeneses Enriquez", "comment_text": "Great video", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T19:04:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Goose", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wvDwSnzcw&amp;t=9m14s\">9:14</a> looks like a pipe bomb", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T17:10:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soviet Onion", "comment_text": "DeBeers: <i>heavy breathing</i>", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T16:33:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I\u2019M HERE FOR A GOOD TIME NOT A LONG TIME", "comment_text": "I\u2019m just 2 years late for the giveaway.", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T09:50:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaiden Stiegemeier", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wvDwSnzcw&amp;t=20m08s\">20:08</a> this man literally just made a pipe bomb pickaxe", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T09:03:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "avgHunt3r", "comment_text": "Andrew tate rn: \ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T09:02:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Try M", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll be taking this business idea.

Therefore, the cost of one experiment over time is much less - especially for your YouTube Channel. It must be fun to have access to all that equipment and feel the thrill of victory when your experiments succeed. The end result is interesting but doesn&#39;t seem to advance science in any noticeable way. However, you are generating a great deal of interest in science and educating thousands of people. Do you ever have anyone tell you he or she has tried to repeat one or more of your experiments? I doubt I would ever attempt to burn diamonds unless I found a practical use for it. I might try charcoal or something similar. I really enjoy your series and find it mentally stimulating. Good luck and keep up the good work.

I personally find such expensive decorations completely stupid and believe someone who brags with expensive gems is just a person that cannot handle money well and that I would not trust with my money. But that aside. My main point is something different. Most of the diamonds on earth belong to one singular company. Which means they controll how many are on the market and they control the prices. We have SO MANY diamonds on earth. They are not that rare. They should not be that expensive. Diamonds are simply an example of why people should not be allowed to have a monopoly on any given product for a free market to work properly.

I used this method to make some bubbly water every time I got dry ice. But if i was you and tried this maybe put a cover over the lid of the cup and monitor it to make sure it doesn&#39;t build up to much so you don&#39;t loose diamonds and this comment is way longer than I wanted it to be reply yeet yes if you read this whole thing.", "comment_date": "2020-01-06T05:24:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shrimp", "comment_text": "the t posing metal man feeds us the diamond gas, be greatefull for the metal man, he gives us the nutrition", "comment_date": "2020-01-06T05:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adan Martinez", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0wvDwSnzcw&amp;t=14m08s\">14:08</a> Guys, get out of the way!

So carbonated water produced from NileRed biproducts would make it the worlds most expensive carbonated water.<br>You could even combine the water with other prior experiments in flavour to make the worlds most expensive soda.<br>@NileRed <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NileRed\">#NileRed</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T17:59:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hydrolox", "comment_text": "Nile my friend your the first person in history to drink DIAMONDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T17:58:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AMMO", "comment_text": "When u go to make a pressure chamber and accidentally make a stempack", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T17:57:16Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "El Polar", "comment_text": "This video should be part of edible chemistry", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T17:55:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dislike button", "comment_text": "NileRed: i have the most expensive water<br><br>Belle Delphine: hold my bath water", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T17:54:05Z", "likes_count": 345}, {"comment_by": "#41337", "comment_text": "Watching your process of conceptualizing, building, and refining the design of the whole experiment was the most satisfying part.

Tap water isn&#39;t the problem really, so long as you like the taste of your tap water.  When I make my soda water you get several 2 liter bottles of soda water (probably about 16 to 18 liters total) after the pressure gauge for the system goes below 20 psi though the water has a very limited amount of fizz and it doesn&#39;t taste good.  And that is the problem with your water, not enough fizz, I can tell from the scant amount of tiny bubbles you&#39;re getting.  Of course some people never think it tastes good and that&#39;s because it is an acquired taste.

As I understand it, there&#39;s not really any such thing as too much oil when tapping. It lubricates the work piece and tap so the primary resistance to turning the tap is the cutting forces, rather than friction in the threads. It also helps to flush out the chips so they don&#39;t build up in the flutes and get in the way of the cutting surfaces. That said, I think you probably would&#39;ve ended up with a broken tap if there wasn&#39;t enough oil.<br><br>2) Not breaking the chip often enough. I think you generally don&#39;t want to go more than one full turn, or maybe even a half turn before reversing to ensure you&#39;re getting good small chips. It looked to me like you were going a couple of turns before breaking the chip. This could result in chips too large to be properly flushed by the oil, which in turns results in them building up in the flutes, and possibly overflowing into the threads.

You heat the bottom of the bucket, and because it&#39;s a quartz glass, the heat doesn&#39;t spread to the glass in your bongs or the rest of the nail, so the bottom of the bucket is able to hold the heat so you can melt the dab.
