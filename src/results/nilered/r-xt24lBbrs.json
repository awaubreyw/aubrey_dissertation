I just finished this exact synthesis for the first time and I have no idea how my yield was as high as it was. I finished the second distillation and then added NaOH to seperate water from the pyridine. It took awhile which surprised me but the first sign it was separating was almost a whole minute after NaOH addition. I left came back and removed the top layer leaving a small amount behind as not to bring water over with the pyridine. This layer was dried with molecular sieves. I did this on a 3x scale so 150g niacin and 36g basic copper carbonate. I ended up with 75ml of dry pyridine so 25ml per 50g of niacin. This is really high compared to others I&#39;ve seen. I did premix the basic copper carbonate and niacin and stoppered them in a flask where I kept the powder stored for about 2 weeks before I got the stones to do it. The color had changed from a lighter green color to more of a blue. It is definitely pyridine the smell is ungodly and it sticks in your nose for awhile if you get a whiff. I used a respirator until I added sieves that&#39;s where I smelled it. Long story short what did I do right?!?! As Nile says in the video most are around 40% yield and upwards of about 75% but I got about 83% I think it comes out to. I thought maybe it wasn&#39;t fully dry but addition of more dry sieves produces no further reaction.
