One thing I learned to remove the remaining toluene is to add a little bit of low boiling point solvent (in my cases often chloroform or dichloromethane) and then quickly reduce the pressure below the boiling point using a rotary evaporator to quickly pull off the solvent which might strip some toluene with it. oc be careful so you dont create a mess.
