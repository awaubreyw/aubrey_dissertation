I have heard that copper powder or granules can ad as a mercury sponge to clean surfaces with small amounts of mercury. just wondering if you had any insight. My professor said she will let me do the reaction if I can find a good way to clean up the waste. Also I was wondering if you know any more about the C3N4 produced as a solid in the primary reaction. I haven&#39;t been able to find much info on what this is, and I don&#39;t think that it is graphitic carbon nitride that has the same molecular formula. so if you have any information on what that is that would be great also.", "comment_date": "2018-12-06T06:27:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Void", "comment_text": "I am.........disgusted", "comment_date": "2018-11-25T23:30:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scord Lorpion", "comment_text": "Music is amazing.
