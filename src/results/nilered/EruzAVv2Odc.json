What I mean is, do things (yogurt in this case) crystallize because they are cold, or they become cold, because they have crystallized? I noticed my yougurt had cristalized in the freezer, but the center was still at normal temperature, even with the spoon in the center of it. Then the question popped. Did the yogurt&#39;s temperature drop, because the yogurt crystallized, or did the yogurt crystallize because the freezer&#39;s temperature dropped? Is it easier to drop a material&#39;s temperature, if it is in a solid state? My brain is frozen.
