(in the same way as napalm in vietnam war) they where put into bombs and artillery and in som sherman tanks they used white phosphorus smoke shells (smoke in ground warfare is used for cover and smoke shells are a smoke grenades fired by tanks from their gun rather then a small external tube or smoke mortar the point is to block the enemies sight rather then cover yourself and allow yourself to get flanked white phosphorus was the same except it had the advantage of destroying tanks that could not be penetrated by shells a normal gun can fire) american use of white phosphorus was questionable at best and considering the soviets already defeated the nazis and where having no trouble dealing with the leftovers (in some times during 1944 the Soviets where having a such a field day it was considered dishonourable and unmanly to die) the western front and as such the american use of white phosphorus could have been avoided as a whole (and actually would have ended with less people dead on the allied front since the west couldn\u2019t properly deal with the fascists) so for some people i don\u2019t recommend making white phosphorus unless a list is where you want your name to be same

This is literally the worst way to get red phosphorus.  I have 2 kilos (that&#39;s over 4 pounds) of it ordered from sigma and on its way to me now.  But it&#39;s stuck in a warehouse that got shut down due to Covid.  That&#39;s my luck.  But when it gets released I&#39;ll have it up for grabs in small portions of anyone needs any.  Just go to my channel and go to the &quot;About&quot; section and find my info and get hold of me.  There&#39;s already a waiting list, but therws only like 20 people waiting so far.  The largest amount that you can buy is 100 grams.  But you can get samples all the way down to 1/4 of a gram.  Poormans Chemist on YT uses it, as does many, many other YT channels and it&#39;s quality stuff.  If you want it, get on the waiting list while it lasts.  I may not be able to get more after this batch is gone.  But I also have a kilo of lithium on the way as well and it&#39;ll be up for grabs as well.  I also have acetic anhydride, phosphorus pentachloride, 2 kilos of iodine, 3 kilos of sodium, a kilo of potassium, a kilo of Mercury, I also make Rubidium and Cesium myself and sell them for half the price that others sell them for, etc.  I sell nearly any element and hundreds of chems.  You just have to get hold of me and see what I have in stock at the time.  Don&#39;t go through the extreme trouble of doin what&#39;s shown in this video.  This is ridiculous.  I can help you out and save you tons of money as opposed to buying 2,000 match boxes.
