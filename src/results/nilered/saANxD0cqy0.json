I also find them quite disturbing.  Having had enough close calls in my own life, I&#39;ve grown to respect chemicals a bit more.  While experimentation is absolutely necessary for learning and the advancement of science, &quot;playing&quot; with chemicals isn&#39;t the way to do this.  Furthermore, I see this producing a lot of toxic materials, which.. again... relatively small scale, so it could be worse.  Still, even the idea of sending all those chromium laden fumes up through the hood and out into the atmosphere feels really irresponsible.   Oh, and small tip... as you could see at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saANxD0cqy0&amp;t=8m38s\">8:38</a>, using sulfuric acid to seal the glass joint is not effective.   Try purchasing some PTFE Glindmann sealing rings in the future.  They&#39;re inexpensive, they make a vacuum tight seal, and they ensure your glass joint won&#39;t fuse.  Being PTFE, they&#39;re pretty inert, and they don&#39;t leave everything greasy like vacuum grease does.  They also make a MUCH more robust seal when compared to PTFE sealing SLEEVES which really don&#39;t work well at all.<br><br>Oh... and don&#39;t go smelling benzaldehyde.   It should smell like almonds, not cherries... But anyway, you don&#39;t want to go burning out your sense of smell and end up with some rare form of nasal cancer in 20 years. (Benzaldehyde may not be carcinogenic, but the toluene and other biproducts are.. and personally I&#39;m more worried about organometallics that you might be forming.)", "comment_date": "2022-06-11T22:21:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaurav Gosai", "comment_text": "Nile: Which is your favorite carcinogenic liquid?<br>Anyone on the planet: Your favorite WHAT??", "comment_date": "2022-06-11T15:57:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "WangWei Yang", "comment_text": "His FBI agent:interesting", "comment_date": "2022-06-11T15:37:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Julien Ajith", "comment_text": "<b>BROMINE</b>", "comment_date": "2022-06-11T15:23:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tinfoil Homer", "comment_text": "Where does the smoke go?", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T12:08:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Henderling", "comment_text": "Now make anthrax", "comment_date": "2022-06-10T11:49:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "golden308", "comment_text": "Thugs in an alleyway come to him pulls this out", "comment_date": "2022-06-09T21:02:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alfa Gaming", "comment_text": "\u201cCall an ambulance , Call an ambulance!

This breakup allowed the water to increase its surface area, accelerating the reaction with the rest of the chromyl chloride. However, the surface of the chromyl chloride drops remains intact next to the break-up points, and that&#39;s why you see this &#39;growing tree&#39; effect on the water surface. It reminds me of fractals.<br><br>The toluene reaction shows a lot of effects which are interesting as well. <br><br>The chromyl chloride probably creeps up the glass as it&#39;s surface at the glass-air-chromyl interface is cut up by moisture in the air. If you happen to do this again, it would be interesting to see how it behaves when in contasct with water vapour or spray.", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T14:34:50Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Barbed Wire Cobwebs", "comment_text": "my favourite carcinogen is the undertale fandom", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T10:03:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Overwatch", "comment_text": "@NileRed I doubt you will ever see this considering how old this video is compared to this comment, but I wanted to let you know that this video was mentioned (a few times actually) in the comments of one of Derek Lowes <b>In The Pipeline</b> posts.<br>(I&#39;m going to assume that, as a chemist, you are aware of Derek and In The Pipeline.)", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T05:30:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ULTRASMURF", "comment_text": "If sarin is a 10 you&#39;d love VX nerve gas", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T04:26:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Simpson", "comment_text": "I&#39;m sorry, but why the hell do the ingredients for the iodised salt include sugar?!", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T03:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "heazy87", "comment_text": "This feels illegal to watch.", "comment_date": "2021-01-03T01:25:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "smib", "comment_text": "I&#39;d call that chemical &quot;hate blood&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T19:15:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Philip Inman", "comment_text": "So\u2026 demon\u2019s blood?", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T09:07:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AbsolutelyBored", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saANxD0cqy0&amp;t=15m56s\">15:56</a> looks like coronavirus", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T07:19:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Squilliam Fancyson", "comment_text": "The wrong dressing ultrasonographically cough because plastic thermodynamically melt throughout a spurious toy. pointless, slippery albatross", "comment_date": "2021-01-02T05:47:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Clapper", "comment_text": "There is something very sinister about those fumes", "comment_date": "2021-01-01T19:08:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Surtyr", "comment_text": "some day you wake up and realize that you have favourite carcinogen", "comment_date": "2021-01-01T10:07:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BoltDoesArt", "comment_text": "Imagine being tortured by this guy", "comment_date": "2021-01-01T06:09:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bakugou Katsuki DynaMight", "comment_text": "Ah yes...

It&#39;s good to see properties of more dangerous compounds, and details about how they behave when being handled. Very useful for people who deal with them, even in professional laboratories. Chromyl chloride is one of those things that should really be scrubbed by a reducer when sucked from a fume hood, if the apparatus is available.<br><br><br>However, I simply must say again, because I see no progress, that your form of presentation has certain things that are so repetitive that myself, and several people I&#39;m in daily contact with that watch your stuff, find them increasingly irritating.<br><br><br>Examples:<br><br><br>- you overuse the word <b>though</b> - it is not ok to use it 40-50 times in a 20 minute video, man. It really isn&#39;t. If you feel something similar is needed (and often it really isn&#39;t), you can start the sentence with &quot;although&quot; or &quot;however&quot;. You can join sentences with &quot;but&quot;. Being relentlessly thumped with &quot;though&quot; every thirty seconds on average is really annoying, especially when you use it as a filler word where it has zero useful meaning. Couple of us actually counted this once for gruesome fun.<br><br><br>- <b>wrong usage of units</b> - something is not at &quot;ten C&quot;. C is nothing. At best, incorrectly said coulomb, unit of charge. Celsius is unit of temperature. It&#39;s not difficult to pronounce it. Correct would be &quot;degrees Celsius&quot;, as those really are degrees and not just simple unit like kelvin, but plain &quot;Celsius&quot; is just fine.<br>Other unit you constantly pronounce wrong is ml. It&#39;s not &quot;mils&quot;. Mils are thousands of an inch. Just because some lazy people can&#39;t say millilitre doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s nice to constantly hear it from a chemistry youtuber. Related to this, it&#39;s &quot;separatory funnel&quot;, not &quot;sep funnel&quot;. Keep it professional.<br><br><br>- <b>pleonasms</b> - &quot;sodium metal&quot;, &quot;oxygen gas&quot;, are not names of <i>chemical substances</i> . At best, they are names for chemical and physical states, but in that case it&#39;s always better to say &quot;elemental sodium/oxygen&quot;. In case of just talking about <i>elements</i> , their names are sodium and oxygen. You don&#39;t see &quot;bromine liquid&quot; in the periodic table of elements.<br>Sarin is not a gas, it&#39;s liquid, but when talking about it in general, it&#39;s sarin, not &quot;sarin gas&quot;.<br>This is something that has become rampant on Youtube, spread by American chemistry youtubers and even copied by others that use English who don&#39;t have formal education. It&#39;s truly a meme.<br><br><br>- <b>nitpicking</b> - there is no need to explain every single detail of what&#39;s happening on the screen. If you place down a beaker, you don&#39;t need to say it. You describe nearly every action that happens on the screen. It comes off as OCD, it increases the amount of words you have to say, cramming the speech and forcing you to speak faster to be able to make a short enough video. Add &quot;though&quot; to it and it becomes information noise.<br><br><br>- <b>style of speaking</b> - Your videos are identical blocks of speech with predictable speech patterns: intonation, speed, melody, tone, rhythm, stress. It doesn&#39;t engage the viewer. It lulls them. Make a pause now and then. Ask the viewer a question. Insert a smart pun. Create a small tangent.

The hospital was old and was going to shut down and make room for a new building that would be better able to help people. So, he and several others had to help clear out a lot of the old items they had in storage. Entire encyclopedias from 50+ years ago covered in dust. Old phonographs with recordings on their wax cylinders as well as blank ones. One old doctor had an old desk with some of his old things in it. This desk had a copy of Mein Kampf (written by Adolf Hitler). What shocked everyone was an old wooden crate with some bottles in it. It had been left there for decades and nobody knew what was in it. One of the guys picked up the bottle and turned white as a ghost and said: &quot;...oh...shit...nobody move.&quot;<br><br><br>Turns out someone left this small crate there and forgot about it. The problem was that it was nitroglycerine...and it was very old. For those who don&#39;t know, nitroglycerine (in its pure liquid form) is a contact explosive. Shaking the bottle could cause it to combust and explode. What&#39;s bad is that as it degrades, it becomes even more unstable. So here, they had bottles of it in an old wooden box that had been stored there for decades. Needless to say, they had to evacuate the building and get the bomb squad to dispose of the nitroglycerine.<br><br><br>Sometime after that, I helped him and some other guys clear out a lot of the old junk they had inside. Lots of very old books got thrown into the dump.
