Im glad that you are doing more organic chemistry, i think that it is far more interesting.<br><br>Quick question: Can the same procedure be applied to alkenes? Theoretically it works out nicely with Markovnikov&#39;s Rule, but i think there might be a side hydration reaction that would ruin the yield.
