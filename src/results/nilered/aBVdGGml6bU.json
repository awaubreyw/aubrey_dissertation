I happen to not be a chemist but watched this video right after seeing you in another video clearly handeling fuming nitric acid while wearing black nitrile gloves. I\u2019m sure you probably have already been given enough hassle over this but maybe edit the original videos that have footage of this behavior so there\u2019s a note on screen for the idiots of the world that might try to attempt things people on YouTube make videos of? I mean no disrespect and respect the work and it\u2019s been an amazing thing for me to start learning terminology for chemistry before I get into school.", "comment_date": "2022-07-04T05:48:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Space.

And I wasn&#39;t prepaired at all. I was unfamiliar with the lab and I was cleaning some glass ware and a more experienced lab member told me &quot;Oh looks like you are going to need nitric acid to get that off. I&#39;ll just hand you some.&quot; You can imagine my face when I was handed a beaker of the angriest liquid I have ever seen. I immedatly rembembered this and considered myself lucky that I wasn&#39;t wearing any gloves. The fuming nitric acid was so angry the fumes alone stained my hands. Fortunatly everything went well, but boy did I shit myself. Usually I would have been pretty pissed, but I was too shocked to be angry.<br><br>When I confronted him later about it he was incredibly sorry and said he totally forgot that I was new. Apparently the only nitric acid they have is fuming nitric acid and anybody who has been in that lab for a while is pretty used to handling that stuff once in a while.", "comment_date": "2021-07-04T16:12:09Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "hands", "comment_text": "Jhoniel \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc99", "comment_date": "2021-05-14T08:53:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chicken Space Program", "comment_text": "Ahh yes... where the legend started", "comment_date": "2021-04-13T22:01:35Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Sweatin", "comment_text": "Nilereds first vid :D", "comment_date": "2021-02-09T10:16:48Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Pietkiewicz", "comment_text": "This is an excellent example of why you should always look up the hazards and precautions of any chemical you are unfamiliar with", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T23:07:29Z", "likes_count": 78}, {"comment_by": "Bang Ahmad Euy", "comment_text": "bro, the final video that burns paper quickly, what is the title of the video you uploaded, looks like how to make a flash paper?", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T05:20:13Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "lifeatpaddyspub", "comment_text": "not a single comment about \u201cDefintions\u201d huh", "comment_date": "2020-09-24T22:34:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Spencer Minyo", "comment_text": "nitric acid is dangerous stuff...", "comment_date": "2020-05-20T04:15:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "no way", "comment_text": "You wore gloves.
