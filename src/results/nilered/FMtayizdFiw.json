Over time the saven will build up on the wheel which if left alone will cause it to stop turning and the wire to break. We can&#39;t just scrub it off because that might rough the surface of the wheel and again cause the wire to break.

It was just missing something and even increasing the volume of fruit used didn&#39;t work. Enter the magic...<br>Adding citric acid soured the taste, but multiplied the flavor very much. Adding sugar to offset the sour of the acid produced not only the missing flavor of the fruit, but actually multiplied it many times.<br>Ah! Its making sense why its in so many things now. So I used less and less fruit until I took a small fraction of fruit I previously used in an experiment. <br>Only two Strawberrys, a gallon of water, two teaspoons of citric acid and a cup of sugar produces a very Strawberry-eee drink...<br>So in conclusion, its also a natural preservative, and produces the strong flavors we get in the candies and things we buy.

Using H3PO4 might be the best choice, since it forms insolubile Ca3(PO4)2. Moreover, form your calculation it seems that you use less acid than the \rstoichiometric amount, not considering the pKa values of the carboxyl groups, nor the acid second proton pKa (you should have monitored the pH in this phase). So, due to these facts, I imagine you recovered, mostly calcium sulfate (I think gypsum looking the crystals), and partially deprotoned citrate (among with some impurities of course).

It&#39;s a great acid to balance out mushroom substrates.  I use it in my Panellous Stipticus bags (a famous green-glowing oyster-like mushroom that is mildly toxic but just awesome looking)  to bring the enriched sawdust substrate to around 4 pH (which lowers more as the mycelium grows to close to 3.5 - the ideal pH for the species in terms of glow).  No other acid works as well for that purpose that I know about.  It&#39;s fairly gentle, completely non-toxic, and survives sterilization just fine.  It&#39;s great for making sour candies too!

We can then centrifuge the blood and measure the activity of the coagulation factors in plasma to find out how well they are working in order to find clotting defects.

I used to study citric acid crystals.  It appears to me that you actually grew a batch of citric acid monohydrate crystals.  The hexagonal plate you saw in crystal 5 is indicative of anhydrous citric acid, as these crystals form hexagonal plates.  Crystal 3 to me just appeared to be a twinned citric acid monohydrate crystal.  Citric acid monohydrate crystals can actually grow fairly large when they are pure and left to sit if you were looking for something to do with them.  I used to get them larger than a cm in diameter in a day or two.  If you keep the crystals out for a day or two in a higher temperature environment, you would probably be able to see the crystals dehydrate and turn amorphous.

It might be worth noting that these two groups are exactly the same. I assume you mean that the first carboxylic group to lose its proton is the middle one. After this, one of the side groups will get deprotonated, and the pKa of this is 4.76.
