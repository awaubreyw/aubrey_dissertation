This means that the delocalized electrons in the highest occupied orbitals for the yellow form are in larger &#39;boxes&#39; than in the blue form.  The energy spacings of the orbitals in the larger boxes are smaller than the energy spacing of the orbitals in the smaller boxes.  So the electron transitions that give rise to the yellow form (larger boxes) should correspond to wavelengths that are longer than the transitions in the blue form.

I actually use ordinary tap water (Hill Country TX hard water) and it works well. I\u2019ve pushed the reaction to its comfortable limits, mostly out of laziness.<br><br>My reactions are: 400 ml of warm (~100\u00b0F) water (I eyeball it), 10.5-11g (dry weight) Sodium Hydroxide, and 2 tsps finely powdered corn sugar (brewing supply). I mix the water, base and sugar in a flat bottom round flask by shaking and venting. Then add the Indigo Carmine. As long as the water temp is just warm when you start, the reaction is fast enough for live stage demos. And a little traffic humor doesn\u2019t hurt.<br><br>I\u2019ve even performed this reaction on live TV (an NBC affiliate morning show), although the green screen equipment inadvertently chroma-keyed out my \u201cgreen\u201d and replaced it with an eyeball hurting white, which I didn\u2019t know until after the show had aired, Lol!
