I was unaware of the benzoic acid that forms as a contaminant from storage and whatnot. The soap i was looking to make would be a hard castile using NaOH as the base. Just to confirm, any benzoic acid, that may potentially be in whatever oil I may find, should be neutralized upon contact w the base? Also, how about the potential long-term storage of almond scented bars of soap? Would there be any potential risk of the miniscule amounts of benzaldehyde (per bar) becoming oxidized into any harmful benzoic acid in time? Should I be concerned w this @ all?
