Unfortunately unbeknownst to my bosst, the HF cylinder which had probably been stored for years in the heat had partially decomposed to hydrogen and fluorine gas so the vapor pressure in the cylinder was very high. Normally HF has a reasonably low vapor pressure that allows you to distill it with a moderate vacuum into the reaction vessels using dry ice acetone cooling. You can guess what happened. Upon opening the cylinder there was enough pressure released that it forced all of the mercury out of the manometer (probably 75ml) all into the fume hood where it spread everywhere. I am glad it was not me who made this error, but I learned to always vent the new HF cylinder before attaching it to the vacuum line and I was glad it was not me who had to clean up the mess.", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T04:37:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Robert kalclus", "comment_text": "I got to spend some hospital time with a former military medic who had shot a bunch of mercury into himself.

You should start off with your liquid metal in an apparatus configured to be agitated via &#39;sparging&#39; with inert gas and allow the mercury to slosh around with half strength nitric acid for 4 - 5 hours.  Distillation should then be performed (using an analogous set-up, with the addition of a fractioning column) under high vacuum, using an open flame/sand bath as heat source with any explosive boiling avoided entirely via the use of a capillary to introduce a &#39;bleed&#39; of air in to the system throughout the distillation....this air stream serves a dual purpose, in that, the more common (metallic) impurities found in samples of mercury metal are far more readily oxidized (especially in the vapor phase) and so are FAR more likely to remain behind instead of being carried over via co-distillation (which is weirdly possible in this case).
