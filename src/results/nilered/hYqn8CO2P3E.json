In short that part is trait and error since size of the paper affects it too, but once you soaked it till it will bend in four directions and is barely curling (thinner papers are different and this is based on my experiences which is only with medium thickness watercolour paper) so you leave it out to dry. After that you flatten it under many heavy objects (the one in contact with the paper must be at least the same size and flat as well, ideally larger) once it\u2019s flat and COMPLETELY DRY you should have a piece of paper that won\u2019t curl.

A century ago, many cameras used large glass plates as film. Some were 8X10-inches in size or larger, and they were placed in a printing frame with a sheet of POP and taken into the sunlight. When the paper turned a particular color, it was taken to the darkroom and processed. Some of the best quality photos of all time were printed in this manner. You do need to size the paper, and use the best quality paper possible. Paper that is made from rags and acid free is what you need for quality prints. A UV lamp would make your printing process more repeatable. Also, there is another printing process based on platinum.

The negative is one of the most important things so you can convert the color image into a halftone first before inverting to a negative. This will allow you to adjust your levels more equally for just a single color exposure like your doing here or even for the duo tone. Also place the emulsion side of your negative closest to the paper, this will allow for less uv light to &quot;bleed&quot; under the blacked out portions which is a result of the very minute thickness of the transparent layer and you can also buy thinner transparency to reduce the amount of uv light to bleed. The closer you can get your negative to lay to the paper the better your result will be. In the print shop we vacume the negative down to the paper to get it as close as possible. Makes a huge difference. Also you could try a lower dpi &quot;dots per inch&quot; on the printer when printing the negative. Sometimes higher dpi washes out even though it&#39;s better quality some paper just can&#39;t hold it so try lowering the dpi to like 300 or 200 or 150 and see the difference in results. These are all things you can do that I feel would really help. I think it would be awesome to get some blueprints with lots of linework to expose.

I think the reason exposure time follows an exponential curve is also, in part, due to the nature of how we perceive light. In photography, when the amount of light that hit the sensor (or the cyanotype) double (or halve), we call it a &quot;stop&quot;. Why? Because the human eyes see light logarithmically. Say if you have 1 light on and you turn on another light, the room will be significantly brighter, but it won&#39;t be twice brighter. Now if you have 10 lights on, and then you turn on 1 more, the difference will be insignificant. The same applies to the exposure time. That means if you change the exposure time linearly, the brightness of the image will change logarithmically following a diminishing curve.

My suggestion would be to prepare a Photoshop document that has a gradient from &quot;black&quot; to &quot;white&quot;, along with a series of half-tone patterns. Print that out, set it out in the sunlight until you get a decent amount of exposure, then develop. Then go back into your Photoshop document, and on top of the layer containing the gradients and half-tone patterns, add a &quot;Gradient Map&quot; layer. Adjust the colors on this gradient map until what you see on the screen is a reasonable representation of what your print looked like. Save this gradient map as a preset. That way, the next time you want to print a photo, you can throw the gradient map on top of it as a preview of what your negative will look like after developing, and you can play around with adjustments (mostly sharpening, curves layer and HDR mapping I&#39;d imagine) until you like how the preview looks, to make sure that neither the shadows nor the highlights will lose detail.", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T07:39:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ka Mi", "comment_text": "We should buy you a UV lamp.", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T07:37:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheLenny27", "comment_text": "I like how I got an ad from NordVPN before watching the video haha", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T07:35:53Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Phi", "comment_text": "I would suggest using better prepared negatives", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T07:35:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darius Anton", "comment_text": "NileRed is making chemistry both fun and educational at the same time, and it&#39;s so professional!", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T07:29:40Z", "likes_count": 2777}, {"comment_by": "Zac H", "comment_text": "@Nilered would you like to sell any of your prints?", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T07:16:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tesseract", "comment_text": "magical", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T07:15:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gavin kemp", "comment_text": "to be honest you shoudn&#39;t put personnal detail much less credit card detail on unencrypted website in the first place even behind a vpn. adding a second layer won&#39;t off course but its a bit over kill i feel. what a VPN will do though is prevent sniffing since IP adresse and website url can&#39;t be encrypted unless you have a specialized service decrypting them.", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T07:10:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Floortile83", "comment_text": "You seem to have your terminology mixed up.

Basically, you should expect the density of the developed image to scale linearly with the <i>log</i> of exposure.  When doing the test strips, most people would pick intervals like 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 4 minutes, etc. as a result.  Finally, you&#39;re right to notice that the observed density didn&#39;t perfectly obey the reciprocity law -- sometimes the chemistry doesn&#39;t quite cooperate with the math.  Not sure about the cyanotype process, but with the &quot;normal&quot; silver halide process a crystal has to absorb two photons to be able to darken during development.  While the math suggests that on average the two photons will have arrived, sometimes that second photon doesn&#39;t actually show up.  So what should be a crystal that will be developed... isn&#39;t actually.  This is called reciprocity failure and has to be corrected for to get a properly exposed image.  (The results are sometimes very surprising; for example 400 speed film being dramatically slower than 100 speed film out towards 1 minute or longer exposures.  But it is very much a chemistry thing; some 100 speed film has very low reciprocity failure, like Acros 100.)", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T06:04:08Z", "likes_count": 36}, {"comment_by": "mastheadmike", "comment_text": "You have an eye for photography too!
