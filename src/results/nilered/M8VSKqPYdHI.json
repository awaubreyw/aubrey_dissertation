After addition of n-butanol my solution heated up and I started to smell the butyraldehyde that has a low boiling point so I had to set up a condenser and a cool water bath. Anyway, the presence of aldehyde meant the reaction was going fine. Due to high solubility of chromium sulfate and, surprisingly, different butyrates, I had to carry out multiple extractions of butyric acid using xylene (I read butyric acid is miscible with all organic solvents, and again I had a lot of this compound). Before the extractions I acidified the solution with sulfuric acid to get pH about 1 to surely hydrolize any butyrates.<br>The question is why my extract is purple-colored. I tried to mix it with some another solvents like alcohol and alcohol-water mixture, but the colored compound stays in the xylene layer. I thought about using TLC, but I don&#39;t know how to make butyric acid&#39;s spot visible on paper. Also I tried reacting the alcohol-water mixture I&#39;d previously got with alkaline solution and got some white precipitate. Almost dry precipitate smells definitely like vomit, so I suppose this is butyrate and thus I&#39;ve successefuly made butyric acid.
