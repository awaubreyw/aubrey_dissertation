The product is very brown but i hear it can be &#39;&#39; yellow or brown&#39;&#39;. Since my school went on strike,  the nitroacetanilide was left to dry for a month after i filtered it.  I will be making the reaction with sulfuric this afternoon.

Thanks i use to perform this experiment in my PG as lab excercise. Method which \u00a0was prescribed in our lab manual for hydrolysis of p-nitroacetanilide was bit tedious and yield was also unsatisfactory.<br>Your method is comparatively easier and seems to provide much better results ! However, i would like to point that temperature of Acetanilide- Glacial acetic acid mix. reached upto 20 deg. Centigrade which is responsible for formation of o- nitro acetanilide and o - nitro aniline upto significant. However, if u manage to keep temp. during nitration below 10 deg. C \u00a0formation of o isomer would be very less becos formation of o-isomer requires compratively high temp. so carrying out nitration below 10 deg. C i m pretty sure it will help u !", "comment_date": "2015-01-26T19:16:58Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "jean-claude pautrot", "comment_text": "do a video on clorine and brake fluid and explain why the reaction happens the way it does", "comment_date": "2015-01-24T16:06:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quarks0010lss", "comment_text": "The link is for a reaction with 4-nitroacetanilide if 4-nitroaniline is used instead what are the correct amounts of 4-nitroaniline and nitric acid and what should be the molar concentration of the acid?\u00a0 I can not imagine the amounts and concentrations are the same as the reactivity is different.\u00a0 Thanks", "comment_date": "2015-01-16T01:08:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pete Buxton", "comment_text": "This was far superior to the usual boring &quot;snakes&quot;....very funny, but violent reaction.
