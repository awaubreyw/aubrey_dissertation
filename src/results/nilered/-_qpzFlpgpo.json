Bismuth is one of very few materials that is less dense in solid form than its melt, meaning solid bismuth floats in liquid bismuth. We did an experiment where we grew bismuth crystals in a way that took advantage of this property. If you heat a container of bismuth (or bismuth shot as we used) to just a little over bismuth&#39;s melting point, you can &quot;pull&quot; crystals from the melt by dipping a wire (with a seed crystal of bismuth if you want) into the film on top of the melt and slowly lowering the container by a jack. Lowering it very slowly, you actually get some relatively nice looking crystals forming on the underside while the topside will just look like gray nothing.

Historically, everything from noble gasses to sand has been used to block heated metal from oxidizing air.  Using a ceramic crucible also helps with heat retention and even heating.  Direct heating from the top of the metal also helps to &quot;push&quot; any present air away from the surface of the metal.

What do you think happens to someone after they die?<br>2. Do you think there is an afterlife? <br>3. If heaven exists, how do you get there? <br>4. Would you be good enough to get into heaven?<br> <br>Here are a few questions to see if you are a good person: <br> <br>1. How many lies have you told in your whole life? <br>2. Have you ever stolen? <br>3. Have you ever used God&#39;s name in vain?<br>4. Jesus said that &quot;whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart&quot; (Matthew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_qpzFlpgpo&amp;t=5m28s\">5:28</a>). Have you ever looked with lust? <br>5. If you have broken any of these commandments, would you be innocent or guilty on Judgment Day? <br>6. Would you go to Heaven or Hell?<br> <br>The Bible says that &quot;all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone&quot; (Revelation 21:8) and &quot;Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality, or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people \u2014 none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God&quot; (1 Corinthians 6:9-10). So, if you are guilty of any of the ten commandments, then you are in trouble when Judgment Day comes! Do you know what God did for guilty sinners so that we wouldn&#39;t have to go to Hell? <br> <br>2,000 years ago, God became a human being, Jesus of Nazareth, who suffered and died on the cross for our sins and rose from the dead on the third day, defeating death. The punishment that we deserve for breaking God&#39;s law, Jesus took in our place. He paid the fine that we could never pay so that God can legally set us free by forgiving our sins. He is just, by punishing evil through Jesus\u2019 death on the cross, while being rich in mercy towards us. <br> <br>What you have to do is repent, or confess and forsake your sins, and trust alone in Jesus Christ. Don&#39;t trust your own goodness, because, as Jesus said, \u201cNo one is good \u2014 except God alone\u201d (Mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_qpzFlpgpo&amp;t=10m18s\">10:18</a>). Trust alone in the savior. The moment you do that, God will forgive every sin you have ever committed and grant you eternal life, and He will give you a new heart with new desires, so that you will love to do what is right. You will be born again. But you must repent and trust in Jesus. <br> <br>When are you going to do that?<br> <br>Here is a short Christian movie on this subject and depression: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcqxzXMRGoc</a>", "comment_date": "2020-11-08T14:49:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Argie Yea", "comment_text": "&quot;How to extract 30 cents worth of bismuth from a hundred bucks worth of Pepto-Bismol&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-11-08T13:54:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean R", "comment_text": "I had to double take metal crystals", "comment_date": "2020-11-08T10:30:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "delia", "comment_text": "Nile....

You might want to get some copper tubing to run from the rubber gas hose to the foil tape to prevent melting the hose.  The open hole should be smaller because it only acts as a vent.  Now turn the valve on from the bottle of helium to about 5 pounds. This will continually purge all oxygen out of the test tube wile you heat it up.  No oxygen, = no oxidization.\ud83d\ude0e  Oh, and that will prevent any flaming on the inside of the beaker as well of course.  Please send me a reply to let me know if this helped.  Thnx. \ud83d\ude01  Now, I&#39;m not sure if the copper tubing would react badly with the chemical fumes coming off the bismuth as you heat it up but if so then you might want to use stainless tubing instead.

I take a little peek through the door to see is it still there and the answer is yes, that&#39;s mean we&#39;re clear to go. So I slowly opened the door and walk inside and gently walk up on my bed( my bed is pretty low because it doesn&#39;t have bed frame so I can walk up on it easily) and slowly reach to the cockroach and when my hands was in position to capture it I aggressively pressed it with my both hands but I don&#39;t know how but somehow he made it out from that cloth and start to fly. I jumped and accidently stomp on my friend&#39;s guitar(another friend) at that moment I don&#39;t know anything I was screaming and run around the noise is so loud that it waked my mom up she run out from her room and ask me &quot;WHAT HAPPEN&quot; I told her it&#39;s a cockcroach with shaky voice my legs was literally shaking her face changed immediately, so she walk into my room and saw my friend&#39;s guitar broken &quot;it&#39;s just a bug, I can&#39;t belive it&quot; &quot;but mom I was scared, you know how much I hate these thing&quot; &quot;sigh-&quot; &quot;how are we gonna find it look how messy this room is!!&quot; then it came out, that wicked creature. My mom grab a broom to catch it but it run away to another room she said I should leave the cockroach&#39;s house(cockroach trap) in front of your room and went back to sleep. Now I have to deal with the guitar and how am I gonna sleep tonight, I can&#39;t even trust my own room anymore. So that&#39;s my story about why I hated cockroach so much, much more than a snake I&#39;d rather encounter a snake instead of 3 cockroach (I was exaggerating) anyway all I want to say is I. HATE.

Unlike a metal crucible however, I bought some cheap graphite ones which not only contain the heat better, but also help to reduce a bit of the oxide slag (still plenty to skim off though). Simply stood the crucible on a tolerable metal surface that could be sacrificed, and hit with a blowtorch until the bismuth all melted - even a crem\u00e9 br\u00fbl\u00e9e type worked (albeit I used the Dremel VersaFlame).<br><br>To make the jewellery, I inserted 14-19 gauge pure copper wire (don\u2019t get it from electronics due to the insulator coating) for a couple of minutes until the surface had been getting hard for 10-15 seconds. Then the wire is removed and you have a couple of larger crystals or lots of smaller ones depending on whether the wire was disturbed much or not. The wire is then looped and twisted at the top of the crystal, the excess cut off, and you have a really awesome amulet.<br><br>Another thing I found was that the older the bismuth, the darker the colours. Initially you get really bright blues, reds, and sometimes greens, however when remelted several times, the colours tended to go to dark blue, purple, and gold. I\u2019m guessing small amounts of oxide get incorporated into the bulk metal in minute quantities, and migrate to the surface where it combines with fresh oxide film.

For this reason you should always acid to water and not the other way around, otherwise enough thermal energy is absorbed by the water to boil it and you can actually get a steam explosion that sprays acid everywhere.  Not fun!  It&#39;s also important to pour the acid down a pyrex stirring rod and to go slooooow, giving the water a chance to spread and dissipate the heat.

I did this experiment using a metal ladle. It doesn&#39;t break like glass or ceramic will under immediate heat contact and is larger than the 5 mL teaspoon you&#39;re using. When making bismuth crystals you want a deeper utensil or container for bigger, better crystals. Also, to make the colors of the crystals prettier, remove the oxides off the top of the bismuth as it&#39;s melting and once or twice as it&#39;s cooling (I personally used a fork I wasn&#39;t planning on keeping after the experiment). When pouring out the remaining liquid bismuth, the oxides (or slag) falls on the crystals below and sticks to them and coats them with that unappealing silver/gold color. Next, make sure when you&#39;re cooling the bismuth down that you hold it very still (movement can dislodge crystals that haven&#39;t fully formed yet or disfigure not fully-hardened crystals). If you want reds, oranges, or yellows in your bismuth crystals, you must make sure that the bismuth crystals cool very slowly (especially after you pour out the liquid bismuth). Last thing, the best crystals form after using fresh, unmelted bismuth. I found that remelting the bismuth time after time provided me with some pretty sorry-looking specimens. Hope this gives you some ideas if you ever try this awesome experiment again!!!!", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T17:48:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kwad Damage", "comment_text": "that rock has a flipflop paint job", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T16:45:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Accalia Murray Music", "comment_text": "I love <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_qpzFlpgpo&amp;t=1m08s\">1:08</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T12:19:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "burritoevie", "comment_text": "SU Bismuth stopped breathing", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T08:59:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aqua phoenix10432", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_qpzFlpgpo&amp;t=11m53s\">11:53</a><br>I didn&#39;t notice you were moving it so internally im just looking at this and thinking &quot;christ, what kind of reaction does that?&quot;<br>And then i realized im stupid", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T08:02:14Z", "likes_count": 162}, {"comment_by": "kadawg13", "comment_text": "I would use pepto after a night of drinking to settle my stomach before bed and hopefully ease nausea in the morning.  the next day my tongue would be black, I assumed it was from smoking too much.  this happened quite a few times so I finally looked it up and it turns out to be a reaction from the pepto bismol.....", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T06:41:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Takata Cheroki", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll admit that this is really cool, but even if I had the proper equipment, training, and setup, I still wouldn&#39;t be able to do it myself - I&#39;m allergic to peptobismal.", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T05:46:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Space Man", "comment_text": "Should\u2019ve just used a razor to slit the whole pack and hat shake pills out", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T04:13:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "7curiogeo", "comment_text": "So idiot plays at being a chemist/ smelter master.", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T04:10:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Name", "comment_text": "When you find out bismuth is radioactive. :/", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T03:54:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tactical_P0tato", "comment_text": "Pepto-Bismuth", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T03:47:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Berrie Barrera", "comment_text": "i didnt realize how much of chemistry was just breaking glass", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T02:59:19Z", "likes_count": 593}, {"comment_by": "rem45acp", "comment_text": "Multiple glass vials and test tubes were harmed in the making of this video.", "comment_date": "2019-12-31T02:17:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "david f", "comment_text": "Everyone: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23teamtrees\">#teamtrees</a><br><br>NileRed: So I had a beaker of pure unobtainium, but before I could show you I dropped it on the floor.

One normal filter paper with a paper towel, much like the trifold type seen in dispensers, on the dirty side of the filtering device. I work with a lot of precious metal refining projects and sometimes solid hydroxides and chlorides can form and create a hazy suspension which would not go away. The two element filter works wonders. As a contrast, even using 2, 3, 4, or more layers of the same type filter papers would still leave a hazy fluid. Now, melting the bismuth could have gone better. One suggestion would be to combine the bismuth with borax and lead oxide, then melt it. The lead oxide will turn to a lead/bismuth alloy. Once this is done you can fire it in a bone ash dish where the lead would oxidize under the flame (also taking any oxygen which might oxidize the bismuth) and it would be absorbed by the calcium carbonate (bone ash) in the dish/crucible. What you would be left with would be more or less pure bismuth. Another way would be to melt it using an induction furnace in a closed container with an inert gas (argon being the best). But I doubt you would want to spend the time and money to make/buy an induction melting setup for what you are doing. Although bismuth melts at a much lower temperature, it does have some things in common with palladium in that it tends to absorb certain gasses (palladium stores vast ammounts of hydrogen for example and upon poring a melt in open air expands like a magic snake absorbing mostly hydrogen and some oxygen). Recovering and refining metals is one science, but smelting is another.", "comment_date": "2019-03-14T00:20:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shifttube", "comment_text": "How is this not jus alum. foil melted by acid than you just recovered it. idk maybe not", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T23:53:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shifttube", "comment_text": "I think the yellow stuff was the acid left in the mixture", "comment_date": "2019-03-13T23:49:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Lacroix", "comment_text": "Wow thanx for the video.

I find that there is a challenge in doing it like this and I like the creativity that it sometimes requires. If it works (gives the same or similar results), it also optimizes the process and makes it more efficient.<br><br><br>So in this case, I wanted to come up with a way to do it without nitrogen or another inert gas. <br><br><br>2) If I used the gas at the beginning, the water vapor would have just pushed it out anyway. This would leave me with 2 options. <br><br><br>a) Add the gas after the water was gone, but at that point it wouldn&#39;t be worth it because most of the bismuth would already be melted or condensed. I would only be preventing a small amount of surface oxidation.<br><br><br>b) dry the bismuth powder and remove all the water first. The problem with that is there would be air mixed in with the powder that would immediately react with it. So, I would have to do a few cycles of vacuum/nitrogen pumping to get it all out. <br><br><br>Between these two options, B is the more &quot;proper&quot; one, but its more work. I would also have to do it in something else, like a round bottom, that might potentially be destroyed. In my opinion, it was much better to do it in a disposable test tube, which required nothing more than a blowtorch and it let me skip a proper drying step. The oxidation was actually still minimal. The first one I did was good, I just didnt melt it enough in the second batch. Nitrogen or argon wouldn&#39;t have prevented that either.<br><br><br>EDIT: I also didn&#39;t try flux, because on a small scale test the bismuth didn&#39;t come together. However, on this larger (but still small) scale, boric acid probably could&#39;ve worked if I dried the bismuth.", "comment_date": "2019-03-05T16:57:12Z", "likes_count": 212}, {"comment_by": "HelpMeUnderstand", "comment_text": "Your life sounds really complicated...", "comment_date": "2019-03-05T16:55:08Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Craig Jukes", "comment_text": "From the battle of waterloo hosted by Sean Bean...to this...

It&#39;s also sometimes used as a non toxic substitute for lead in glass making.<br><br><br>I&#39;ve been experimenting with developing ceramic glazes containing bismuth compounds and could be worth playing around with if you want to do something interesting with the bismuth you&#39;ve collected. <br><br><br>Currently the best results to produce iridescence begins by taking a high alkaline Ferro Frit 3110/4110, adding 4% additional 200mesh silica, 6% Kaolin, adding some colourants such as cobalt oxide, copper oxide and even silver nitate and bismuth nitrate between 1-4% of each, producing very different results depending on the ratios of the colourants.<br><br><br>The busmith I think is Bismuth(III) nitrate pentahydrate, I made it by dissolving a chunk of bismuth in nitric acid, drying and recovering the crystals. Silver nitate was produced the same way but with silver instead, the nitate salts are needed so they can be dissolved in water and properly dispersed with the glass mixture.<br><br><br>Everything is dissolved in water and painted on bisque ceramics and fired to 1060c to form the glass. When it comes out, it looks really boring like nothing has happened. I then take the kiln to 800c at which point I remove as much oxygen from the kiln as possible using LPG vented in via a bunsen burner with the vents closed through one of the spy holes, the kiln is turned off but the gas is still reducing the atmosphere and I let it run for about half an hour, the temperature usually reduces a hundred degrees. Through this the glass is soft and the removal of the oxygen in the atmosphere reduces the metals in the glass mixture, causing nanoscopic beads of metal to pool at the top layer of the glass. At least this is my guess and seems to be shown from the handful of papers I could find which scanned similar results under an electron microscope.<br><br><br>This ends up creating stunning lustre/iridescent effects as you would find on butterfly wings. Bismuth creates its characteristic rainbow effects, silver creates cyan blues and purples similar to butterfly wings, copper goes from red through to metallic copper and cobalt produces intense blues and purples.<br><br><br>This produces lustre ceramics and some pretty wonderful effects.

If the cast has enough heat permeability, or even direct transferability, you should be able to pour the mold but keep rings of it hotter than others, producing the rainbow-like gradient. Inversely, insulation could also work, but I think heating would be more controllable.

You are brilliant, and your videos demonstrate how patient and smart you are when it comes to chemistry. But I will kindly say, you need to study up on working with metal. Having a solid knowledge of chemistry isn&#39;t as universal when you start to experiment with other mediums, because you need to have a very solid understanding of how these materials behave under all sorts of different circumstances. Which will absolutely come with time and experience, so don&#39;t be discouraged. I did notice quite a few things you did that had clear and dramatic effect on your yields and results. Here&#39;s some tips based on my own experience. Try melting the metal under an inert gas, or a vacuum, after you drive off as much water as possible without oxidizing it too bad. A vacuum will lower the melting point, and keep away anything that reacts with it, including water. But use a vacuum with caution, because I have never melted bismuth under one, and I have no idea what all will happen. Nitrogen or argon will work best I think. For making a plaster mold, you 100% NEED to make it a liquid. Not a paste. I&#39;m actually kind of surprised that the mold didn&#39;t crack on you, or cause a more violent steam explosion. But this is probably because it was a one sided mold, and not an internal three dimensional one. Next time, make a nice syrup thick plaster slurry. Take your tablet and glue it to a board, tape or glue a round open cookie cutter around it (or any open circle made of metal sheet), and pour the plaster over it. Let it dry completely before you break it out, and never ever wash the mold with water. This is why you didn&#39;t capture any detail. Use a brush very carefully to remove any excess material, but remember how delicate the mold is. Drive off the moisture with your oven, but cast the metal right when you take it out (keep it in the oven long enough to leave no possibility of water remaining). The heat will stop the bismuth from pulling up, and allow it to fall into the mold better. Other than these things, you did an amazing job. I always look forward to watching your new uploads!
