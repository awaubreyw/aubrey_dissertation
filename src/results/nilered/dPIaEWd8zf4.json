Yeshua is coming very soon. Are you ready?<br><br>- \uc608\uc288\uc544\ucee4\ubc0d / Yeshua Coming -<br><br>In 2004, there was a visit from Yahweh the Creator. He called me directly and said this in Korean.<br><br>you have to go there The time has come for the world to close, and my sons and daughters still don&#39;t know me.<br><br>Since then, for about 18 years, God has been with me and showed me a lot of visions through dreams.<br><br>I had no idea at the time what the word of God meant. However, since 2009, God poured out the Holy Spirit like a waterfall, showing all the signs of Yeshua&#39;s coming, what is happening around the world.<br><br>Yahweh the Creator focused on me the rapture from beginning to end.<br><br>Do you know this facts?<br><br>1. The clouds in the sky around the world are gradually coming down to the ground.<br><br>2. Every day we see a super moon, a super sun.<br><br>3. Looking at the pink sky.<br><br>4. Chemtrails are being sprayed in the sky around the world 24/7 like crazy.<br><br>5. The moon is spinning round and round.<br><br>Unless you are not blind, this fact can now be seen with your eyes in the sky.<br><br>From 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, God showed me the vision that Nibiru is coming continuously.<br><br>Nibiru is a being of light like the sun, and God showed me that Nibiru is a small system. There are several planets in Nibiru, one the white planet and the other the red planet.<br><br>Now you are looking at the pink sky. This pink sky will, in time, appear very thick in skies around the world. When that time comes, even the air in the sky around the world will appear purple. At that point, the axes of the north and south poles are change. At that point, the Earth around the world will be completely twisted and crushed. A cataclysm will occur on this earth, and that point will be when the clouds have come down to the very surface, and that it is just one step before the coming of Yeshua.<br><br>Yeshua is the real God.<br><br>He is the creator of all things and is the eternal God.<br><br>Yeshua is coming very soon. God showed me vision that Yeshua God has received a letter of permission from Yahweh to bring your brides from the earth. Now, in the closet in heaven, God showed me that the linen clothes for the brides of Yeshua have been taken out of the closet.<br><br>You will now see two suns rising and setting here and there very soon, you will see two moons in the sky, and you will see a very large white planet floating in the sky. God showed me the vision that when we see with our eyes a very large white planet in the sky, we enter Rosh Hashana (The Wedding of Yeshua).<br><br>There is going to be a rapture very soon.<br><br>Satan knows everything, and both Satan and evil spirits know that there will be a rapture very soon. They are now administering the Viper Snake Injection, which is part of Satan&#39;s mark, fighting for one second, and now they are administering it very urgently to children under the age of five.<br><br>Fighting for a second, the world is in a great spiritual warfare, and Satan and the evil spirits have become even more urgent now because the rapture is coming very soon.<br><br>Because all souls that can be captured must be captured.<br><br>I heard the direct voice of Satan. In Korean, Satan said:<br><br>Yahweh! All the souls we wanted are all left on this earth. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha~.<br><br>Those on the plane of the rapture and the ship of the rapture in Yeshua Coming, under any circumstance and environment, do not eat, do not inject, do not receive. I recommend that you keep your human identity to the end in any situation and environment.<br><br>God show me the vision that Yeshua God treats the brides of Yeshua who will be raptured, the sons and daughters of God recorded in the book of life, as kings and queens.<br><br>I encourage you to keep your faith in Yeshua until the end. Stay alive until the very end.<br><br>Only Yeshua! \uc544\uba58", "comment_date": "2022-08-31T08:02:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aadi Chaturvedi", "comment_text": "What i read as the title-<br>\u201cThe Iodine Meth\u201d", "comment_date": "2022-08-31T04:17:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jakee", "comment_text": "Meth", "comment_date": "2022-08-30T16:45:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert C.

The only difference is that we call it evaporation (or nilation) when the atmospheric pressure is below the characteristic vapor pressure (at the temperature of the liquid), while boiling (or sublimation) happens above.<br>Here&#39;s 4 fun facts that follow from that:<br><br>(Reminder: Whatever we call the process, it only proceeds forwards wile the partial pressure of the vapor is below the characteristic vapor pressure.)<br>Fact 1: The backwards process (that proceeds when the partial pressure of the vapor is above the characteristic vapor pressure) is always called condensation - or inverse sublimation.<br><br>Fact 2: This is a somewhat arbitrary distinction, which does not affect how the process happens, but it is a good predictor of how it ends. With boiling, the atmospheric pressure is below the characteristic vapor pressure and the partial pressure of the vapor (being one contributor to the atmospheric pressure) has to be below or equal to the atmospheric pressure - meaning that the process continues until the material has completely entered the vapor phase. In the case of evaporation, the vapor will continue to (usually slowly) collect until its partial pressure reaches the material&#39;s characteristic vapor pressure. In a closed container, this means the process stops once it has reached that equilibrium point; in a process open to the atmosphere the vapor will diffuse away and the process will resume again - which continues until all material has entered the vapor phase.<br><br>Fact 3: If you have some evaporating/boiling material in a closed container, what the process is classified as can change during the process (if you have both a low enough initial atmospheric pressure and enough material). If you start out with an atmospheric pressure below the boiling point it&#39;s first called boiling. At the end, the process will stop if the partial pressure of the vapor reaches the characteristic vapor pressure - if you have enough material. But the vapor pressure of the evaporating material is only one contributor to the total atmospheric pressure. Therefore, unless you evacuate out every last molecule of other gases, the  atmospheric pressure at the end of the process will be above the characteristic vapor pressure, which means the process ends as evaporation. That means somewhere during the process it changed from being clasified as boiling to evaporation.<br><br>Fact 4: As far as I know, the bubbling that we associate with boiling is not a characteristic of the boiling process, but a characteristic of how we heat the liquid to the boiling point. In the vast majority of cases we suspend the liquid in some container (you&#39;d really have to go out of your way not to). This container both provides nucleation sites where the liquid can very easily start a microscopic bubble of vapor; and usually the majority of the heat flows into the material through the container (meaning the temperature at that surface is higher than throughout the rest of the liquid - the majority of which could stay below the boiling point). Spontaneously forming a microscopic bubble in the bulk of the liquid is possible, but a much rarer occurrence. If for some reason the bubbles do not form it is possible to superheat the liquid to above its boiling point. But in that case the vapor escaping from the surface of the liquid will still fall under the definition of &quot;boiling&quot;.", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T16:05:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brett", "comment_text": "The way the cold affects it is pretty cool", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T14:00:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maurice Bakker", "comment_text": "So i might be super wrong here. <br><br>But isnt it techinally more like evaporation in both cases ?, <br>since boiling occurs throughout the liquid forming gas bubbles and &quot;escaping&quot; the liquid<br><br>However with a solid would go through this process a lot of the gas would be trapped inside the solid, until it reaches the surface of the solid. <br>Increasing the pressure inside the solid increasing the boiling point.

Either way, the vapor is coming off of the material, whether it equals the outside pressure or not.  My guess is, the only reason we have a different word for boiling is because boiling is characterized by bubbles forming inside of the liquid.  The pressure inside these bubbles is dictated by the vapor pressure.  If the vapor pressure is less than the outside pressure, then the bubbles collapse, making boiling impossible below the boiling point temperature.  This also means that solids can&#39;t boil because they&#39;re so rigid, that they cannot have any bubbles forming inside of them.  This is why no distinction is needed.

The evaporation we perceive as boiling is actually the same process, it&#39;s just that we force a larger amount of particles to attain this same level of kinetic energy to undergo the transition by heating the liquid to a certain temperature (based on the given external pressure, usually 1 atm). The particles that reach this temperature are all located at the liquid&#39;s interface with the heat source, which is typically underneath the liquid&#39;s vessel, and since the vapour pressure is high enough at this temperature to resist re-entering the liquid phase, the vapour becomes visible as bubbles that rise from the source of heat towards the liquid/gas interface above. Fundamentally the processes of evaporation and boiling of a liquid into a gas are one and the same and this same logic applies to the difference you are suggesting between &quot;nilation&quot; and sublimation. In reality they are the same process, it&#39;s just that in one case ( as it is for boiling) 100% of the particles acquire sufficient energy to transition versus a much smaller fraction of particles when the temperature is below the point on the transition curve of the P/T phase diagram (as for evaporation). Same would go for sublimation but solids do not allow the movement of gas through them the way liquids do so we do not perceive a difference between sublimation at or below the sublimation point temperature other than the rate at which gas is produced.

Worse, science teachers didn&#39;t know.   In first year, our science teacher was pretty good - knew his science, and knew how to teach.  But he got the sack for showing some boys in a rocket club how to make rocket fuel out of paint.   He was replaced by a complete dill, who didn&#39;t know that sand was essentially silicon dioxide.  A boy asked (deliberately, to show how dumb the teacher was) if Japan was so competitive in transistors as they had the best silicon mines.   Teacher said yes.  One day he announced to the class that there are 3 states of matter - solid, liquid, and gas, and these exist in any substance in sequence as temperature is raised..   I forthwith stated that there is a 4th state in that sequence - plasma.   He denied it and disciplined me.  Actually, if you raise the temperature enough, there is a state beyond plasma, but that wasn&#39;t generally known when I was in school.<br>As for the effect of pressure on boiling temperature, that was WELL beyond what that idiot knew, but most boys in the class knew, because of the pressurised cooling systems in motor cars.   <br>The textbook said that friction is proportional to the force pushing two surfaces together multiplied by a constant that depends on the surfaces.  The friction is independent of the area in contact.  When this moron of a teacher said that in class, a boy said &quot;So, Sir, wide tires on cars are a waste of money?  The grip on the road will be the same?&quot;   Teacher said yes.    He was wrong of course, because tires aren&#39;t normally working under sliding friction, which was the only form the book covered, but it didn&#39;t say so.   Which most boys knew, due to the use of very wide racing tires at Speedway.<br>We used to laugh at him, but he never really knew why.  If he saw a boy smiling, he got mad, as he thought the boy was laughing at him again.<br><br>As for Wikipedia (quoted by NileRed), if you rely on that, you are dumber than that science teacher.

It can work that way, but often doesn&#39;t.

Common misconceptions get reinforced, and newly understood facts get suppressed.   <br>This does not mean Wikipedia is worthless though.

It would make navigating phase maps so much more intuitive especially for students. But I\u2019m general I think it\u2019d be healthier for our thought process to draw a stronger distinction between a concept that effectively describes atoms escaping from a solid in the form of gas as the rate at which a probable occurrence MIGHT happen, one which has a positive correlation with temperature; from a concept that is meant to describe a critical threshold in temperature after which matter can no longer exist as a solid and MUST transition to a gas in order to exceed it. <br><br>A question like \u201chow does increasing the temperature of CO2 effect the rate of sublimation?\u201d Is now left a bit harder to answer. In once instance the rate of sublimation is dependent on the temperature within the system of the solid CO2 and can be accelerated by directly increasing the temperature of the CO2 system itself. In the other instance the rate of sublimation can only be further influenced by an increase of the surrounding system\u2019s temperature as the temperature of the solid CO2 system cannot exceed its sublimation point. This is as to say that in a hypothetical block of CO2, of which I can precisely and uniformly manipulate its temperature,  the rate of sublimation for instance one can be increased or decrease by adjusting the temperature within the range of values at which CO2 exists as a solid. If one was to manipulate a block of CO2 as described, precisely and uniformly, when applied to instance two which describes a forcible transition from solid to gas upon surpassing the sublimation temperature, increasing the temperature of the solid CO2 would have no effect because the CO2 would have all sublimated instantly upon exceeding the sublimation temperature. <br>Of course this is only a thought experiment I\u2019m using to further drive home the point that these are two very different concepts that come with their own set of connotations that we are sloppily describing with the same term.", "comment_date": "2020-11-10T09:29:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SB C", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t want to hear it I&#39;m....

Inventing a 3rd term is really adding more confusion, not clearing anything up.  The reason is that in the sciences we like to be a bit more specific about grouping similar things together.  We observe patterns, and group them together for utility.  Unless I&#39;m missing something fairly basic here, there&#39;s nothing fundamentally different happening between evaporation from a liquid, and evaporation happening from a solid. <br><br>We differentiate between boiling/melting/condensing/freezing because these are all different phase transitions.  Something similar happens when creating a plasma, or bose-einstein condensate, and we categorize all of these as different states of matter.  If you want to get deep into physics, there&#39;s a 6th, which is a quark-gluon plasma, where particles aren&#39;t even bound by the strong nuclear force anymore.<br><br>So if that&#39;s fundamentally the same process, why invent a 3rd term for the same process?  The two are directly related, so we should use the same word for them.  Words are really just tools and &quot;convenient ways of thinking of things&quot; rather than reality itself.  In both processes we have a state of matter turning into a vapor.  Both happen below the &quot;normal&quot; transition temperature, so I think it makes sense to related them together.<br><br>Now...  I suppose what you&#39;re saying is that the important part here is the transition from one state of matter to another should use a different word, just like we do for other transitions.  If you wanted to to that, the word should be more related to evaporation, not sublimation, since, as I understand it evaporation is what&#39;s really happening here is a transition from a solid into a vapor.  Maybe something more like sevaporation, so the concept of evaporation is still evident, but distinguish it from a liquid evaporation?  Or at least something based on the root word &quot;vaporation&quot;, to connect it to vaporizing, which is what&#39;s going on here.", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T02:16:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marden Ofugi", "comment_text": "Very interesting!

This means the phase change rate is localized causing bubbling. There are different types of boiling: film boiling and nucleate bubbling and are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated by the rates causing bubbling or simply instantly vaporizing at the surface. If the rate is slow enough, no bubbles will be observed. Sublimation is the change from solid to vapour directly, which in this case is happening in concert with the evaporation as the heating does not happen slowly enough to form a stable liquid before evaporating.

The reason evaporation is different from boiling is because evaporation only applies to the surface turning to gas and boiling applies to any part of the liquid becoming gas. And the reason we don&#39;t need a new word for sublimation under boiling point is because only the surface becomes gas due to slow conduction of heat (liquid can transfer heat through convection). Therefore resulting in the same thing and no need to confuse people to terms that have no observable differences. Honestly, think of writing a lab report and try describing what an unknown solid is doing. For liquid, if you see bubbles appear rapidly and floating to the surface without prior mixing with other chemicals, you know it is boiling. If the liquid sits there with smoke floating out, you know it is evaporation. But for solid, should I write about seeing sublimation or &#39;nilation&#39;. Because they are same thing, there is no such need for new names. If you really like new names so much, you should name both sublimation processes and categorize under sublimation, so only the people who study these stuff need to learn the words and the common folk can stick to sublimation.", "comment_date": "2020-02-25T03:21:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HariGtt", "comment_text": "AFAIK in spanish evaporation is used for both liquid and solid", "comment_date": "2020-02-24T22:54:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Outsider", "comment_text": "Go to College, kids.", "comment_date": "2020-02-24T11:42:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Hart", "comment_text": "Could this be used safely in paint?

From memory I recall the melting point (at atmospheric pressure) was a bit higher than that of water, while it&#39;s boiling point was surprisingly low (certainly less than 200C).  There was never any question that the liquid phase exists, but the important point was that the sublimation occurs below the melting point.  (and hence needed to be expected while conducting our investigation).  It was around this time we also explored the properties of sulphur.  The way that behaves is even more crazy ,considering it&#39;s an element,  the liquid phase actualy turning more viscous as it gets hotter.   I gather that schools nowadays are very light on practical experimentation (health and safety gone mad) which is a shame because it&#39;s the experience of practical stuff that really sinks in.

VLE (vapor liquid equilibrium) is very similar to SVE (solid vapor equilibrium) in that they occur through points on a phase diagram (pressure, temp dependency), but to my knowledge these are not distinct phases like in pool boiling that are dependent on the temperature gradient, rather the temperature gradient does not affect sublimation in easily detectable, separable stages. thus the need for this term has not yet arisen, but I would assume there are thermodynamic research labs that study this phenomenon!!<br>you should check out this research from the University of Minnesota. <a href=\"https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/185589/Morgan_umn_0130E_17541.pdf?sequence=1\">https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/185589/Morgan_umn_0130E_17541.pdf?sequence=1</a><br>anyways I love your videos, they\u2019re awesome. hope you are well!", "comment_date": "2020-01-08T23:10:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "worddunlap", "comment_text": "A sublime video?", "comment_date": "2020-01-08T21:45:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Toyota Summer Sales Event", "comment_text": "Your voice reminds me slightly of solar sands, awesome video too.", "comment_date": "2020-01-08T21:28:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spancer", "comment_text": "Why is it that I am learning more about chemistry in a few hours from this than spending a whole year in a class?", "comment_date": "2020-01-08T18:50:13Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Marie Fiction", "comment_text": "Sparkly kill juice, I want to bleed this shit", "comment_date": "2020-01-08T17:37:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NuD AKA Fondu", "comment_text": "Iodine meth", "comment_date": "2020-01-08T11:46:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hordix 721", "comment_text": "is that slag?", "comment_date": "2020-01-08T06:06:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Deviljoegaming", "comment_text": "Ohh i read iodine meth", "comment_date": "2020-01-08T04:52:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SC TV", "comment_text": "Since Iodine has the potential to sublimate and evaporate depending on pressure, temperature, etc, I guess both the textbooks were right together but not separate.

Those are single component phase diagram, and strictly speaking do not represent water-air or iodine-air system (where air is a mixture of gasses). Under an atmosphere, single component phase diagram, have to be used carefully (or just go with multi component phase diagram, but good luck with that).<br><br>Water under an air atmosphere and at temperatures below boiling is in a single phase, only if there is not enough water to begin with. When you enter the room in your apartment, you can see all that single phase water vapour. OK, maybe not see it, but it is there.<br><br>Given enough water below boiling point, it will never be in a single phase. It is just that we don&#39;t see that gas phase. As temperature rises, the equilibrium phases of water (not considering many different ice phases) will be: gas/solid (T&lt;273.15K) -&gt; gas/liquid/solid (T=273.15K) -&gt; gas/liquid (273.15K&lt;T&lt;373.15K), until at high enough temperatures water turns to single gas phase. The useful information from single component phase diagram is the partial pressure of a gas phase. This shortcut is possible as gasses under these conditions are non-interacting and close to ideal gases .<br><br>Further complication arise between melting point and triple point temperatures. In that region, partial pressure of a gas phase cannot be read from the phase diagram, as equilibrium between the stable phase (e.g. liquid water) and a gas phase is not drawn. This is because liquid/gas equilibrium at those temperatures is not present in the single component system (e.g. isolated system with only only water, no other gases).", "comment_date": "2020-01-06T09:19:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angel Sandoval", "comment_text": "I thought it said The idion meth", "comment_date": "2020-01-06T04:16:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steve", "comment_text": "I wonder if there is the possibility for a material that sublimates into plasma (this is a joke I understand plasma)", "comment_date": "2020-01-06T01:48:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OceanMan", "comment_text": "You should try putting iodine in a vacuum", "comment_date": "2020-01-05T12:27:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Adam", "comment_text": "New word for sublime; I choose a synonym of sublime, choose mainly for humorous effect and ability to be incorporated into sick new rhymes, rather than root meaning: Divine or divination.", "comment_date": "2020-01-04T12:04:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Morris", "comment_text": "But can you distill it in a condenser.", "comment_date": "2020-01-02T04:51:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcus W", "comment_text": "That sounds way too much like Annihilation", "comment_date": "2019-12-29T08:46:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tracy Bowling", "comment_text": "Bc we \u2764 you- of course \u2764 your new term.

The phase transformaion between solid and gas generally only occurs on the surface, since nucleation in such case requirs not only extremely difficult-to-create temperature distribution that might be possible by focusing multiple laser beams, but also a sufficiently low \u0394G (or high in negative) that overcomes the energy needed to form new surfaces out of nowhere while creating a space to hold those newly formed gas, which is probably inplausible since solids hardly deform. However nucleation in liquid-to-gas phase transition requires significantly higher (or lower in negative) \u0394G owing to the liquids&#39; ability to deform given a pressure gradient. Thus the term &quot;boiling&quot; is specified to the phenomenon that bubbles forming in a liquid due to nucleation when the conditions, including the equilibrium vapor pressure of that liquid is greater than the environmental pressure at the nucleation site, are met. And since solid-to-gas phase change may usually be dscribed as, without extra nucleation process, the substance on its surface simply moved from point A to point B on a phase diagram, either vertically (vapor pressure &lt; equilibrium VP), horizontally (increasing in temperature with the ending point equilibrium in gas phase under same pressure), or some combination of both, I see no purpose to seperate sublimation process into two categories.

If the pressure is lowered does it break? Deformation.<br>5. If the temperature is raised, does it change from solid to liquid? Melting.<br>6. If the temperature is raised, does it change from liquid to gas? Boiling<br>7. If the temperature is raised, does it change from solid to gas? Evaporation.<br>8. If the temperature is lowered does it change from liquid to solid? Freezing.<br>9. If the temperature is lowered, does it change from gas to liquid?  Condensation.<br>10. If the temperature is lowered, does it change from gas to solid? Cyrogenation. <br><br>Terms should be made using water as the basis for temperature, because it is also the basis of our measurement of the gram. Is from a cubic centimeter of water. We use gram often when talking about mass. These changes greatly affect the volume of the object but the gram would be the best way to account for the changes happening to it. With water we observe similar changes happening when heat is taken away or given but there are no conflicts at atmospheric pressure. Which I feel does happen with iodine and that is why it&#39;s bad to make a term based on iodine&#39;s problems.<br><br>The terms should also use 1 atmospheric pressure as the base line because we live on earth and the times we&#39;d practically experience anything else would happen with the inclusion or exclusion of water. [We lose water in the air as we go up into the sky and we gain more water as we go down into the ocean.] <br><br>The situations we experience with Iodine is Evaporation. Not boiling or melting. Similar to how people say it sublimates except that sublimation is a term that I feel goes against scientific uniformity. As you also stated I feel like everything can evaporate but at different rates, at such such points that when compared to water&#39;s temperature when solid that it&#39;s almost non existent. It&#39;s not remarkable at all that solids become liquid when heat is added. Vaporizing however is a pretty big deal and as you stated the bonds of something has to be pretty weak for it to visibly vaporize from a solid at freezing the freezing level of water.  Heating it up does make the process happen faster but that isn&#39;t remarkable either as most substances on the planet would react the same way to being heated. It&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s bonds are so weak that at base atmospheric pressure it barely can keep together that makes it remarkable/different.<br><br>By correctly using terms to explain the differences of things, people can relay that information more reliable. Like if it turned into a liquid from a solid at the same freezing temperature as water. That&#39;s pretty remarkable. Nobody cares at that point if adding pressure or removing pressure will change this, unless it too requires very little change and so it becomes less certain that it is the key factor. Usually when it comes to observing, a person tries to limit the observations to 1 variable changing under a controlled environment. While other variables can be changed later when it comes to making basic terms, this is how most scientists would do it. <br><br>So basically. Iodine is remarkable because at atmospheric pressure it requires no added joules at water&#39;s freezing point to go from solid to gas. This change I would simply call evaporation as it vaporizes itself directly to gas. Heat helps but is not required at this point for the same mass of iodine to completely vaporize. Heat is part of the factor when it comes to boiling, which is not required for iodine to reach a gaseous state. This is basically what the video is about.

OK... so basically what the potential energy curve is saying is that the amplitude of the quantized atomic vibrations increases if you add the right amount of energy to the material. I think you can imagine the vibrations to be like atoms being connected by springs. At the bottom, the anharmonic curve is approximately parabolic, so that&#39;s why the spring model, which has a harmonic curve works. Also the energy levels of possible vibrations are so fine, that it apperas like the atoms would oscillate around continuously or smoothly. If the vibrations are transfered to neighboring atoms in a crystal, these vibrations are called phonons... ok so much for the scientific facts in a few sentences.<br><br>First question: The atomic vibration frequency of almost all organic molecules (crystalline or not) is in the range of 10^12-10^14 Hz which is equal to IR-radiation. So by resonace these Materials can be heated. But how come so many people and websites say that by heating a material the frequency of atomic vibrations gets larger? It would basically mean that the characteristic absorption bands would shift to different frequencies in IR-spectroscopy if you heated a small sample of the material by that statement.<br><br>Second question: What is the vibration frequency of metals? Is it also in the range of 10^12-10^14 Hz? In my opinion it has to be, because metals absor IR and turn them into optical phonons.<br><br>Third question: What are the mechanics of heat conduction in amorphous materials like glass and amorphous polystyrene for example? The vibrations are not called phonons anymore in amorphous materials. I have found they are called &quot;diffusons&quot; but the explanation for conduction in these materials was very unclear for me.<br><br>Thanks :))))", "comment_date": "2017-09-14T07:20:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Doctorine", "comment_text": "This may be a dumb question but...

This is what is represented on a phase diagram.<br><br>The boiling point simply describes a set of temperature and atmospheric pressure for which the vapour pressure of a liquid is equal to the atmospheric pressure, <b>an equilibrium point</b> .<br><br>From a thermodynamic stand point, boiling is not something remarquable.<br>Boiling is just the fast evaporation of a liquid at it&#39;s equilibrium point.<br>Vaporisation is the general term for the transition from a liquid to a solid. In some context, it can be distinguised as either evaporation or boiling.<br>Sublimation is the general term for the transition from a solid to a gaz.  As far as I know no differentiation exist for different kind of sublimation.<br><br>In the case of iodine, what we witness is a fast sublimation from non-equilibrium conditions due to the high vapour pressure of iodine.<br>For dry ice, we have sublimation from an equilibrium state (vapour pressure of CO2 is the same as atmospheric pressure and temperature of the dry ice stays the same during the whole process).<br><br>I think the reason why we have different terms for boiling and evaporation is more of a practical one than a theoretical one. We can see a difference between boiling water and evaporating water, but there is no visual cue between sublimation and &quot;nilation&quot;.<br><br>So I&#39;d argue that we&#39;re not missing a term for describing a change from solid to gas. If we want to follow your logic and be rigorous, we&#39;d have to introduce another term for the sublimation at equilibrium. In such a case I&#39;d like to reserve the term <i>SuperSamation</i> :p<br><br>Otherwise, very nice video.
