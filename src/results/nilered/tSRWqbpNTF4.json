I am currently trying to extract neodymium from magnets. after lots of steps, I have reason to believe I am left with Nd2O3, Fe203, and some Ni2O3. Most of the chlorides and other compounds of iron, nickel and neodymium share extremely similar properties. I referred to my merc index and it stated that neodymium sulfate is created by reacting Nd2O3 with hot concentrate H2SO4. This lead me to believe that the reaction is rather slow with dilute cold acid. The iron and Nickel salts should dissolve in dilute acid however. I was wondering if you would give my your input... If this does work, I can react the Nd2O3 that didn&#39;t dissolve with HCl and electrolyse the chloride formed to obtain the pure metal. Parts of this are my own processes, so if this works, It could be a new viable way to recycle neodymium magnets. I am only\u00a015 and LOVE chemistry,\u00a0Please respond.
