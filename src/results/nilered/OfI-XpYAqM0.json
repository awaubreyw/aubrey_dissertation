My reasons for buying the power was for a painting experiment. So I have not purchased the resin. I personally did not find the glow powder that expensive if it is a small project although I still have left overs from my project. The one thing is that not all glow powders are equal in quality and I found that by buying a few different types in small quantities to see what glowed the longest and brightest.

The guy in the YouTube video who made &quot;doped zinc sulfide&quot; also mentions he is going to make a VFD display panel. Phosphor is what causes the glow in the dark when hit by ultra violet, you could&#39;ve just bought Phosphor and call it a day. There are many kinds of Phosphor that &quot;luminescence&quot;, the type of &quot;luminescence&quot; you want for glow in the dark toys does not requires Zinc Sulfide. Zinc Sulfide doped with copper is used in applications specifically to cause luminescence due to an electromagnetic field or electrons crashing into the doped Zinc Sulfide. What you just made is specfically called &quot;electroluminescence&quot; and it is very inefficient for using as a &quot;glow in the dark&quot;. &quot;Electroluminescence&quot; requires high voltage AC electricity to cause the doped Zinc Sulfide to &quot;luminescence&quot;, it can however also glow with ultraviolet light but will glow very dimly and is designed not to glow too long, about few seconds it will glow and them stop glowing. &quot;Glow in the dark&quot; stuff which everyone is talking about is called &quot;phosphorescence&quot;. &quot;Phosphorescence&quot; is very efficient to &quot;glow in the dark&quot; and is used for applying to toy&#39;s surfaces to cause the &quot;luminescence&quot; effect when ultraviolet light hits it and can glow as long as 24 hours. So this video is really a big misunderstanding of what exactly &quot;glow in the dark&quot; chemical really is, and 3+ million people are now going to make &quot;Electroluminescence&quot; for making toys glow in the dark when they could&#39;ve just bought a much simpler and cheaper proper chemical of &quot;Phosphorescence&quot;. The worlds most strongest and brightest &quot;Phosphorescence&quot; is &quot;Strontium Aluminate&quot;, Nile should&#39;ve tried making &quot;Strontium Aluminate&quot; instead of Zinc Sulfide doped with copper lmao. But I gotta say thanks to Nile because I couldn&#39;t understand jack nothing what the guy in the youtube was saying and Nile&#39;s tutorial was much better to understood and yes, I am making electroluminescence display panels.", "comment_date": "2021-06-20T21:55:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Under Animtions", "comment_text": "Green baby<br>I-is that a JoJo reference?!?!?", "comment_date": "2021-06-19T07:23:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "david is ez", "comment_text": "<b>GLOWING BABY</b>", "comment_date": "2021-06-19T06:56:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kathy Robichaux", "comment_text": "Oh hey, those are king cake babies!

ZnS precipitates.  Wash several times with distilled water to remove sodium nitrate, filter, resuspend in DH2O, then add trace copper nitrate and/or silver nitrate solution.  Boil dry, then calcine the solids at &gt; 1000c in a kiln for several hours in a covered porcelain or fireclay crucible.  Voila!  Doped ZnS.  For red glow powder, substitute strontium nitrate for zinc nitrate.  Copper doping results in a lime green fluorescence and phosphorescence.  Copper activated/Silver quenched ZnS results in a bright blue fluorescence with no phosphorescence.

Enough DCM (general reagent grade, Acros) was added to cover the Pasanate Glows. The mixture was then stirred until the polymer dissolved. The resultant solution of polymer dissolved in DCM was found to exhibit fluorescent qualities (evident in a dark room) after it was exposed to light (direct sunlight or a strong flashlight). The resulting solution was transferred to a glass-stoppered conical flask, as I have to explore a means of separating the fluorescent agent from the polymer dissolved in DCM. Once I have worked out a means of isolating the fluorescent agent from the polymer-DCM I&#39;ll update and publish the report on SciMad. Considering that the fluorescent agent did not precipitate out from the dissolved polymer in DCM, I doubt that its identity is ZnS, which is insoluble in non-polar organic solvents. Surely, if the fluorescent agent was ZnS,  it would crashed out of the DCM solvent?", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T16:53:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DoggosAreNeat", "comment_text": "Dio.....", "comment_date": "2020-06-13T16:49:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OrdinaryLiVv", "comment_text": "So Nile, you know how growing up we all used to say how cheez whiz was almost plastic.

Obviously you would never use thermal epoxy for this use but Linus likes to test things in a normal person manner to see if jank stuff works or not. The CPU used was an older cheap AMD FX CPU which was known for getting hot though with the Thermal Limit of 70 C, I don&#39;t see why it had that reputation considering Modern CPUs limit at 100 C before thermal throttling occurs but for obvious reasons, he didn&#39;t want to use a modern cpu because first gen Ryzen and newer models are great CPUs and gluing a cooling solution on to one would be wasteful though he did manage to remove the cpu from the cooling solution via hammer and chisel damaging both but leaving them in a working condition.", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T22:53:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Devansh Gupta", "comment_text": "Chemistry is dangerous tho", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T22:36:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u7948\u308a / ino", "comment_text": "\u201cIt was breaking down again the moment it was formed\u201d<br>a metaphor of my life", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T22:03:16Z", "likes_count": 637}, {"comment_by": "Robert Hastings", "comment_text": "Thought you might find this video interesting, man.

It is e.g. used in emergency exit signs or other related safety phosphors or in toys, as it is non-toxic and high-temperature stable. Besides the reduction step from Eu3+ to Eu2+, it is not really difficult to synthesize. The precursor can be synthesized from the nitrates and urea in a furnace at 600 \u00b0C. Due to the reductive atmosphere of the gaseous sideproducts, some of the Eu3+ is already reduced. Afterwards, the precursor can be annealed at higher temperatures (~1000 \u00b0C) under Ar/H2 atmosphere in order to reduce the remaining Eu3+ to Eu2+ and to form the final product.

The ends of the tube furnace can be closed with a rubber stopper with thin glass bends and sealed with cotton or silica wool. However, I also use ammonia by passing it under reduced pressure through a tube furnace.
