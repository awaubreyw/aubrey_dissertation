Though the chemicals used are not extremely deadly, and some parents had problems with us doing it, we did still practice good respects. Even the class clown was sufficiently amazed that he kept his cool. He was one of the three who went on into a biochem field on graduation and Uni. Hands on labs were the only thing keeping me in school. It is nice to see these things on Youtube.
