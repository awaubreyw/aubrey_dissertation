He is good and even though we have sinned so much and even though this world refuses him so much He still stretches out His hand for us. If we follow him and do his will, repent, find a truly Biblical Church and be Baptized and put our faith in Jesus Christ for salvation, we can be saved. Not everything is perfect, even for Christians, but the difference is that God is with those that follow truly follow him. He can give us peace in hard times and help us through, he can give us new lives and lead us to better things in a better way, and most importantly, he can give us everlasting life in Heaven. But true faith in Jesus and following God&#39;s way is the only way, and we need him right now. Don&#39;t wait, tomorrow isn&#39;t promised but God does promise one thing, that if we truly follow him, we are saved. So, open up the Bible and seek God, pray to him for help, and ask him into your life and find a Truly Biblical Church. They can help you grow. Just make sure to test all things and make sure you are truly following God. God will show his true believers if they are on the right path.

I think that the alcohol group would then be protonated by HCl and via a nucleophilic substitution reaction (like Sn1 due to the possible resonance forms of the carbocation intermediate) water would be lost sand replaced by chloride. In step 2 the pyridine acts as a base and initiates an elimination (possibly E1 for the same reasons as for Sn1, and especially if the pyridine is dilute). The pyridine abstracts a proton the carbon adjacent to the halogenated carbon and the hydrogen&#39;s electrons are donated to form a carbon-carbon double bond as the chlorine is kicked off as chloride.

The  oxygen on anisole is electron donating making it an ortho/para director. The lone pair from the oxygen can resonate to the para position and this in turn will attack the aldehyde in an electrophilic aromatic substitution. Then a tetrahedral intermediate will be formed which is easily protonated by HCl or phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid protonates the resulting alcohol a second time and now you have a good leaving group. Since this is a benzylic position the reaction should then proceed SN1 and water will leave resulting in a secondary carbocation.

This yields a structure where there are 3 bonds and a positive charge on the oxygen at the phenoxy end and an alcohol where there was previously a protonated carbonyl at the &#39;propanal&#39; end. This structure is then deprotonated at the phenoxy end (by water I assume) to give 4-(1-Hydroxypropyl)phenol. the ether is then reformed via an sn2 reaction where the alcohol at the phenol end attacks the chloromethans to form 1-(4-Methoxyphenyl)1-propanol. The chloride ion generated from protonation of the aldehyde is regenerated into hydrochloric acid by the phosphoric acid. Then we have a condensation reaction via an Sn2 mechanism where the Hydrochloric acid protonates the alcohol on 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)<del>1-propanol followed by the chloride ion attacking that carbon to kick out a water molecule.
