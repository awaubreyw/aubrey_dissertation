I&#39;ve casually asked many people if they know what roach infestations smells like. Not only everyone I asked said no, but they also are not aware that a roach infestation does have a unique smell. Maybe I can smell it better than most people. To me, a roach infestation smells like a combination of honey, sulfur and unscented baby powder all blended together, and it&#39;s mildly irritating.

I work in the manufacturing sector and many companies add in their recruitment procedure a sweat test (commonly touching a polished, clean steel sample)  to avoir recruiting people that have a tendency to oxydize parts. <br>I for example can touch metal parts for months without leaving any oxydized fingerpring marks while my coworker has literally the most corrosive sweat I ever saw, if he touches a sample you can be sure that 48h later the part will be oxydized. <br>I think there might be different sources to investigate there, sweat salts concentration linked to the amount of water consumed and type of food consumed but also the tendency of a person to have a dry skin or sweat from their hands.

First of all, smell is actually just an extension of your sense of taste. They are even essentially the same sense, your nose just operates differently than your tongue. With that in mind, here&#39;s an at home experiment:<br><br>1. Take any kind of coin, doesn&#39;t matter what kind, although if your coin is made of copper it will effect the taste to some degree.<br><br>2. wash it off pretty reasonably thoroughly. This step does not need to be absolutely perfect, the water is to just help in the next step.<br><br>3. Dry it off with something like tissues or paper towels, ideally not a cloth because it could not be totally clean and it could leave behind a taste. Make sure you also have a pretty thick barrier between your skin and the coin while you&#39;re drying it off, several tissues or paper towels matted together for instance. You also want to make sure you&#39;re cleaning the coin thoroughly while drying it off, just to be absolutely certain the coin is totally clean. If you use soap, be extra super thorough doing this to be sure you remove all the soap otherwise it can affect the taste.<br><br>4. After it&#39;s dried off, remain not keeping any contact of the coin to your skin or other parts of your body.<br><br>5. Finally, just... Lick it. Lick the coin. You will notice it will have virtually no taste at all, again unless your coin is made of copper in which case there is a chance there will be a faint copper-y taste not unlike blood.", "comment_date": "2020-04-11T10:35:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Don\u2019t mind me I\u2019m just brushing my teeth", "comment_text": "Don\u2019t you hate the fact that your body is a better chemist than you\u2019ll ever be?

Two things occurred to me when I saw your video.<br>1: You went to a lot of trouble to distill the stuff.<br>2: It made me consider colour perception...<br><br>To explain (thought experiment here):<br>&gt;&gt;&gt; Describe the colour Blue to a blind man. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br>Moving forward, we all know that the sky is blue. Sure about that? Shades of blue notwithstanding. But how do we perceive it? What I call blue may be perceived by your eyes as slightly greener (say) than how my brain interprets it.<br>Just maybe. Perhaps it is all merely subjective. <br>And so, as a corollary to our sense of colour, our sense of smell could conceivably be entirely subjective as well. Just maybe.<br>Your test/guests compared their sensations to what we may all agree upon as &#39;metallic&#39;  What is the yardstick? <br>In the printing industry, colours have a yardstick, and they are standardised by a system known as the Pantone Matching System (or PMS for short, whereby precise blends of Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black inks are mixed or formulated to create a tint which is perceived by humans as a recognisable, universally agreed-upon colour: 100% magenta and 100% yellow produce Red for example: I think it is known as PMS485).<br>Interestingly, a blind man could safely say that PMS485 is Red and be correct, according to the book or color chart. He would also be very handy in a darkroom, with respect I say, but I digress.<br>STOP!<br>Question is this: Now that the colour of Red can be so precisely mixed, how do we know that your perception of red is the same as mine? We agree on the formula yet our personal view of it may be 180 degrees in opposition without us knowing how to disagree. How can we be sure then that my sense of a metallic smell is the same as yours? We all may agree on it, based on our internal library of smell associations, but how can we be sure? How can we empirically standardrise it?  After all, we have been told from birth that &#39;that smell is metallic&#39; or &#39;that thing is red.&#39;<br>Anyhow, your video triggered this thought-provoking string of ideas which I felt that I had to express.

When extremely concentrated they almost all stank terribly, even the rose scent.<br>We had also in the lab a small unit which allowed us to make spray cans.

Pull a partial vacuum on that with the remainder being wet air (you need a source of oxidation for the metal catalyzed reaction, use wet air?).  Use another glass tube and a magnet driven pump (stir bar with aerofoils on a bearing with a magnetic drive on the outside) to provide a flow of nitrogen through the reaction chamber (recirculating loop for the gas flow).  On the output end of the reaction chamber, add a cooled metal container (old cleaned out hardware store container of solvent) with more brass wool for cooling surface area as the receiving flask and a Peltier element and heat sink to provide it with fast cooling.  On the input end of the reaction chamber, spray in the pure 1-octen-3-ol, stoichiometric amounts of oxygen and water directly onto the brass wool.

Many metals/alloys you encounter everyday, often steel or cast iron (or zamak) tend to be of lower quality or made from recycled, especially if they&#39;re dirt cheap items, or even the infamous &quot;chinesium&quot;. What happens is that there&#39;s a small amount of slag or other dissolved impurities in said metal, due to manufacturing process. The amount of slag that can dissolve in metal is extremely small, but in industry since they work with kilotons of metal, the amount is not insignificant. When exposed to a strong acid or even just water corrosion, the metals tend to give off a phosphine-like smell, and I&#39;ve noticed that every time I&#39;ve done reactions involving iron nails, plates or wires, the smell was always present, even when I didn&#39;t touch the metal with my bare hands. The smell appears even when I used different acids (HCl, H2SO4, acetic acid, oxalic acid, phosphoric acid), but only or iron alloys. Neither copper, brass or aluminium gave that smell, although in a few isolated cases a few items made of zamak gave a similar smell (probably because it&#39;s usually made of recycled metals, so they don&#39;t always do quality control there). When I once dissolved some scrap metallic turnings from various metals, I also got that smell, but I&#39;m not sure if it was because they had steel or some phosphorus containing copper/bronze.

I definitely can tell  the difference between iron, copper, zinc, and silver smells. Copper alloys like brass or bronze just smell like copper to me. Since copper and silver have antimicrobial properties, my current best guess (before watching this video) was that it was a product of that phenomenon, especially since the smell tended to be more prominent the longer I hadn&#39;t take a shower.

This is quite difficult to remove from the actual products that I&#39;m trying to make, but the best thing is indeed to remove as much DCM as possible, and extract the crude product with hexanes or petroleum ether. Even though much of the triphenylphosphine oxide is removed in this way, a small amount dissolves in the hexanes / petroleum ether and crystallizes out after removing these solvents. I always use column chromatography to get rid of the last traces of triphenylphosphine oxide.<br>By the way, the brown color of your product is probably also due to (some sort of &quot;polymeric&quot;) triphenylphosphine oxide. When I&#39;m working with this stuff I always get some sticky brown &#39;goo&#39; after removing the DCM.

Well, that metals and salts actually dont have a distinct smell is something I heard from my professor in first semester chemistry but we didnt dive this much into it explaining where the smell comes from. It was more or less a sidenote back then. Nice to see this topic picked up here by you now.<br>To be honest I think 1H-NMR is easyer to read than IR (plus its faster and give you possibly a full structure), but I do like that you added the IR data. I&#39;d love to see this more in future videos. Considering how... messy... the purification was (maybe culumn chromatography would be faster, considering the different solubilitys its at least possible, thats for sure) I am really amazed how clean the IR was. There is clearly some alcohol still left (the OH-Bond is hard to overlook ;) ) but it loks quite well.<br>I&#39;m a little curious now, have you tryed catalyszing the reaction to the ketone by adding graines of iron? I&#39;d imagine if it works on the skin it should work in the flask as well. But on the other hand maybe the &quot;metallic&quot; smell seems metallic because the catalysis isn&#39;t really fast so there wouldn&#39;t be much product.<br>You said you&#39;ve never smelled other persons skinoils on metals? Have you always have had clean coins, ticket automats, tools etc?
