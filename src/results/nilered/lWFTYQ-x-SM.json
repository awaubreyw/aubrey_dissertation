The reason for this is due to kinetics. Although the carbocation has exceptional stability and would be expected to be the major product, it relies on the relatively slow step of the water spontaneously leaving. The SN2 reaction proceeds via an attack by the relatively weak chloride nucleophile but this process can happen much faster. Therefore the reaction mechanism is almost an even split. Sn1 is greater favored due to stability but hindered by a slow leaving step. The sn2 is fast with the attack by the chloride, but does not have the benefit of the stability of resonance. <br><br>This illustrates the importance of kinetics for determining the experimental outcome of a reaction beyond theoretical expectations", "comment_date": "2020-10-23T22:49:40Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Corvus Corax", "comment_text": "Benzylic cation is very stable!", "comment_date": "2020-10-15T13:45:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sjoer van der Ploeg", "comment_text": "Here are my friends telling me the IKEA sump is a bad idea...", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T04:16:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jean-Paul", "comment_text": "I had beef with that bloody chemical during my degree lab work.
