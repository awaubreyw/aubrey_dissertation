My project involved the Sol Gel synthesis of Ba, Co, Fe and Cu-doped alumina foam supports for catalytic applications, e.g. in space thrusters employing a nitrous oxide/CH4 oxidant-fuel  and greenhouse gas (specifically, CH4) abatement. The expanded alumina foams were produced by incorporating a carbohydrate (sucrose) into Al isopropoxide (which is viscous and gel-like), adding aqueous solutions (containing dopant metal species in the form of water-soluble salts; e.g. Ba(NO3)2) to hydrolyse and form finely divided alumina, then calcining the matrix at over 1000 degrees C to sinter the alumina and also oxidise the sucrose to CO2 gas, which expanded the alumna matrix to form a sintered alumina foam with a very high surface area. Maybe this will inspire you to try out a Sol Gel preparation?", "comment_date": "2015-10-02T11:03:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Experiments Int. - Experiments and syntheses", "comment_text": "Nice synthesis!
