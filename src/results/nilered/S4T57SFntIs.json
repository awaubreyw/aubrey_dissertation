I work with sorbents in lab and particularly zeolite for almost 5 years, so here is my tips for using it and not breaking the sorbent layer : 1) you need to pour the sorbents onto filter only in wet state, so before pouring them, you should mix them with distilled water 2) before filtering, you should carefully add water to the column to maximum level, so nothing can break the sorbent layer 3) before filtration you should seal the top of the column to avoid the water from leaking and hit the side of the column with something, that is not gonna break the glass but is definitely hard (for example we used pens or pencils) until bubbles of air will stop coming. This way you will remove any excess air and ensure the proper filtration. We used to assemble dynamic filtration columns for radioactive strontium and caesium with zeolites and other sorbents this way.
