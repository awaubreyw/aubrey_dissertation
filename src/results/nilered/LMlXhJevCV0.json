Doing that was NOT our goal. Once we had the correct range, we wanted to kill enemies quickly with HE (High Explosive) rounds. Our plan was never to wound them with burns; it was to kill them quickly with shrapnel. In an asymmetric war, the weaker side uses stealth and improvised weaponry to make surprise raids on the stronger and inflict casualties. The stronger side uses superior technology and logistics to concentrate massive destructive power on a designated area. The stronger side can also occupy and control more and more of the infrastructure, while denying it to an enemy. It is a war of attrition, in which the stronger side can always win; provided they have the political will to stay the course and keep making life more and more unbearable for the population supporting the enemy. The weaker side can win, if they are willing to endure crippling attacks, tremendous losses and to live in the woods sleeping on, or under, the ground, often for years.

While employed there I worked\u00a0\u00a0in the phos department as a furnace tapper, technician, and furnace chief as well as other jobs. Watching that burn demonstration I could almost sense the smell of that sample as the smoke has a very distinct odor.....at first I thought you had some false phos in the jar as\u00a0it was common to have some fake stuff\u00a0for visual\u00a0demo\u00a0purposes,\u00a0and\u00a0it\u00a0looked very much the same as the\u00a0real stuff did. I&#39;m surprised you have some of the real stuff\u00a0since its was federally deemed a controlled substance as its one of the main ingredients in making methamphetamine (an illegal drug). It looks like what\u00a0you have was\u00a0what we called red phos I&#39;ve seen yellow phos\u00a0which was\u00a0termed white phos\u00a0and from a pilot gas\u00a0slip stream project, that\u00a0produced some\u00a0very purified phos that was as clear as water in its liquid state, so clear in fact you\u00a0had to look close to see the separation line while viewed in a test tube. It was referred as pharmaceutical grade.\u00a0You wouldn&#39;t believe the shit I saw at that plant it was like\u00a0if you could imagine\u00a0working on a different planet. The place just consumed your life... we worked 12 hr shifts and sometimes 16s it was very hot and dirty backbone work. I was around that shit all the time and at one time was a sump pumper for a time and\u00a0that&#39;s all I did was pump the four sumps that belong to these four\u00a0giant electric smelter furnaces.\u00a0FYI\u00a0luckily the\u00a0most I got burned was a hot coke ball that come out of\u00a0a tap hole while metal tapping a furnace and it burned through my fire retardant jacket and burned my forearm I\u00a0still have that scar about the size if a dime,\u00a0but I saw people there who been burned by phos and their scars were disfiguring\u00a0healed\u00a0like melted skin.

Now, this bomb in particular, the M47 bomb, was stated to use either mustard gas or WP as its payload. It is also stated that a WP and jelly-gasoline mix could be used as an incendiary. Now for my question - How would one go about mixing such a bomb when WP catches on fire in the air? I hardly think they mixed it in water as it would weaken the bomb or render it inert and you probably cant just drop the WP in the jelly-gasoline as it would probably ignite the whole mixture as you were mixing it and you would be burnt to a crisp. Anyone has any idea?

The effect was that the mortars exploded over dense populated areas of the Gaza strip, and the results included horrific burns to hundreds of civilians.   Once the phosphorus comes in contact with human skin, it adheres and bonds to the skin, and doesn&#39;t stop burning until the phosphorus is completely consumed.

The Latin word corresponding to Greek Phosphorus is \u201cLucifer.\u201d Phosphorus (Greek \u03a6\u03c9\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 Ph\u014dsphoros), a name meaning \u201cLight-Bringer\u201d, is the Morning Star. When phosphorus is combined with the elements below and carbon, it forms our very DNA.  When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds, including sugars, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, aromatic esters, carotenoids and terpenes. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, and with the addition of sulfur it also forms antibiotics, amino acids, and rubber products. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical-code carriers of life, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the most important energy-transfer molecule in all living cells.  Nucleotides are biological molecules that form the building blocks of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA). Each nucleotide has three components: a phosphate group, a five-carbon sugar, and a nitrogen-containing base. The phosphate groups and the sugars form the backbone of each strand of DNA or RNA. The phosphate is a component of DNA, RNA, ATP, and also the phospholipids that form all cell membranes. Phosphorus (Lucifer) is just the \u2018spark\u2019 in our DNA that makes us fire.     When the 666 of Carbon is combined with the elements above and mixed with Lucifer, AKA Phosp-Horus, we get a combination or reaction of chemical elements that forms DNA and RNA. This magical god given chemical-code carrier is the very code for all life, and of course, it is the number of a man; his number is 6 neutrons, 6 protons, and 6 electrons, Six hundred threescore and six (666).
