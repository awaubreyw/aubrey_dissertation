One thing that\u2019s totally unnecessary but works pretty well for huge crystals. When you recryst leave the solution on the hot plate and let the beaker come down to rt at the same rate as the hot plate cools. This takes much longer but you\u2019ll get huge crystals! Again totally unnecessary but big crystals are pretty awesome.<br><br>Also taking a few TLCs might help you figure out when the rxn is done and give you better yields (or at least save you some time), literature timing is almost never correct.<br><br> Anyway, great video man!", "comment_date": "2018-05-19T03:54:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Scott Roberts", "comment_text": "Awesome video as always!", "comment_date": "2018-05-19T03:47:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Riley", "comment_text": "Or just use Hemp Oil", "comment_date": "2018-05-19T03:45:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moleo", "comment_text": "At around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5aUF8aaFg8&amp;t=4m00s\">4:00</a> when recrystalising, if it was soluble in ethanol, when washing, why not pick some other solvent to &#39;crash out&#39; any dissolved product?  <br><br>(I imagine there is a reason, I&#39;m just unsure why.)", "comment_date": "2018-05-19T03:38:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Perez", "comment_text": "Watching your videos makes me feel like I chose the right degree (Chemistry of course).\u00a0Thank you for\u00a0showing how practical chem can be, which professors\u00a0attempt to do but gets lost\u00a0by all the theories and concepts.", "comment_date": "2018-05-19T03:37:05Z", "likes_count": 350}, {"comment_by": "JamesG", "comment_text": "Very cool.
