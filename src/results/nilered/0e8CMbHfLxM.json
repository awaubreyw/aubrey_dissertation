Edit:How to solve this below<br><br><br>Update: I finally fixed the problem, well it was obvious that I was getting some iron (II) contamination but i didn&#39;t knew were it came from but after some experimenting I found the cause to be my bad quality ferric chloride, it was contaminated with lots of iron (II) plus while it was supposed to be 20% was actually a 32% solution so I ended up with a large excess of uncomplexed iron (II). To avoid this problem in the first place I would recommend to add some hydrogen peroxide to your iron hydroxide to be sure its fully oxidized, It should look reddish not black as in the video. In case your Ferric ammonium citrate ends up like mine it can be fixed easily by adding some hydrogen peroxide drop wise until it becomes slightly brown, then add drop wise a saturated solution of ammonium citrate and mix until it becomes slightly green, let it rest for a few minutes and test the solution, if it keeps turning blue when mixed with the potassium ferricyanide add more Ammonium citrate solution, keep doing this until you no longer get the blue color. Also I made Ferric ammonium oxalate and its much easier to make plus is far more sensitive to light than the citrate, the only problem is that it leaves a rusty tinge on paper so not ideal for cyanotype but amazing for ferric gelatin (holography) experiments.", "comment_date": "2019-08-25T11:11:38Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "KaenRyuu Art", "comment_text": "Can you make gunpowder?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>From clam shell, bat&#39;s pee, charchoal, sugar, and sulfur", "comment_date": "2019-08-19T10:59:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vert World Art", "comment_text": "I am learning so much and your videos are great, subscribed and dinged the bell!", "comment_date": "2019-08-18T16:35:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "-mastyle", "comment_text": "does this also count as me studying for my chemistry test?", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T17:59:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bryce Douglas", "comment_text": "that shit look like bud", "comment_date": "2019-08-16T02:35:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kitsune Princess", "comment_text": "the dank weed", "comment_date": "2019-08-11T06:55:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LeClaw", "comment_text": "Ammonium ferric citrate? you making Irn-Bru on the side?", "comment_date": "2019-08-09T01:48:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lindsay L", "comment_text": "Looks cool Nilered keep up the great work", "comment_date": "2019-08-07T01:59:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shay Koi", "comment_text": "CHRIS IS THAT A WEED", "comment_date": "2019-07-30T03:24:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shay Koi", "comment_text": "Yo it kinda looks like weed", "comment_date": "2019-07-30T03:24:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "plate noise", "comment_text": "you made fuckin crystal weed", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T06:18:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VenomStryker", "comment_text": "That stuff looks like some kind of Cannabis crack rock......lmao!", "comment_date": "2019-07-09T15:52:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Subtractison", "comment_text": "Though", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T03:27:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Romeo A.", "comment_text": "<b><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e8CMbHfLxM&amp;t=9m26s\">9:26</a></b><b> gets a coincidentally placed marijuana safety ad</b>", "comment_date": "2019-06-11T17:30:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom", "comment_text": "Funny how it still worked under  glass, which is mostly opaque to UV", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T15:24:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guillermo Perez", "comment_text": "My iron hidroxide didn\u00b4t precipitate :(", "comment_date": "2019-05-29T14:42:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Byron Watkins", "comment_text": "Actually, blueprint originals are/were ink on vellum.", "comment_date": "2019-05-20T05:39:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Snails are Dumb", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e8CMbHfLxM&amp;t=9m27s\">9:27</a> it looks like &quot;some type&quot; of plant material \ud83d\ude02<br>edit: phrasing", "comment_date": "2019-05-14T03:33:30Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gabriella Ballestas", "comment_text": "I think you&#39;d really benefit from a silicone spatula in your lab.
