I&#39;m torn between chemistry and IT related stuff, as they&#39;re both passions of mine. A lot of people tell me that chemistry is bad atm because a lot of stuff is being outsourced to china and india (I&#39;m from the US) so i&#39;d be better off doing something IT related. Just wondering what&#39;s your opinion regarding that?", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T19:19:38Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "iloveeggstoday", "comment_text": "please do the video on cleaning the sulfuric acid drain cleaner next", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T19:10:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Quen Jankosky", "comment_text": "This NEEDS to be you tube pooped.", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T19:04:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SubscribeToSyndicate", "comment_text": "y tho", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T19:03:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Kolmes", "comment_text": "After you extract the lidocaine in water could you dissolve it in xylene, add a few drops of HCL acid to some distilled water, mix together, separate and evaporate the water to get lidocaine HCL?", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T18:54:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "justTJRoots", "comment_text": "I just looked this stuff up on <a href=\"http://amazon.co.uk\">amazon.co.uk</a> and noticed a disclaimer that i have not seen before;<br> &quot;Please be assured that all orders of products which are dispatched and sold by <a href=\"http://Amazon.co.uk\">Amazon.co.uk</a> are shipped in plain packing material, with no information regarding the contents of your order printed on the outside of the parcel.
