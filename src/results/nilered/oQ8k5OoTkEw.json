Oximes of aliphatic/monoterpenic aldehydes tend to smell green/grassy and (as I recall it) jasmone oxime has a vanilla/gourmand type of scent. Now I wonder if you&#39;ve got a chance to smell your vanillin oxime product. It should have a (strong?) odor completely different from vanillin, but I can find no info about its odor whatsoever on the internet.
