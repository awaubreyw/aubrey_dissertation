If you see that this is about to happen, <b>IF</b> you can move the slow cooker to the floor safely before the contents actually make their way out, that\u2019ll make clean-up easier; otherwise, LEAVE THE SLOW COOKER ON THE SURFACE AND ALLOW THE BOIL OVER TO HAPPEN. Clean up is going to be a nightmare, but it\u2019s far better to allow the contents to boil over and not get your hands burned.  The hot soap with its corrosiveness will solidify on your hands and do a lot of damage.<br>Don\u2019t use wood, bamboo, paper, aluminium to mix soap; be cautious of thin plastics.<br>Do not use ingredients that are known to be irritating when making soap. Like I said in my comment on your solid cold process soap video, *you know this isn\u2019t smart, but you\u2019re not doing what\u2019s smart.

Look out for the folks that don\u2019t have common sense or respect the danger in making soap. PPE should always be used when making soap: closed-toe shoes, pants, long sleeves, gloves with the sleeves tucked into the gloves, and goggles.  Oh, and hair pulled back (I should edit my comment in your other video to mention pulling back long hair). Keep pets, children, and idiots away from you while using lye and hot liquids and heating apparatuses.<br>This is coming from someone who has studied soap making for ten years and has been making soap for six years.
