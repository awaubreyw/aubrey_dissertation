The recrystallization step almost certainly hydrolyzed a substantial amount of your product, not just a few percent. You can confirm this by using the iron (iii) chloride test for phenols. You will obtain a colored adduct with your recrystallized product, confirming the presence of a phenolic hydroxyl group. I know this because I synthesized ASA from salicylic acid and acetic anhydride, and after quenching the reaction mixture and decanting the precipitate, the crude product was recrystallized from boiling water. The melting point was extremely broad, strongly depressed, and was dependent upon the rate of heating. The NMR spectrum was a mess but did demonstrate the aromatic protons around 7.2-7.24ppm, and FTIR showed a broad and intense absorption around 3300/cm, and a sharp, very intense peak around 1710/cm.<br><br><br>This is all immaterial, however, since your next step is to hydrolyze any remaining ASA.", "comment_date": "2019-04-12T06:31:26Z", "likes_count": 26}, {"comment_by": "John Cassuri", "comment_text": "Sir, you&#39;re an alchemist, just saying but the idea of turning all metals into gold has the same process...", "comment_date": "2019-04-09T19:32:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Louie Steen Laursen", "comment_text": "Hey man I have a quick question, how come you didn&#39;t know how much baking soda to add?

Like starting with a single C molecule then adding to it with for example hydrogen. So ( C+H=carbon hydrogen). So to create any synthesis starting with a single molecule without any other elements bonded to it? That way you can make anything from the base level. Idk if that makes sense as I\u2019m not a chemist but it seems one could create anything if they were able to start with just the single six sided molecule. Or isotope or atom or whatever it\u2019s called before another element is attached creating a different element. I know that was a long winded comment/ question.

I&#39;ve always been taught that such a reaction is usually done with an alkali, like sodium or potassium hydroxide, with a carbonate forming instead of simply CO2. Was there a certain reason for that? Because the percentage of the phenol, that you got, lowered drastically only from the fact that the reaction was done in a solution, while the method with an alkali could be done with dry reagents.

Here&#39;s a couple of points that could be useful for improving the method:<br><br>(1) I&#39;ve seen some sources suggest that deprotonation of salicylic acid aids decarboxylation due to the competition for the proton. This should also stop the esterification as the carboxylate is not electrophilic.<br><br>(2) Before nitration, protect the phenol with either acetic anhydride or (acetic acid + HCl + boil). Do the nitration using c. sulfuric acid as the solvent, and 1.1 equivalents of NaNO3, at -5 degrees Celsius (ice/brine bath), then hydrolyse. It adds two steps; however, this will lead to a selective mononitration to p-nitrophenyl acetate. Also means you avoid forming nasty di(-) and trinitrated products, which will be explosive. Work it up by pouring it onto ice and water and filter in vacuo. The crystals you get out will be almost exclusively p-nitrophenyl acetate. <br><br>(3) The decomposition of p-aminophenol is due to oxidation/polymerisation in light, but it actually amounts to very little (if you check by NMR etc), so long as you keep it out of solvent. Recryst. from water is the usual way of purification, but I found that toluene works well too (if you can get your hands on it).<br><br>(4) Recryst for p-aminophenol should be easier than for paracetamol. <br><br>Source: my own research lab experience", "comment_date": "2018-04-11T23:22:52Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "floif", "comment_text": "the outro music thoughPRETTY NICE", "comment_date": "2018-04-11T21:22:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cyb3rty", "comment_text": "Could you do a video about chromatography and separating optical isomers?", "comment_date": "2018-04-11T20:25:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Markos", "comment_text": "All of your videos are absolutely amazing!!!!
