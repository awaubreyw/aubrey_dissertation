I was using it on a higher power setting, but the flask fused to the mantle and cracked the glass. In my case, I was doing a steam distillation on powdered cinnamon (as in your cinnamaldehyde video), but the cinnamon was all pooled at the bottom.<br><br>If I were to speculate, the cause is having a solid versus a liquid at the bottom of your flask. Heating mantles are typically meant for boiling liquids, and as the liquid vaporizes, it carries heat (energy) from the heating mantle with it through the apparatus. This, in turn, carries energy away from and cools the glass. If, however, the mantle is in contact with a solid, this latent heat of vaporization can&#39;t serve to cool the glassware, so the flask reaches a much higher temperature, high enough where it can melt. Furthermore, the temperature differential between the top and bottom of the glass becomes so great that the flask cracks around the middle (both of our flasks cracked in exactly the same way, right along the equator).<br><br>This probably also explains the smell. The temperature becomes so great in the salt that it, and any trace impurities, will actually begin to burn. Not only that, but the heating mantle itself probably had components that were breaking down and burning. I had the same thick white smoke coming over in my cinna-still. I didn&#39;t test the flammability like you did, but it smelled strongly of a campfire or burning leaves, and left a thick red-brown oil in my receiving flask and in the joints of the distillation apparatus. I was using water, but the oil might be acetone soluble, making for the off color solvent you got.<br><br>For ANYONE attempting to use a method like this, I strongly recommend either using a different, more even method of heating (like an oil bath), or adding a liquid to the boiling flask in which the salt is not soluble and stirring vigorously. This may impede the reaction rate somewhat, and yield a less pure product from boiling liquid, but you can always redistill. The solvent will keep the boiling flask at a constant temperature as it vaporizes, and the stirring will make sure the solid can&#39;t pool at the bottom and crack the glassware.
