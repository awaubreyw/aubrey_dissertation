I&#39;m asking because I actually make beard products like beard oil and beard balm and I try to avoid using oils that are high in oleic and linoleic acid, since those fatty acids have been shown to inhibit 5-alpha-reductase, which is important for converting testosterone into dihydrotestosterone, the hormone responsible for the maturation and growth of androgenic hair like facial hair.<br><br>Right now I&#39;m settling with using oils that have very low levels of oleic acid and linoleic acid, but if there was a way to remove those fatty acids entirely, or even just reduce their levels significantly, that would be quite an amazing innovation for &quot;beard science&quot; lol. That would also open up the number of essential oils I could use for fragrances. Right now my options are pretty limited since a lot of essential oils contain fairly high levels of both oleic and linoleic acid.", "comment_date": "2022-02-28T17:08:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xetlas", "comment_text": "Do you live in Quebec?", "comment_date": "2022-02-28T11:18:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kennyko", "comment_text": "Ahh so that explains why my school French fries tasted like soap", "comment_date": "2022-02-27T19:37:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roof", "comment_text": "\u201cFatty Acids\u201d \ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2022-02-27T18:48:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vik Table", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAieBBeS7Ss&amp;t=3m41s\">3:41</a> watching him grind - hmm I wonder if he will accident-*oh ouch*... yeap.", "comment_date": "2022-02-27T18:21:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Randall Edwards", "comment_text": "I figured I\u2019d post on this video, I work in a facility that refines oils and I have to say you were very close. One of the big problems with your method is that you need to do this reaction under vacuum to start. The reason for this is because soft oils like olive oil tend to form peroxides when this reaction happens. The final resulting almost black sludge is something that we deal with too. We call it residue and it gets wasted through the process. Finally gas chromatography is genuinely a lot better at telling individual fats apart. Testing them requires a twofold method though, the first tells you which ones are present between mono-s di-s and tri-s and the other tells you their percentage breakdown between the different fatty acids. I don\u2019t want to get too specific because I could possibly divulge trade secrets, but this process just needs a couple of tweaks to actually work.

Carboxylic acids are typically very easy to identify because they give very broad huge absorbances around 3700-3100 cm^-1 due to the O-H of the acid and hydrogen bonding. They are typically the easiest peaks to identify because they are large and broad. That does not seem to be present on the graph you displayed at about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAieBBeS7Ss&amp;t=16m55s\">16:55</a>. Like I said, I could be missing some info about the spectrometer used and the parameters, but it does not look like a graph indicating carboxylic acid functional groups to me. I know your carbonyl peak came a little low for a typical ester carbonyl, but factors such as alpha or beta saturation/unsaturation, and other factors can shift the peak. It looks very possible to me that this actually is the graph of an ester rather than an acid. Just a thought, and like I said I\u2019m certainly willing to be incorrect, maybe there is something I missed or don\u2019t know here. You also have other indications such as liquid at room temp rather than solid, etc. Let me know what you think if you see this.", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T06:47:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bird Girl", "comment_text": "I did this today by accident and now I&#39;m watching this video again to have it confirmed that my brain&#39;s as smooth as baby cheeks \ud83d\ude02<br><br>I&#39;ve mixed savon noir, water and a ton of citric acid thinking I had made a bomb bath cleaner.

Are 100% pure fatty acids as safe/healthy to eat as food oils in their natural state ?  Food oils, especially unsaturated plant oils, go &quot;bad&quot; rather easily, they are delicate. Heat, Sunlight or simply age causes vegetable oil to spoil. I was wondering what is happening in edible oils when they go &quot;bad&quot;, whether it is when using them for deep frying and the oil seems &quot;burnt&quot; and expired, or the stale smell of vegetable oil when it is years out of date, and it starts to smell like motor oil or kerosene. Are purified single fatty acids more resistant to spoiling than edible oils in their natural state? And lastly, can the damage that happens in edible oils that makes them &quot;spoiled&quot; and no longer suitable for eating, be &quot;reversed&quot; through processing?", "comment_date": "2018-10-04T01:21:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PatrickAndFriendsPRO", "comment_text": "if your flasks are coated in organic stubborn goo or gunk, piranha solution can get rid of it pretty easily", "comment_date": "2018-10-04T00:36:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mario Luigi", "comment_text": "Great video NileRed.

The need for controlled free hydrogen is why industry  usually feeds zinc chloride with hydrogen chloride, rather than straight hydrogen gas. <br><br>Second, Speaking of temperature.... Fatty acids oxidize when over heated. Fatty acids with double bonds in them are especially noted for oxidizing at the position of the double bond. Esters are big molecules, relative to the size of the reactants. Hydrogenated alkenes are not really much bigger by comparison. Because of this, Hydrogenation happens faster at higher temperatures.

For the plasticizer you already have made adipic acid, you have already made a base catalyst (trimethylamine), the surfactant is only used in really small quantities, glycerol is at like cvs, you have already done every reaction related to making diisocyanates except the final one (sodium benzoate to aniline) and even multiple nitrations (picric acid) so it seems like preparing everything would be a walk in the park.

I am a new subscriber that is coming from a reddit thread on /r/Skookum where we listed some of our favourite channels. You were mentioned, and I&#39;m currently binge watching everything! Absolutely loving your content. <br><br>I do have a question regarding this whole soap making process though! I&#39;ve never found a clear answer online yet. <br><br>I use a double edge safety razor to shave with and a brush with shaving soap to make my lather, and I&#39;ve explored making my own soaps. There are lots of recipes to make shaving soaps but most of the shaving soaps you find or find recipes for are either hard soap pucks or like a waxy texture. <br>One commercial soap company called &quot;Taylor Of Old Bond Street&quot; makes a product known as a &quot;croap.&quot; (cream/soap) It&#39;s a shaving soap that lather up incredibly easily because it is more of a creamy texture in the tub before you add water to create the lather. <br><br>I was wondering if you knew how one could create a homemade shaving &quot;croap?&quot; What would the difference be in making this kind of soap and other shaving soaps that gives it this texture? <br><br>Thanks for the great videos! Can&#39;t wait to see what you show us next!", "comment_date": "2017-06-13T01:48:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frogge", "comment_text": "Maybe you could use a very slow belt grinder to pulverize your soap", "comment_date": "2017-06-13T00:08:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "adfaklsdjf", "comment_text": "I really enjoy seeing failed experiments.
