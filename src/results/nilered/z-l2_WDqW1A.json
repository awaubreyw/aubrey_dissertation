On June 18, 1907, he was experimenting with making a wood coating and writes that he had placed in his &quot;horizontal digester&quot; (which was later named the Bakelizer) some blocks of wood, plus an open tube &quot;rammed&quot; with a mixture of asbestos fiber and liquid, and a sealed tube rammed with asbestos fiber and liquid. He heated all of it 4 hours at 140 degrees C.<br><br>(He refers to &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; in the next paragraph; he had four different resins and the one he called D was the Bakelite resin that made it to production.)\u00a0<br><br>He wrote: &quot;Asbestos + A in sealed tube. I found tube broken perhaps in irregular expansion but the reaction seems to have been satisfactory because the resulting stick was very hard and below where there was some unmixed liquid A there was an end of solidified matter yellowish and hard and entirely similar to the product obtained by simply heating A alone in sealed tube. This looks promising and it will be worth while to determine in how far this mass which I will call D is able to make moulded materials either alone or in conjunction with other solid materials as for instance asbestos, casein, zinc oxid, starch, different inorganic powders and lamp black and thus make a substitute for celluloid and for hard rubber.&quot;<br><br>This is how Bakelite was made in Bakelite factories.<br><br>First, a steel mold was made. The mold has three pieces. It&#39;s got a top and a bottom. The third piece serves as a dam. It wants to be three to four times as deep as the height of the finished piece...so if the part you&#39;re making is an inch high, the dam is four inches deep.<br><br>You apply a lubricant called &quot;release agent&quot; to all the parts of the mold so you can get the part out. Set the dam on top of the bottom and fill it with a mixture of resin powder, catalyst and a filler like wood flour. (The filler makes it stronger. Also cheaper to make.) Put the top on the mold and use hydraulic pressure to compress the resin/filler mix to its final size. Then put the whole thing in an autoclave heated to 300 degrees F and leave it in there until the resin melts and catalyzes. When it cools enough to handle, open the mold and remove your new bakelite object.<br><br>So...how can we do this when we don&#39;t have a factory?<br><br>Silicone spray will work for a release agent.<br><br>You could make a really simple mold out of a piece of two-inch black iron pipe and two metal discs that fit nicely inside of it, and use a big C-clamp to press it in place. One disc you can call &quot;bottom mold,&quot; the other &quot;top mold.&quot; (Alternately, Spray the inside of the pipe and the two molds with silicone spray. You&#39;ll need a vise and a C-clamp you can tighten down with a wrench.\u00a0<br><br>Since you need 300 degrees F and a pressure cooker will only get you to 250, you&#39;ll have to put it in the toaster oven. Leave it there for...oh, thirty minutes will get you started.\u00a0<br><br>Make enough resin powder to fill the tube to the depth of 2 inches from the bottom mold. Add wood flour at a 1:1 ratio and mix thoroughly. Dump the resin mix into the tube (there should be 4 inches of mix in there, half wood flour and half resin mix) and put the top mold on. Put the C-clamp on it, pressing the top mold and bottom mold together. Put the C-clamp in the vise, and tighten it until the assembly has been pressed to a quarter of its original size. Then bake it for half an hour, pull it out, put it on a heatproof surface and let it cool. When you can handle it, undo the C-clamp and pop your Bakelite disc out.", "comment_date": "2017-09-08T03:15:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dorus Overmaat", "comment_text": "Do I see bubbles turning around under the flask in the water bath at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-l2_WDqW1A&amp;t=2m05s\">2:05</a> or is that something else?
