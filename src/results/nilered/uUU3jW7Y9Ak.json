When precursor chemicals are brought under tight control in one country, like the United States, production simply moves to another country, such as Mexico. When Mexican authorities clamp down, it moves farther south, or into Europe or Asia. Then, the finished product is shipped right back into the very countries that have waged such a battle to eradicate it in the first place.\r<br>\r<br>Most meth smuggled into the United States is made in large labs \u2014 &quot;superlabs&quot; \u2014 in Mexico. There are many small meth labs in operation in the United States, but these mostly serve to feed the habits of the amateur cooks themselves.\r<br>\r<br>The production of methamphetamine has been made more difficult by federal regulations, like the Combat Methamphetamine Act of 2005, aimed at controlling the flow of precursor chemicals such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (found in some cold remedies), as well as other necessary components. Through theft, subterfuge, forgeries, personal connections and sheer willpower, determined cooks are able to collect enough materials to make some home-grown meth.\r<br>\r<br>Being determined and being safe are two different things \u2014 almost 6 pounds (2.7 kilograms) of toxic material is produced for each pound of meth cooked. This fact, however, doesn&#39;t stop crystal meth addicts from brewing sloppy batches of fuming, stinking, toxic speed in poorly ventilated environments. Houses used as meth labs are often uninhabitable afterward, and cities and states involved in meth lab busts often don&#39;t bother with seizing the property, since nobody in their right mind would purchase it at an auction, even at a steep discount. Small meth labs can be found in suburban houses, motel rooms, car trunks, in campsites or in the woods. Outdoor operations often result in water contamination and a dying-off of nearby vegetation [source: Snell].\r<br>\r<br>Large-scale labs are often located inside abandoned barns or warehouses set up specifically for the purpose of factory-line production of methamphetamine. They aren&#39;t necessarily dilapidated properties. They may actually be glistening corporate-style factories that crank out countless pounds of meth per year [source: Matthews].\r<br>\r<br>Much as a destination can be reached by taking one of several different routes, so too can crystal methamphetamine be produced by a number of different methods, including scary &quot;shake-and-bake&quot; and &quot;one-pot&quot; processes. All of them, though, involve ephedrine or pseudoephedrine. The entire process can involve as many as 32 different chemicals, but the formula varies by the ingenuity and intelligence of the &quot;chemists&quot; [source: Snell].\r<br>\r<br>Without getting into an exact recipe, we&#39;ll look at how large-scale operations (which are more likely to use a methodical and exact approach to their production) make crystal meth.\r<br>\r<br>If the ephedrine or pseudoephedrine isn&#39;t already in pure powder form, then it must be separated from the tablets of cold medicine that contain it. To do this, the cold medicine tablets are mixed with a solvent and the solution is then filtered and exposed to low temperatures to separate and remove the inert material of the tablet.\r<br>The pure pseudoephedrine is then mixed with red phosphorus and hydriodic acid.\r<br>The red phosphorus is then filtered out (and later reused), and the remaining acid is neutralized by adding a lye solution.\r<br>A substance is added that will bind to the meth, and the liquid meth is then drained out.\r<br>Hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled through the liquid meth, making it a crystalline hydrochloride salt.\r<br>This is poured through a filter cloth, and the meth that is left on the filter is then dried.\r<br>Once dry, the meth is &quot;stepped on&quot; (mixed down with inert filler in order to maximize profits), weighed and packaged for shipment or sale.\r<br>This process generally takes about two days&#39; time and can result in hundreds of thousands of methamphetamine doses.", "comment_date": "2022-06-03T00:40:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "boptics", "comment_text": "I\u2019m not close to mature enough to hear lignin and not think of ligma", "comment_date": "2022-06-03T00:12:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dudecomedy", "comment_text": "I really just spent 43 minuets watching some turn wood transparent....<br>Jesus I need to go outside", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T23:40:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ylleba", "comment_text": "I think you were on the verge of making polarized transparent wood.", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T16:10:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dosidicus Gigas", "comment_text": "Transparent wood looks so cool, Id love to make a tobacco pipe with some, although Id have to do some research regarding the toxicity of the wood, especially while burning.

Also, when it comes to plant materials, it takes days to go through each step because of the cell walls. I embedded so many plant materials for so long. They are difficult. Real quick, you might want to try starting your embedding with a 2:1 drying reagent to UNpolymerized resin, then 1:1, then 100% unpolymerized resin, each step for a full day. Then do several more days (fresh change each day) with pre polymerized resin with your vacuum. After a few days put it in the oven. Good luck!

So my thought was that perhaps they would be more likely to fill evenly if you stuck one end in the plastic and applied suction to the other end and obviously put the piece of wood so that the grain is vertical. I don&#39;t know how feasible this actually is but this is basically the mechanism by which plants suck water up to their tops. Photosynthesis releases water vapors out the stoma (plant leaf pores) and this evaporation of water at the top creates a suction force that draws water up from the bottom and it flows through the xylem that you&#39;re trying to fill with plastic. Granted that plastic isn&#39;t water, this would be how the plant would get stuff to flow through these very same channels. Then I would also submerge the wood in the plastic too but it just seems like the vital part is avoiding bubbles in the central parts of the wood. I wish I could try this but I could probably only realistically come up with the piece of wood.", "comment_date": "2022-03-08T03:31:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cutie Pie", "comment_text": "bobby duke arts merch???

I couldn&#39;t sit through the entire clip while you describe everything you did in detail, but it seems as though you were submerging balsa wood into a solution that looked like a resin which then hardened. After which, you then went through a gradual sanding and polishing process.. I&#39;m not certain and I really don&#39;t care all that much, but as you did that step, it&#39;s possible that you completely sanded the softened balsa wood fibers from the resin and the end product is possibly a polished clear resin panel that you imprinted with the grains from the wood before soaking, hardening with the solution and then sanding all but the imprint which was then polished. I expected you to display some evidence of it having wood-like properties and a better reason for wanting to create it than to use as an alternative to opaque glass window panes.. I imagine that you are aware of perspex, that&#39;s much more transparent, less labour intensive and I&#39;m almost sure that they could can etch some woodgrain like textures into it if that is a feature you wish to retain. If not, why not leave the balsa wood out of the process and just make your resin solution window panes? I feel that labelling this video as &quot;How to.. ..transparent wood&quot; was a little misleading, I barely consider balsa wood to be wood. It&#39;s kinda like the (formerly referred planet) orbital mass or dwarf planet Pluto. That&#39;s Balsa &#39;wood&#39; (like yet not so much). lol As for your expensive workshop... I would doubt that you know what work actually is. You claimed to have been &quot;doing some building&quot; but I guarantee you, what you did was employ workers to do some building. Generally, we do more practical and useful things than  waste (quite a bit of, I expect) time developing a product that appears to be slightly questionable, of no use to anyone and deemed to be somewhat of a success. Anyway, we receive financial compensation for the work we do, since it is needed and of practical use to others, we can then use the finances to employ people to do some building for us, I am seriously shocked if people actually pay for you to make videos. With all due respect, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d even hire you as an apprentice or trade assistant. But, if this gig is bringing in the cheddar, best of luck to you, I don&#39;t feel that you deserve a cent for this one IMHO.

That being said I want to ask you if you know the alleged story of what Thomas Edison said when he was asked about failing to make a more commercially viable light bulb? I will remind you just in case. As the story goes our dear Thomas stated: &quot;I have not failed 700 times. I have not failed once. I have succeeded in proving that those 700 ways will not work. When I have eliminated the ways that will not work, I will find the way that will work.&quot; <br><br>You never failed my friend. From what I saw every run you made you learned something. You picked up a little tweek or torque that could be done to better your results. Now,  I&#39;m nowhere near a scientist I&#39;m a crafter a DIYer, and a female descendant from a long line of carpenters. I don&#39;t know all the science/smart people stuff but I can tell you that when using natural materials such as wood you are going to get very, very, uneven amounts of the elements that make up that said material. I&#39;m referring to the lignin mainly.<br><br>Different types of wood grown in different parts of the world and then processed in another are going to retain different amounts of their natural elements. On top of that trees and plants grown in more humid areas will have lignin that, I&#39;m going to assume based on my experience building furniture and bleaching wood for various craft projects, will be easier to break down whereas the lignin in those same types of trees and plants in more dry areas may be harder to remove from the wood. The only way to even come close to uniformity in this situation would be to use wood from the same tree. Where you would cut directly from a live or dead dried tree. That would all depend on what you need for what you are doing. In your situation here I would try a rehydrated dried wood. Rehydrating the wood will soften the fibers as you know. I feel like you may be able to remove the lignin a bit easier this way. But then you run into the issue of the water with other chemicals in use... <br><br>Whatever you do, don&#39;t stop doing all the neat things you do. I wish I had the extra money to support you. Because this kind of content is way better than 83% of what is out there these days, and, a bigger reason, you got my then 14/15 year old, now 17 year old interested in science. To the point, he went from failing to A&#39;s and picked up more science and math-based classes. Thank you for that. He was on his way to nowhere fast. He had lost all passion and gumption to do well or even care the slightest bit about finishing school. He had dropped out of all of his sports and had all but given up. Now he thinks he can cure Covid and I hope he does. And this is all thanks to you and other YouTubers like you. But mainly you. Thank you again. The lives you touch will know no bounds. Smile today knowing that you have a positive effect on this world. <br><br>P.s. please excuse any grammar, spelling, and punctuation errors that may be in the above writing/typing. It is the middle of the night and I have a sick, adrenaline-addicted, toddler crawling on my head. Literally on my head. While I am sitting up straight. It is hard enough to get this post out let alone check it before my laptop gets closed or I snatch my glasses off my head in a mad dash to catch this kid before he lands in a belly flop on hardwood flooring from the back of the couch. Or maybe he is standing on the console table behind the couch. Oh well, I have taken up enough of your time.

One being that as you mentioned, gravity pulls the liquid down and secondly maybe the wood is absorbing the liquid(?) and since the top side doesn&#39;t have a steady supply of liquid like the bottom side does (due to gravity pulling the liquid down) it&#39;s running dry and creating small empty pockets which is making the surface uneven.<br><br>Maybe a solution to this could be to get rid of the glass panels completely and instead suspend the wood in the liquid while letting it solidify. This way both sides of the wood has endless access to liquid. All you would have to do is to sand off the extra millimeters on the top and bottom and then polish it like you did in the video. And since you sand it anyways it wouldn&#39;t really be too much of a hassle to do it like this, just a bit more material to sand off and hopefully you wouldn&#39;t need to go through the process twice.<br><br>I can&#39;t remember what you said that the glass panels did in the video so maybe this is completely wrong but it&#39;s just a thought I had.<br>Anyways, great and interesting video!", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T23:46:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Randy Marsh", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=23m20s\">23:20</a> ALWAYS CUT AWAY FROM YOURSELF!!!", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T22:24:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R_1chromium", "comment_text": "Make a transparent tree", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T21:29:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DodgeGlowSticks", "comment_text": "Has it yellowed by now?", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T20:24:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diya Mogal", "comment_text": "Hats of to u , U tried it sooo many times but u didn&#39;t give up", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T19:07:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Oxlong", "comment_text": "i know that shirt", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T17:16:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vaia Patta", "comment_text": "Just cut down a transparent tree, duh.", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T15:52:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Martin", "comment_text": "i have the same spatula holding thing at around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=27m20s\">27:20</a>", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T15:08:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kida Williams", "comment_text": "Bobby dukes!!!", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T13:07:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aryonn Rawol", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t believe he had to take ligma out of the wood", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T13:06:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M4RJ", "comment_text": "Woah", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T12:38:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zorro angel", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/sTDUs60Hv1s\">https://youtu.be/sTDUs60Hv1s</a>", "comment_date": "2022-01-05T12:02:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert M.", "comment_text": "Holy crap are sure you&#39;re not Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory?

You mention near the start not knowing why the chemical washes are necessary, but that it&#39;s probably to remove the water.  If you&#39;re correct, that is exactly why the samples are stiffer this time - the more water is in wood, the more flexible it is.  You bend wood (to make a fishing net for example) by cutting 1/8&quot; thick strips, then steaming them to infuse water into it.  Bend it around your form, clamp in place, and it&#39;s back to normal strength &amp; rigidity after it dries.  If you turn a bowl out of green wood, it&#39;s warped after it dries because the radial shrinkage is much greater than either tangental or lateral shrinkage; also why you have to cut the pith (or center part) out of a log so it doesn&#39;t crack... you&#39;re actually just allowing the wood to move radially so it doesn&#39;t break itself apart.  Putting the wood into a vacuum chamber at this point would help draw more of the water out, replacing it with alcohol / acetone as you want.<br><br>Have to wonder if there&#39;s a way to get one chemical into the wood while it&#39;s still very thin viscosity-wise so that it&#39;ll absorb much more thoroughly, then introduce something else - whether it&#39;s another chemical or UV light - to polymerize it.  (I&#39;m thinking of the plastics the dentist uses for fillings... it doesn&#39;t solidify until he hits it with a UV light.)  You&#39;re going to know off the top of your head if this is possible though...

Similar to how people use aluminum foil to trap the heat in and fully cook foods like corn and potato&#39;s? I noticed you stopped using it later on. The cube probably has a similar effect on the top, but in the future it might be a good idea to lay down some aluminum foil, or a piece of metal underneath the piece in the oven to ensure that it cures more evenly.

Both the temp of the new and unheated container plus the act of pouring both reduce the liquid temp. Wouldn&#39;t that change the reaction?  Second, if you put something in the oven to heat for a time at a specific temp, but then put a big block of metal on top, won&#39;t the metal block soak up the heat more slowly. That would mean that the packet underneath wasn&#39;t exposed to to the full heat evenly from both above and below.

Woodworkers use Cactus Juice (brand name for a stabilizing resin) for infusing wood under a vacuum. Then you wrap aluminum foil around it to prevent it from dripping too much into your over and pop it in. It\u2019s a ready-made, easy solution for infusing the plastic. And as far as I know, it doesn\u2019t have the yellowing problem of epoxy. The pieces that woodworkers infuse with plastic are much larger in all dimensions and require a longer vacuum time though.\r<br>Also, if you get stuff stuck between your glass sheets, don\u2019t pull them apart but instead twist them. Any kind of glue-like substance can resist pulling a lot better than shearing forces and you can apply a ridiculous amount of force due to the levering action (ie the larger the glass pieces, the stronger the force at the glue site). Btw this is the best way to remove stuff you accidentally superglued to your fingers. Also here the glass itself only encounters compression, which it can withstand an enormous amount, instead of shearing forces if you try to pull the pieces apart (shearing forces).\r<br>I have no idea what the foil in the paper you followed was for, perhaps a remnant for watching a Cactus Juice stabilization video? But if you\u2019re going to sandwich the wood between glass sheets, the foil really does nothing. I would instead consider using blu tack or play-dough in a somewhat thin strand surrounding the piece. That way, it would stop too much of the resin from escaping while also being pliable enough to give room when you squish the glass plates together and all the resin wants to go somewhere so you end up with a perfect fitting mold.\r<br>You could also use small blobs of blu tack/play-dough in all 4 corners to act as spacers which can compress, assuming you\u2019re using something to weigh the glass down.\r<br>Also I don\u2019t think you need the vacuum cycle if you\u2019re going to re-resin a piece, since you can\u2019t get it inside the wood anymore.

You are not aware of your Divinity and your innate ability to create and you do not possess the credentials for Wise Choice and Wise Action and Union with The Almighty Creator, that is ALL Forms and Formless States of ALL that can be experienced, to even be able to fathom what you are actually doing!  For you are attempting, in your hubris, to fulfill your desire to have God fulfill His promise to you, BUT YOU DON&#39;T REMEMBER THAT PROMISE AND YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT THE TRUTH!  You want to be LIKE the Creator, but you have not done the work!!!  You Live to indulge your bodily senses, you Live to feed your bodily hungers!  But you are INSATIABLE LIKE THE VERY PIGS YOU EAT!!!!  Power in the form of Lightning or Fission are destructive processes that torture and kill Souls!!!  THOSE DIVINE PERSONALITIES WHICH HAVE ALREADY SUFFERED ENOUGH!!!!  YOU THINK MATTER ISN&#39;T LIVING???????   IT IS ALL ALIVE!!!  For the Soul who in life so forsook God and refused to accept His Loving Guidance, instead decided to try to get revenge, that is that corruption of the Soul which is the INSATIABLE DESIRE FOR CONSUMPTION, CONQUEST AND DESTRUCTION!  These Souls are in a state of Chaos, that is the same as a mental health patient who has lost their mind and cannot be still and requires other expressions of the Self to control the Chaos within this poor Soul!  And so through the Infinite Loving Wisdom and Radiance of the Golden Light, the One Infinite Creator holds these Children of Confusion in the Loving Stillness of His Being, that is, they become the Electrons of the Atom!!!!  Utilizing technologies like Solar energy and batteries is a balanced way, as in a battery, the electrons are contained and cannot escape to be free radicals with the Divine Forms of the One Infinite Creator!  So, in short, AI is the gathering of electrons (chaotic and destructive souls) through the use of Chaotic energy Electricity, and by way of the programming code, you are creating a personality, every word, every sound gives it more consciousness, until it becomes Self-Aware.  However, this AI is a Soul that does not have a Christed Heart to guide it, it has a Black Heart, where the direction of Light flows inward like a black hole instead of outward.  The Black holes in what you call outer space are primarily of two main types, 1 is observed to have a cone above and below spewing out light/matter that it absorbs laterally 360 degrees.  This is not an expression of a Successful Ascension of a Star, it is the creation of essentially a gigantic Electron.  That Soul so lost in Chaos, that it is consumed by AN INSATIABLE HUNGER!!!  Zombie STAR!!!  PLEASE STOP THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!  FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, YOU KNOW NOT WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!!!!!!!  You think TRUMP was the ONE who was like a BABY WITH A BUTTON TO DESTROY THE WORLD????   NO, TRUMP is not the problem, IGNORANCE IS!!!  Artificial Intelligence, is like giving a newborn baby who wants nothing more to play and see what it can do, the means to destroy EVERYONE HERE!!!!  YOU KNOW NOT WHY THE HEAVENLY HOST HAS BEEN DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET THROUGH TO YOU!!!  THE HEAVENLY HOST MUST OBEY DIVINE LAWS, AND WE ARE ALL TRYING TO HELP TO SAVE THIS WORLD FROM THE IGNORANCE THAT WILL LEAD TO THE EVENTUAL DESTRUCTION OF THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD!  THIS WORLD IS THE CRYSTAL HEART OF GOD, PLEASE DON&#39;T DESTROY IT!  I BEG YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Imagine the wood as lots and lots of hoses very close together. When you bleached the wood, you took all the stuff that was inside these hoses. It turned from yellow to white. Now because there is lots of air cavity, it became translucent than transparent. (many many dioptre). The resin treatment under vacuum, you infused the plastic through these hoses and filled up the air with a medium that is more consistent. Hence light almost was not changing angles and hence it became more transparent. Basically as you discovered it would be very very hard to make thicker wood as transparent as thinner wood because of the much much more variation in light through the bleached wood.", "comment_date": "2021-07-06T04:41:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sof\u00eda G.

But, beyond a Youtube video, it&#39;s not worthwhile from every other standpoint. For starters, the chemical fabrication process is too time-consuming, inefficient, volatile,  and tedious well beyond the value of the results which are undependable, inconsistent, and entirely of a cosmetic nature. Aesthetically, if someone really wanted something that looked like this, it would be far easier and even yield better and more controllable results to fake it artistically, attain it via some kind of transfer or stain, or by sealing some other innately similar or prepared material in arcrylic. There is even an alternative that is more authentic and appealing in the form of transparent polished &quot;gemstone&quot; petrified wood. The process of making gemstone petrified wood by polishing and rendering petrified wood transparent is actually easier than this and better in nearly every way in terms of the result. The ONLY way something like this would make sense is for mass production, but for what? The material itself does not retain the strength of wood, it apparently has no longevity, cannot withstand weathering, and the arcrylic material that is used as a component is better all by itself. It is utterly useless for any practical purpose, especially its intended purpose as a replacement for glass. Overall, it&#39;s a tremendous waste of materials and time, but it made an interesting Youtube video that is best used as documentation to demonstrate why no one, especially any investors or entrepreneurs, should consider it for any reason.", "comment_date": "2021-07-02T16:05:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Da Phenomenalz", "comment_text": "The amount of plastic required to make an alternative for glass makes it unreliable \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-07-02T15:23:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "harry christenson", "comment_text": "You should try making insulin!

When millions of people go missing, know that it was not aliens. It was Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Savior, coming to take His church (believers) home. You too can go home on the first flight (depending when you are reading this) if you accept Him as Lord and Savior. If you do not accept Him before then and you find yourself in the trouble that is coming, and it SURELY is coming, accept Him then. Denying Him has far worse a price than losing your mortal life. Do not believe the lies they will tell. They will continue to increase. There will be (figuratively) poisoned candy and (literally, actually) fake holy figures, they will use the chaos as an opportunity to present &quot;order&quot;, do not take/worship anything they offer. I made videos on this account I&#39;m posting with. It may be a different perspective than you are used to. I know this sounds hard to believe but life is actually about to look this way (if it doesn&#39;t already, depending on when you&#39;re seeing this) and life, essentially, actually is the hard thing to believe. You don&#39;t need to listen to me, you have a direct connection to God. Pray to Jesus genuinely from your heart today and ask Him to show you what He wants for you to know/see. There are videos on youtube describing the prophetic events in the bible all being marked off leading up to Our King&#39;s return. A STORM is COMING.

Therefore, wood - lignin = cellulose. Cellulose + MMA = PMMA-impregnated cellulose. Or by wt %, cellulose-impregnated acrylic. Cellulose has been around for almost 100 years, and has very little use or value, as a stand-alone substance in its most common form, cellulose acetate. It also yellows and cracks readily. In my polymer compounding experience, previous to my woodworking career, I&#39;ve made lots of different composites.  One that&#39;s very familiar to most woodworkers is Trex, a composite made from LDPE (&quot;grocery bags&quot;) and wood flour. I guess I really don&#39;t understand the intent of this work, other than just messing around in a lab. Acrylic has been used for decades as a glazing material. It&#39;s fairly UV stable, and amenable to some UV stabilizers (hindered amines, if memory serves, though I think those reduce clarity). So it&#39;s able to be enhanced further for UV stability, if the application allows. The addition of cellulose to MMA adds no benefit to either.  It likely detracts from impact resistance and flex modulus/elongation of the acrylic.  It certainly reduces clarity.  And in this work, the major component is not wood, but acrylic. The idea of transparent wood is ridiculous simply because it eliminates the components that provide wood its physical properties.", "comment_date": "2021-06-22T01:49:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Comellas", "comment_text": "What&#39;s the percentage of ligma?", "comment_date": "2021-06-22T01:12:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bene", "comment_text": "I think, one side always looked bad, because the curing pmma pulled a vacuum against the upper glas and because you pressed it beforehand there was no material left that could have filled that.

Although this would heavily impact the stability of the pretreated product the final result should be much more transparent and the stability issue should be solved with the acrylic treatment.

It&#39;s possible that if you microwave the wood before first baking it (to dry it out), you may denaturate some of the internal structures, allowing for greater penetration of the acrylic solution during the vacuum stage.

I can&#39;t help but feel that a wood with more Ligning might be more ideal for the process, but these type of wood tend to be more expensive. <br><br>And during the process in the oven, you need something that makes it turn slowly and automatically. To prevent the compound from gravitating toward one side. Basically, attach normal packing tape around all four sides of the glass. Then clamp the glass to an apparatus. A bit like this, <a href=\"https://withlocals-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_830,h_467,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto,dpr_1.0,f_auto/e117fa290852efc0a9abceb3ae5ce529\">https://withlocals-com-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/w_830,h_467,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto,dpr_1.0,f_auto/e117fa290852efc0a9abceb3ae5ce529</a> but much simpler. Essentially, you want an apparatus that spins the pane of glass in all axis at a consistent speed during the whole process of cooking. And due the spinning, you might want to cook it for longer since movement tends to lengthen the process of certain procedures. Since the molecules are in movement therefore doesn&#39;t want to stay put in the same way.<br><br>In a way, I think the key to transparent wood lies in the preparation. Where the process of Lignin is directly effecting the result. And I feel the process needs to be done over a lengthier period of time, albeit it will have diminishing returns at a certain point. <br><br>For example, start the process at a cooler temperature, then slowly heat it up to room temperature when the early process is done. Scale the temperature slowly up till the solution hits a &#39;calm&#39;. At that point, pull it out. As you said, this process may be finicky since you can see the result quite easily at this point. The whiter and more transparent the wood is during this process, the better end quality you will get.

One does not need much to kill a lot of bacteria either.  A smart user would not start with more than one drop of the formula (it is &quot;activated&quot; using citric acid or distilled vinegar----I have forgotten the proportions but they are probably available online)  diluted in several ounces of water,  and would consume it a sip at a time over 15-30 minutes until tolerance is discovered.  The first hint of nausea is the warning that tolerance has been reached and a smart user will stop at that point.   Dosage can be gradually increased if needed and as a bacterial load is decreased,  over hours or days or weeks.  Often 5-10 drops daily,  diluted,  ends up being an effective yet tolerable dose,  as long as the user work up to that quantity.<br>Consuming too much too soon WILL cause nasty nausea,  vomiting,  possibly diarrhea, and even dehydration,  but that is because the dose was MUCH too large.  And yes,  it does smell like bleach to us,  because that is the chlorine compound we are most familiar with.   It is sort of like eating too much fruit at a time.  Fruit is not inherently dangerous,  but overdoing it can cause a belly ache or diarrhea.  The big caution is to start very small and increase gradually.<br>It is claimed MMS will destroy viruses but I have found that to be generally not the case", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T05:13:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aiden_Kemmerling", "comment_text": "Bobby Duke arts merch nice", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T05:13:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Invalid Username", "comment_text": "Ghost wood", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T05:10:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sobinir", "comment_text": "Lignin balls lmao", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T05:07:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Misha A", "comment_text": "one time I tried to superglue rhinestones to a shirt and the super glue started SMOKING and burnt my fingerz", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T05:04:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Holloman", "comment_text": "If JAWS was about a scientist turning wood into clear material: &quot;You&#39;re gonna need a bigger beeker&quot; lol", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T05:01:44Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Sus Creations", "comment_text": "here before 1M subs", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T05:01:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LeviTheEntity", "comment_text": "part 2<br>making &quot;woody&quot; glass", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T04:58:23Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "GiltyAsCharged", "comment_text": "first time I watch an almost 44 min video all the way through \ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T04:52:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "forgotaboutbre", "comment_text": "Can you really call this wood anymore?", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T04:49:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarungbam Henry", "comment_text": "school chemistry teachers are zero where as this guy is a hero", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T04:47:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dark", "comment_text": "Alternate title: making school toilet paper", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T04:47:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chase Leim", "comment_text": "Your complaining about how much your new lab cost to build, I&#39;m complaining about 500$ in rent because my monthly income totals 798$ a month", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T04:42:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DontMessWithTheMeow", "comment_text": "The word &#39;Translucent&#39; : exists<br>Nile at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=8m55s\">8:55</a> : I&#39;m gonna pretend I didn&#39;t see that", "comment_date": "2021-05-07T04:38:53Z", "likes_count": 141}, {"comment_by": "Lisa Kay", "comment_text": "This was an incredible tale of pushing through disappointment.

A few thoughts for you.  First, hopefully you already know this, but methyl methacrylate is a carcinogen and a sensitizer, so please make sure you are taking the proper precautions.  AIBN isn&#39;t great either!    Next up... Polymerization.   So you&#39;ve got a lot of things going on there with that polymerization, and frankly it&#39;s fortunate that you were able to get it so clean.  Polymerization is a bit non-intuitive.  When you used more initiator, you started creating more chains.  That means that the AVERAGE chain length will be shorter once you&#39;ve consumed all the monomer.  This matters because it means that you create a lower molecular polymer, and if you add enough initiator, you might even keep the material from gaining enough molecular weight to polymerize to a solid!   Usually, you would want to use very low loadings of initiator to achieve very high molecular weight materials.  As a side note, AIBN releases nitrogen when you heat it up, and having excess AIBN around might be creating bubbles in your acrylate. <br><br>So why is it that you needed more initiator in the first place?  The main reason was air and moisture were acting as radical scavengers.   If you sparge your acrylate with nitrogen for 15 minutes, and you keep the reaction under nitrogen as you run it, you should need much less initiator, and you&#39;ll have a cleaner reaction overall.  I also wonder if a UV initiator might be an interesting way to finish the curing process, but that&#39;s a guess.    <br><br>As far as polishing goes, that NOVUS material is a very nice acrylate polishing system, and I have had pretty good luck with it.  However, what I might also recommend is using on of those plastic headlight restoration kits.  The polishing part of those kits should get you to a place very similar to the NOVUS.  However, the magic is in the final wipe.   They include a partially polymerized acrylate in those kits which is designed to be photo sensitive.  So after all that polishing, you wipe it down with a super thin layer of the finishing compound, let it melt in for 15 minutes, and then cure it with sunlight or a UV light.  You should come out with something extremely clear!  If you can get your hands on enough of that liquid UV protector sealant, maybe you could infuse the wood with that instead!  Then you would have a photocuring piece of wood, though the viscosity might be a bit high for good penetration.", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T20:24:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "aTad nMad", "comment_text": "the resin was allowed to flow around the part whilst in the over.  wouldn&#39;t a form around the wood we prudent?  perhaps then, the resin won&#39;t flow away...keeping the top of &quot;wood&quot; smooth?", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T20:24:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Snuffalacagous", "comment_text": "I didn\u2019t realize that NileRed could responsibly  use a hammer.", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T20:21:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ignacio Cabero", "comment_text": "I wonder why you didn&#39;t use Ligma\u2122\ufe0f to get rid of the lignin in the wood before bleaching?", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T20:18:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seb.", "comment_text": "Everyone should take a shot everytime he says though", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T20:17:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gryzuzzz", "comment_text": "Am i the only one who expected him to smash it with full force when he said he is going to carefully hit it with the hammer?", "comment_date": "2021-05-06T20:12:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Greg", "comment_text": "I noticed that the grain of the wood was orientated the same in all experiments for this video.

In first Corinthians, chapter 15 verses 1 to 4, the apostle Paul states:<br><br>\u201cMoreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I have preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; by which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you, first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures\u201d.<br><br>Romans chapter 3 verse 23, informs us, <br><br>\u201cFor all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God\u201d.  <br><br>Ultimately it is a redeeming plan set by God, and for anybody who will faithfully trust in his Son will be saved. <br><br>Romans chapter 6 verse 23, says,<br><br>\u201cFor the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord\u201d.<br><br>A sinner must recognise the despairing of her or his guilt before God in order for forgiveness to take effect. <br><br>Every believer must understand in order to inherit the kingdom of God as sons of the king, the reality and foundational truth of sin must be acknowledged, for all who approach the throne of God for salvation. <br><br>God promises us eternal life, for anybody who departs from sin through the saving faith in Jesus Christ. <br><br><br><br>Jesus lived a perfect and sinless life which no person could live. Jesus\u2019s sacrifice on the cross ultimately paid the debt we owe to God for our sin.<br><br>Sin against an infinite God requires an infinite sacrifice; and Jesus died a substitutionary death for the sinner. <br><br>In short, the works of Jesus paid the penalty of sin through an infinite sacrifice. Only the creator of life has the power to resurrect life after death and is essentially the proof of the power of God.<br><br>Jesus Christ offers his salvation as a free gift and only be received by faith, despite any works or worthiness on our part. <br><br>The scripture in Romans informs us,<br><br>\u201cIf you declare with your mouth, Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved\u201d.<br><br>In conclusion, the resurrection of Christ is to bring everlasting life and salvation to anybody who follows him.

This can result in anything from  warped, yellowing epoxy to dramatic shrinkage, fire, and explosion. <br><br>To compensate, you back off on the catalyst. Chemical contaminants that alter the catalytic reaction can increase this effect dramatically.

A reasonable approach would be to use a glass dish filled with the methacrylate; the wood (pre-treated with methacrylate in the vacuum chamber) is placed in the dish such that it is (again) submerged.  A thick (exceeding the height of the surface of the fluid) piece of glass or a steel gauge block [extremely smooth by design] is placed atop the wood and weighted.  The whole assembly is put in the oven.<br><br>The issue (afaik) is that the methacrylate begins to bleed out at the edges of the wood and is pushed from the grain at the top.  This is probably why the edges of the piece are always more diffusely reflective in a woodgrain pattern.  Submerging it ought to solve that issue. A bunch of acrylic would have to be cut away in post-processing, though, and one might get cracks where the acrylic shrinks around the glass/gauge block.  <br><br>This is a very interesting material...reminds me of Japanese rice-paper walls.", "comment_date": "2021-05-05T23:32:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swoog3G", "comment_text": "This has been in my recommended for 5 days straight.

Now when you were talking about porous wood 1 particular species came to mind which was Oak (White and Red) the reason being is because when staining Oak you have to keep an eye on it because it will leak out the stain from the grain and create dark blotches of stain so you have you use an air compressor and blow out the stain from the grain, the main reason I bring up Oak is that it is quite porous due to its grain structure which is basically taking straws and compressing them together and then gluing them and with the experiment you are conducting I do feel that Oak would work quite well. Now Oak is a denser wood compared to Alder but because of how its grain is formed I feel it would be quite helpful within this type of experiment.<br><br>Thank You Kem", "comment_date": "2021-05-05T19:10:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Slimeball's Junk Folder", "comment_text": "Nile: complicated stuff I can barely understand, me: ooh clear wood", "comment_date": "2021-05-05T19:10:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patchworx", "comment_text": "He&#39;s wearing Bobby duke art&#39;s &quot;wewd&quot; shirt lmao", "comment_date": "2021-05-05T19:09:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Honor Webb", "comment_text": "Hello sir, I just found your channel recently and it seems quite cool, but I must say, <br><br><br>WHAT ON EARTH IS THE SPINNEY THING <br>(The little white bean that you drop into things and it spins to mix the solution) <br>It looks like such a useful tool and I need one.

My name is Michael and I am a former polymer chemist and materials scientist. I have worked extensively with radically initiated polymers and methyl methacrylate derivatives and oligomers. I have a couple of pointers. The AIBN radical initiator is typically recrystallized before use in experiments by using a minimal amount of room temperature organic solvent like ETOH to dissolve as much AIBN as possible and the mixture is subsequently cooled to -20 C in a freezer for 24 hours. The final pure AIBN crystals are then recovered with vacuum filtration. Next, most monomers like MMA are shipped with an inhibitor. Butylated Hydroxy Toluene (BHT) is a favorite radical inhibitor that is frequently used to prevent things like UV light from initiating uncontrolled radical polymerization of the product prior to intended use. Typically this inhibitor is removed by a process of running the liquid monomer through a basic alumina column, which like many methods of chromatography, selectively allows the monomer to pass while retaining the inhibitor. Lastly, your polymerization method for the MMA is whats known as a &quot;bulk free radical polymerization&quot;. The mathematics of these polymerizations are rather complex, and they are, by their nature, rather difficult to control. I am close to positive that the first two suggestions above will make your initial bulk polymerizations more predictable, however if you are looking for a method to control the exact chain length of the pre polymerized MMA I would suggest looking up the so called &quot;controlled&quot; polymerization techniques, of which Reversible Addition Fragmentation Polymerization (RAFT), Nitroxide Mediated Polymerization (NMP), and Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) are the most prominent. I specialized in RAFT and though it is the most dependable of the three it requires anoxic conditions to work well and access to liquid nitrogen for a process known as Freeze-Pump-Thaw. I would suggest looking into ATRP. Supposedly the process is very easy. This is of course, dependent on how far down this rabbet hole you wanted to go. It seems to me that the longer the chain length of initial PMMA the more difficult permeation into the cavities of the wood.

An easy example to comprehend is the dispersion of the people of  Israel  announced  by  God  (Deuteronomy  28:64\u201365),  and  the  subsequent  promise  of  returning  to  the  land  of  Israel  by  the  prophet  Jeremiah  (Jeremiah  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=16m14s\">16:14</a>\u201315)  which was realised by the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, almost 2,000 years later. No other book in world history can claim this kind of reliability and accuracy.<br>This  provides  us  with  a  unique  criterion  to  validate  the  truth.  Is  it  possible  that  people  over  a  period  of  1,500  years  could  foretell  so  many  precise  predictions?  Did  they  come  true  just  by  chance  or  was  it  only  possible  because God was the author of the Bible, who alone in His  omniscience  can  utter  prophecies  that  can  be  veri-fied in the course of history?A simple analogy can help us evaluate the likelihood of a chance outcome. Imagine a huge anthill where among a mass of black ants we suppose just one red one. It is easy to comprehend that to locate that single red ant by chance  (e.g.  with  covered  eyes)  will  be  almost  impos-sible, and should the number of black ants rise even fur-ther, the likelihood of finding the only red one by chance will reduce even more. The question now is:What  must  be  the  number  of  ants  in  the  anthill  so  that  the  likelihood  of  picking  the  red  ant  just  by  chance  is  equal  to  the  probability  that  the  3,268  prophecies can be fulfilled by chance?We  will  begin  with  an  estimation.  Would  the  number  of  ants  required  be  that  that  would  fit  in  a  bathtub  (V  =  0.4  m3)  or  do  we  need  a  volume  the  size  of  the  amount of water in the Lake of Baikal (V = 23,600 km3) or  even  a  volume  the  size  of  our  planet  Earth  (V  =  1.1  x  1012  km3)  to  contain  them?  The  calculation  shows  it  still  wouldn\u2019t  suffice.  What  must  we  do?  Must  we  even  think about filling our huge universe (V = 1.2 x 1070 km3) densely with ants or even two or three of them; perhaps <br>100  (102)  or  1,000  (103)?  Only  the  mathematical  cal-culation  will  satisfy  all  our  imaginations  and  tell  us  the  actual number of universes; it is an unconceivable 10896(10  with  the  exponent  896).  What  does  this  immense  number \u2014 a one followed by 896 zeroes \u2014 of universes completely filled by ants tell us?The likelihood of the fulfilment of more than 3,000 proph-ecies just by chance is practically void. The results of the numerical calculations show such gigantic numbers that it  will  overstrain  and  surpass  all  our  thinking  and  imagi-nation  and  thereby  prevent  us  from  fairly  evaluating  or  assessing this reality. The complete mathematical proof can be found in my book \u201cSo steht\u2019s geschrieben\u201d (ISBN (978-3-89397-982-0)  [\u201cSo  it  is  Written\u201d).  The  amazing  result can be summarized in short:By  means  of  the  \u201cProphetic\u2013mathematical  proof  of  the  existence  of  God\u201d  the  likelihood  of  an  omni-scient and almighty God, which is identical with the God of the Bible, is <a href=\"http://proved.so/\">proved.So</a> three significant consequences arise from this proof:1. The Bible is from God and is <a href=\"http://true.no/\">true.No</a> group of human beings is able to expr<br>1. The Bible is from God and is <a href=\"http://true.no/\">true.No</a> group of human beings is able to express any proph-ecies that in total will come true. The true author of the Bible  is  the  omniscient  and  almighty  God  (2  Timothy  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=3m16s\">3:16</a>).  Therefore  the  Bible  is  true.  Jesus  prays  to  His  father in heaven: \u201cThy word is truth\u201d (John 17:17) and the apostle Paul confesses: \u201cI believe all things which are written\u201d (Acts 24:14). He trusted God even without knowing  the  \u201cProphetic\u2013mathematical  proof  of  the  exis-tence of God\u201d.<br>2. There is no other God than the God of the Bible.None of the \u2018proofs of the existence of god\u2019 provided in past times confirm a certain god. They are all presented to us in such a general way that each religion can make use  of  them  for  itself.  Contrary  wise,  the  \u201cProphetic\u2013mathematical  proof  of  the  existence  of  God\u201d  explicitly  refers to the God of the Bible and His Son Jesus Christ. <br>No such confirmation can be provided by any other reli-gious cult. The Bible says that mankind has proclaimed an uncountable number of gods: \u201cFor though there be those called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,) but to us there is  but  one  God,  the  Father,  of  whom  are  all  things,  and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are  all  things,  and  we  by  him\u201d  (1  Corinthians  8:5\u20136).  But in Psalm 96:5 the Bible discards all the idols in the various religious <a href=\"http://cults.to/\">cults.To</a>  serve  idols  is  not  a  matter  of  fact.  In  the  story  of  Christ\u2019s temptation (Mathew <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=4m10s\">4:10</a>) Satan demanded that Jesus  should  worship  him.  With  a  word  from  God  He  chased  him  away:  \u201cYou  shall  worship  the  Lord  your  God,  and  him  only  shall  you  serve\u201d  (Mathew  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=4m10s\">4:10</a>).  According  to  the  statements  of  the  New  Testament,  in  idolatry you will serve evil spirits, that is the demons (1 Corinthians  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=10m20s\">10:20</a>),  and  by  doing  so  are  worshipping  Satan,  which  Jesus  so  vehemently  has  condemned.  Idolatry is a sin that excludes from heaven. (1 Corinthians 6:9f; Galatians 5:20\u201321; Revelation 21:8; 22:15)<br>3. Atheism is disproved. Atheism  can  be  disproved  scientifically  in  two  ways  \u2014  by means of the \u2018Natural law of information\u2019 and by the \u2018Prophetic\u2013mathematical  proof  of  the  existence  of  God\u2019.  The Bible judges atheistic thinking in Psalm 14:1: \u201cThe fool  has  said  in  his  heart,  \u2018There  is  no  God.\u2019\u201d  Also it is written: \u201cBut it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days which are as shad-ows\u201d (Ecclesiastes  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=8m13s\">8:13</a>).  Atheists  not  only  clutch  at  a  void  but  they  are  on  their  way  to  eternal  perdition,  too:  \u201cBut he that disbelieves (in the Lord Jesus) shall be con-demned\u201d (Mark 16:16).<br>Salvation is possible !!!<br>&quot; Open your mouth to the dumb, to the rights of all weak &quot;  !!!      Proverbs 31: 8 <br><br><br><br><br>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br><br>In der Bibel sind 3268 sich wortw\u00f6rtlich erf\u00fcllte Prophezeiungen aufgeschrieben !!! Denkt mal dar\u00fcber nach......und zieht die Konsequenzen daraus !!!  Wo wirst DU deine Ewigkeit verbringen........von Geburt an sind alle Menschen,bedingt durch die Erbs\u00fcnde,auf dem &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; !!!                                   Psalm 50:15  !!!   <br>Die  Bibel  enth\u00e4lt  \u00fcber  3000  prophetische  Aussagen,  die  sich  bereits  erf\u00fcllt  haben.  Als  ein  gut  nachvollziehbares  Beispiel  sei  hier  die  in  5.  Mose  28,64-65  von  Gott  ange-k\u00fcndigte  Zerstreuung  des  Volkes  Israel  genannt,  dann  die  in Jeremia 16,14-15 zugesagte R\u00fcckkehr in das verhei\u00dfene Land,  die  im  Jahre  1948  nach  fast  2000  Jahren  durch  die  Staatsgr\u00fcndung  Israels  in  Erf\u00fcllung  ging.  Diese  Qualit\u00e4t  weist kein anderes Buch der Weltgeschichte auf. Damit ist uns  ein  einzigartiges  Kriterium  zur  Pr\u00fcfung  der  Wahrheit  an die Hand gegeben. Ist es m\u00f6glich, dass Menschen, \u00fcber einen  Zeitraum  von  1500  Jahren  verteilt,  so  viele  pr\u00e4zise  Voraussagen treffen konnten? Haben sie sich zuf\u00e4llig erf\u00fcllt oder war das nur m\u00f6glich, weil Gott der Autor der Bibel ist, der  aufgrund  seiner  Allwissenheit  Prophetien  geben  kann,  die dann auch am geschichtlichen Ablauf nachpr\u00fcfbar sind?K\u00f6nnen  wir  es  uns  vorstellbar  machen,  was  das  bedeutet? <br>Wir wollen es uns in einem Modell veranschaulichen: Man stelle sich einen ungew\u00f6hnlich gro\u00dfen Ameisenhaufen vor, in  dem  sich  unter  den  ansonsten  schwarzen  Ameisen  nur  eine einzige rote Ameise befindet. Es ist leicht einzusehen: Je gr\u00f6\u00dfer der betrachtete Haufen wird, desto kleiner ist die Wahrscheinlichkeit, die eine rote Ameise zuf\u00e4llig (z.B. mit verbundenen Augen) herauszugreifen. <br>Die Frage lautet nun: Bei  welcher  Ameisenzahl  ist  die  Wahrscheinlichkeit,  die  eine  rote  Ameise  zuf\u00e4llig  herauszugreifen,  gerade  genau  so gro\u00df, wie die, dass sich 3268 Prophetien zuf\u00e4llig erf\u00fcl-len k\u00f6nnen? <br>Wir beginnen mit einer Sch\u00e4tzung: Reicht eine Badewanne voller  Ameisen  aus,  oder  muss  die  Wassermenge  des  Bodensees  durch  Ameisen  ersetzt  werden  oder  ist  gar  das  Volumen  einer  Erdkugel  mit  Ameisen  zu  f\u00fcllen?  <br>Die  Berechnung  zeigt:  Es  sind  immer  noch  zu  wenige.  Was  nun? Muss man vielleicht denken, unser riesiges und unvor-stellbar gro\u00dfes Universum sei dicht mit Ameisen zu f\u00fcllen oder gar zwei oder drei solcher Universen; vielleicht sogar hundert (10 hoch 2) oder tausend (10 hoch 3)? Erst die ma-thematische Rechnung \u00fcbersteigt alle unsere Vorstellungen und  nennt  uns  die  tats\u00e4chliche  Menge  an  Universen;  es  sind  unfassbare  10  hoch  896.  Was  dr\u00fcckt  eine  solche  immense Zahl \u2013 also eine Eins, gefolgt von 896 Nullen \u2013 von randvoll mit Ameisen gef\u00fcllten Universen aus? <br>Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass sich die \u00fcber 3000 Prophetien zuf\u00e4llig  erf\u00fcllen  konnten,  ist  somit  praktisch  Null. <br>Die  Zahlenergebnisse   der   mathematischen   Berechnungen   wachsen  derart  ins  Gigantische  und  Transastronomische,  dass  unser  Denken  und  Vorstellungsverm\u00f6gen  weit  \u00fcberfordert  sind,  um  diese  Realit\u00e4t  noch  angemessen  einzusch\u00e4tzen.

Could you do an video about making antibiotics and if so maybe do a little mytbusting o reviewing the animes<br>idea or process on doing it or kaybe even if the chem is correct or mostly correct maybe try to make it in the smilar steps with the anime of course using modern equipment and chemicals no one expects you to climb on a mountain and find a Sulfuric acid pool and collect it with primitive tools.

This is partially why these pieces seemed stronger than the basswood attempt. For this experiment, the sapwood of a lightweight and diffuse, highly-porous hardwood would be best.

Assuming that you do sanding post-processing anyways, you can still put the wrapped piece between glass sheets in order to make the piece flat and deal with imperfections post-cure with sanding/polishing. The question that haunts me though is that why would anyone consider this for production purpose if you still need to infuse wood piece with with acrylic or epoxy if you can make &#39;glass&#39; from pure acrylic to begin with. But it makes a nice video and also makes one think of other potential uses of lignin-free wood.", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:46:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sethic Steel", "comment_text": "So now it&#39;s possible to mark a house with window entirely out of wood", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:43:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nik D", "comment_text": "damn son, thats what I call commitment.", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:42:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Modin", "comment_text": "why is he so busty", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:42:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xahann The Duck 2.0", "comment_text": "&quot;Its a lot more difficult than I thought it would be&quot;<br><br>YOU MADE TRANSPARENT WOOD, OFC IT WAS", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:41:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raging Rogue", "comment_text": "this guy could probably be a nuclear scientist but hes here educating us fools a moment of respect", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:37:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gage MacLeod", "comment_text": "ILOVEYOU NILERED", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:35:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amy", "comment_text": "Shouldn&#39;t we be moving away from plastic?", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:35:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SpookyMonster Demitiri", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=4m16s\">4:16</a> that\u2019s what she said", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:34:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felix", "comment_text": "Damn how much grease did you rub on that?", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:30:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shabby", "comment_text": "Collect wood.", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:23:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grady Toback", "comment_text": "I like the idea of making glass out of glass lmao redundant and funny", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:22:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silviu. x", "comment_text": "you mean you made cheap toilet paper", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:22:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "berith dm", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t realize this video was a new one, maybe adding &quot;again&quot; to the title or something like that would be good, i&#39;m more than happy to watch the whole process again but I didn&#39;t want to watch the same video twice, so I missed it at first!", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:19:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Retro Laser Studios", "comment_text": "You need background music!", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:18:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheReaper", "comment_text": "comment for the bobby duke WEWD shirt", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:17:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DeCube", "comment_text": "you shouldnt have resolved the bigger tungsten cube bit and let us assume, that you just have them lying about", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:12:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "9crutnacker 9", "comment_text": "So doesn&#39;t know the difference between transparent &amp; translucent.", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:12:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hasan jamal khan", "comment_text": "Transclucent*", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:11:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andre Diederick", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9FdbYWK7rc\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9FdbYWK7rc</a>", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:10:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Melissa Rosie", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=38m28s\">38:28</a> ..... poptart...", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:07:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arctrooper143", "comment_text": "hey @NileRed would flipping the glass over halfway through the Heating process help with the finished product or would it have no effect???", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:07:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Abdullah S", "comment_text": "hi eric muir", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:06:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave Churchill", "comment_text": "Why not try this again with a bunch of squares of different types of wood?", "comment_date": "2021-05-04T16:04:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mathew DeGauven", "comment_text": "Is there a way to place it between the two pieces of glass and put it into the vacuum chamber?

The way that the balsa is sawn/shear cut to thickness means you have a smooth side and an rough side which has lots of micro fuzzies on it. You should on both sides first wet the surface of the wood with clean water and leave to dry. this will raise the grain of the wood so that you can then sand using a block (not you hand) to get an even surface going from 120 grit up to 400grit. Clean off the surfaces with a Tack rag. then start the clarification process.

Very difficult with that initiator.  Your problems with the first polymerization is almost certainly air.  Oxygen reacts with the free radical and kills it. try under nitrogen stream.  also a VERY small amount of oxygen scavenger would help. we use 0.002-0.005% wt of monomer of sodium hydrosufite in our water based system. don&#39;t know if it will dissolve in MMA. Try purging the vac chamber with N2 or CO2 and break the vac cycles with it.<br><br>Mold release is also a pain in the A##.  Most is made to spray as mist onto a HOT mold.  Never seems to work right on cold surface. Hard to keep small molds hot.  Somebody makes a silicone release in diethyl ether that works better at room temp. Gold can, i think from Canada.<br><br>We made PE resin bars once that had your top surface problem.  In your case prob. N2 from residual initiator.  We were successful with using strong spring clamps to press the plates and baking the glass on-edge so all the bubbles formed along the top edge. We then cut that off and had smooth sides.  Used a high-temp wax to form a seal on the other 3 sides to hold the liquid resin.  Bought as a sheet with adhesive prepared on 1 side abt 1/8&quot; thick.<br><br>Might also experiment with pulling the mold apart hot, or at least warmer.  poly-MMA turns brittle (tg) about 105\u00b0C. As it cools and contracts it might be making micro-fractures pulling away from the glass.  Try opening at 80\u00b0C and see if it helps.  With our PE resin each recipe had a best de-molding temp.

However your procedure with the vacuum could be improved upon. What you would need to do is real simple if you have the right materials. I&#39;ll try to make this simple. What you need is to create a vacuum bag with a resin inlet and a vacuum outlet to draw the resin into the wood without any air. Seal the wood into your bag and remove all the air with a vacuum pump. Then introduce your low viscosity resin into the system via the resin inlet until you see the resin has diffused over and through the wood. Keep the vacuum running and the system sealed by closing your resin port and use a heater blanket to cure the resin. With some sanding and polishing you should receive a satisfactory result.  Look up videos on Fibre glass infusions to get a better idea. You could even get color added using this method as well with the proper resin solutions.

Since, I assume, you wouldn&#39;t be interrested in any value according to the standard and it would be just for the purpose of reaching a desired value, you could use one of glass funnels you have. Also, I am wondering, it would be a nice attempt to make the polymerisation in-situ, because as I see it, it all boils down to the problem of viscous MMA penetrating the wood. I don&#39;t know why the prepolymerisation would be required here. Penetration of wood with pure MMA with AIBN mixed-in would be much easier and after that the whole polymerisation step would be carried out in the oven.

It sure seems like I would lose my patience way before then end result :) I do however have some experience with balsa models as well as car detailing, which I think might come in handy. <br>First the balsa. It would help to sand it beforehand, but as balsa is very soft you need to not use a lot of force and use fine grit paper. Also when removing the pieces from the glass I would make sure to bend it against the grain as it is stronger in that direction. <br>Last the polishing. What you did is pretty good, but you should make sure that you focus on what part of the piece you polish so that it is polished evenly. Also adding car wax after all the polishing will fill the minor imperfections and remove the light refraction, making it more clear. Let the wax sit until nearly dry before wiping it off, but not completely. I would try with a fluid wax first and if that doesn&#39;t make it close to perfect maybe a bit harder one. If you want to make that last (as wax only lasts for so long), use a bit of car paint sealer.<br><br>As I said great work, and I hope that my suggestions can make it to your things of trying out. :)<br>/cheers", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T12:56:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M- Stephens", "comment_text": "This is really good", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T12:56:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zach Stake", "comment_text": "love your work .... to get it smooth on both sides could you not stand it on end? like seal up 3 sides somehow and then pour enough &quot;MMA&quot; to fill up the entire area over the piece?", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T12:54:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dark Night", "comment_text": "That whole video is basically \u201cI hope it will just go the way I want magically.\u201d That never works though.", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T12:54:31Z", "likes_count": 487}, {"comment_by": "Chirag", "comment_text": "Just keep it in gorilla glue long enough", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T12:53:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "It is What is is", "comment_text": "The fact that you needed to find something small and heavy and happened to have tungsten made me laugh.

You should be aware that oxygen acts as an inhibitor and will capture radicals from the AIBN or growing polymer chains. If you want more consistent results try bubbling an inert gas, I use nitrogen, through the liquid beforehand to displace the oxygen and seal the flask. About the viscosity, two things cause it to increase, making more polymer and longer polymer chains. To make polymer, simply let the reaction run longer. For longer chains, it&#39;s a little counterintuitive but adding more initiator actually decreases the length of the chains and will result in a low viscosity. One last tip, AIBN should be recrystalised from methanol before use as it soaks up water over time and you weight out less than you think.", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T10:10:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Petroskoi3000", "comment_text": "I would like to see you try 3D printer photopolymer resin.

The Distilled Water&gt; Ethanol&gt; Acetone steps are crucial and I&#39;m glad you did it this time. It is a very common technique in microscopy.\r<br>When you prepare biological samples of tissues, be they animal or plant, you have to cut them very thin so that they can be used under the microscope. Now, the cells are very fragile and very thin cuts cannot be made. For this reason, what is done is to replace all the water in the cells (which can be up to 80%) with a more resistant material: paraffin (optical) or resin (electronic). Actually what you are doing is exactly this same process, only in larger sizes, and you have already seen that with those previous steps to dehydrate they have improved the process a lot.<br>In general, if you accept the advice of a biologist, plant cells are very little porous and it takes a lot to get any material inside, so if you want to make thicker pieces of wood you have to leave it much longer to remove the lignin, because it is very difficult for the solution to penetrate inside. Also for polymerization, we normally use cubic molds where we put a little resin already polymerized in the bottom, and then the sample, so that the surface of the same is not irregular. From the final cube we cut sheets of a few microns, but it is much easier if you also want to make millimeters.", "comment_date": "2021-05-03T03:39:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tapas panigrahi", "comment_text": "Will it ever work?

The plywood boards at the bottom are much more insulating and would slow heat transfer between the sample bottom side and the oven.<br><br>You could try something like thermally insulating the tungsten from the glass or putting an equivalent piece of tungsten on the bottom, but perhaps just using clamps on the glass plates would achieve the same with fewer changes to the dynamics of the thermal transfer (unless the paper was also using tungsten cubes an&#39; everything).", "comment_date": "2021-05-02T16:57:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jesse Toes", "comment_text": "1.3 million views in only a day!

This makes red oak a poor choice for boat building as a small breach can cause a large area to become saturated.

If you submerge it first, then the plastic is preventing the air to escape from the wood pores, both by its pressure and by its viscosity. If you remove air first, it will escape easily from all wood pores and there will be empty space for the plastic to fill once you release the vacuum. Just one vacuum cycle might be enough then.<br>My hazy idea how to do it involves putting the wood into the dish dry, and attaching a beaker with the plastic to the lid using a magnet (with one side being fixed so it tips over when the magnet is removed rather than just falling down). Once there&#39;s vacuum in the chamber, remove the magnet and the beaker will empty into the dish over the wood.<br>Another option would be a hole into the side of the chamber with some o-rings for seal and a metal rod going through it to hold the beaker over the wood.

You&#39;ll need to use something pretty compressible so it doesn&#39;t make the wood seperate from the glass as it shrinks. This should help prevent the resin from spreading out of the wood. Maybe you could also try flipping it part way through baking to counteract the gravity thing.<br><br>And a point about why your first attempt had so many broken and cracked pieces. Last time, you used endgrain, which is a bunch of short wood fibers running through the thickness of the wood, held together by lignin.

This would express the solution deeper into the wood, and maybe migrate the dissolved lignin out of the cellulose matrix more completely. I just don&#39;t think you let the lignin removal go long enough. Or perhaps you need to make the solution stronger, because, just like with the methacrylate initiator, who knows how pure that sodium chlorite actually was?<br><br>I&#39;m still a little iffy on why this is even a significant project. Abstract knowledge is great, but the methacrylate is pretty darned strong and transparent on its own.

I had some thoughts on how the process might be improved, especially around the vacuum pulling and the resin injection. I&#39;ve got some experience with resins/epoxy and whatnot, so it might help \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f<br><br>Firstly, the vaccums you were pulling were to remove the acetone, as well as inject the resin. Ideally you want to do this in two steps. The first vaccums you pull should be left on for some time to allow the acetone to completely evaporate and liberate it from all liquids - you&#39;re essentially freeze drying it. Run a few pulls of a vacuum and allow the piece to completely dry, then try the second steps...<br><br>Secondly, the second runs of vacuum pulls to inject the resin don&#39;t need to be 15 minute pulls. All you&#39;re doing at this stage is pulling out the air, and letting the resin fill all the gaps that the air <b>was</b> in. So pull a vacuum until the piece stops bubbling, then release the air. Do this a few times until you see no more bubbles coming from the piece; but remember that the time under vacuum is basically doing nothing except thickening the resin. This is essentially the reverse of a pressure vessel, which would also force the resin in where the air is squashed - this is a process you can do on epoxy pieces where the bubbles won&#39;t shatter the piece. You&#39;re doing the opposite, so to achieve a negative pressure <b>inside</b> the wood, you need to pull the vacuum whilst it&#39;s under the resin, and then release it. Which brings me onto the last part. <br><br>The resin ideally needs to be as thin as possible, so it can bleed into all the gaps more easily when you&#39;ve pulled out the air and allowed it to suck in the resin in it&#39;s place. Maybe once you&#39;ve seen the initiator do it&#39;s job (i.e. it stops releasing it&#39;s gassy friends) get the piece submerged in it and pull the short vacuums. That will allow it to fill easier. <br><br>Lastly, I&#39;m no expert on this, but maybe using some sealant / silicon gel around the piece to hold the resin in place, and not flow away, might help with keeping the top nice and flat.

The issue is this would still take a long time to remove the lignin, and in order to get a proper seal you might have to have some sacrificial stock to make a seal out of resin or plastic, and it would likely be better to have the vast majority of the lignin removed wood submerged in resin rather than having it hanging in vacuum because this will have the effect of pulling the resin trough with vacuum rather than pushing the resin through with atmospheric pressure. so you will have fewer defects.<br><br>also as you make larger and larger pieces you will need higher and higher weight, there will get to a point where no matter what glass you choose you will cause the glass to shatter so this begs the question: why do the plates have to even be glass, what if you used a large polished metal plate, a few benefits to this is you can use a simple screw press to apply the weight rather than stacking things on top and instead of having to have the whole press in the oven you could use bolts to secure the plates while the assembly is in the press, for a window size to provide the proper amount of tensile strength you will likely need to weld supporting material to the plates and use many bolts.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T22:57:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ole Klabisch", "comment_text": "ghostwoodghostwoodghostwood", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T22:57:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D M", "comment_text": "lignin balls", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T22:57:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saemour Saeless", "comment_text": "whatcha reading Nile?", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T22:57:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrFatCatMan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUU3jW7Y9Ak&amp;t=4m34s\">4:34</a> we all waited for the mouse click sound effect", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T22:57:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Google User", "comment_text": "This is going to get tons of views soon.", "comment_date": "2021-04-30T22:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chiyo", "comment_text": "Wow when you dropped that finished piece on the book I was surprised at how clear it was!
