I hated chem when I took it 40 years ago, but I love watching your projects (and seriously lusting after your lab glass).<br><br>This particular bid was timely because I just deployed a 40W UV lamp zapper about 4 weeks ago in an area saturated by hurricane Harvey floods. The lamp on its own is moderately effective. I looked at adding an octenol cartridge, but these are just ridiculously expensive. My further looking at some articles also made me skeptical than octenol without a sustained release CO2 source would provide much incremental effectiveness. <br><br>Based on my reading and local observation of insect behavior, I&#39;ve just deployed a decidely low tech next step. It&#39;s a 500ml bottle 80% filled with a 1:1:1 mixture by vol of sugar, scrap sweet wine, and water with a tablespoon each of cornstarch, flour, and dry baking yeast. The bottle is placed adjacent to the zapper. <br><br>If this seems to increase the zapper rate, I might experiment next with adding octenol to the mixture. <br><br>My thought process is as follows: while female mosquitoes are attracted to the CO2/heat/octenol produced by mammals, both male and female mosquitoes are attracted to sweet liquids (nectars) for nutrition. While only the females bite, they only bite after they&#39;ve bred. Hopefully attracting the breeding pair near the light will reduce the actual egg carrying female population. Secondly, fermenting yeast seems to be a very strong attractant for many flying insects.  Third, it&#39;s just a hunch but I suspect octenol isn&#39;t the only alcohol compound that attracts.  I&#39;ve observed flying insects attracted to glasses of wine, wine that has degraded to vinegar, and to bottled fruit vinegars. <br><br>I&#39;ll try to post my results here.
