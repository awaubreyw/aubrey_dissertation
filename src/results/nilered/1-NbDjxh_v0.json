I say this because among artists who do oil painting there appears to be a Renaissance of interest in using lead white aka white lead aka basic lead carbonate aka hydrocerussite/cerussite (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.corsci.2018.10.033\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.corsci.2018.10.033</a><br>), and the synthesis, which can be easily done at home with lead metal sheets, acetic acid vapour, carbon dioxide from a little vat of live yeast, and a big box to contain it all, produces copious quantities of aqueous waste with a lot of lead(II) acetate in it. It would be healthier, more environmentally friendly, and recyclable to be able to extract pure lead metal from this waste, melt it down into metal sheets again and use it to make even more lead white. I&#39;m thinking of something along the lines of your tree of Saturn experiments but so good it extracts every trace of lead from waste so that the waste can be safely thrown away.

I have some proposals for you if you are at all interested.  I at first was wanting to get into collab projects with other YouTubers, but with my regular engineering day job and my aerospace 3D graphics freelance schedule, plus the many other parts of my life as a family man and keeping up with other projects I have going on, I have an excess of compounds I&#39;ve made which have a shelf life such as potassium ferric oxalate (K3[Fe(C2O4)]3).  One problematic issue of this particular compound is that it is photosensitive and decomposes forming CO2 upon exposure to light.  I have no immediate use for it and I&#39;d rather see someone put it to use.  Most of my K3[Fe(C2O4)]3 has been purified three times through recrystalization.  Some of it has not, but is stored and labelled in a separate light protected container.  I still have approximately 600ml of solution to evaporate and crystalize the remaining K3[Fe(C2O4)]3.<br><br>Let me know if you have any interest in taking donations of compounds I&#39;ve created.  I have no problem donating them to you since you are one of my favorite YouTubers.  A couple other guys just won&#39;t respond to my proposal.  Maybe they think there is a catch to it.  I don&#39;t see any legal concers over the particular chemicals I&#39;m referring since they are widely available online from eBay, Amazon and just about any science company that will sell to industry and individuals.  I list all chemicals used in the synthesis of my products, plus I have access to a lot of interesting igneous rocks/minerals which can be used for extracting many interesting compounds.<br><br>If interested, send me an email to themadpinner@<a href=\"http://gmail.com/\">gmail.com</a>.<br><br>I love your videos.
