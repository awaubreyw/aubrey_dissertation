This is a variation not a mutation. The clue to this is the idea the blue can mutate repeatedly into green and red and the red can repeatedly mutate into orange. A mutation is random in what it changes. This means the change has an incredibly low chance of occurring more than once. So low in fact it would be eieser to guess a 5 thousand digit pin on the first try. Additionally, mutation often mutations leads to death of the individual preventing replication of the mutation.

Then you&#39;ve got amazed that the rules you&#39;ve made did what you&#39;ve expected. Then you&#39;ve just stated that this is how complex life forms can emerge. No proof, no explanation, nothing, just a single statement. You have not explained how sexes could have emerged, even though you&#39;ve stated &quot;Eventually we will tie this to the real physical world, stay tuned&quot;, but that never happens. &quot;Since complex organisms can&#39;t form without replication it doesn&#39;t matter how good they are at replicating if there aren&#39;t any around to replicate.&quot; and so &quot;we were left with a mistery&quot; and learned nothing about evolution theory.

There is no paleontological or archaeological evidence for one species mutating into another. There are NO fossil records in between different kinds of species. Mutations like these do NOT account for different kinds entirely. The darwinian finches are still finches. They&#39;re not now frogs. Natural selection works, but evolution as people like to say it does, does not. There&#39;s scientific evidence for evolution, as in species adapting to/mutating to better live in certain conditions, but all of those are from one thing to then the same thing. If what you&#39;re suggesting is true, then somehow things like chickens mutated out of fish or other sea based creatures. Before that, somehow single cell organisms mutated into muti cell organisms down the line into fish. Before that, somehow single cell organisms came to exist. Before that bacteria... If you back far enough, there&#39;s just hot rotating molecules and elements.. How do those randomly get put together in such a way that creates life? So let me ask a version of the age old question, what came first? What randomly mutated first... The fish&#39;s gills, it&#39;s brain, it&#39;s skeletal structure, it&#39;s internal organs, or it&#39;s reproductive system? Which one of the absolutely necessary things for a fish or other sea creature mutated first? They would have had to mutate all at the same time PERFECTLY, but we know that&#39;s not how that happens. Or that even when incredible mutations to a living thing&#39;s dna do happen, they almost exclusively make life more difficult and not easier. This theory you&#39;re presenting is telling us that were supposed to believe that massive mutations that produced things like brains and vital organs all happened randomly at the same time in such a way that the mutated form of life is now the only living form of that creature AND there is no actual measurable physical or empiracally verifiable evidence for the MANY stages in-between these different forms of life? How are we supposed to believe that? Evolution only accounts for mutations and adaptations limited to a singular kind of animal (human, iguana, frog, etc). That being said, your math is extremely applicable to mutations and helps us understand mutations such as the color and hair color or beak shapes or things of that nature, and why we have the specific forms of the animals alive that we do today! Not trying to bash your content, but it&#39;s important to only be teaching verifiable truth. If it&#39;s just speculation, like you do BRIEFLY mention, there should be much more emphasis on it. &quot;We are only beginning to understand exactly how this fits into our real world situation,&quot; or whatever the exact quote that you said in this video was, is simply not enough.

Many years ago I experimented with evolutionary concepts using two creature types: predators and prey. I created an X-Y landscape and one of the characteristics of every creature was its location on the X-Y grid. I had arrays to keep track of the two creature types. With every iteration, each prey stood a chance of dying, based on a basic random chance, it&#39;s age, and it&#39;s proximity to a predator creature, and all these variables would increase or decrease the random chance. The only hard-stop was that every creature would die at age 20. For the predators, all the same life/death factors were the same except proximity to prey creatures. The closer they were, the more likely they were to get fed. I wrote this program in Basic on an APPLE II computer, that is how long ago I did this. For replication, I kept the number of creatures constant. After the die-off of creatures that did not make the cut, I repopulated their slots with creatures generated from the surviving creatures. I would randomly select two surviving creatures of that type, average their stats, and then add a small randomized positive or negative value to those stats. I then plotted the location of all creatures on the screen, on the grid. It was fun to watch the prey creatures evolve away from the predator creatures while the predator creatures evolved in hot pursuit.", "comment_date": "2019-05-11T02:26:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sammy Sammyson", "comment_text": "I just discovered your content, and sent some videos to my bio teacher.

Before there was life, space was just filled with different particles interacting with each other, according to physical laws. After some (long) time, eventually, there will be a lot of recurring patterns in how particles interact. They may bond together better with specific other particles, split up into different clusters, which can bond with other clusters and so on. There will be a lot of different types of clusters and patterns, but the ones which are the most stable and adaptive to different conditions, those are the ones that stay. So while other things fall apart, those things that dont fall apart get more time to &quot;be&quot;, which is really all that existence is about. It is just about gaining more time to be. So the patterns which managed to stay, those are the ones that are around today. It is actually simple evolutionary principles, applied to atoms interacting with each other and forming clusters and patterns. Over time, the environment will force the patterns to become more complex and selection and competition will only leave the &quot;best&quot;, most stable patterns to able to stay, to &quot;survive&quot;. We as animals share a billion tiny patterns with other animals, some even with plants, others are unique to us, which is why we are not going extinct (hopefully). Evolutionary principles are inherent to the universe, it is a simple logical conclusion: That which manages to stay, is able to &quot;be&quot;. Now &quot;living&quot; things might require closer classification, such as reproduction and movement, or life cycle and genetic material or something like that. Living things might also just be a part of the pattern &quot;DNA&quot;, which is the actual thing that is struggling to survive. But the borders are not clear, after all, everything emerged from the universe by the same principles, they are just different patterns of matter with different strategies for how to keep staying around.", "comment_date": "2019-04-30T15:51:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "animation studios", "comment_text": "its a great video also i subcribe and liked a blob just a blob", "comment_date": "2019-04-30T14:56:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiny Ford", "comment_text": "I love how nobody made this video or the blobs in the program...
