In the end it might work like each of them taking proportional food to their power or it will be war to death - all or nothing. In that case winner will have minimum amount of profit compared to peace option. Let&#39;s say if he&#39;s twice as powerful he&#39;s gonna get 1.5 from the first option, but second means he&#39;s going to lose his stamina and get injury so it&#39;s always below 1.5(let&#39;s say 1.25). Going Hawk way makes sense in personal survival, because the fact that you&#39;re ready to go for mutual destruction means that you can get better terms. If the other Hawk realizes that he might not go to risk, so he rather give up 0.5 &lt; x &lt; 0.75(in cases that Hawk got little bit more scared maybe even more. It&#39;s about when it becomes direct existencial threat) and win peacefully than initiate conflict. Other variable in this situation is that Hawk who just got into fight will be weakened for his future adventures compared to the other Hawks and this acts as prevention which can be used by the weaker Hawks.", "comment_date": "2022-05-27T12:56:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arne Cousaert", "comment_text": "I would always choose dove", "comment_date": "2022-05-26T15:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JSM", "comment_text": "I thought that is covelent and ionic", "comment_date": "2022-05-26T11:01:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ud558\uc2b9\uc6b0", "comment_text": "Sharing is caring<br>&quot;I care for my self and the one&#39;s that matter&quot;", "comment_date": "2022-05-25T16:11:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043e\u0432 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430", "comment_text": "\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0418\u043d\u044f \u0438 \u042f\u043d\u0430", "comment_date": "2022-05-25T14:03:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Morten Bjerkelund", "comment_text": "&quot;field of math called GAME THEORY&quot; but hey, thats just a MATH THEORY", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T20:47:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bernhard Blocksberg", "comment_text": "What I took away from this video is that no hawks are actually necessary.", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T14:14:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "That KBS Kid", "comment_text": "Game theory", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T14:10:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Muhammed Salim Gaming", "comment_text": "That&#39;s enough my brain is fried more than a chicken at kfc omg!", "comment_date": "2022-05-24T12:56:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Moonswind Witch", "comment_text": "Idk, I would pick Dove regardless of the social factor. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-05-23T21:10:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aurora Vaughan", "comment_text": "Wonder how many &quot;It&#39;s just a theory, A GAME THEORY!

Hawks vs Hawks has this mathematically integrated flaw that it&#39;s somehow beneficial to fight for food and ultimately gain nothing from it--which I can&#39;t help but feel is a bit of a senseless sentiment only there to assist the design of the equilibrium. While there are multiple variables and angles to account for in nature--wouldn&#39;t it make more sense, in a combative situation between Hawks, for one to perish and the other to walk away with 2 food pellets? I understand that, given the initial setup, this would make it so every Hawk killed guarantees another Hawk&#39;s reproduction--which is a bit of a moot formula--so maybe setting the successful Hawk&#39;s expended energy rule implementation is necessary to keep it interesting; granting the surviving Hawk &lt;2 food pellets rather than 2. Though another issue comes to light: why play it safe and be a Dove vs Hawk situation? Initially it was due to it yielding a higher chance to survive than Hawk vs Hawk, but... with my tweek in mind, both Hawk vs Dove and Hawk vs Hawk would yield a 50% chance at survival ultimately for both example&#39;s participants (excluding the Hawk with a 100% survival guarantee in Dove vs Hawk)--the only major difference is whether the survivors walk away with 1/2 &amp; 3/2 food pellets or 2 food pellets... one bird perishes from either hunger (if there&#39;s a single dove) or combat (if they&#39;re both hawks). Maybe boosting Dove vs Hawk&#39;s survival rates to 75% - 100% respectively would make more sense for higher survival chance at the expense of food pellet yield; reproduction/time. While Dove vs Dove is arguably still the safest option--there needs to be consideration towards the natural factor of &quot;higher risk, higher reward&quot;; 50% chance of survival for potentially more food pellets.

Seems random but actually is predictable using Mandelbrot and the doubles and triples are bifurcations and reaches a stabil harmonic  kinda even when it\u2019s got 5 diferent repeating patterns in the harmonic making it so complex we often won\u2019t give it any extra thought. As well as same time just turn up the water just a slight amount it ether drips real slow and completly random or speeds up just a bit and the dripping becomes random and flakes into chaos. It\u2019s crazy from this your talking about to dripping water all can actually be modeled using Mandelbrot. I believe some where between the Mandelbrot and Pie or in the combination of the two showing pie is organized chaos and is a harmonic of its own and infinites can be a loop finite or fractal Mandelbrot used to express finite a that is where we will find important parts to grand unified theory. Or who know the link between standard model and M with some many wolds and quantum loop thrown in to spice things up. Ether way I can see it in my head and actually wrote it down.

Where the males fight during the mating session and the alpha gets all the females?  That seems like a pure hawk strategy to me with high risk, but high reward.  The reproductive benefit is huge for the winner.  If you can mate with 20-30 females during a single season, then future seasons don&#39;t seem as important.  It&#39;s too good of a benefit to the individual, and forces all the males to play the hawk strategy, because unless they win or rape a female, they won&#39;t reproduce.  Another interesting thing I&#39;ve heard was that it is the females that drive evolution, since they do the majority of the &#39;choosing&#39;.  Then, even though the &#39;winner takes all&#39; strategy is bad for the majority of the males, it&#39;s advantageous to the females to only breed with the top males.  A pure hawk strategy doesn&#39;t appear good for a species, but it seems like plenty of them are set up that way and are stable.  Is it that the population stays the same or continues to grow, despite all the fighting? Or is there a duel strategy going on? Like during the mating season, everyone is a hawk, but in the off season everyone is a dove? (I guess I&#39;m thinking of species like deer or elk when I say this, because they seem docile for the majority of the year)", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T23:30:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u8c37\u6b4c\u7ffb\u8bd1", "comment_text": "This whole process is basically a mr beast video", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T20:10:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lotschi", "comment_text": "I want a new video!<br>\ud83d\ude04<br>SO MUCH!", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T19:03:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hristo varlev", "comment_text": "I just died\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T18:05:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Owlboy1", "comment_text": "But that&#39;s just a theory a game theory", "comment_date": "2022-04-06T10:33:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "P Chan", "comment_text": "No one likes peas", "comment_date": "2022-04-05T21:54:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u00b0.HDMI33.\u00b0", "comment_text": "that\u2019s just a theory a game theory", "comment_date": "2022-04-04T21:27:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brownfacemini", "comment_text": "The hawks: hippity hoppity your survival is now my property", "comment_date": "2022-04-04T17:44:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miss Jx\u014d", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not really sure what I just watched but it was really interesting, more than my normal classes.

He is a single-target melee troop who targets grounded units. He has high hitpoints and moderate damage per second. Being a Champion card, he will stay out of the player&#39;s card cycle while he is deployed, and only return once he is destroyed. The Golden Knight&#39;s ability increases his movement speed when no enemies are nearby, and causes him to dash onto enemies in sequence, similar to the Electro Spirit&#39;s attack. He has golden hair and is outfitted in gilded breastplate and gauntlets, as his name implies, and wields an impressively large sword. A Golden Knight card costs 4 Elixir to deploy, and his ability costs an additional 1 Elixir. The Golden Knight has a special ability, accessible from the rightmost side of the screen just above the player&#39;s card slots in battle. After a 1 second delay, the Golden Knight activates his &quot;Dashing Dash&quot;, gaining a movement speed boost if he is not within 5 tiles of an enemy unit. Once a unit is in range, he dashes to it quickly, then dashes towards any other units within a 5-tile radius (even if the previous unit was not destroyed). His dashes have invulnerability and deal increased damage, like the Bandit. He cannot dash into the same troop per ability use. He will stop dashing after dashing 10 times or if no other valid targets are within range. The ability goes on an 11 second cooldown after the duration ends. The Dashing Dash ability costs 1 Elixir to activate.  It is also important to note that his movement speed boost cannot be reset or cancelled by The Log, Zap, Freeze confirmation needed or other things that will normally stop a charge.        <br>Strategy<br>            For the purposes of determining Elixir trades, the Golden Knight and his activated Ability count as 5 Elixir, as the player must play the 4 Elixir Knight and then spend a further 1 on his Ability. While he runs to the tower, use a cheap card like Skeletons to make him dash from the tower into said cheap card. If done correctly, this can be used to cause him to chain dash into the King&#39;s Tower and activate it. Because of this, it is not recommended to use his Dashing Dash if there isn&#39;t a target. For the reason mentioned above, he can act like an Electro Spirit: Potentially lots of value, but can also be a double edged sword if you accidentally activate the opponent&#39;s King Tower. Though this isn&#39;t recommended due to the cooldown, the Golden Knight&#39;s ability can be used to counter swarms. The Golden Knight is unique in the fact that he can dash onto multiple targets, like a Knight and Tower, and still attack the original target. Because of this, it can be hard to defend against. For example, if a Valkyrie is approaching a tower, the defender will use a Knight to avoid all damage, but if a Golden Knight is approaching and the defender places a Knight close to the tower, it will dash onto the tower, making the defense less valuable. If the player has a unit on the board that they do not want the enemy Golden Knight to reach, they must play more ground units as far away from it as possible to entice the Knight to charge into the more expendable units instead. Due to his low damage output, a glass cannon or mini-tank such as Mini-P.E.K.K.A. or Prince can easily take him out. Once the Golden Knight uses ability, he will not target any units behind him unless they are in range. In other words. The Dashing Dash ability only chains to the troops that the Golden Knight can see.", "comment_date": "2022-03-24T08:45:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abdulrahman Alriffaie", "comment_text": "I will always be hawk.", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T16:02:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cruize", "comment_text": "i found this back a couple months after it was released, found it again and it&#39;s amazing still.", "comment_date": "2022-03-23T12:04:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nochinator", "comment_text": "2 things <br>1: so basicly the world is just in a prison<br>2: what if 3 blobs find one food?", "comment_date": "2022-03-22T00:25:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Slapshot", "comment_text": "i swear this video has been in my recommended at least 100 times", "comment_date": "2022-03-21T21:08:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "JJokerMoreau", "comment_text": "This really didn&#39;t and doesn&#39;t mean anything.

Owls get 90% slowed by it and have a 24% win rate. Shoebills get faster and have better damage. Many blobs will hide under trees, but poor owls may die sometimes.<br><br>Tree: Hiding places for pigeons and crows. A large &quot;shed&quot; tree with many holes in the middle of the map allows all types of blobs to hide under it. In rain, every type of blob can hide under every tree. Trees also sometimes drop apples which are the same as pellets.<br><br>Pond: A small pond near the big tree. Blobs can drink the water to get a better reproduction chance. It is a sleeping ground for shoebills and ducks. Owls sometimes drown and die when walking into the water. <br><br>Owl: Eats other blobs but is vulnerable to rain and water. Has a 40% win rate against hawks normally but mostly uses the extremely effective backstab strategy where they go behind an unknowing blob and kill them. Color: White<br><br>Seagull: Fast and takes all food it can. It has extremely low HP however. Color: Grey<br><br>Crow: Neutral. It shares food with other species. However it is a force to be reckoned with. It can turn excess food into weapons which makes it easier fo fight hostiles. It also lives in packs. When a crow dies and a hostile is seen near the body, crows will be suspicious and if they see a death caused again, they will gang up and kill the hostile. Color: Black<br><br>Cuckoo: Steals children from other species and turns them into cuckoos. Its actual children are given to doves, and will need a lot more food to nurture, effectively tiring out the dove and leaving it in a vulnerable situation. It has one glaring weakness: It needs to be sneaky about the children situation. If it gets caught, it will immediately die. They also need to eat more food to survive. Color: Brown<br><br>Falcon: Feeds on rammed blobs. It first has to charge up its speed and will speed up every 0.8 seconds. It can ram blobs when it moves half a tile. It increases its ramming power when it accelerates even faster. However, the faster a falcon goes, the harder for it to steer clear of edges. Color: Brownish Grey<br><br>Parrot: A slightly aggressive blob. It can claim food piles. Blobs that try to eat a parrot&#39;s food pile will get screeched at. Most blobs will get scared, but some will try to fight. However, it shares with food piles that already have a blob eating it. Color: Green<br><br>Songbird: A pacifist blob. It chirps and makes calming songs. Songs can break up fights near it. It shares food too. Songs can also attract mates easily, explaining the extreme growth. It is however, the weakest blob and will die at a single hit from predatory blobs. Color: Purple<br><br>Shoebill: Protector of the defenseless. When it spots a blob attacking another blob, it will attack the attacking blob. It has massive damage, but will try not to kill the attacker. The attacker will get traumatized and will steer clear of the shoebill for a while. Its only weakness is its slow pace and its slow reproduction.<br>Color: Blue-grey<br><br>Duck: Peacefully swims along ponds and resurfaces to eat. It has low health and is defenseless, but can run away fast. It delivers quite the feast however, as predators can survive AND have two children by eating a duck. <br>Color: Green, then fades to grey", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T05:02:42Z", "likes_count": 26}, {"comment_by": "Jessica Galvin", "comment_text": "These blobs are so cute. &lt;3", "comment_date": "2021-09-01T04:07:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TauriOfficial", "comment_text": "What software do you use for simulations?", "comment_date": "2021-08-31T19:01:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "palebeachbum", "comment_text": "This illustrates conservative and liberal idealogies.

For instance, if a person uses a hawk strategy (one where they take), it would be much more efficient if you respond with a dove strategy (one where you share). This can also be applied vice-versa.  A mathematical function can also be written to represent this function:<br><br>Score of doves on average = (score when exposed to other doves * 1) + (score when exposed to hawks*1/2)<br>\r<br>Score of hawks on average = (score when exposed to doves * 3/2) + (score when exposed to other hawks*0)<br>where both score averages have to remain in equilibrium.<br><br>When this line is plotted on a graph, the intersection of the line, (AKA the solution for the system) is always held true when doves and hawks maintain a 50% ratio.<br><br>What complicates things in the study of advanced game theory though is the versatility of those people, and how some of them can have a different percentage chance of playing either strategy or how some of them may act differently while being exposed to a specific person. But what if the risk of facing both hawks was not as sacrificing? then a specific term known as the prisoner&#39;s dilemma comes into play.", "comment_date": "2021-06-12T20:17:28Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "joey", "comment_text": "the only math I feel like seeing", "comment_date": "2021-06-12T18:26:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YoukiTenshi", "comment_text": "Awesome indeed, but you should consider social, ambiental, mindfull and contextual effects too for next steps.

My reasoning for this is that if you look at the four possible strategies there is a 50% chance that your opponent will also be happy to share, meaning you both survive to the next day, a 25% chance that the opponent tries to scare you but runs away when you stand your ground, giving you a 1/2 chance of reproduction, and if they do decide to fight to the death you have a 50/50 chance of dying or winning the fight, and if you do win then you get the 1.5 food for 50% percent chance of getting to reproduce.

Eventually some Doves would die without reproducing but this would make room for others to reproduce (there would be more food spare), creating an equilibrium (this also results in the highest possible population as seen in the video). However the most selfish people know that if everybody would play Dove, they could play Hawk, and benefit more for themselves, so then some (let\u2019s say 50%) of the remaining Doves would prefer to save themselves and play Hawk, and then 50% of the new remainder of Doves would switch to Hawk and so on, so on. This continues until the population reaches an equilibrium because people realise that it becomes better to play the minority like it did in the video (when Hawks wasted 100% of there energy fighting).<br><br>This would be cool to do with a group of people to make a spectrum of the most selfish of the group to the most selfless. (BTW being 100% selfless is just as bad as being 100% selfish IMHO - the last Dove is just as bad as the first Hawk in their own right). This could also be interpreted as a measurement of stupidity/stubbornness or the like in the group.<br><br>The lowest possible population would be with 100% Hawks and the highest with 100% Doves as realised in the video. <br><br>I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m writing this, I just wanted to I guess, but this was all done on mobile so it took a long time!<br><br>This simulation is also almost exactly like the game show \u201cGolden Balls\u201d (so much so that it could have even been an inspiration for the video!) if I am not mistaken, I feel like that is the name of the show that I am taking about. I believe that it is the final round where the last two contestants have to choose to split or steal with the other contestant by picking up a ball with one of the respective words on it (Only they know which one is which, their opponent does not).

For example amy ants emply a hawk dove strategy in the sence that they both work in a great teem as the colony like doves but also commit genocide and often eat the larva of other ant species. All animals are inherently hawk. What this video misses out on is that the ultimate key to several is to employ the most sustainable tactics and adapt from one to the other depending on who u face. Its not about selfishness or selflessness its about sustainability. The video becomes even more inaccurate when we consider humans not animals.

Evolution is something that I have been studying in my spare time and thinking about a lot lately, and this made me reflect on some things. In the video, you point out about having other traits that could exist such as conditional strategy and that made me think about two other possible additional situations:<br>1 - when the hawk is &quot;rational&quot;, whenever they find themself disputing the same &quot;food&quot; one of them decides to be a dove. This situation would have an equilibrium of 100% hawk and the same population as the situation you pointed out. <br>2 - when the dove is &quot;emotional&quot;, whenever he finds himself disputing the same &quot;food&quot; with a hawk he would get angry and become a Shawn as well. This situation would make the dove at a disadvantage but in the equilibrium, hawks would disappear so it would be an advantage for the population as a whole since the equilibrium would tend to 100% dove, with a population of individuals bigger than in the situation 1.<br>With this, I conclude that being &quot;rational&quot; is good for the individual alone, but being &quot;emotional&quot; is good for the population as a whole. It makes me understand why would nature give us the trait of being emotional sometimes. What we usually consider as a defect of human beings may in some situations give out species an advantage.<br>I would love if you talked about this in another video <b>.</b>", "comment_date": "2021-03-22T20:25:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ItzGray", "comment_text": "Me acting like I understand: \u201c\ud83e\udd14 yes, go on\u201d", "comment_date": "2021-03-22T18:21:58Z", "likes_count": 4399}, {"comment_by": "Random", "comment_text": "Video: theory of evolution<br>First subtitle in the video: IRJTJSKDOEAOEJEMG D", "comment_date": "2021-03-22T17:26:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "4Dkarma\u2122", "comment_text": "but hey that&#39;s just a theory a game theory", "comment_date": "2021-03-22T09:35:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kirsten Hansen henry", "comment_text": "I pickes blue still i pick blue", "comment_date": "2021-03-22T08:32:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GABEBESTX1771", "comment_text": "What if 1 hawk meets the two pairs of food?", "comment_date": "2021-03-22T03:32:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gsoki Time", "comment_text": "This guy is going to make a replica of the simulation we are in", "comment_date": "2021-03-22T00:57:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sniper Dude", "comment_text": "When you forget what game theory\u2019s YouTube channel is so you have to watch something else:", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T22:16:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruukz", "comment_text": "it&#39;s good video don&#39;t get me wrong. but swear to god i&#39;ve gotten this video recommended so much the last month.", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T21:28:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "jake", "comment_text": "bro the blob merch is pretty nice but i cant use 25 for it", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T20:59:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maxwell Bown", "comment_text": "game theory?

Could this be viewed as a kind of commentary on communism as well as just evolutionary biology? Like humans exist as a species with intelligence to choose between hawking and doving. Capitalism is super competitive, very hawky. Like hawking has become the new &quot;meta&quot; of the human society where competing with others and not necessarily taking their resources but trying to advance yourself over them is the best strategy for gaining resources.

Having the maximum population can destroy the environment as well as lead to starvation of many, and can (at least with humans) lead to massive conflicts that could lead to an extreme loss of life and could even make the species go extinct if nobody decides to sit on the sidelines and watch the fight, or if those sideliners can&#39;t find any food. I get youre pushing against greed and saying it&#39;s always better to share, but you&#39;re wrong for several reasons. Some people are pieces of shit that don&#39;t deserve anything. Some people are manipulative, horrible Fucking people. And genuinely don&#39;t deserve an equal share. They deserve to fight for what they have or die with no help.

I found a problem in the simulations, like: You don&#39;t have any social ties in your video simulation, for example, the creature eats two food and reproduces, that&#39;s mean that we have a family ties between two creatures, even if they are hawks, they won&#39;t fight between, they would split the food for the \rsurvival and wait for another day to act. Then, I would like to say about the population, the simulations gives us fixed amount of food, so we have some borders in which creatures will stop reproduce more than some amount of them. Now, imagine these are not just creatures and we are not on the &quot;God&quot; role, these are creatures with their &quot;family name&quot; and they have specific gens(now remember  the main role of the reproducing among the creatures, it is to save you own gens and reproduce them), So now with these specifics of the simulation, we have creatures for example halved (half doves, half hawks). The simulation starts, we will see that doves will be demolished in ~10 days and then we will have the fight between hawks (don&#39;t forget about the relative ties), In which they will reach the maximum amount of creatures and will fight for their family tree, in which I personally see reasonable circle of the survival in which particular groups of social active creatures will survive or reproduce. And for the people who will say that the circle between doves is &quot;fair&quot;, you aren&#39;t playing a real world simulation, in which we have our will to reproduce ourselves with our gens, and in the only dove world, there are no particular personalities, it is just a group of creatures, which are reaching the maximum amount of  them and live till someone&#39;s die and only one creature will fill the gap.

Our modern food system is a superb example of this. We Australians grow food on farms which are in competition with each other. However farms may cooperate (not very well) in sharing water from a river such as the Murray-Darling. There are cooperative rules about which herbicides and insecticides can be used on farms and how much fruit pickers from overseas should be paid. Farmers compete via lowering prices in order to sell their produce to supermarkets which also compete in price wars. However there is cooperation around labeling of food so that it agrees with requirements set by the government. Customers cooperate a lot in supermarkets by physically distancing when queueing and in being polite to each other and to shop assistants as they shop. The supermarkets compete against each other by trying to outdo each other with presentation and prices etc but also have to obey certain government laws e.g. re safety and refrigeration. This dance between cooperation and competition seems to work very well.     We also apply it in other areas e.g. playing tennis. Players cooperate around the rules of the game but compete fiercely within those rules. How fiercely they compete depends on a cooperative agreement before the game e.g. let&#39;s just have a friendly neighborhood game, or &quot;this is Wimbledon: let&#39;s compete to the limit of our abilities.&quot;   This ability to weave together cooperation and competition is one of the great strengths of us mammals. However ants and bees do it too. Look at the complexity of a beehive! Fantastic cooperative delegation of duties. However if you threaten their hive, you can feel the competition as they drive you away.  So the above game, Simulating the Evolution of Aggression is interesting but doesn&#39;t reflect reality. In practice, communities cooperate together a lot because a harmonious community provides a safe haven for the protection of a pool of genes. There can be some competition within that community. The rich may buy better houses and can buy more food. However allowing some members of the community to be too downtrodden is unwise. Desperately poor community members will turn to crime, making the community less cooperative and thus less safe. A well-run nation like Australia provides a wonderfully cooperative place within which some competition can occur. However the foolish decision to use negative gearing to give multiple houses to the rich has meant that there are many more homeless people. Homeless people are often sick so by having desperately poor people in our midst, we are providing a pathway for those intensely competitive creatures - viruses. It is always a false economy to save money by creating poverty within your nation.", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T01:31:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Josiah OTK", "comment_text": "Hawks: take half more food than it should.<br>MandJTV fans: Why can\u2019t you all just <b>BEHAVE YOURSELVES</b>", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T00:54:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Ryan", "comment_text": "BIG BRAIN MATH", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T22:03:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Munroe", "comment_text": "Survival of the fittest doesn&#39;t mean survival of the strongest or the healthiest or most capable.

This reminds me very much of the Prisoner&#39;s Dilemma and similar ethical and social scenarios we discussed in my one Evolutionary Psychology class. However one thing people often forget when they insist that humans are inherently selfish and that a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; mentality is the best way to survive is that cooperation has it&#39;s benefits too. There is a reason we humans (and other animals) evolved to cooperate with each other. Cooperation not only prevents the mutual demise of both creatures, it also can enhance both organisms&#39; odds of survival and reproduction if, for example, the two organisms worked together to gather and split more food than either organism could have gathered alone. So really, as much as one can argue that violence and aggression is apart of human nature, one could also argue so is altruism and pacifism.", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T01:25:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cactus Cat", "comment_text": "It\u2019s already back.", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T00:40:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan Kowalski", "comment_text": "You proved, that if the reward is too big for hawks, then there is war.

Someone explain this to me, if you think i&#39;m an idiot then further argue your topic because if not you&#39;re an idiot. You people run through life listening to authoritative people without asking questions because you cant think for yourself. I&#39;m sick of this mindset that i&#39;m constantly seeing. If your trying to be a hawk, don&#39;t be. You want to know why? Because its a fucking YouTube video and it doesn&#39;t apply to real life. If you think your gaining anything constantly thinking about the past. Your not because the only reason why you should look at the past is so that it can change the future. So with that concept on the table. You should think about important shit and not some dumb fucking metaphoric shit that does not correlate to real life. If anything it&#39;s just gonna make more hAwKs because they think that its cool or some random shit that makes no logical sense. Like sure if you want to be a lonely asshole and hurt people that care about you. Be my guest but just know i ain&#39;t visiting you on your deathbed or your funeral and neither will anyone else because no one would fucking like you.", "comment_date": "2020-08-16T22:44:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Artful Dodger", "comment_text": "I didn&#39;t expect dove to thrive in a society predominant with hawks but then there are few hawks if there are only hawks so I suppose this makes sense.

This way the overall population size can be kept higher than red and blue mix but probably still lower than all dove population.

This means that playing Hawk is worse for the survival of a species since the more that a Hawk reproduces, the more Hawk blobs there will be to possibly kill each other and the more likely a Dove blob might die as well. On paper, the role of the Hawk sounds like the best way to go, but it&#39;s really the worst option for both your own survival and the survival of the species because while the chance of running into another Hawk seems to cap out at around 40% I would say since only an 80% of the max population seems possible when it consists of Hawks and Doves, and half the population will be Doves and the other half will be Hawks, that 40% chance guarantees that you will die, as opposed to a Dove who has an equal chance of running into a Hawk, who has a 50% chance of dying in that scenario.", "comment_date": "2020-03-02T02:16:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "martin stojanovic", "comment_text": "Why tf am i not sleeping rn and watching this instead", "comment_date": "2020-03-02T02:02:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Morrison", "comment_text": "Just like in real life with what the bankers do to us in large scale.

Its also so you can successfully find a breeding partner. No one wants to breed with someone who&#39;s mean to them because 1(if your partner hurts you to the point of incapacity before your child can be born, the likelihood of the child surviving is limited and 2( your child has half your genes and if your partner hurts you for your genes, may hurt the child for the genes you gave it. Now, the reason you&#39;d want your partner to stay while your pregnant is because pregnancy limits your abilities, especially near the end.

This is how real animals develop territories. Also your score equaltion is wrong, because it ignores the chances that Doves get food uncontested.

Because if they were always at contest the only thing that would matter is if during the 50% chances of survival if they survived at all. In those cases even if they survive if they&#39;re only to compete repeatedly for food then there would be no reproduction and thus also the population would eventually become null.

think of yourselfs and take good care of the weak that are draining us on resources that we could use in other ways to make the futere of humanity way better than ever, but don&#39;t you think about this care about yourself and feed your own ego help the unfit to sruvive make the stupid ppl the leaders of countries and have them decide about your human rights and have them decide about everything b/c we are all pwr hungry to show everyone that we are the most fit to survive our doom.<br><br><br>the weak with do whatever it takes to make themselves stronger even if that&#39;s making others weaker than they are.<br>i&#39;d hapily have a strong leader that is not pushing down others but instead are trying to make others as strong as they are and not by making themselves weaker but by ruliong with an iron fist and a heart of gold.<br><br><br>but rly who cares?

(errors teach you how to avoid them more than any possible simulation). <br><br><br>good tests can be made using evolutionary neural networks and a set of actions that can be taken with their chances of success (like avoid conflict , split , fight for all , fight for more , kill , store an event into memory , make food  , broadcast anger , demand justice , percentage payback for law enforcement etc) and while inputs are (surrounding conflict , current conflict , history of opponent , current action of opponent , predicted survival chances , score of pain and discomfort , current condition , current resources , level of liberty , property rights , equality , justice etc) and create 7 sets of species each with a separate neural network. and see what will happen.<br><br><br>due to simulation imperfections they will just all become vigilantes or something , but in real life possibilities are higher , resolution is higher , actions taken can vary with varying degrees of success based on situation. so in real life equilibrium will be as stated in the first paragraph with the evolution of a system of Government that continues evolving. presence of hawks will always be feasilble due to people with psychological problems and faults , or oppertunists who converts evil into money and resources. and doves that want stability and peace and hates fighting , and vigilantes who are willing to enforce justice on themselves and everybody around them correctly and justly at a fee to be able to specialize in justice with the inherent risk that the government system truns corrupt and hawks themselves if hawks corrupt them and infiltrate their ranks and bribe them and convinces them that it will be better to enslave doves which will optimally require doves to have some degree of justice perception , law enforcement capability , etc to act as a final failsafe and as a checks and balances system against vigilantees evolving into hawks which happens.<br><br><br>so optimally each individual should have a sense of righteousness for himself and people directly around him and a sense of anger and judgement and a sense of law enforcement if necessary against hawks or vigilantes if they turned hawks. and a sense of cooperating with the masses at a degree better than simple herding by the social system and feeling entitled to help and cooperate against wrong. which is the current situation in human evolution , but these emotions need some more evolution to me more intuitive to avoid current common day to day evil better.", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T04:38:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eleanor Clapp", "comment_text": "This is basically golden balls.", "comment_date": "2019-10-12T21:41:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pezsmapatkany", "comment_text": "I think the optimal way of choosing dove/hawk on a blob fight depends on how much food is available.

We make poor decisions in the long run, in pursuit of short term happiness. For example, humans eat poorly, smoke, drink, do drugs, drive faster, lay around all day, sleep off schedule etc, without thinking &quot;hey, these poor choices are making my lifespan shorten, and may affect my offspring.&quot; Instead, we are focused on feeding these chemicals which our brain processes as happy or sad. It would be neat to introduce multiple food sources, some which increase happiness, and some which increase lifespan.

It sharpens the traits of a population and evolves biological tools (weapons, essentially) that make dealing with conflict much easier. Also, you didn&#39;t allow hawks to actively kill. If they did, and both evolved traits (for example, doves would evolve a higher reproduction rate, or lower metabolism allowing them to go for longer with less food) and if killing also constituted a food unit, I think the population size would fluctuate and even possibly enable one side to gain an incredible advantage against another. Maybe also include a herd variable which allows doves to be less prone to dying against hawks if they are surrounded by more doves, and give hawks a similar chance of dying in battle when surrounded by a herd of doves. Also you could variate the kill chance of hawks depending on their food consumption. Would be cool too to give  each species a compounding chance to evolve a favorable trait with each generation. idk how heavy that would be computationally, but I bet it would be interesting.

Secondly &quot;hawks&quot; that do challenge other &quot;hawks&quot; do have a chance to end up both dying but by in large the outcome will still have a winner. For example take a cheetah vs a lion, both aggressive hunters that have similar diets, if they were to be pit against each its rather unlikely that they would both die in actuality its much more likely that one will win and result in having 2 food, 1 for the energy it burn and 1 for survival, as well as less hawks to compete with in the future &quot;hawks&quot; aren&#39;t really the kind to just share 1/2 and 1/2 while fighting, instead it becomes an all or nothing deal. Also most hawks wouldn&#39;t share with the doves, doves would generally have to find their own source of food and avoid the hawks.

Food is often scarce, creatures are of varying sizes, even among the same species depending on their age, health and how well fed they are. Aggression, as far as I can tell is the primordial default strategy, and more social behaviour only develops when necessary.

So that\u2019s fairly simple, and in every situation, the dove blob is the better choice overall.

Also I know this is a RNG based simulation, but aggression is not a purely random concept, as a truly aggressive entity will stalk and prey.  <br><br>If you were to expand this even further, allow each class to store fat, that is, take all pellets or prey objects and store extra energy to either become stronger/higher defense, make more moves, or take a turn off, while making them a greater target on the field, in which perhaps predatorial creatures might choose to work together to take them on and split the reward of stored energy, like wolves might do. <br><br>Perhaps there is a dove that is on a winning streak and has 10x the energy stored up and decides to give it another chance on the playing field, they might attract the attention of two top tier predators who could then take it down for 5 food points each and sit out the next round, like hibernation.  Doves might be able to protect themselves by sharing food pellets and not allowing a space for a hawk/predator to attack.

It would have been more meaningful to leave food collection to chance, leading to the survival of one or both of the participants.

For many animals, if you want a population to be as reproductively effective as possible, you want many females per male. The male&#39;s role in reproduction is pretty quick, so you don&#39;t need very many. But the animal&#39;s genes determine the ratio of sexes of its offspring. If you&#39;re an animal in a population that&#39;s 90% female, and you&#39;re deciding what type of offspring to give birth to,  you&#39;ll want to give birth to males, since their expected reproductive success is way, way higher.

An Herbivore is worth 2 food pellets when consumed by a Carnivore. Each creature will keep hunting for food until time runs out or until it is full (except the parasites). If a creature has 1 food pellet of food at the end of the day, it survives and it&#39;s food pellets is reduced by 1. If it has more than 2 then at the beginning of the next day, it reproduces and it&#39;s food pellets are depleted by 2. Food pellet locations are set, so locations aren&#39;t merely coordinates on a grid, rather they are locations like how the spaces on a chessboard are set locations, regardless of where IN that space your chess-piece is actually set. Creatures that die at the end of the day die AT the location they were last at, even if they begin the day at the edge of the board and move inward. Not every space will have food, which is important to help regulate the third species.<br><br>Species-1 is a strict herbivore, it goes to 1, 2, or 3 (depending on random number) of clusters until it is &quot;full&quot;.<br>Species-2 is a strict carnivore, it goes to 1, 2, or 3 clusters of food but doesn&#39;t eat any of them. Instead it looks for herbivores to eat, eating them and taking 2 food-pellets plus one more if the food pellets that herbivore had were greater than 2 at the time it died.<br>Species 3 is a strange one, it is a parasite that latches on to a food pellet and to any herbivore that eats that pellet. The parasite eats one food-pellet from it&#39;s host at the end of the day (before deciding if the host has enough food to survive). If the host gets eaten (herbivore/carnivore) then the parasite has a 50% chance of moving to the carnivore. If the carnivore starves to death then the parasite lingers there for a day, gaining a food pellet from it&#39;s fallen host&#39;s body. If food pellets appear at that space on the next turn, then the parasite infests it. A food pellet cluster with a parasite will automatically feed that parasite one pellet per day and will not disappear at the end of the day. The parasite dies if it is on a space with no food and isn&#39;t picked up by a host by the end of the day.<br><br>Admittedly, this is going to be ridiculously complicated. Presumably we&#39;d need to start with Species-1, then introduce Species-2 and let them achieve equilibrium. Finally we&#39;d need to introduce Species-3 into the mix and see how they interact. How many spaces produce food and how much food is produces is also a variable to consider, but I think these are lesser variables and suspect that it can be resolved in this way. Each space generates a random number 1-8 and then subtracts 4, if this results in a negative number then it resolves at zero instead. This makes roughly half of the spaces barren each turn. The spaces with food will be fairly evenly distributed between 1, 2, 3, and 4 food pellets on each space.", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T02:20:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Hunter x Hunter 2011 Dickriding Association", "comment_text": "Great explanation", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T02:17:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colton Keldeo", "comment_text": "No wonder the canadians have survived for so long", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T02:12:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DreeG 18", "comment_text": "Science blaster intensifies", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T02:07:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blacklight", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNMkADpvO4w&amp;t=7m02s\">7:02</a> Oh hey it&#39;s the prisoner&#39;s dilemm- wait no.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNMkADpvO4w&amp;t=12m30s\">12:30</a> There you are!", "comment_date": "2019-08-04T02:06:51Z", "likes_count": 625}, {"comment_by": "Sassafras Official", "comment_text": "That&#39;s just a theory.

Historical law subverts it at every turn. A moral view can never be proven right or wrong by any ultimate test. A man falling dead in a duel is not thought thereby to be proven in error as to his views. His very involvement in such a trial gives evidence of a new and broader view. The willingness of the principals to forgo further argument as the triviality which it in fact is and to petition directly the chambers of the historical absolute clearly indicates of how little moment are the opinions and of what great moment the divergences thereof. For the argument is indeed trivial, but not so the separate wills thereby made manifest. Man&#39;s vanity may well approach the infinite in capacity but his knowledge remains imperfect and howevermuch he comes to value his judgments ultimately he must submit them before a higher court. Here there can be no special pleading. Here are considerations of equity and rectitude and moral right rendered void and without warrant and here are the views of the litigants despised. Decisions of life and death, of what shall be and what shall not, beggar all question of right.

You could start off with \u201cplants\u201d and blobs to eat them. The plants could have a replication chance, making the simulation less artificial. Maybe the plants could have mutations to if they give more food when eaten, or if they can replicate more. This would show how changes in the environment can change the population. Afterwards you can add a carnivore. Carnivores will attack other blobs and will have a chance to kill the blob and eat them. A carnivore\u2019s mutations could be things like speed and aggression, fluctuating the chance of killing a blob. A carnivore gets a total of 2 pieces of food, while a normal plant has a total of 1 piece of food. Herbivores could also mutate and evolve to fight back against the carnivores or have a higher speed to run away from their predators. This can show a food chain, showing how each creatures need eachother to survive. The herbivores need plants to survive, the carnivores need blobs to survive, and you could even say the plants need the carnivores because they cut down the herbivore population and help them survive. Afterwards, omnivores could be added, having them eat both blob and plant.

However, as server population increases, it becomes more and more viable to play a carnivore, again for to closely related reasons: there is more competition for plant life (if other players are playing herbivores) and there is also a greater chance you will run across another player to eat (or get the chance to scavenge a carcass of another player). <br><br>It would be interesting to calculate at what points it becomes more viable to play carnivore than herbivore or vice versa, but for that you would need to know the plant count on the map.", "comment_date": "2019-07-29T03:16:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "joeyyy maybe", "comment_text": "similar to the prisoner&#39;s dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.", "comment_date": "2019-07-29T03:12:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Henrique Braga Silva", "comment_text": "I loved this channel.
