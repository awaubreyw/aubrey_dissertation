Lets imagine that everyone is using homemade coins, and the fairness of the coins is kind of random and all over the place, and instead of cheating intentionally, some people just have coins that come up heads too frequently because of poor construction. <br><br>Now the goals change. Instead of trying to catch so many of the cheaters, now we want to define the range of what fairness means in a coin.  So maybe we say a fair coin doesn&#39;t flip heads more than 55% of the time.  For the time being we&#39;ll ignore coins that are weighted more to land on tails and figure that this is the player&#39;s responsibility to deal with. <br><br>So we want to design a test that finds 80% of the coins that have more than a 55% flip rate. Lets ignore false positives for now. Lets take 10 flips and then choose the number of heads that would successfully accuse 80% of the coins with over 55% flip rate. This is going to get a really high number of false positives. So then from the positives we run the same test again, such that we catch 80% of the cheat coins in that scenario and let the other 20% go.  Now we repeat that process until we have under 5% false positive rate. <br><br>This means the number of trials is n. Flips is f, we do f * n trials in the worst case for a player. To test players this way, we will know the maximum proportion of the population we will need to accuse in each stage, which would be the case when all players are cheaters, so we have an idea of the worst case scenario for number of tests, which would be a function of the worst case trial times a function of the population size to the power of the number of trials.  In a normal case with mixed cheaters and fair players, it would be the worst case trial times a function of the population size and the fair players to the power of the number of trials. <br><br>Now we have a general idea on how it will go down. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t catch 80% of cheaters here, we catch 80% to the power of n cheaters. So instead, we play with these numbers so that that new term &quot;statistical power&quot; of the first trial to the power of n equals 80% while after n trials we will have a 5% false positive rate.  We can do this by increasing f, or increasing n and the statistical power. <br><br>In a real world scenario it might be best to monitor the outcome of the flips to build a database of players who need to undergo further scrutiny. So that a run of so many tests is recorded, and when it appears that there&#39;s a high enough chance that there&#39;s something fishy then they go to further trials.  This could be just a threshold maybe where 30% of the fair trials would end up with a run like this. This could let the number of flips used to calculate this be really high because it has no impact on the players, just some data analysis. <br><br>This would mean that 70% of fair players would generally go untested across this period. 30% would be subject to testing, we would want to control the number of flips so that more than 80% of cheaters would be subject to testing. Then in testing the test could be more aggressive, no we only need to get the final number of cheaters to 80%, but the number of false positives only need to be about 16.7%, because if even 1/6 of the fair players tested come up as false positive, if only 30% of the fair players end up having to submit to trial, 1/6 of that is still only 5%. <br><br>The other thing about this is it can be progressive testing.  Players who have coins that flip heads 55% of the time might take a lot of trials recorded playing in the population before getting pulled in for trial.  On the other hand, a player who has a coin that flips heads 95% of the time will get pulled in immediately after having an unreasonable streak. <br><br>I think this would help to increase the overall fairness of the play in the population.  A player with a 55% win coin will stick around longer without getting pulled in for trial. But they will have a much lower impact on the fairness of the player population.  A player with a 95% win coin will get pulled out very quickly, and will have a higher impact on the fairness of the player population but for a much shorter time. <br><br>The future trials will show whether it&#39;s likely that this is random chance or whether it&#39;s consistent. This gives a way to test players that are potentially playing unfair without impacting the fairness of the game. <br><br>I would also take this one step further.  It could be that a player has a decoy coin that it uses when it is called in for trial. So two things should be monitored.  One is the likelihood of a cheater who has the same coin during trials. This setup will handle this situation already.  The other one is the likelihood that a player is a cheater whose coin surprisingly starts to play fair when being monitored. To deal with the second situation, we can exclude the data from the trials and continue to monitor data only with other players. When that data of flips against other players hits a certain threshold, then we can straight up accuse them of cheating. So if the player with 10 heads in a row comes to trial and gets 10 tails in a row, or 50/50 heads and tails, and then goes back into the game and gets 10 more heads in a row, they&#39;re gone without another trial. Similar to the player who consistently wins 10% more often than everyone else, and again, the first player would be ejected quickly, and the second would stick around in the population for a really long time. <br><br>I think there&#39;s also one other difficulty. In a lot of games not every win is equally as valuable.  Maybe you have a coin that cheats heads, an coin that cheats tails, and a fair coin. If a player flips a heads coin when the stakes are really high, chooses to flip an unlucky coin an equal number of times when the stakes are low, and uses the fair coin the rest of the time, it will be impossible to detect this player without also considering the value of the outcome of a successful or unsuccessful flip.", "comment_date": "2022-07-17T17:37:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Max Cool", "comment_text": "i thought this said <br>How to catch a cheater with meth<br>and i interpereted that as catching the cheater <br>by using the meth as a tool<br>somehow", "comment_date": "2022-07-17T17:33:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wojciech P", "comment_text": "Can you do a video about the Great Statistical Anomaly of 2020?", "comment_date": "2022-07-17T16:35:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dysurian", "comment_text": "This is why the International Coin Flipping Association needs to provide regulation coins, machined to precision, at every sanctioned ICFA event.

I also have a degree in math. And one thing I learned over the years is that it is always better not to do any math when there is no need for it.<br>I think an easier and more effective way to ensure no cheater ever gets away with it while guaranteeing no fair player ever gets falsely accused would be to test everyone&#39;s coin before allowing the flipping contest to commence, and only permit those who brought fair coins to compete. The problem with this contest is that it permits the players to bring their own coins instead of providing a set of uniform coins for them to use. I don&#39;t think anyone would play this game knowing that some people may bring biased coins to the event. In fact, I wonder if anybody would show up with a coin that doesn&#39;t have two heads on it, knowing that. Thus, everyone would flip nothing except heads and every round is a gigantic field-wide tie ball game that would never end. Hence, the probability that you get false positives = true positives = false negatives = true negatives = p-value = EV = 0 since the number of players will always be zero. There is a 100% probability that the contest will be a flop, however.<br><br>The most accurate test for any contest of this nature, presuming you manage to find people willing to play, is to simply accuse them all. You&#39;ll achieve 100% of the cheaters caught and falsely accuse &lt; 5% no problem. There exists nowhere on Earth where more than 5% of the population are dumb enough to bring a fair coin to this game. Plus, getting it wrong won&#39;t matter because anyone stupid enough to bring a fair coin is worthy of ridicule &amp; suspicion anyway. There exists no reputation there that is vulnerable to damage by false accusations. Their reputation was discarded the moment they decided to use a fair coin. No point worrying about trying to minimize it, it&#39;s naturally almost at zero already. Besides, they are easily identifiable visually. They&#39;re the same ones who can&#39;t figure out how to flip the coin.<br>\r<br>\r<br>Correct conclusion...no math required.<br><br><br>For a game like this, you&#39;re analyzing it backwards. You should be trying to detect the fair coins not the cheaters. It&#39;s a smaller pile to sift through. And on that note, being more serious, you probably can get better results if you also eliminate those who are clearly not cheating from the equation before making your analysis and educated guess. You are thinning the herd only at the front of it. You&#39;ll do better if you take out all the stragglers first. Nobody cheats for the purpose of losing. You haven&#39;t worked that into it at all. I can&#39;t help but believe it would help to start by looking only at the potentially suspicious ones, not simply the winners. Work your analysis on a reduced subset of the starting group so you can dig deeper into the pile and access more of them using the same percentages. Since you slice away a portion of almost exclusively true negatives before you begin, you decrease the probability of false positives and increase the probability of true positives overall because more of the people you end up accusing turn out to be cheaters. It also might allow you to try a more aggressive method on the ones who remain. If you can eliminate a significant percentage from the bottom, i.e., the ones who are obviously not cheating, then you can be more aggressive with the rest of them. Particularly with a dataset that contains mostly fair players, as probably one ought to expect to be the case nearly every time in realistic situations. I think you are mistakenly presuming the cheaters are distributed uniformly in the dataset, at least potentially. I think you&#39;d catch more cheaters probabilistically if you focused in on only that portion of the distribution that is most likely to have the cheaters in it. Certainly, in the group you slice away, there could exist a couple of cheaters who did terrible despite having a biased coin, and you&#39;ll miss them, but they are also the ones whose cheating had no impact on the contest, and the probability says they won&#39;t likely even end up there so only a tiny fraction of the cheaters will get missed there. They&#39;ve already been sorted out by Lady Luck. The true positives &amp; false positives tend to come from the upper end of the distribution where there are more cheaters drawing more scrutiny. The true negatives &amp; false negatives tend to exist in the bottom end where fewer cheaters end up and those that do aren&#39;t worth scrutinizing. The true negatives &amp; false positives tend to come from the bottom where mostly fair players are found. The false negatives &amp; true positives mostly come from the top since cheaters tend to perform better.<br><br>Maybe the way to look at it is: if the best fair player wins, then the contest must have been fair, else it wasn&#39;t. You don&#39;t really need to catch all the cheaters unless you want to punish them. All you really need to do is identify the best performing fair player. It&#39;s important to notice that any cheater who was beaten by any fair player did not impact the outcome. They are equally as irrelevant as are every fair player who was beaten by some other fair player. Also, no player, cheater or fair, influenced the performance of any other participant. Everyone who lost to some fair player could have never showed up to play and the outcome would be the same. The fastest most bulletproof solution to this problem is an iterative one not a statistical one. <br>1. Accuse the 1st place winner<br>2. If they cheated then disqualify them, move everyone else up a place, and return to step 1. Otherwise, you have found the contest winner and need not look further at anyone else. The first false positive you encounter is the winner. Doesn&#39;t matter how many cheaters were discovered or left undiscovered. Only those cheaters who beat every fair player matter, none of the rest had any more or less impact than the fair players who also lost did. Also, by iterating, there is only ever one person falsely accused, every other accusation made is true, there are never any true or false negatives, nobody who impacted the outcome gets missed, nobody who had no impact is even bothered with, and I imagine the one false accusation made isn&#39;t going to annoy them too much since they are subsequently cleared and awarded the win every time. If everyone cheated, then I guess the best cheater wins?

However, if they get 6 or more heads, we continue the test and make them do 10 more coin flips. If they get 5 or less heads again they are marked as &#39;probably innocent&#39;, otherwise they have make another 10 coin flips.

According to the post not a single one of them found their name, he then sent them in to grab a random name and give it to the persons whose name it was and they all had their names in under a minute... it was supposed to illustrate the importance of teamwork. That is an idiotic story and it makes me feel physically sick that so many goddamn people believed it. Even if we assume all the kids are blindly snatching at balls and only know when they grab their own (meaning they can grab the same ball twice), and also assuming the average student grabs 6 balls a minute, you would expect 20% OF THEM TO FIND THEIR OWN BALL... except wait the students who found their own ball would remove it from the experiment... MEANING EVEN MORE OF THEM WOULD HAVE FOUND THEIR OWN BALL. but assuming for the sake of easiness that the students throw there ball back into the room after finding it, making all events independant, The likelyhood of all the students finding their ball in 5 minutes with 6 grabs a minute is .13% meanwhile the likelyhood that nobody finds their own ball is 0.000000000008% with these assumptions (and yes even a small deviation from these assumptions would change these results alot but this is about proving a point not actually predicting the probability of a story somebody clearly made up) IT IS OVER 16 BILLION TIMES MORE LIKELY THAT EVERYONE FINDS THEIR BALL THAN NOBODY DOES AND THIS IS ASSUMING THAT PEOPLE DON&#39;T ONLY GRAB FOR BALLS THAT LOOK LIKE IT COULD BE THEIR OWN NAME most people know shit all about basic statistics and it drives me up a wall. I commented &quot;clearly he was not a probability professor.&quot; some people did the laughing emoji but must were like &quot;what do you mean?!&quot; and I commented &quot;it is statistically impossible that this story is true unless the professor covered the first set of balls in names that none of his students actually had or something, (which would be a hilarious prank btw, fill a room of balls with names that none of your students actually have and tell them the first 10 people who find their name gets 10 bonus points on the final and see how long it takes for them to realize that none of their names are in the room.)", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T18:39:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Igor Petrov", "comment_text": "Thanks for the video \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb<br>See you next year \ud83d\ude43", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T18:28:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Naud van Dalen", "comment_text": "I only have 15 coins to flip in the game though because I only get 15 coins when I win.

The whole point of this exercise will be that cheaters want to cheat as much as possible to &#39;win&#39;. This is something actual real intelligent cheaters do NOT want to do. Cause if they play a game and win 5 out of 5 times, they are of course cheating, and even tho they &#39;won&#39; they are instantly spotted, kicked out, and lose their winnings and banned for life. Even people losing once to make it seem like luck, 4 wins out of 5 games, would still most likely be a cheater, trying to be &#39;smart&#39; and make it seem like they lost one, so it isn&#39;t so clearly they can&#39;t be cheating, right? Wrong!<br><br>No, the most best cheater, wants to be the absolute most average. Not the most wins. They want to usually hover around 50% wins, 50% loses, tho not exactly that, to be seen as the most &#39;average&#39; of player and believable. Sure, they might not win the best prize, but if they do this to collect 10 prizes? 100? 500? a million? Suddenly those earnings start racking up. And when your cheating, this can be easy to do.<br><br>Unless your playing a highly recorded video game, where they have all the data of your wins, loses, and what you did during the matches for every single event to look through, you will never be called out, unless you win &#39;too&#39; fast for an &#39;average person&#39; giving away your taking shortcuts through cheating. Generally, tho, no one ever records that much data, and even if they do, wouldn&#39;t care to sip on through all of it, all at once, looking for cheaters. They would look for people accused of cheating first, and then go through the accused&#39;s records then and only then to save time.<br><br>So when you shows the 6 people, the one in my eyes that showed the most likely hood of being a cheater, wasn&#39;t the 5 heads in a row, but the 3 heads and 2 tails, and the 2 head and 3 tails, as they were the most average, and most likely where a cheater would hide to not get caught but still win over time.", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T08:52:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Galaxy of games", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTcP4oo4JI4&amp;t=12m50s\">12:50</a> ocelot", "comment_date": "2022-06-27T08:44:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MatthewPogi 1558", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTcP4oo4JI4&amp;t=19m25s\">19:25</a>.

I have some quibbles with the math you used, though, as applied to the rules of the game.  Mainly, its just that the evaluation was not how most of us played the game.  We played given expected value.  Given all of the information we have in the game, there is a better equation to use.  If 50% of players are cheaters and cheaters get heads 75% of the time,.  Therefore, if we ran total expected 2048 tests, we would expect to get 324 4-0s  from the cheating half and 64 4-0s from the honest.  That means about 83.5% of the 40-s are from liars.  We had a -30 penalty from a false guess and a +15 bonus from a true guess.  That means that on average we add 7.577 guesses if we guess there.  So for it to make sense for us to make another guess, we would need to increase the average guesses earned to more than 8.577.  If we took one more guess, of the 392 4-0s, 275 would get a heads and 117 would get a tails.  On a yes you would accuse.  Of the 117 tails, 32 are from the honest and 85 are from liars.  If you weren&#39;t going to accuse before, you aren&#39;t going to accuse now.  All 117 require at least one more flip.  Actually, since 5-1 is less confident than 4-0 (and we&#39;ve established 4-0 confidence isn&#39;t enough), all 117 need at least 2 more flips. If we guess at 6-1, we would be left with 37.1875 liars and 24 truth tellers, either at 5-3 or 6-2.

We would have to somehow &quot;test&quot; every incoming player with this nonsense, and would still be getting into fights with many innocents who got falsely accused. A nightmare, a totalitarian system that will quickly turn people off from playing. Even accusing 1% would be ridiculous.<br>A real life approach wouldn&#39;t even bother with statistics - as it should be: Statistics should only be used to confirm/deny the fundamentals, the theory, the qualitative approach - not the other way around. Trying to find some way to &quot;justify&quot; your statistic through a theory is a great way of screwing up both. Meanwhile, confirming or denying an internally-logical theory through statistical means is a great way of advancing knowledge.<br><br>A real life approach would first wait for someone to get accused by another player who felt wronged: that gets rid of unnecessary work (if everyone had fun, who even cares), unwarranted work (dont need to test everyone), and thus allows for more time spend on each case. Also, because catching a cheater implies some action to be done to the cheater (banning them from playing, taking their coin away etc.), you would always have to document each of these cases and communicate the results to some official/game-master - documentation can often be more time-consuming than actual tests, so cutting down the number of tests is the first priority. <br>Also, having a specific test set up for everyone simply allows a cheater to only cheat when nobody is looking. A cheater would try to circumvent your test, perhaps by using another coin - they cannot do that if they get accused by a credible player during or after a game, and then have to prove their actual game-coin is unbiased on the spot.<br><br>A real life approach would also want to mainly concern themselves with patterns of psychological behavior, not statistics: <br>Does someone not want to share their coin with others? Does someone avoid having their coin touched by others, especially game officials? Does someone avoid playing with pro players, always trying to crush newer or inexperienced players? Does someone use weird tricks during play?<br>Testing for these factors and talking to the accused player about their weird behavior could get a confession out of someone quicker than any test setup, and allows the option of having someones coin be banned quickly without banning the player. It also allows a potential cheater to &quot;save face&quot; and return to being a normal player with an unmodified coin, without any further work.<br><br>Even after having someone be accused officially, a real life approach would rather test physical reality than statistics: They would weigh the coin, test its balance, and see if it deviates from the usual standard model (was it modified? made at home?). If the coin is 100% standard-issue, but still deviates from the norm, that is actually really important information for the coin manufacturer, and also for the other players: maybe there are others who unintentionally &quot;cheat&quot; because they got the badly-manufactured coin. So, you should test that first, not the statistics.<br><br>See what I mean? Statistics can confirm or deny the information these other approaches produce, but it cannot replace them. That still means statistics are useful, but you should never start anything by thinking about statistics: You should start by thinking about the fundamentals, about qualitative science. Then comes statistics. Not the other way around - far too many statistics nowadays get misused, misinterpreted, wrongly used to create too broad conclusions, etc. etc. because they get wildly thrown around without any proper non-statistics theoretical foundation. <br><br>For cheaters specifically, visual-mathematical patterns (non-cheaters might produce very unlikely outcomes as well, but their timing is usually different, more random) and psychological patterns (trying to get attention, &quot;winner-types&quot;, player who hit their skill boundary and get frustrated by luck, etc.) are usually way more useful to start out with, to then confirm your suspicions with more testing.<br>You should not try to catch someone with statistics alone, unless you really have to, and the odds are so overwhelming there is basically no other option but for the accused to be a cheater.<br><br>Take the case of Dream, a minecraft cheater into account: statistics were used to confirm him as cheater, but the results were utterly overwhelming against him. However, psychological behavior and the mathematical pattern of consistency were just as convincing. <br>Far more usual however, are cases such as the Trackmania cheating scandal, which was not exposed by statistics (because thats not really possible in most cases), but rather through technological analysis of how the game was played.", "comment_date": "2022-06-26T02:46:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Elizabeth Jones", "comment_text": "From a human communication perspective, offer to swap coins with the suspected cheater and let their reaction to that request add weight to the mathematical probability.", "comment_date": "2022-06-26T02:42:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fidget Spinoza", "comment_text": "thanks man. i might finally pass Stats thanks to you", "comment_date": "2022-06-26T02:41:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Peters6221", "comment_text": "The irony of this being a simple example is that it&#39;s actually very hard to find cheaters in a timely manner.

So you&#39;re not trying to catch as many cheaters as possible and you&#39;re not trying to avoid as many fair player as possible, but you&#39;re trying to minimize the portion of fair player caught compared to cheater.<br><br>That means the test needs to adjust based on the population of cheater. If there is a high number of cheater then it needs to be more sensitive, but if there is a low number of cheaters then having too many false positive is bad because at this point you&#39;re ending up catching innocent people for low results. Like, if there is only 1% of cheaters and you have a 4% false positive rate then you&#39;re having more false positive than cheaters and you might aswell not try to catch those cheaters at all even if you&#39;re below the 5% false positive line because you&#39;re doing more harm than good. (of course you can keep monitoring cheaters to see if thee lack of sanctions has negative effects on the cheater rate which force you to implement sanctions back again).<br><br>Of course in real life you&#39;d need to also weight the prejudice caused both by cheaters and by wrongfully accusing someone. For exemple with the death penalty, the cost of wrongfully accusing an innocent is extremely high, actually typically much higher than not catching someone.<br>On the other hand if you&#39;re tracking a serial killer and all you know is that they have a red car with a bloody hatchet in it, then sure you&#39;ll probably get a lot of false positive by checking every red car but it&#39;s only a minor inconvenience for the persons involved so it&#39;s worth it, though that kind of exemple isn&#39;t ideal cause you get into the questions of trusting instiutions, mass surveillance etc. <br><br>A better exemple might be vaccines, that are extremely worth it in case of very dangerous diseases because they&#39;ll be a minor inconvenience for many that wouldn&#39;t have caught it (false positive) but the cost of someone who&#39;d catch it not being vaccinated is very high. On the other hand the milder the disease get (and the less it spreads efficiently) the more the minor side effect associated with the vaccine would start outweighing the benefits of stopping the people who&#39;d get sick from catching the disease.<br><br>I&#39;m unsure where I&#39;m going with that I feel like I got sidetracked =p (ADHD goes brrrr lol).

I programed a replica of your game (with the assumption that half of the blobs were cheaters and a cheaters coin would come up heads 75% of the time) and a robot to play it. <br><br>the robot would use some math akin to the binomial distribution function to determine the exact probability that a blob was a cheater given a certain number of heads and tails. for instance if a blob got 6 heads and 1 tails then there would be an 85% chance that it was a cheater.<br><br>after every flip the robot would tally up the heads and tails and calculate the probability of it being a cheater, then if the probability was above a certain threshold it would guess whether that blob was a cheater or fair, otherwise it would flip the coin again and repeat the process. so if I set that threshold at 80% the robot would guess  only when it was 80% sure that it knew the correct answer, otherwise it would flip the coin and try again. <br><br>at this point I was confident in what I had programed so far, except I didn&#39;t know what to set that threshold at. so I made another simulation that would use the numbers from your game i.e. you use one flip every time you flip the coin, you gain 15 flips when you guess correctly, and you lose 30 flips if you guess incorrectly. then I had robots with all different thresholds in 1% increments play that simulation for 1 million round each and then show me how many flips they had at the end of it. <br><br>when i finally got the results back I was shocked to see that they all came out negative. all of the bots lost more flips than they gained. some thresholds worked better than others, the best threshold was somewhere about 73% but even that robot was not able to survive indefinitely. they would always run out of flips eventually.<br><br> I had been sure that you could go forever with the right strategy so I went back and tested to make sure that I got all my programing right, but it had. there were no bugs. out of curiosity I went back and started tweaking the variables about how many flips you lose or gain after a guess and to both my distress and amusement I discovered the if you were to change those numbers by the smallest amount, if you gained 16 flips for a correct guess and lost 32 for an incorrect one instead of 15 and 30, it became possible. with the right threshold you could play forever, never running out of flips, and always gaining more than you lost on average.<br><br>I came to the conclusion that you must have designed the game with that in mind. you didn&#39;t want people to get an infinite run, and so you made it impossible.<br><br>but when I looked at the leaderboards I saw the people had gotten runs with thousands of correct guesses so I made another solution using the 73% threshold and this time i made it play a real game so that it would loose whenever it got to zero flips. and as it turned out it wasn&#39;t too hard to get large runs, my strategy was almost good enough and every now and then it would get just a little bit lucky and achieve runs in the tens of thousands.<br><br>with all of this knowledge in hand I turned my attention towards building a bot to play your game, not my simulated version of your game but the actual game on the internet. it didn&#39;t work. I tried to make it look at the colors of certain pixels on the screen to discern what was happening but I could never get it to stop messing up every now and then and reading the screen incorrectly. <br><br>eventually I gave up, satisfied that I had at least learned the intricacy&#39;s  of the mechanics of your game and saw what looked like a game intelligently designed to be almost but not quite possible to defeat. but after watching your video I must question my assumptions.<br><br>did the cheater coins really come up heads 75% of the time? was it 60%? or, horror of programming horrors, was the probability different for every cheaters coin? was my robot doomed to failure from the beginning even if I could have made it read the screen correctly? were my assumptions correct, or did I fall into the very trap the end of this video warns against?", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:14:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "emnerson", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTcP4oo4JI4&amp;t=12m51s\">12:51</a> a wild cheeter appeared", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:14:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The C\ud83c\udf10\u2b55\ufe0fN", "comment_text": "Waiting for the next video next year", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:14:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u4e45\u8fdd", "comment_text": "your videos are always entertaining and interesting! thank you for making these content", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:14:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NITB", "comment_text": "Covid testing flashbacks \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:13:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R Johnson", "comment_text": "Poor blobs getting put through all these ordeals just to prove a point.", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:13:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hawk0485", "comment_text": "quality content, leaving a comment for the algorithm :)", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:11:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Dummy", "comment_text": "this is a really frustrating video. i learned pretty much nothing and still tried to anticipate what would happens as i was told, but of course i thought it would be harder than that, so i searched for really hard answer and found nothing and was like, dude, am i stupid, come on tell what it is so i can learn new things. and well in the enf this was just the basic of the basic, i gave much thoughts for nothing since the answers were like, so trivial. quite frankly i expected way more considering your previous videos", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:10:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kristophia", "comment_text": "I like the cheetah at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTcP4oo4JI4&amp;t=12m51s\">12:51</a>", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:10:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "parwes", "comment_text": "Something you could&#39;ve kept track of on the 1000 blob tests, is the chance for a blob to flip his coin off the platofrm in to the void.", "comment_date": "2022-06-25T20:02:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vemund Dyrkolbotn", "comment_text": "If I get my Vocabulary correct, avoiding false positives is &quot;Specificity&quot;, and avoiding false negatives is &quot;Sensitivity&quot;.
