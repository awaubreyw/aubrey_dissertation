So let\u2019s take the brain for a moment, to me it\u2019s basically a collection of ideas, the visual cortex in the back? It\u2019s used for processing visual data?

We all know science is good, but the problem comes in when people begin to move outside the realm of science, and yet use it to explain something beyond it. Let me use an example or an illustration, alright. If characters in a video game began to search for the cause of their existence, some of them would most likely do it very scientifically. They&#39;d make use of the scientific method of observation, make conjectures (hypotheses), derive predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carry out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions. They may do this as many times as possible, but we humans know they will never come to the truth of their existence, because they cannot measure, test and observe the humans who exists outside their world. We know there&#39;s nothing wrong with science. So, what&#39;s going on here? It&#39;s simple. The characters moved beyond the realm of science, yet still tried to make use of science. That&#39;s the problem. The same goes for the real world. Science only works insofar as you remain inside the feasible area, but as soon as you move beyond it, then you&#39;re running the risk of making serious mistakes... That&#39;s my problem with the theory of Evolution on the whole. I agree that mutations occur, species adapt and change and so forth, but you cannot create a &quot;history&quot; of species based on it and call it factual. You&#39;re moving outside the realm of science and that is dangerous to do. Or you can. Like, no one is stopping you, but you can&#39;t claim it as fact.

This simple example can explain the Fermi Paradox (i.e. Where are all the aliens?) - that the birth and death rates of such civilizations are roughly equal (and I know this also doesn&#39;t consider the &quot;detectable&quot; variable in the Drake equation).<br>Assuming that conjecture is roughly true, that points to a possible survival strategy for our civilization - replicate.  I don&#39;t see any indication of that in the Drake equation, but this simple example would seem to indicate that your civilization (probably the whole ecosystem) would be wise to adopt a replication strategy for prolonged survivability.  Of course, it would probably be pretty tough to replicate a viable ecosystem elsewhere if we destroy the current one before doing so.<br>I wonder if there is a tipping point past which you would no longer have the ability to replicate your civilization (ecosystem) once you have reached a certain point in using/destroying a limited set of resources (a planet) - an infertility point?", "comment_date": "2019-10-17T13:45:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hybridism", "comment_text": "First 2 are both 1 in 10 course their gonna stay roughly the same", "comment_date": "2019-10-14T09:39:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "UberPizzaZombie", "comment_text": "I love this channel!", "comment_date": "2019-10-13T04:20:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "clara", "comment_text": "Why did this video make me simultaneously sad, melancholic and hopeful?

But i have to say its fundament is not really that complex to comprehend. Evolution is basically survival of life in any form. There is no trend, no better reiteration or advancement of any kind, we just see it that way because of the sample we observed in an isolated environment over a small period of time. Survival is random, what is the pinnacle of advancement right now might be totally worthless later. So a life form variation is better and superior until it&#39;s not.<br>There is that saying about in life death and taxes are the only certain things. I don&#39;t totally agree but i admit limits as a certainty, what begins must end, nothing is infinite. Thus an ascendent trend for evolution, as well as our Universe, can&#39;t continue going and going.

The pace is good. I would say a big issue (not just with this video) is that quantitative modeling can be very abstract (e.g., how should I think of a birth rate? What part of the system does this control?). Personally, I would love to see graphs alongside the frame-by-frame simulations, since that&#39;s the standard presentation of this kind of data. Walk-throughs of the equations were OK, although I think you can spend more time helping people develop an intuition for why the equation makes sense. For example, around the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDvzbBRiNlA&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a> transition, looks like you assume people understand what you mean by equilibrium. Also, why should we expect the overall population to stay the same if birth rate = death rate? You should try to anticipate audience confusion. As an example, it&#39;s common for people to look at a graph of overall population and think that no more organisms are dying or being born because the overall number isn&#39;t changing, so explicitly walking through the system more would be great.

(ex. Male 1 procreates with; Female 9, f 8, 7, 6.....) of the women and the same goes for the males, each male has to procreate with each female basically, and it&#39;s 50 50 (or 49/51) whether you get a female or a male, and the next generation does the same, but they&#39;re not allowed to procreate with anyone from the same forefathers, if you want to make it even more interesting/complicated you could do it so the next generation is allowed to procreate with maybe 2 generations back and of course no incest, you can also play with the amount of children they would get, maybe it could be influenced by what gender their offspring is, but it could also just be set after if you implement a chance for the infants to be stillborn and have them try procreating again and maybe set a limit there to how many times they will try, you could make the child death rate influenced by how old the person is getting, how many kids they&#39;ve had, maybe make it a random genetic thing for some people to have a higher rate.<br><br>All in all my question is really just if you had 50 people split up 50 50 by gender, how many generations would it take before you wouldn&#39;t be able to procreate with anyone without it being incestual, the reason I started thinking about this was because of the Mars one mission where 50 contestants are sent to colonize Mars, and if you wanted to do that, how many generations would you &#39;realistically&#39; be able to make, I know the environment probably isn&#39;t ideal, but if it&#39;s theoretical I&#39;d just like to know, don&#39;t know how relevant this would be to this series you are making if you can fit it in somehow, but hopefully you&#39;d consider at least looking at the concept, and maybe make just a separate series or a one time kind of video idk what this channel is going to be if you&#39;re even going to make more than just why do things exist series, good video and I&#39;m excited for the next one.", "comment_date": "2018-05-21T05:40:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sangamesh Raghoji", "comment_text": "3b1b", "comment_date": "2018-05-21T05:30:37Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Houck", "comment_text": "You can play around with <a href=\"http://ncase.me/simulating/\">http://ncase.me/simulating/</a> to do similar simulations.
