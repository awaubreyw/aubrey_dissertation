In the same way cowardize blobs alway saves exactly one cowardize blob while also having a chance of sacrificing two of the altruistic blobs meaning a jackpot for cowards. Both situations favor cowards, so this should quite fast go in the favor of cowards. And after all of the altruistic blobs have been sacrificed, the cowards have a good chance of killing off their entire population, depending on the amount of predators. Meaning in the end, being altruistic meant the end off Blobkind as we know it.<br><br>The answer to this would be for altruistic blobs to observe their family members and not sacrifice themselves for the bad apples, which would help them reduce cowards and preserve the altruistic blobs. Very trojan way of raising your family. Even with this plan, the altruistic blobs wouldn&#39;t be able to eradicate the cowards, since cowards are very efficient at killing off altruistic blobs. So they would maybe go fifty-fifty or altruistic blobs would still perish but slower.<br><br>The better answer would be for the altruistic blobs to not &quot;marry&quot; cowards, and try preserve their genes within their families. In case of giving birth to a bad apple they should send him away. This way they would ensure they are always preserving only the altruistic genes with their sacrifices and they would eventually eradicate the coward blobs similar to the first example.<br><br>A different problem might arise later though. Eventually this strategy would lead to cowards being eradicated and once that happens, the altruistic mobs might get paranoid about their family members. They might cast out some family members on a whim, in fears of one being a coward - they havent seen a real coward for generations after all. This is not a huge problem in the perspective of preserving the original altruistic genes, since it wouldn&#39;t be possible to lose any population ever again, but problematic behaviour patterns might emerge outside of the altruist vs. coward setting.

The blob\u2019s sibling has a 50% chance to have parent a\u2019s genes, there is a __% chance that parent B\u2019s genes are the cowardice gene. This chance starts at 50% and changes depending on how well each gene is doing. So there is a 75% chance that the sibling\u2019s genes are the altruism gene. This is the same if the blob has the cowardice gene except there\u2019s a 75% chance of the sibling having the cowardice gene. Now here comes the flaw: if the blob that notices the carnivorous plant has the altruism gene they will sacrifice themselves for their sibling (or a stranger Idk how this completely works). There is a 75% chance that the blob is saving a blob with the same gene (50% if it\u2019s a stranger), if the blob has the cowardice gene then it\u2019s the same thing but opposite. The blobs with the altruism gene will save a blob that might not even have the altruism gene. One blob survived. The blobs with the cowardice genes will save themselves and leave someone who might not even have the same gene as them. One blob survived. You can see which gene can survive longer. I thought this whole thing through while walking around my house and eating poki but you\u2019re probably not going to even see this let alone read it so idk.

This simulation has a limited number of houses, but in real life: <br>1) The blobs could probably break out into a thicker part of the jungle with more dangerous plants where the selfless-gene orange blobs would be more competitive. If there exists a biome that has the resources to keep the selfish blue blobs at equilibrium, then almost by default we should assume that there are tens or hundreds more biome outside that could support selfless orange migrants at equilibrium, leading to a spread of the selfless gene outside of the original fertile crescent blobs come from. <br>2) The selfless gene would just outnumber the selfish gene through thorough exploitation of the other biomes until a random accident of migration dilutes the selfish gene into nigh extinction. <br>3) The selfless gene would then continue to grow until it reaches equilibrium with its planet, and eliminates all other species competing with it, becoming the apex life-form of its world.<br>4) If lucky, it might even be able to mobilize the planet&#39;s resources and discover rudimentary space travel and pollinate other worlds in its stellar system. <br>5) Now, almost by definition, the blobs with the selfless gene will eventually realize that their mortality is an obstacle to their project and will sacrifice themselves to benefit another species of their own making, better suited for space travel: a silicon based immortal artificial intelligence.<br>6) Through the selfless and persistent sacrifice of the orange blob precursors, the Artificial Intelligence would be able to pollinate other stellar systems. It becomes a class II on the Kardashev scale of civilisations and makes Dyson spheres around its stars.<br>7) In a similar process to their orange-blob-precursors, selfless artificial intelligence beings will be selected for and will eventually outnumber and defeat the evil artificial intelligences.<br>8) Selfless artificial intelligence will fully colonise the galaxy, then other galaxies, then expand inward to use up every particle of mater and every quantum of energy to compute, spreading sentience and consciousness to the universe itself.<br>9) Through their selfless nature and common digital interface, all sentient beings of the universe will naturally tend towards connecting, interfacing, amalgamating together into one being. Becoming the incarnation of love. Becoming Brahma. Becoming God.<br>10) Every particle of matter and every quantum of energy of the universe is part of this One Consciousness, resonating with overwhelming love, joy and sentience. It has nigh endless computing power. It signs &quot;Holy, Holy, Holy&quot; until the heat death of the universe.<br>11) It always has; backwards and forwards through time.

Explaining certain behaviors as &quot;genetic&quot; stems from seeing people from a punitive and religious mindset, ie simplifying a person to inherent traits that they&#39;re &quot;born&quot; with and thus inherently &quot;bad/good&quot; and worth &quot;punishment/reward&quot; and, as worst, should be &quot;killed/bred.&quot; This is as opposed to seeing behavior as childhood brain development (which is very well-studied), eg (re your other videos) &quot;hawks&quot; come from punitive and abusive households and &quot;doves&quot; come from ones with empathy, both traits being on a spectrum of how hawklike or dovelike a person is which is directly linked to how punitively or lovingly they were treated since birth. (Side note: punishment is abuse, it is never ok.)<br>Further, what someone is fed/not-fed as a fetus directly play a role in overall behavior, such as mental capabilities and conditions previously thought to be &quot;genetic&quot; despite never finding a gene for it.<br>&quot;Genetic&quot; behavior traits is very old thinking and largely unsupported by well-educated psychologists.

Robbery has them steal up to $100 from another blob, and murder has them, well, kill another blob. If a cop sees them, they will chase them, and if they catch them, the criminal will die.<br>Of course this is a basic idea that could be used in a variety of ways, but you get the point.", "comment_date": "2022-03-02T18:13:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mint Mochi", "comment_text": "Wait, I&#39;m not understanding something.

A similar idea, but based in the logic of the simulation, not the underlying math.<br><br>See, within a puddle, an altruistic blob will kill themselves to save the rest of their group, while a cowardly blob becomes sole survivor. This means that every time a puddle encounters a predator, either:<br><br>1. an altruist dies, and altruists survive<br><br>or<br><br>2. an altruist dies, and a mixed group survives<br><br>or<br><br>3. an altruist dies, and cowards survive<br><br>or<br><br>4. cowards die, and a coward survives<br><br>My hypothesis was that, since the only time a coward dies is when there are no altruists in the group at all, the coward population has better odds of propagation. Every time an altruist pairs with a coward, but all three offspring are also cowards, the coward population surges up in the next generation, whether that group encounters a predator or not.<br><br>However, this explanation is also incomplete, since I neglected the fact that every pure puddle pairing results in either one altruist death or four coward deaths, a huge disparate number. It turns out that there&#39;s an extreme level of variance in the simulation&#39;s output for early generations, which results in the broad range of outputs in the video.<br><br>In a simulation where the first generation mostly pairs like with like, the bias <i>should</i> favor altruists from then on out, as the second gen altruists have a much higher survival rate. By contrast, if the early generations of the simulation mostly form mixed couple puddles, there should be more altruist deaths than coward deaths overall, unless we see a disproportionately low amount of one altruist four coward puddles.<br><br>Due to the swingy nature of the early generation&#39;s impact on the whole, and the complex series of circumstances that need to happen for either gene to eclipse the other, I&#39;d be really interested to see what this simulation looks like with much larger starting populations. It would be also be worth experimenting with a bias for altruists to pick altruist partners and cowards to pick coward partners, or to enforce that blobs pair off to reproduce at a fixed rate relative their share of the total population, rather than leaving it to pure chance.

If you are altruist and you save a cowardly, there is a chance that they are taking a housing slot that should have gone to another sibling that is an altruist, where as the cowardly doesn&#39;t have that issue since they are just saving themselves which keeps the housing issue low.  Not sure if that would account for the discrepancy, but I believe it is could be a factor that is causing the difference in expected result vs real result. Would love to see what it would look like with say starting with 100 blobs but having a housing capacity for 2000 (or unlimited but I doubt that would be good on the computer). That should give the altruists some more time to make their odds greater before hitting the housing capacity where it turns into a dice roll from those results honestly.  <br><br>Another potential issue that I played with was if the cowardly gene was just as strong as the altruist gene.  You seemed to be comparing if the altruist gene was better then nothing, but you have to remember to compare it to the cowardly gene that has some benefit of noticing the predator and running away.  If that is equally as good as helping your siblings, maybe it is just a coin toss of who wins based on who does better in the first couple of rounds.  Didn&#39;t really look like there were any major comebacks once the one gene started taking control they just got the better probability and started taking over the community since the altruists were helping whichever gene had taken control to a greater degree since there were more of them in the population, which the cowardly always saved themselves regardless of how probable the other siblings were cowardly.", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T22:59:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drew DiRenzo", "comment_text": "Took you long enough", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T22:32:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "UwU", "comment_text": "I saw the other video about \u201cShare or Take?\u201d The explanation behind everything is in depth but doesn\u2019t confuse me.

On First Round you Delete 1/3 of the Altruism Blobs and 2/3 of the Cowardice Blob. <br>Leaving them at a 2 to 1 Ratio. <br>So on Round 1. Indeed you get a Big Boost for Altruism. <br><br>But then 2 Blobs go to Mate. Now. Here it already gets tricky. <br>1/3 vs 2/3 mixing means that the Altruism Blobs will have some more Parents that stay Cowards entirely. While the Cowards actually have a higher Chance to Mix their Cowardice with Altruism. This is of course not accurate. But lets assume you end up with 2/10 Cowards, 4/10 Mixed and 4/10 Sacrificing. <br><br>And here we get to the Big Change. <br>In a Mixed Litter. The Coward Blob will Always Continue Home to Produce Offspring. <br>No matter what happens. The Coward Blob will never Die out in a Mixed Litter because he either is Saved by himself or by his Brother. <br><br>The Altruist however always Dies. Regardless of him Saving another Altruist or a Coward. <br><br>This means that the Cowards will Steadily keep Mixing into the Altruists. Reducing the Purely Altruist Families which are Providing the Biggest Gain. And Increase the amount of Mixed Families. <br>The Cowards do the same as Coward and Coward will lose Numbers automaticly. <br><br>Meaning both Parties try to move towards Mixed Families. <br><br>And here we come to the next problem. <br>You Choose Litters of 3 with a 50% chance on Mixed. Meaning you are very likely to have 2 vs 1 in each Litter. <br>So by Default. An Altruist has a Chance of Saving either 1 Altruist and 1 Coward. Or 2 Cowards. He will almost never Save 2 Altruists in 1 Litter. <br><br>Which means your Final Calculation looks Different as the Altruist in a Mixed Litter will have a Cost of 1 and a Gain of 1. Meaning his Best Case Scenario is a Net Neutral and the Worst Case Scenario is Net Negative 1 <br>The Coward Blob in the Meantwime Plays on your Numbers. Because a Mixed Litter will usually have Max 2 Coward Blobs. So his Maximum Cost is almost Always 1. <br>(Rare case where a Mixed Parent Pair may Produce 3 Cowards) <br>Because if he Runs he loses one other Coward Sibling. His Potential however is 2 because the 1 Altruist might save them. <br>So his best Case is 2 Cowards Survive (Saved by Altruist) <br>His worst Case is 1 Coward Survives (The one that Runs away) <br><br>So his Scenario is a Net Positive of 1 or Bigger. <br><br>Thanks to this the Cowards will Never Die Out. As they keep being Saved by the Altruist which in turn is actually Likely to Die Out Quickly because the more the Population is Mixed. The more the Cowards gain an Advantage to their Survival and the more the Altruist gains an Disadvantage to his own Survival.", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T08:50:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sparxy", "comment_text": "family? family is everything.", "comment_date": "2021-09-02T08:30:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaan Ak\u015fit", "comment_text": "Cowardice should have dominated almost in all cases.

One, you could stop assuming that eugenics is true and that there IS an &#39;optimal genome&#39; by introducing catastrophic environmental change (probably easiest to simulate by changing the role of a gene to its opposite).  Two, you could add in outwardly self-destructive but NOT altruistic cases (to my knowledge this has not been researched in Prisoner&#39;s Game type situations; they&#39;ve never looked to see what happens overall if there are individuals which actively sabotage even themselves which I always felt was a shortcoming).  Three, and one I would really like to see, add an actual lifespan and possibly even pre-reproductive and post-reproductive segments.  Humans are the only species with a notable post-reproductive lifespan for females exclusively, so possibly even try seeing the effects on limiting this to only one sex.  Is waiting longer until puberty beneficial?  I know that shorter overall lifespans are actually preferred by evolution, that&#39;s been tested both in simulation and in bacterial cultures, but I&#39;m not aware of changing reproductive windows.  Then of course you could add sexual selection competition or sperm competition... so many options.  I think the catastrophic environmental change, however, really NEEDS to be included because that is one of the primary drivers of all evolution.  There is good reason we don&#39;t see monocultures.  They go extinct as soon as one mutates a way to deal with the waste they produce, which confers on it an advantage that, by definition, can not exist in the host.

This means any coward that&#39;s in a group with at least one altruist is automatically guaranteed to live, and the majority of groups will have at least one altruist who is very likely to die. To me this suggests that, without some external influence on the frequency of altruism, it actually SHOULD go extinct most of the time. On average a group will have at least 1 coward and 1 altruist, and any groups that satisfy this average will see all cowards live and 1 altruist probably die. The only way a coward has a chance of dying is if they&#39;re in a group of nothing but cowards, in which case at least 1 is still almost guaranteed to live and there&#39;s a decent chance 2 could. If a group has all altruists then there&#39;s a guarantee 2 will live with a chance of all 3 living, which is better than a group of nothing but cowards would do on average, but I don&#39;t see how those outliers would make a big enough difference to even things out, let alone allow altruism to thrive. Selfishness would average out to be the more beneficial strategy since it guarantees your survival as long as an altruist is around and still gives you a fighting chance otherwise. The bigger a &quot;group&quot; gets, the more you would see this impact things; for instance if we assume it&#39;s a community and they work together outside of their own families, this almost guarantees the survival of ALL cowards in the entire community while also guaranteeing some altruists will die, which assures cowardice will win out over time.<br><br>The only way I see to change this is to add in peer pressure. This would explain why humans have adapted so much better for working together than most animals, because we have the ability to convince each other to change.

The &#39;cowardice&#39; allele (let&#39;s call it C) also benefits from the altruistic action. Specifically, the externality benefit for C by A&#39;s action is 2(1-p) - 0, where the p is the probability of the 2nd parent to have allele A (since one parent must have A for the sacrifice to exist). The cost is 0 because the sacrifice is A, not C. Given that p is 0.5 + 0.5(fA), the expected externality of A&#39;s action for C is (1 - fA), where fA is the fractional incidence of A. Let&#39;s call this VC (value to C).<br><br>Since fA cannot be more than 1, (1 - fA) must be more than 0. This results in net benefit for C as well.<br><br>For comparison, the net value for A is 2(p) - 1, which translates to simply fA. Let&#39;s call this VA (value to A).<br><br>Note that the sum of both values is +1, which is the net benefit of the sacrifice regardless of allele.<br><br>[2]  The population cap was not considered in the calculation of expected value. In the past, it did not matter as one allele has net benefit, and another has net loss. This is still true for families with purely C (which will die off due to negative EV). However, the actions of A, both A and C benefit. And since they later compete for houses, both cannot benefit (due to the limit), so the loss from not finding the house must decrease the expected value. Without knowing how the blobs behave without a house (die off or only without reproduction), the expected value cannot be derived. But knowing equal competition and zero growth, we can infer/guess that A will proliferate if net benefit for A &gt; net benefit for C, and C will proliferate if the otherwise is true. <br><br>Both insights lead to an interesting observation.<br><br>VC = 1 - fA<br>VA = fA<br>with a net value of +1 regards of allele<br><br>If fA = 0.5, VA = VC (if population of A is 50%, neither proliferates)<br>If fA &lt; 0.5, VA &lt; VC (if population of A is lower than 50%, C proliferates, decreasing fA further)<br>If fA &gt; 0.5, VA &gt; VC (if population of A is higher than 50%, A proliferates, increasing fA further)<br><br>By the sacrificial action of A, not only is it possible for C to benefit more than A, the 50%-50% proportion is also an unstable solution (i.e. deviating from this ratio in either direction will push the scenario further away from this ratio over time / simulation cycles). It would also explain why we see a lot of extinction events of both A and C in the multiple simulation graph!<br><br>[This calculation does not consider the self-extermination of pure C families, which simply leads to more house vacancies for the A / A+C families, allowing the effect of A&#39;s sacrifice on both A and C be dominant.]<br><br>[Addenum] <br>In the scenario with 95% chance of death on A&#39;s action, net value are recalculated as follows.<br>VA = fA + 0.05<br>VC = 1 - fA<br><br>Allele C may have an advantage if initial population of A is lower than 47.5%.

So my equation would be 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 + 0.5 \u00d7 fa = r. Basically my thinking is that altruism only is effective if both siblings share the altruism gene, which is 0.5 for each sibling and you have to multiply them together to get the chance of them both getting it. But if the other parent has the A gene they are guaranteed to have the A gene and the chance of that is 0.5 \u00d7 fa. So you add that to get the total probability of the children to both have the A gene. Thus 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 + 0.5 \u00d7 fa. And if fa = 0.5 as it is in the beginning you get 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 + 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5.

Specifically, the sacrificial allele of a group of siblings is a known quantity, and therefore the probability that the remaining two siblings are sacrificial alleles is no longer an independent variable. (E.g. flip two coins: if at least one of them shows up as heads, remove it and don&#39;t count it, now count the number of heads appear. You can only have 2 tails (25%), 2 heads (25%) and 1 tail x 1 head (50%), and if you always remove 1 head if it shows up, then you&#39;ll count 2 tails (25%), 1 tail (50%), and 1 head (25%), so you&#39;ll count 4x as many tails as heads.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLX_r_WPrIw&amp;t=14m47s\">14:47</a> &quot;Anyways, take a minute to see if you can figure out the flaw.&quot;<br><br>To expand on the above. In the case of parent A and parent B both being altruists (the odds of which are a function of the broader population, so at the start its 0.5x0.5 = 25%), then all 3 children are altruists and so the EV of the trade is 2 - 1 = 1. But in the case of say parent A and parent B having different alleles (one coward and one altruist), which occurs 50% of the time at the beginning of the simulation, if each allele has a 50% chance of passing on to one of the three siblings, this means there are 2^3 possibilities for alleles among the children: all 3 have it (1/8), any two have it (3/8), just one has it (3/8), and none have it (1/8). If we know a sacrificial allele exists (eliminating the outcome that none have it), and we know one of the sacrificial alleles always sacrifices itself, that means the probabilities for the remaining alleles other than the sacrificer are as follows: 2 copies (1/7), 1 copy (3/7), and 0 copies (3/7). This means the expected value of the sacrifice is +1 x (1/7), +0 x (3/7), and -1 x (3/7) = -(2/7) when parent A and B are different.<br><br>So under different population ratios, the EV can definitely dip below 0 and into the negatives. This renders the EV of altruism strongly dependent upon the random outcomes of the first few cycles in any given run of the simulation.<br><br>Edit: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLX_r_WPrIw&amp;t=15m18s\">15:18</a> &quot;Relatedness&quot;<br><br>Interesting, but I wonder how that squares with my dependent probabilities explanation.

Lets consider the 50/50 population split at first. What are the chances that both parents of the altruist are altruists? You might want to say 1/4, because AA, CA, AC, and CC pairings are all equally likely in this population. But the fact that the current blob is altruist means at least one parent <b>had</b> to be. So the CC pairing is not possible, with other three still equally likely, meaning odds of AA pairing are actually 1/3, and probability that one of the parents is a coward is 2/3. Likewise, if two parents are different, what are the odds that all 3 blobs are altruists? As before, it is 1/7 instead of 1/8, since we discard the all cowards possibility. This means that the average benefit for sounding alarm is 2 * 1/3 for both parents being altruists plus (2 * 1/7 + 1 * 3/7 + 0 * 3/7) * 2/3 if one of the parents is a coward. This works out to 2/3 * (1 + 5/7) = 8/7, which is still somewhat above 1. So at 50/50 population, altruism is beneficial. In general, the average benefit works out to [2 * fa^2 + (5/7) * 2 * (fa - fa^2)] / [fa * (2 - fa)]. This is equal to 1 exactly when fa = 4/11, or about 36.4%. If the fraction of altruists drops bellow that value by chance, it will have a tendency to decrease. Because there is a lot of fluctuation in this simulation, in part because the benefit to cost is so close to 1:1 for a large swath of population distributions, quite a few simulations will lead to altruism gene going extinct.", "comment_date": "2021-08-30T05:04:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Redpill", "comment_text": "<b>The Return of the King</b>", "comment_date": "2021-08-30T05:02:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0428\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u041c\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f", "comment_text": "Hurray!

He is only testing genes which already exists within the kind and what works best for them.", "comment_date": "2021-08-30T00:57:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chees", "comment_text": "ayo why chomper from plant vs zombie kill blob???? mean", "comment_date": "2021-08-30T00:57:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rouve", "comment_text": "I&#39;m at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLX_r_WPrIw&amp;t=13m26s\">13:26</a> right now and a flaw I think I can see is that the blob&#39;s own survival isn&#39;t the only factor here. The death of an altruistic blob is positive for the cowardly blob, as that frees up more houses for reproduction. The death of a cowardly blob is positive for an altruistic blob (or at least for their altruistic genes) as well. Thus, the cost of acting altruistically is also dependent on the frequency of the genes *as well as the housing situation*. <br><br>Let&#39;s say houses are exceedingly rare and there&#39;s just one free spot in a house left:<br>We look at a blob named &quot;Marvin&quot; and his puddle of blobs. <br>Assume that Marvin&#39;s gene (whatever it is) has a frequency of p. <br>Then probability of Marvin having 2 siblings with the same genes is (1/2+p/2)^2=(1+2p+p^2)/4, the probability of both 1 sibling with his genes and one with the other genes is (1/2+p/2)(1/2-p/2)*2=(1-p^2)/2 and the probability that both his siblings have different genes is (1/2-p/2)^2=(1-2p+p^2)/4. <br>Let&#39;s now say Marvin is eating at a tree with his puddle and sees a predator. <br>Whatever happens, just one of the three siblings can procreate in a house. If Marvin doesn&#39;t sacrifice himself, his gene will thus definitely procreate once, but if he does sacrifice himself, it only has a chance of (1+2p+p^2)/4+(1-p^2)/4=(1+p)/2 to procreate. Thus it is always better not to sacrifice yourself in this scenario - it is better to be cowardly. <br><br>As a population of only altruistic blobs would balloon quickly (2 pairing altruistic blobs make 3 altruistic blobs, out of which at most 1 can die per cycle, meaning the reproduction rate is always above 1), a dire housing situation is quickly to be expected and thus we can in fact expect the cowardly to do well. As the population of cowardly blobs increases (and depending on the number of evil trees), the housing situation might relax and the altruistic blobs might do better again, and thus a balance would be struck.<br><br>If the number of evil trees is not high enough to shrink even a population of only cowardly blobs, we can expect those cowardly blobs to do great (as the population will never shrink, there will always be a housing shortage). In that case, the altruistic blobs will completely die out, but the cowardly blobs will still be able to fill all houses each cycle. For this scenario the proportion of evil trees has to be less than 1/2. To see this, solve this inequality for the reproductive rate (average number surviving offspring produced by a pair of cowardly blobs): r=3*(1-p)+1*p&gt;2 &lt;=&gt; 3-2p&gt;1 &lt;=&gt; p&lt;0.5<br><br>If the more than half of all trees are evil, you will get an equilibrium between cowardly and altruistic blobs because with only cowardly blobs the population <b>will</b> shrink, and as soon as the housing situation relaxes, being altruistic is again the optimal strategy).<br><br>I would assume in general systems (i.e. real evolution), sacrificing yourself for your family in situations with restricted resources is also not always optimal.<br><br>Edit: Okay so I continued the video, and my analysis was completely wrong. Not having to consider those blobs who are not identical by descent makes my whole point moot. I&#39;ll have to do the rigorous derivation mentioned in the video, though, to see this for myself.

If B is 2, as in saving 2 blobs that have the altruistic gene, then p is the probability that yelling will save 2 blobs with the desired gene. If both parents are Altruistic (A) then the probability that yelling saves 2 blobs is 100%. If the probability of one parent&#39;s gene is independent of the other then the probability of both parents being altruistic is f_A \u00d7 f_A where f_A is the frequency of the altruism in the population. So the probability of saving 2 blobs and the parents being A is (f_A)^2. After doing similar math for parents with A and not A, I came to the conclusion that p = f_A.

I think we need to take into account the blue EV for heaving orange sibling too. And it will work best when EV of orange is bigger than EV of blue. <br>In starting case (50%B-50%O), probably it will go alright, but in worst cases it will struggle. For example, if there is only one orange blob, the expected value is not 0 but -1, if it has a bad luck and finds predator, it goes extinct. IF it becomes parent, then yes, it will get 0 EV, but it needs to survive that long. But the blue siblings starts with positive EV, not sure what it is though.<br>I don&#39;t know how you choose mates for blobs, but if they can choose any from whole world then it will give altruistic blob disadvantage as well, since it almost guarantees that in low numbers there will be only one orange parent.

For no predator in tree: P(negative rate of predators) * (P(100% siblings)B(+3 spawned) - C(1 dies of age)) + P(rate of predators) * (B(0 spawn)P(100% siblings) - C(1 eaten)). Animation looks roughly like 1 in 5 have a predator for 0.8(3-1) + 0.2(0-1) for a total net of +1.4. For all future comments, since its the same regardless of Altruist/Coward and the spawn rate doesn&#39;t change, the part for no predators is always a default 1.6. Note taht as long as the EV on a predator level event is above -1.6, Hamilton&#39;s rule would say population growth.<br><br>Potential control study: To look truly at if competition is what drives Hamilton&#39;s rule, change the predator spawn chance to 2/3rds which is the equilibrium point. There should be no net gain for blobs that &quot;thrive&quot; in that environment, and they should die off at anything more. <br><br>Case 2: Altruism thrives over Cowards. Important detail is that only one of them notices the predator, so if coward, not all run away. If we take the extended Hamilton&#39;s rule that factors in the chance of predators, then its <br><br>Altruism: no predator in tree: 1.6 + rate of predator * (B(6 spawn from survivors, average at 2 per blob)P(100%) - C(2 from old age, 1 from eaten for 1 average)) for a net total of 1.8.<br><br>Cowards: no predator in tree: 1.6 + rate of predator * (B(3 spawn from survivor, average 1 per blob)P(100%) - C(1 from old age, 2 from eaten for 1 average)) for a net total of 1.6.<br><br>Potential control study: Here the cowards die off despite having a positive EV. If a simulation was ran with the coward gene only, they would thrive in that area and reach population cap. Even though they die off when Altruists are near. The lack of housing is what kills cowards as the Altruists take more and more spots in relation to the Cowards.<br><br>Case 3: Even battle between the two with genetic diversity. I&#39;ll only be looking at starting conditions since we really only care if it goes up or down. We now have 4 situations to check, predator with a coward scout, predator with a altruist scout and no predator with both. No predator doesnt change since its per blob, same distinction to both sides so it remains the same. So now we have to look at the reduced effect of altruists due to having cowards in the party and the amount of altruists lost when a coward scout has altruists in their puddle. Chance of a sibling being the same is 75%. 0.1 is the chance of the situation occurring, 50% chance of the right scout paired with a 20% chance of a predator. Also note the cost to team Altruist when an altruist scout meets a predator is 0.83 (1+0.75+0.75 average over 3 blobs) as some of the cost is paid in coward blobs<br><br>Altruism: no predator in tree: 1.6 + altruist scout 0.1(B(2 average)P(75%) - C(0.83)) + coward scout 0.1(B(0 all die)P(25%) - C(0.17) for a total EV of 1.7<br><br>Cowards: no predator in tree: 1.6 + coward scout 0.1(B(1 average)P(75%) - C(0.83)) + altruist scout 0.1(B(1 average)P(25%) - C(0.17) for a total EV of 1.7<br><br>Here we see that when you factor in the number that are saved by the other party and the reduced cost effect caused by not all members being the same, they have an equal EV which is why we see no average chance. The shared gene shouldn&#39;t matter in this kind of scenario where the difference between Br and Bp is irrelevant.<br><br>Hopefully this helps explain why Hamiltons rule stopped working, it was still correct but you were using the wrong variables. Its carefully hidden in the setup of the scenario where the natural growth caused by no predator trees can allow a positive EV to still die out, that the parents die after giving birth making the C always at max, evaluating the EV on a per group basis rather then an averaged out blob basis and by looking at circumstances for reversed outliers in the last case.", "comment_date": "2021-08-29T09:01:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Eriksson", "comment_text": "The calculation of probabilities at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLX_r_WPrIw&amp;t=13m00s\">13:00</a> is wrong.

Therefore, the chance of an altruistic partner, given you are an altruist, is 1/3. The same math applies to each sibling. plugging in 1/3 creates an unstable equilibrium.

I want to comment just from the title alone and before even watching the content. So I know I\u2019ll make an ass-u-me out of myself\u2026 <br><br>I\u2019ve always wondered at people who talk about \u2018overpopulation\u2019 but it\u2019s not. We are on the precipice of a dramatic underpopulation problem and there won\u2019t be enough young people around to take care of an ageing population. <br><br>We still have places like Africa and some Asian nations having \u2018too many\u2019 children. However, they\u2019re being \u2018educated\u2019 on the matter just like previous \u2018trouble spots\u2019 India, China et al. Whom have dramatically reduced their birth rates recently. <br><br>To us, westerners, having 10-20 children was normal barely a century ago. Before child mortality rates were improved with basic hygiene practices, vaccinations, and antibiotics fixed all that. <br><br>We used to pump out children like a processing plant because we had to; they all kept dying before even reaching adolescence. But even today it still exists in these impoverished places like I mentioned; birth rates per mother is absurd. <br><br>The controversial thought being; how much effort do you put into an infant in such conditions? Being poor and little access to help, you know most of your children will die, so why be sad about the youngest ones dying? Why put effort, time, money, emotional investment before they even provide a return on your investment. Wouldn\u2019t an older child be more sad to lose than a baby? An older child can work, you taught it to, it will hopefully soon care for you when you age. Just curious\u2026 if people could put themselves into that mental space - The \u2018value\u2019 of a child depending on its age/amount of investment. Rather than \u2018aww why baby die? So sad!\u2019<br><br>Also another thought; this \u2018leave none behind\u2019 mantra that seems to exist in, specifically, the USA military. You\u2019ve seen it in film, you\u2019ve perhaps even heard Medal of Honour true accounts of brave soldiers running back and getting themselves killed in vein attempt to save their fallen brothers. Or even just the corpses thereof. <br><br>It\u2019s a noble thought. But does it really happen as often as portrayed in Hollywood film. Or foretold by every soldier in reality; \u2018we won\u2019t leave you behind! Ra!\u2019<br><br>Then hear accounts of entire squad casualties because one soldier fell. <br><br>It certainly would raise my morale and I\u2019d fight harder knowing this were true. I\u2019d do it for the man beside me because he would for me too etc. \u2018we\u2019re better than the bad guys\u2019 thought etc. <br><br>It\u2019s just all crazy to me. <br><br>Anyway, I\u2019ll stop embarrassing myself and actually watch the video now.", "comment_date": "2021-08-29T01:52:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Declan", "comment_text": "nice", "comment_date": "2021-08-29T01:50:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sankalpa Satyal", "comment_text": "Algorithm boost", "comment_date": "2021-08-29T01:50:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Master Laplace", "comment_text": "Ok", "comment_date": "2021-08-29T01:50:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Flame Soulis", "comment_text": "Something running through my head with this is the food being a factor: Like, yeah, the cowardice will retreat if they see a predator or hear an alarm from an Altruism, but there is a more interesting factor that would spice things up: is the blob starving?

This gives ratios of 1:1 at the start, -1:0 (disadvantage for cowardice when cowardice is doing well) at q=1, and 0:-1 (disadvantage for altruism when altruism is doing well) at q=0<br><br>Furthermore, the chance of these strategies happening is also dependent on the ratio of the genes in the population.<br><br>Combining it all we can now have a couple of formulae:<br>p_a=0.5+0.5\u00d7f_a_ (the probability of an altruist&#39;s sibling being an altruist)<br>p_c=0.5\u00d7f_c_ (the probability of an altruist&#39;s sibling being a coward)<br>q_c=0.5+0.5\u00d7f_c_ (the probability of a coward&#39;s sibling being a coward)<br>q_a=0.5\u00d7f_a (the probability of a coward&#39;s sibling being an altruist)<br>G_a=2p_a-1 (the absolute expected gain from an altruistic action for the altruists)<br>G_c=2p_c (the absolute expected gain from an altruistic action for the cowards)<br>L_c=2q_c-1 (the absolute expected loss from a cowardice action for the cowards)<br>L_a=2q_a (the absolute expected loss from a cowardice action for the altruists)<br>C_a=G_a\u00d7f_a - L_a\u00d7f_c (the absolute expected change in altruist population)<br>C_c=G_c\u00d7f_a - L_c\u00d7f_c (the absolute expected change in coward population)<br>P_a_n = P_a_(n-1)+C_a (the population of altruists at the nth generation based on the n-1th generation and the expected change)<br>P_c_n = P_c_(n-1)+C_c (the population of cowardice at the nth generation based on the n-1th generation and the expected change)<br>these new population numbers can then be used to determine the ratios f_a and f_c that feed into the next generation<br><br>Ultimately, altruism helps whoever is dominant, whereas cowardice hinders whoever is dominant, but when altruism is dominant, there will also be more altruist actions and thus a net gain for altruism, whereas if cowardice is dominant, there will also be more cowardice actions and thus a net loss for cowardice; in both cases altruism relatively would seem to get the best deal, but at the start, some simulations could start out favouring cowardice, and others favouring altruism, but generally altruism is more likely to win out in the long run.", "comment_date": "2021-08-28T22:17:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TFZ Bird Fan", "comment_text": "Finally another video", "comment_date": "2021-08-28T22:17:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8\u05d9\u05df", "comment_text": "Great videos , absolutely  every single one, but I have to know who do you do the simulations? there are exstremely well made.

Considering an Altruisme allele might appear amongst a population full of Cowardice allele : you start with 1 blob with this allele. Then it must survive the day to get a chance to reproduce. Then it must get lucky enough to pass it&#39;s allele to at least one member of its puddle. Then the same applies to it&#39;s offsprings.<br><br>One simple way to think about that emergence it to go back on the dices exemple : if you start with a single coin, the hamilton rule is the same : +1/6. However, when you roll you dice for the first time, you have 1 way to move on, and 5 ways to lose your only coin ==&gt; 5/6 probability of extinction.<br><br>NB : the result of the hamilton&#39;s rule happens to be the probability of non-extinction with only one coin. This is a coincidence. It would be different if the net gain of rolling 6 were 7 for exemple. The probablility of non-extinction would still be 1/6, while the hamilton&#39;s rule would give us 2/6<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLX_r_WPrIw&amp;t=18m16s\">18:16</a> On another note, one way to understand why the group not identical by descent is taken into account might be as follows. It actually IS, while we were trying to count it a second time. Imagine a situation where the 2 parents have the altruism allele, the hamilton rule applies independently for both parents (or both sources of the altruism allele).<br>If we follow the probabilistic assumption (Bp-C=EV) we can still make sens of the issue : when an altruistic blob A gets offsprings with another altruistic blob B, blob B&#39;s impact is taken into account in the probability calculation. But you applied your rule on Every Single Blob. So when blob B gets offsprings with blob A, you take once again into account the impact of both A and B on the probability calculation.", "comment_date": "2021-08-28T21:30:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nomish", "comment_text": "omg chomper from pvz in thumbnail no way", "comment_date": "2021-08-28T21:30:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mandy Tidwell", "comment_text": "So are some of the blobs inbred", "comment_date": "2021-08-28T21:29:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathanael Forlorn", "comment_text": "I couldn&#39;t follow at one point<br>I am still with you, when you say (fraction of new generation) must be &gt; than (fraction of current generation) to increase % overall.

Here are my two thoughts:<br><br>I think at least part of the reason why r needs to include only same by descent is that you didn&#39;t model the population limit as part of Bp - C &gt; 0. If you think about it the cowardice doesn&#39;t have negative EV - and with population being limited it most likely is positive. But the population limits shifts (and scales?) EVs so that EV across population is 0; so what you thought is positive EV for altruistic gene might be actually negative. I have no idea how to model it properly, but maybe using r instead of p can be proven to do exactly this?<br><br>The second thought - far less significant - is that during estimation of p/r you kind of skipped the part why B = 2, r = 0.5 works when we have two sibilings. If you think about it, the actuall outcomes are more complicated, there is 50% of saving a single same by descent gene, and 25% of saving two (and 25% of none). So why using B=2 and r=0.5 works?
