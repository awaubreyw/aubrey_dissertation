From here the &quot;law&quot; of supply and demand becomes completely divorced from reality as the monopoly will benefit from economies of scale and will be able to put other competitors out of business who simply cannot compete. Once the monopoly has no more competition in the town, they are free to set prices to whatever they like and consumers are forced to deal or go without. <br><br>This also applies to housing, where no matter how much housing is available, the market will naturally tend toward consolidation as we see with the housing markets in the US and the UK. It&#39;s not as if there is a lack of supply; we have enough housing to house every homeless person if we so desired. It&#39;s just that the system inherently favors those who have capital and are able to make that investment, while regular folks have trouble even getting their foot in the door for even the highest interest rate loans. And so the landlords get richer while everyone else suffers<br><br>Your core premise is also faulty outside of luxury goods and hobbyist markets. If you need to buy food, you will pay for what is available. It doesn&#39;t matter if you wanted to pay $20 for a week of groceries because ultimately you have to eat and the alternative is starving. The same applies to healthcare, where big pharma will charge ridiculous prices for life saving medicine for no other reason besides that they can, and they make so much profit anyways that it doesn&#39;t matter if most people aren&#39;t willing to pay for that.<br><br>Market economies might appear good on paper but your simulation does not account for anything resembling reality.

Specially in certain stuff like real estate or basic products and services like electricity, medicine and food. Specially since, even when a particular market is in red numbers (either actually red or when it comes to potential earnings comparatively) if it strengthen all the other markets, its actually a net positive. A perfect example would be a good welfare system in a welfare state, which, creating a solid &quot;floor&quot; from which they cannot fall even if they wanted to, and still not having (at least a hard one) cap/ceiling economically, citizens are more likely to invest or get educated or start their own business and even if they fail, which they are not afraid anymore, the market moves and so does money. Eventually, at least in theory, those in need of welfare would decrease as the amount of it increases (even more solid floor) which is more likely to decrease the remaining people in need of welfare.. and so on and on until you probably get into an equilibrium (no system is perfect). Another example would be employers increasing the net salary of their employees, and as such as it happened at the end of last century in the US if im not mistaken, theres more and more people with money to spend and willing to. Same with time as well (more time and energy to spend the money at hand) etc etc, so we could say that a market in a vacuum works one way but a nation is way more complicated and needs to account for interlacing (interlocking? sorry for bad english) factors like opportunity, foreign agents and minimum standard of living.", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T20:38:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Artthur Max", "comment_text": "When the government interferes in the economy, only shit happens", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T15:05:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmed Naboot", "comment_text": "we need a video about entertainment industry  history and current states", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T14:06:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nhatanh0475", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&amp;t=6m00s\">6:00</a> Remember, just let NVIDIA and AMD fighting each other, the benefit is us.", "comment_date": "2021-11-11T11:02:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zero to Hero", "comment_text": "Honestly it was so refreshing to hear someone talk about this objectively, and not over politicize it.

The Austrian School, the school of economics which studies dynamic markets, has in it&#39;s theory a theorem called the theorem of impossibility of statism. The schools that model the markets like the Keynesian School or the Monetarist School are based in calculations that are incompatible with any accepted capital theory; which sometimes make them a good tool in the short-term but they are useless in the medium- and long-term.

The only way for govt to do that is to either subsidize a commodity or to limit the price. Subsidies come out of taxpayer pockets. So there&#39;s an involuntary expense that effects how much surplus people have to put towards other things. Which effects what they&#39;re willing to pay in other markets. Price ceilings force companies to inflate prices elsewhere in order to make up the loss. Again, this effects the surplus buyers have available to spend on other markets. There can also be other consequences that aren&#39;t immediately apparent. For instance, the federal govt maintains a sugar cartel in the US. There are regulations about who can produce sugar, how much sugar can be produced, and the minimum price sugar is allowed to sell for. The end result being that the price of sugar is artificially inflated. But people want cheap sweets. So manufacturers had to find an alternative. Conveniently, the govt also subsidizes corn. This makes high fructose corn syrup much more affordable than sugar. And that&#39;s why it&#39;s used in most drinks and sweet foods instead of sugar. The bottom line is that central planning can never beat a free market because no planning committee can possibly react as quickly and as effectively as &quot;the invisible hand&quot;. It&#39;s literally the difference between serial and parallel processing.<br><br>Also, we had excellent access to health care prior to govt intervention. Look up &quot;lodge medicine&quot;. Not &quot;medicine lodges&quot;, that&#39;s a different thing. Back in the day people joined fraternal lodges, like the &quot;Elks&quot; and such, for more than just social events. Their monthly dues also paid to keep a doctor on retainer. So lodge members had quicker access and discounted prices for the doctor&#39;s services. And the doctor got a level of guaranteed income. But the AMA felt it was wrong for educated, well-heeled people like doctors to be at the beck and call of the riff-raff from the mills. So they lobbied against lodge medicine and got it banned. As a result of govt &quot;saving&quot; us from such a decrepit practice, the AMA now has monopoly control over health care in the US. They decide what qualifies as &quot;medicine&quot;, what institutes get to teach medicine, even how many doctors are allowed to be taught every year. If you&#39;re going to cite health care as a broken market, you should at least be honest about why it&#39;s broken.

That economic model is generically called Crony Capitalism or more accurately known as Mercantilism.  It&#39;s not a new system and is a popular corporate tool to bribe politicians to grant themselves monopolistic controls over the market and bar potential competition from entering said market.  This ensures that the consumer is forced to over pay for goods and services (G&amp;S) while taking the pressure off corporations from having to innovate.  Innovation is the pressure that improves manufacturing and products while governmentally-ensured monopolies gives the state power to choose winners and losers within the market to line its pockets.  This results in price-gouging the consumer accompanied with the decline of G&amp;S over time.  Don&#39;t take my word for it.

It doesn&#39;t make sense to apply economics to survival since continuing to exist has demand approaching infinite.<br>However, even if these requires us to apply a little socialism, state socialism isn&#39;t the only option. The opposite end of the socialism pole is libertarian socialism.<br>   <br>What I particularly like about it is that is decentralizes (or distributes) power away from the top (i.e., from federal government to local citizens councils as well as from international corporations to local co-ops) without requiring violent revolution. For example a consumer co-op can compete in the market with a corporate retail store. Since the corporation&#39;s bottom line is profit for investors and since the consumer co-op&#39;s bottom line is whatever its members want (and the members <i>are</i> the investors, so presumably they have specifically invested in a consumer co-op [as opposed to investing in a corporation] to create access to better quality goods or services) then they are competing with similar, but ultimately different products. This means a consumer co-op will never lead to things like planned obsolescence because the members aren&#39;t trying to get one over on their customers because their customers are themselves.<br>   <br>This also means that there&#39;s direct democracy for those who are interested and representative democracy for those who aren&#39;t. For example, as a member of a credit union (basically the co-op version of a bank) I have the ability to attend meetings and vote on issues. But, I have no interest in the bureaucracy of banking. Some of my peers do, though, so when they attend such meetings they in effect act as my representative. This works because our both being members of the same credit union means that our interests are aligned within that context.

So if you bid and win, you get my $100, for just 1 cent. However obviously the other person is going to bid $0.02 because, well hey they aren\u2019t going to miss that 2 cents when they win $100 for it. And so the other person bids it up again. Because until you\u2019re forced to bid $100, you\u2019re making money on the bid. So even if you and the other person bid back and forth all the way up to $100, at the very least you\u2019ll break even then. Except there\u2019s a special rule in this bid war, where the LOSER of the bid, still has to pay 50% of their losing bid. So what this creates, is the 2 people thinking they\u2019ll keep outbidding the other by 1 cent until it reaches $100, as even at $99.99, they\u2019re still making money, yeah it\u2019s just 1 cent, but it\u2019s still a positive. And if it reaches $100, well then they\u2019ll just break even no big deal. But person B places that $100 bid, and now what? Well now person A would be silly to bid $100.01 for a $100 bill as they\u2019d lose $0.01, but in reality, because of the rule where the loser has to pay 50% of their losing bid, if they don\u2019t bid that $100.01, that means they let person B win, and break even, and now person A has to pay 50% of $99.99 or $50. So, don\u2019t bid again, and lose $50, or bid $100.01 to try and win, and only end up losing $0.01? Obviously they\u2019re gonna bid again, even though now they\u2019re bidding more money than the prize is worth because they now want to minimize their loss. Except now person B is on the losing end, and will have to pay 50% of that $100 bid, so are they gonna lost $50 or place a bid for $100.02 and only lose $0.02? They\u2019re gonna bid to reduce their loss. And this continues on and on and on until it reaches a bid of $200, where by winning the bid, you lose $100 because you paid $200 for $100, and the person who lost, pays 50% of $199.99, or $100 and both people lose $100, the person who bid $199.99 isn\u2019t going to then bid $200.01 because then they\u2019re actually only increasing their loss by bidding because now by winning that bid they\u2019re out $100.01 rather than $100, so the seller, easily doubles their $100. Also in this problem the 2 bidders don\u2019t know each other and have no way of communicating with each other to try and talk about a solution such as one person bidding $0.01 and the other letting him win and then splitting the money. Or one person realizing the issue and letting the other person win just so they both don\u2019t end up being out $100 by the end of it.

Without talking about how you get markets, the arguments for and against come down to for or against regulating a market we assume should just exist. In order for markets to exist in this model, the means of production for the sold things must be owned, but they aren&#39;t owned in common by people. They&#39;re owned privately by individuals or small groups which inevitably use their power of production to consolidate more market power. Instead of looking at that system and saying &quot;we should try to regulate it&quot;\u2014which involves a State entity that needs a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence to enforce\u2014maybe we should just not do that system at all. This is so weirdly out of place for the progression of the series thus-far, that it is borderline an injection of Capitalist ideology directly into Biology at this point. If the workers\u2014who worked to make the things\u2014directly owned the products of their labor and were not alienated from it by those who own the machines they labor on to make the products, then you wouldn&#39;t need a market since that system stabilizes on any of two equilibria: the workers create specific things independently or in unions based on what they think they can barter for; or the workers weave themselves into local communities of diverse labor and products, which doesn&#39;t require barter since each can know the needs of their neighbors and directly provide and be provided for. Thousands of civilizations and communities like each of these have existed and thrived around the world. Some still exist today. Many were wiped out by foreign invader States who decided workers owning their own means of production was a threat to their awful and selfish system\u2014the one we use today where drug companies can decide who lives and dies because they &quot;own&quot; medicine patents, and the threat of violence from the regulators can&#39;t keep up with the rapidly shifting strategies those private owners use to stay ahead of the regulation. Because it turns out, letting a few people consolidate power is a self-reinforcing power consolidation loop that eventually outstrips any threat we can propose a powerful regulator have. Private ownership can grow exponentially. State regulation and punishment can only grow linearly, and largely responds to damage that has already been done after it&#39;s too late.", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T17:21:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lisa Ann Hunt-Boord", "comment_text": "Does enyone else see the blobs with top hats", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T05:12:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pabloparsil", "comment_text": "One of the problems with the eating part is that these would be, say, oranges, and the people left out are likely left out because they don&#39;t really enjoy oranges so they buy other products with different supply and demand curves", "comment_date": "2020-12-12T09:29:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Heater64k", "comment_text": "I am now an economics expert", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T10:43:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Myckou \ud83c\udfae", "comment_text": "What the h*** is up with the french translations?

The buyer is completely dempendent of the seller. We could say that the only real limit for the price of the bread in this example is determined by the minimum amount of food the buyer must get for his money to keep him away from starving and repeating the transaction at the next day. <br>Ore we could assume, that the buyer is working at a factory and gets a wage of for example 40 dollars but he could also cancel his job and produce one bread a day in his own kitchen. In this example the maximum price for the bread would be 40 dollars again.

You can even combine the two methods and introduce a new different market (with blobs buying and selling) and allow the blobs from one market to enter into the other market if they have enough for development. I think this would more model an amazon type company who can use surplus from one market to enter and eventually dominate another market.

The goods of each market have different costs, so it is only lucrative to persue markets that cost and pay the most.

Hence the need for regulation, but also the need for deregulation in others, ie, the need for deregulation in the health sector (in terms of costs of medicines and allocation of training). But we need to have sellers in low cost markets that are regulated, like milk and other farming produce, or we risk starvation or extinction of those goods. I find it hard to see why we can regulate food and have public access to water but we let the price of housing be set by the market.

But maybe you don&#39;t like Walmart? Maybe the difference in the cost of bananas doesn&#39;t make up for the gasoline you spent getting there? Or you&#39;re just biting the bullet and buying Bananas at Kroger because you simply don&#39;t want to take an extra 20 minutes to buy bananas at Walmart?<br><br>5)) Supply and demand also assumes that if there is a large stock, the price will go down. And in turn, if something is low in stock, the price will go up. But not all products follow this pattern, especially if the seller is knows they can get away with it. For example, printer ink cartridges cost between $0.03 - $0.08 to make, but they&#39;re still sold at $50.00 a pack.<br><br>6) capitalism has a natural tendency to monopolize. As soon as one seller gets an real edge, he gets all the customers. Lets assume he can mass produce rockets for $1 and sell it at a cutthroat price. Why would you pay $40 for a rocket when you can pay just $10. All of the other sellers lose out on their businesses.

It&#39;s somewhat complicated but not as much as you might think... here&#39;s how I would set it up based on the three means of production and the three economic actors:<br><br>The &quot;means of production&quot; you always hear about can be boiled down to three categories: Land, labor and capital.<br><br>Land:<br>Land and natural resources. All value that exists before human (in this case blob) influence. So you drop blobs onto an island or globe, a mass populated by nodes that represent natural resources.<br><br>Labor: <br>Human powers that we exert on resources to improve their value. The value we create is wealth, and economically wealth is used to acquire subsistence (what we need to live), commodity (what we want because reasons) or to invest back into labor to increase its power. The blobs would have the ability to use &#39;energy&#39; to turn &#39;resources&#39; into &#39;wealth&#39; which they have. And wealth could be saved, turned into more energy, &#39;fun&#39; which makes them happy, another blob, or &#39;tools&#39; that let them use less energy to make wealth.<br><br>Capital: <br>Capital is wealth devoted to getting more wealth rather than subsistence or commodity. You could say tools and equipment are capital, because they exist to increase the productive power of labor. But in the modern economy capital usually refers to wealth in the process of being exchanged for increase. So an active money loan or stock in a company is capital. Blobs should be able to give wealth to each other provided they will get more wealth back later from that blob at an interest rate. If it isn&#39;t repaid the blob that took the loan loses all their wealth and dies.<br><br>As there are three means of production, there are also three actors in an economy: landlords, laborers, and capitalists. These are not mutually exclusive and a person may be one, two, or all three. A blob&#39;s hue could depend on which one they are more.<br><br>Landlord: green<br>A landlord is someone who receives their wealth from demanding payment for the use of land and resources that weren&#39;t created by anyone. Blobs that are landlords could simply be the ones who got to a particular piece of land first, all other blobs that want to use land owned by another blob must give them a portion of their wealth produced from resources on it. The higher percentage of a blob&#39;s wealth is &#39;rent&#39; made this way, the greener they are.<br><br>Laborer: red<br>A laborer&#39;s wealth comes from expending energy on resources to increase its value. This is the vast majority of actors in an economy. The more a blob earns from turning resources into wealth, the redder they are.<br><br>Capitalist: blue<br>One whose wealth is derived from returns for the supplying of capital. This person has wealth somehow. Maybe they earned it, maybe they inherited it, maybe they stole it. But they have it and they have the ability to leverage it for interest. A blob that gets more wealth as interest from capital loans becomes more blue.<br><br>Other things to consider:<br>The law of economics that gravity is to physics; People seek to satisfy their desires through the least exertion. The blobs want to survive, be happy, multiply, and use less energy - in that order.<br><br>On top of that, it would be cool to make the resources replenish at a rate that at first is sustainable but as the blobs expand, they threaten their resources. But maybe if they exert themselves more they can ensure they have enough to sustain their population. Would they learn to curb their consumption to keep existing or consume exponentially until they die?<br><br>So color represents the forms of income a blob has most, size could reflect the total wealth a blob controls, its eyes could show how happy or sad it is.", "comment_date": "2020-01-22T02:18:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pepito Alcachofa", "comment_text": "Who needs economy and biology clases in school?", "comment_date": "2020-01-22T01:52:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin D'Ambra", "comment_text": "problem comes when one of the seller blobs monopolizes the market, like in the real world", "comment_date": "2020-01-22T01:28:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tones", "comment_text": "correct me if I&#39;m wrong but I thought it was rather confusing at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&amp;t=7m52s\">7:52</a> when you were talking about the supply curve but drew the demand curve (orange) in the animation and vice versa a few seconds later<br>Otherwise exceptional video!", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T09:00:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sl1ght!", "comment_text": "That&#39;s a rich blob.", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T04:19:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "K\u00f6lsk\u00f6 and Calst\u00f6 Union", "comment_text": "Their buying them for The Motherland! <b>USSR ANTHEM PLAYS</b>", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T03:47:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Beast's left earlobe", "comment_text": "haven&#39;t finished the vid yet, but if you didnt do this, you should do a simulation involving inelastic demand", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T02:14:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pasha Gaming YT", "comment_text": "690 dislikes.<br><br><b>oh yeah, we live in a society</b><br><br>People In 2050:<br><br>[Visible Confusion]", "comment_date": "2020-01-20T01:55:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sh_Check_In", "comment_text": "market is good but we need plan economy, comrade<br>viva communism", "comment_date": "2020-01-19T23:22:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TuesdayMartesVR", "comment_text": "The first sentence sounded like odd ones out", "comment_date": "2020-01-19T22:05:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kamilia koru", "comment_text": "<b><i>when its not a indian guy thats smarter than the teacher: i see i found a worthy opponent</i></b>", "comment_date": "2020-01-19T21:14:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eRr0r-s3aRcHeR", "comment_text": "the 1st buyer pays more <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&amp;t=4m24s\">4:24</a>", "comment_date": "2020-01-19T17:52:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MadManToss", "comment_text": "I thought the prices are hats", "comment_date": "2020-01-19T16:39:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RilBitz", "comment_text": "Add this in to the natural selection and the dove and hawks one and now you have primitive hoomans", "comment_date": "2020-01-19T10:34:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fidget Butterflies", "comment_text": "Honestly I don\u2019t watch this channel for the math or science at  all I just watch it for the cute animations.", "comment_date": "2020-01-19T03:30:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bryan pedrosa", "comment_text": "Supply and Demand is a spook.", "comment_date": "2020-01-19T01:27:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cheeky", "comment_text": "what program are you using", "comment_date": "2020-01-18T22:43:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trevin Carter", "comment_text": "Just flip the curve", "comment_date": "2020-01-18T17:25:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kittengirl6000", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc4xYacTu-E\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc4xYacTu-E</a>", "comment_date": "2020-01-18T02:51:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kittengirl6000", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFws_hhZs8\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOFws_hhZs8</a>", "comment_date": "2020-01-18T02:51:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YazHazDazSpaz", "comment_text": "Choosing beggars be like no", "comment_date": "2020-01-17T21:25:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JULIUSCOOL", "comment_text": "Joe", "comment_date": "2020-01-17T18:32:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "xya", "comment_text": "i sell nasa rockets for 1 dollar, a real bargain", "comment_date": "2020-01-16T20:16:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan Glaser", "comment_text": "I love your presentation, and the blobs.

A company making t-shirts might be just as happy with the price that they got from me as I am, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the people living near the t-shirt factory are happy with the company dumping chemicals in the local river. So even though regulation wasn&#39;t needed to protect/help either the buyer or the seller, it was necessary to help those who had no part in the transaction, but were effected by the making of the goods being sold.<br>Also, although it is very similar to the bargaining for goods, one reason to regulate has to do with labor; if there aren&#39;t enough buyers for marshmallow cakes, then no body buys them, and the company making them just goes bankrupt or folds; if there aren&#39;t enough buyers for your labor, you can&#39;t just survive and not work, so you will be forced to accept whatever terrible pay, conditions, etc. that the only buyer offers. That is why we used to have kids working 18 hour days 7 days a week, and when they lost a finger to the machinery, they were just fired, and the company didn&#39;t even stop the machines to fish the finger out of the food processors. Before regulations, when the job market got tight, people were forced to accept terrible conditions, and the buyers of labor could game the system to create a situation where the job market remained tight. Basically, companies &quot;dying&quot; (because there aren&#39;t enough buyers for the product/service) isn&#39;t considered a big deal, and is expected as a function of the economic system; people dying (because there aren&#39;t enough buyers of labor), however, is much more serious, and is therefore understandably treated differently. So the t-shirt company will die rather than go below its minimum acceptable price, but if no one buys my labor, I will probably not just let myself die- I will continuously lower my minimum acceptable price (and tolerated working conditions).<br>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I am not in favor of all regulations, and there are some that I think are ridiculous, but for the most part, regulations came about because things were going terribly wrong before they were put in place. People worked ridiculous amounts of hours before the 40 hour work week, they frequently got hurt on the job before safety regulations, when they got hurt they were just fired before stuff like worker&#39;s compensation, and consumers would get products containing gross/dangerous ingredients or non-working products before consumer protections.<br>We have yet to find a motivation for an economic system that works better than greed (I want the most I can get while giving up the least amount possible in return, and you want the same thing for yourself); it is reliable and has functioned for all of recorded history. However, throughout history, there are examples of the excesses of greed becoming detrimental to the system as well. Greed works well when it is kept in check, but its excesses can cause the system it supports to destroy itself. It is great for me if I can get a cheap t-shirt, but terrible for the people whose business relied on the river that the t-shirt manufacturer dumps chemicals into; greed motivated the t-shirt company to create a great shirt and deliver it to me at a fair price, but greed also caused them to dump chemicals, because doing so is cheaper than disposing of them safely, and will also cause them not to change that practice unless it starts to negatively impact their income. That is where regulation seems necessary to me- greed is the best thing to base our system on, but it has blind-spots and causes problems, which requires an outside force to counteract. In other words, greed does a lot of things well for our economic system, but it doesn&#39;t do everything well, and in those cases, we need regulations to fix the problems that greed can cause.", "comment_date": "2020-01-02T14:23:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gustav Bertilsson", "comment_text": "Great video to explain why S&amp;D is a bad method of understanding the market.

It&#39;s incredibly simplified and avoids multiple variables that would definitely complicate what is a simple 101.\r<br>\r<br>With things such as food, at least in the U.S., the supply of food is far greater than the demand for food. This means prices tend to be quite low and most people can afford food. That said, it&#39;s worth noting that &quot;food&quot; is a fairly broad term. There are different types of food and different demand for each type. It shouldn&#39;t be difficult to understand why lobster costs way more than corn.\r<br>\r<br>Another thing to note is innovation. What we didn&#39;t see in this video is how the market evolves over time. When you have people who aren&#39;t willing to pay much for existing products, there&#39;s incentive to find a way to sell to those who won&#39;t pay as much. Technology is a wonderful example of this. Not everyone is willing to pay for an iPad, but cheaper alternatives on the market exist. These alternatives aren&#39;t as good as the iPad, but they are good enough to those who don&#39;t want to spend much money on a tablet.\r<br>\r<br>For example, at about  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&amp;t=9m22s\">9:22</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&amp;t=9m33s\">9:33</a> you see a bunch of sellers and buyers removing themselves from the rocket market. However, what if another seller with a relatively cheap product is introduced? As long as they remain somewhere on the left side of the graph, they can profit. When this seller is introduced, they will push all the blue bars to the right of them one space to the right. This means the product will become available to more buyers! It&#39;s not explained in this video, but there is incentive to try to nudge your way into the market - which increases the number of sales.\r<br>\r<br>All of that said, swapping the graph around is far easier said than done - FAR easier said than done. The chart at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&amp;t=11m20s\">11:20</a> simply is not feasible. After all, people willing to pay more will always pay less if possible - which inherently means that (by pure willpower), those willing to pay more can simply stop being willing to pay more, and thus fall into a lower paying bracket. After all, these graphs only represent what people are willing to pay, not what they can pay. So, let&#39;s change what the chart represents - let&#39;s change it so that these lines now represent what people can pay. Now, people are going to be forced to pay more if they make more money, they can&#39;t simply buy cheaper products. We would need to do the same with sellers as well, so that those who make cheap products would be forced to sell to those who are willing to pay less. As far as I know, this is completely unfeasible!\r<br>\r<br>What does come to mind is national health care, and I&#39;m sure some people will use NHC as evidence of the reverse graph coming to fruition. However, NHC does not work like that. The graph represents different sellers selling different priced goods, and it shows what people are willing to pay. NHC, on the other hand, is (often) a single seller that charges people based on their income. This means we would need to use an income based chart and the average price each bracket would be FORCED to pay and the cost of goods sellers would be FORCED to sell at. These artificial systems are NOT self-sustaining, thus they are prone to problems that aren&#39;t present in the free market or, at the very least, are resolves MUCH differently. This is not to say NHC is a bad thing, but using a &quot;reverse&quot; supply and demand chart does not work. <b>It makes the problem seem easy to fix, but the graph would function VERY differently.</b>", "comment_date": "2019-12-23T06:29:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Hoffman", "comment_text": "Elon musk simulator", "comment_date": "2019-12-23T05:25:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PepperX_", "comment_text": "Stonks\u2122\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2019-12-22T13:10:03Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Mahdi Yason", "comment_text": "What if the seller had more then one rocket or the buyer want more then one rocket, how would that playout", "comment_date": "2019-12-22T13:00:38Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Rico loop", "comment_text": "In the real world thes buyers are willing to pay less then what the sellers are offering...", "comment_date": "2019-12-22T12:38:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ti Tau", "comment_text": "As an economics major specifying in property, your forgetting buying power as a dictator of markets", "comment_date": "2019-12-22T10:22:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hilson Alexandre Junior Wojcikiewicz", "comment_text": "Do the blobs believe in primer or are they atheist??", "comment_date": "2019-12-21T17:29:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wolf Elkan", "comment_text": "You should do a video simulating the government regulating the market with some of the other goals you mentioned.", "comment_date": "2019-12-21T15:43:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dean Van Greunen", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NorthKorea\">#NorthKorea</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Economy\">#Economy</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23LMAO\">#LMAO</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-21T15:26:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AnAbosoluteMuppet", "comment_text": "What do you use for these videos", "comment_date": "2019-12-21T13:03:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Finn", "comment_text": "&gt;steals this for my econ class next semester", "comment_date": "2019-12-21T05:33:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruno Wesen", "comment_text": "MISES APROVES!", "comment_date": "2019-12-20T17:21:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "elan", "comment_text": "dude youre literally covering what my lecturers teach me at my uni", "comment_date": "2019-12-20T14:58:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "El Weko", "comment_text": "Now make a communist market simulation", "comment_date": "2019-12-20T13:32:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "d0fabur5st", "comment_text": "As soon as you pulled out the price and quantity graph two years of economics In hs suddenly made sense.

Similarly, how sellers across the entire economy implicitly compete with each other over the price of inputs (labor, raw materials) and how such prices organize economic activity.  For instance, since revenue is roughly analogous to &quot;value buyers place on the product&quot; and expenses is roughly analogous to &quot;cost of the inputs&quot;, a &quot;profit&quot; means &quot;the output is more valuable than the input&quot; i.e. economic value was created, whereas a &quot;loss&quot; means &quot;the output is less valuable than the input&quot; i.e. economic value was destroyed - thus, a profit-maximizing economy is by definition a value-maximizing economy.  Similarly, an increase in price for a specific input (representing greater scarcity or increased demand) makes the least profitable activities with said inputs become outright unprofitable, driving out both the least efficient <i>sellers</i> as well as the least valuable <i>uses</i> for that input (since profit is &quot;value created in excess of input&quot;).", "comment_date": "2019-10-21T03:05:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mastertoad2", "comment_text": "You should implement a tax and show the effects on surplus", "comment_date": "2019-10-21T02:07:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ozzy Explains", "comment_text": "Nice hats", "comment_date": "2019-10-20T21:12:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HaYud", "comment_text": "Dammit, 1 semestre struggling with microeco 101, re-take class 2 time.

This would simulate the growth of the seller, likely resulting in effectively a couple &quot;supermarket&quot; sellers. Then the buyers must lose however much of their money they spent on buying rockets. For the fun of it, we&#39;ll also assume the blobs are all rocket scientists and need these rockets for their job. Each day, they use up however many rockets they bought up and gain some specified amount of money per rocket they have. It&#39;s pretty obvious what would happen here since the richest buyers and the lowest sellers eventually have a positive feedback loop where they will simply continue to gain infinitely more money, while the poorest buyers and the highest sellers will likely &quot;die off&quot; without being able to buy or sell anything.

Free Market is often portrayed like a continuos &#39;referendum&#39; where people decide what the adequate price of something should be, but in this &#39;referendum&#39; not everyone has the same purchasing power and so not everyone has the same &#39;vote&#39;. This is a plutocracy. Stop and think about the moral consequence of this fact in an economy where the top 1% owns more wealth than the bottom 50% of the population. It is often far profitable to provide WANTS for the rich (often in the form of financial assets to get richer), than it is to provide NEEDS to the poor.", "comment_date": "2019-08-11T08:43:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ethan Huynh", "comment_text": "A few years on, bet Primer will have millions of subscribers!

There are multiple reasons (purely logical and also empirical ones) that point towards free markets being the best option always. When competition in some area seems dead there is always new ways to get in the competition (think train monopolies destroyed by cars and airplanes).<br>Ultimately, intervening the market has the effect of distortioning prices. Which are the fundamental tool for guiding production. Where wealth is increased by the right products being made in the right ammount.<br>Also the reasons you suggest for it being desirable to regulate the market is something that happens in a free market. That&#39;s mistake two you make in that regard. The first one was saying that it organizes &quot;automatically&quot;. From far away it seems that way but from upclose it&#39;s every individual interaction that organizes it. So it&#39;s not a mindless autmatic organization, it&#39;s the result of every comercial interaction made conciously by each individual. And from upclose it seems as you are only counting on the surplus of each individual for organizing it but, in the big scale, every price is determined by the combination of surplus of every buyer and seller. <br>Lastly I recommend &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; to understand that regulating &quot;markets&quot; according some &quot;greater good&quot; ideal end up in full regulation and tyranny by goverment. That&#39;s not to say that the goverment doesn&#39;t have an important role in society, or even in the market. It can participate and produce things for people that couldn&#39;t afford it otherwise but it will only work as long as it trades in a free market that has real prices and a healthy economy that produces so much it can sustain said goverment.<br>I also recomend &quot;Human action&quot; for a more in-depth understanding.<br>Cheers, amazing channel", "comment_date": "2019-08-06T01:26:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Weddlz", "comment_text": "<b>s t o n k s</b>", "comment_date": "2019-08-06T00:13:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bl0ck Gamer", "comment_text": "if it were this easy to buy rockets North Korea would already have nuked us x 100,000,000", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T23:56:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0411\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430\u043d \u0421\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d", "comment_text": "Everybody gangsta until math enters the room", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T23:34:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "_", "comment_text": "Put these all of the simulations together and make a huge simulation", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T23:27:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kubagurPL", "comment_text": "you should set up a program/website where the supply and demand is simulated with real people in rooms/servers with a set amount of people per room/server.", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T23:09:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "itstherealbrace", "comment_text": "Primer in a few years: So now the green blobs will have to pay taxes...", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T22:45:20Z", "likes_count": 2545}, {"comment_by": "Lazar sharky", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m watching this it pops up in my recommend but it&#39;s interesting", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T22:44:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cool Day", "comment_text": "Stonks", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T22:35:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GENERALSEAL", "comment_text": "Stonks", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T21:55:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GENERALSEAL", "comment_text": "This is how difficult business should be<br><br><br>Hello would you like to buy my product<br><br><br>Sure how much does it cost<br><br><br>It costs this much currency <br><br><br>Ok here\u2019s your money<br><br><br><br>Thank you goodbye<br><br><br><br>-Ron Swanson", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T21:53:20Z", "likes_count": 34}, {"comment_by": "ICameHere JustToComment", "comment_text": "Aren&#39;t real markets usually heavily buyer-saturated?

Many buyers and sellers<br>Proven false by the computer industry.<br>It often only has a few businesses for a product or service and often the leader has 90%+ of the market.<br>Yet in the computer industry quality consistently goes up with price consistently going down.<br>Potential competition is enough to achieve this effect.<br>Which is why standard oil kept oil prices low, when government started meddling, they&#39;d already been losing market share.<br><br>And without government it&#39;s far too expensive and not profitable at all to keep competition out.<br>Only by making the public pay for creating barriers to entry, can such policies be profitable.<br><br>2. Freedom to transact with anyone<br>Again; the only one who can afford to enforce this is government, because they can steal the money to pay for it.<br>Even if there&#39;s a natural resource that only one person/company has access to, there&#39;s always alternatives.<br>So instead of oil, use nuclear energy, by raising prices to greatly motivate the development of those alternatives.<br><br>3. Voluntary participation<br>Government is the only one who can force you to buy their product or sell your property.<br>In the previous century alone governments murdered over 200 million people for not disobeying the totalitarian state, as compared to an estimated 9 million murders that where committed privately.<br>Surely, in most western societies few people are murdered by the state for disobedience, but state action still always causes more misery than benefit.<br><br>4. Good information<br>There&#39;s a cost to having/providing information and it&#39;s quality.<br>Who determines how much information is needed or how much should be spend on improving it&#39;s quality?<br>Everyone is different and in practice one size fits almost nobody.<br>So whatever level of information government chooses to require will be the wrong level for almost everyone.<br>Should the information include the diet of factory workers?<br>Please don&#39;t try to repeat the disaster of centralized control.<br><br>Conclusion:<br>The problems caused by monopolies/cartels are actually caused by governments raising barriers to entry.<br>Here&#39;s a few examples of policies that do this:<br>- Licensing (literally a monopoly)<br>- Patents<br>- Tariffs<br>- Regulation (with the Clean Air Act existing polluters where specifically allowed to keep polluting)<br><br><br>-----<br>On the issue of value or the goal of the market.<br>That is determined by customers.<br>By choosing where to and not to spend their money.<br>Any government policy that influences where investments go will either keep the focus the same, in which case it has no effect. Or it will shift the focus away from what consumers want; why would that ever be a good thing?

A lot of sells happen due to ignorance of the general consensus on pricing.<br>Another one that is false is the freedom to transact. Because one thing you didn&#39;t take into account in your model is that there is a cost of going to one stall to another in reality. And a cost to bring your rocket back home. But that means that distributing different buyers and sellers differently will lead to different price despite expectation not changing.<br><br><br>The argument about &quot;voluntary participation&quot; is also one that is definitely not fullfilled for market like healthcare, food, shelter and labor, because everyone has to participate in those, which is why it&#39;s definitely a good idea to make sure everyone can get access to it, you can&#39;t just walk away and say &quot;yeah I&#39;ll pass on food&quot;. And the thing is that your model doesn&#39;t take into account that the maximum price a buyer will offer isn&#39;t always associated with it&#39;s need in those kind of markets, but also with it&#39;s available money, which needs it might be willing to pay more if it could, but might not be able to.<br><br><br>Also you assume your buyers don&#39;t communicate with each other and don&#39;t try to agree on a price less favorable for the customer but more favorable to all of them.<br><br><br>Well those aren&#39;t the only things obviously (you could think about the impact of sellers also being buyers for exemple), and I get that they are beyond the scope of the video, but I also wanted to point out how many unfounded assumption this model has, because a lot of political views about economy talk about how amazing markets are abstractly without actually looking at how human market work for real.<br><br><br>I mean humans aren&#39;t enough guaranteed to set their buying or selling price in a way that make surplus for them, they might buy something more than what it&#39;s actually good for them and get scammed, and the use of cognitive bias to try and produce this into customers is omnipresent in our modern societies.", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T16:29:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XZile Bow08", "comment_text": "I love this channel, the voice is...

There&#39;s probably an argument to be made that at the end of the day it all boils down to utility, which makes sense in a way, but even then it remains subjective.  Supply and demand, after all.  Water will be worth more in a desert than in New York.  Likewise, while sand isn&#39;t particularly expensive, it is sold for certain things.  Good luck selling sand to someone in a desert.<br><br>The interesting thing is that this even applies to money.  The value of money comes (in the immediate, day-to-day sense) from the fact that you can buy stuff with it.  That makes it REALLY useful.  Despite that, the money can&#39;t do much itself.  What winds up happing is that a sale happens when the seller values the money he&#39;s selling for more than that he&#39;s offering, and when the buyer values what he&#39;s buying more than the money he&#39;s spending.  That&#39;s the surplus.<br><br>The interesting thing here is that this results in both people having MORE VALUE, by their estimation, than they started with.

On one hand, a handful of sellers can produce enough for the demand of all buyers, and yet all buyers could still be sated by buying from the most efficient ones, pushing other sellers out of the market; and because having food is necessary for survival, their demand is effectively infinite until they have sated their needs to sustain themselves. One effect of this, is that if they have a limited income, then the higher the price of food, the lower the price they will accept for any other product, and the lower the price of food, the higher the price they&#39;ll pay for anything else. They will not make any decisions about the price of anything else, until their most urgent needs have been met.<br>Now, you may assume this would suggest that the sellers would infinitely push the prices up until everyone is spending the entirety of their budget on food... But there&#39;s another factor; there are alternatives to buying food from others; and that&#39;s to make or gather it yourself. For example, if the price of meat is higher than the price of going out and hunting a deer, people will go out and hunt deer; and if its cheaper to rear animals for food than either of those two options, people will go into animal rearing. These people, once would be buyers, if they ever produce more than they need, thus become sellers.<br>Thus, in a food market, the buyers on the right side of the graph could be interpreted as being, perhaps, the same people as the sellers... In fact, that&#39;s another thing the simulation is missing; every buyer can become a seller if offered the right price. In fact, the thresholds for both buying and selling, are likely one in the same, but from different sides.

The reason why people can&#39;t afford things like food, job or healthcare in a developed country is precisely because of the economic policies and regulations tends to increase prices and taxation and inflation reduces the purchasing power of the consumer, specially on the lower income brackets. For example in the case of heakthcare in the united states you have insurance companies that monopolycing the health insurace in a certain state(wich means the goverment actively reduces competion), with no competition you have practices like price gouging, in adition the regulations forcing hospitals to follow certain procedures make the service more expensive. In the labor market regulations like minimun wages drive up the price of labor artificially, if the price of labor rises the market will react with less employment(as you exposed in the video), then the rise in unemplyment will drive the workers to work for less money or worse conditions, after all all those goverment funded retirement plans, taxes, health insurance and other beneffits are also a kind of profit or surplus wich are paid in kind instead of money.", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T20:34:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cleptuno", "comment_text": "Common sense 101: do not force people to do what they don&#39;t want to.", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T19:14:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kawaii Kitten", "comment_text": "we need this in school even a video or hypothesis experiment would have taught me better than the actual learning method my school uses", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T19:02:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Qunas", "comment_text": "\u0420\u044b\u043d\u043e\u0447\u0435\u043a \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0448\u0430\u043b", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T12:51:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "bradbla", "comment_text": "So it seems to me that there are blobs that want the rockets and there are rockets to be had but since some blobs are willing to overpay for the rockets some blobs don&#39;t get rockets.", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T10:06:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aburaishi", "comment_text": "Now simulate with advertising - have sellers with a higher surplus influence blob opinion to expect a higher price from their store and a lower price from others", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T10:03:48Z", "likes_count": 75}, {"comment_by": "Farzan R.Nobakht", "comment_text": "Awesome, It shows that instead of endless arrogant fights we can analyze thing more deeply and accurate.", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T07:28:26Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "EggsWithLeggs", "comment_text": "I love your videos, you\u2019re so good at explaining and visualizing concepts.", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T06:53:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "happysmash27", "comment_text": "Your blobs are very cute! <br><br>I also like your animation style, which is fairly similar to what mine is developing in to (most of my newer CGI isn&#39;t on YouTube though, but on my own website).", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T02:30:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tomas Chabrillon", "comment_text": "Love your videos, very good at explaining complicated things in a very easy way to understand.<br>For another episode, you could make the sellers expand themselves after earning certain amount of money (like having two stores, or sell more items)", "comment_date": "2019-07-20T18:59:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Huffman", "comment_text": "I enjoyed this as a basic Supply and Demand simulation.

I know it requires a lot of hard work with fixed variables and at the same time, fixed variables are the problem for this particular Supply and Demand video. Why? Well, to start off, it is set up backwards. Usually if you&#39;re the only seller, you set outrageous prices after you realize what people are willing to buy  because no one else can contend (historical event on monopoly citation here).  Your fixed variables are imprecise because they&#39;re based on a &quot;perfect&quot; economy which is derivative on a limited yet liquidative resource per simulation which lacks its modernism of today&#39;s supply and demand. If every single one of the businesses had a larger quantity of product so they could sell more than 1 per consumer and if the consumer can buy it, then what needs to be set is how much a business can own and sell in quantity. The larger they can afford bulk, the more they can save by selling in lower prices. That is how a modern day Supply and Demand is working. Because let&#39;s be honest, the consumer will always end up paying due to it being a necessity and against the law to steal- like food. The 3rd problem is that you&#39;re listing supply and demand as something that is not heavily manufactured, because in reality it is. Everything is. Otherwise your supply and demand simulation would mean that finding the equilibrium was pointless because you&#39;re simulating it in an economy, not actually supplying a demand.

If those assumptions were just an approximation of reality, and not plainly wrong, any &quot;free enough&quot; market would heavily punish things like &quot;incredible offers&quot;, in which a cheap product is suggested to be available at a price incredibly convenient but actually much higher of its &quot;real&quot; one, or companies that work more on appearance and status symbol, than to substance, to overprice their goods in comparison to competitors. <br><br><br>An example is youtube: if consumers were perfectly rational being they would invest far more time watching your videos, instead of wasting hours (equivalent of money in other markets, and that makes the assumption on consumer surplus wrong) enriching idiots that play videogames while screaming.<br><br>By the way, with &quot;invisible hand&quot; Adam Smith was referring to divine providence and the concept remains the same today.

You can send money to the developer through the built-in function, but it will not give you anything.  Only voluntary donations.  Now about the game: the game simulates the life and development of microorganisms consisting of CELLS.  In the campaign you will have to complete 66 tasks.  There is also a sandbox, but to uncover new cell types you will have to go through all the main tasks in the campaign.  In other games, where you need to create your microorganism in cells, you create it in the editor.  And then manage it during the game.  But in this game, the genome editor is completely different.  I will explain if you or someone else asks.  And now, why is she a great evolution simulator.  In the editor, you can turn on radiation.  It will change organisms, and the best will survive.  Personally, I used it this way: I copied the task for which I created the organism, but the number of individuals did not reach the required mark.  You can copy tasks by holding your finger on it.  Later in the experiment, I switched on the radiation and inserted several individuals inside.  In the accelerated mode, I received a satisfactory result for half an hour.  This can be done even with the whole ecosystem!  YOU REALLY SHOULD PLAY IN THIS GAME.  This game is worthy of you.  Thanks for reading.  You can ask any questions.

I believe that what would happen is that a new market would emerge, selling a similar, but lower quality service for the people that can&#39;t afford the higher quality service.

I really enjoy this video. While in a flat market that is helpful but the economy is set up for a debtor nation. Which is a strange concept. The goal of the debtor nation is to have the interest rate be lower than the inflation. America&#39;s current set up. In fact most countries set up. <br><br>This means that if you can get an item for an interest rate lower than the actual cost the debt lowering in cost to the buyer. Why is this such an issue. The common person is not able to get a loan that is not able to get that interest rate. Only the top can. Normally governments and companies. This also has another effect. The workers who&#39;s wages don&#39;t raise with interest rates they start to earn less as time goes on. <br><br>This is a down side to a debtor nation. Why is this a bad thing will the value of the money can under go inflation at a rapid rate especially when a market is designed to increase surplus for one side. Even more so when one party is breaking the rules to play that game. (the last recession is a prime example)<br><br>Sadly the market for when the currency is increasing in value is flawed. The wages go up but the goods and services go down. which means that the sellers are taking the lose. So in practice bot are bad in a long haul. Sellers take a loss than not companies, Debtor nation leads to rapid growth in prices which left unchecked can have market crashes as well as the competition for good cause issues.<br><br>The best way to put it the market model combined with the survival model. Except now instead of only trying to get two everyone is trying to get the most out of it. which if you but this in with gene mutation with those being being potential future incomes as well as incubation time for the offspring. This is a much larger computer model that would be difficult to match to a in workings of the market. <br><br>The parameters for he market would be massive with many layers and variables that are dependent on variable inputs that are based on more variables.

That being said, your videos are fantastic, and I&#39;ll probably just keep watching them anyways.<br>2) In this simulation, how do you determine the actual price of the transaction? Is it just the average of the buyer&#39;s and seller&#39;s asking prices?

After competitors are driven from the market they can use their newly established monopoly to rise prices as the buyers are deprived from alternatives.<br>Preventing such monopolies from forming is also an instance where intervention in the market can be worthwhile or even necessary.", "comment_date": "2019-05-02T19:44:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "carlo down", "comment_text": "Make a Video about Mutual Aid", "comment_date": "2019-05-02T19:44:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael53b", "comment_text": "Yes new video:)", "comment_date": "2019-05-02T19:42:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ultra Fire", "comment_text": "Blobs are too proffesional", "comment_date": "2019-05-02T19:31:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Smith", "comment_text": "A fun video but there is an extremely important flaw at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&amp;t=3m57s\">3:57</a>.  The min sell price is $20 and the max is $40...the video determines with just one buyer and seller, they will settle on a halfway point ($30).  In reality this is not true.  They could easily settle on $22 or $38, or $33...there is no mathematical rule that determines this should be split evenly at exactly the halfway point.  As long as the seller sells above the min price and the buyer buys below his max price, everybody is happy.  This is an important flaw that undermines the subsequent and derivative tests.  In realty, bargaining power determines whether a a rocket will be sold between $21 and $39 dollars.  In reality, the sellers would try to get together to improve their bargaining power (merger, corporate growth, etc...), while the buyer would try to increase their bargaining power through a labor union or another company.   Just like games theory, bargaining power is a game of chicken in which the larger party can bluff withdrawing from exchange to get a larger share of the increment of association.

At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNtKXWNKGN8&amp;t=10m39s\">10:39</a> you listed four requirements for ideal markets. However, those four requirements are off shoots of only one requirement. If the individuals have freedom (liberty), then you will have ideal markets. For instance, the requirement for many buyers and sellers - if individuals are free to become a buyer, or seller, then you will have the ideal number of buyers and sellers. If you have individual liberty, then you have the freedom to transact with anyone. Liberty allows for voluntary participation. And, liberty allows individuals to only decide (to buy or sell) if and when they have enough information to do so, in their own opinion of if they have enough information.<br><br>What does not work is when others limit liberty of individuals to be buyers or sellers. We see government limiting both supply and demand in many if not most markets. We see government limiting who can transact with whom, via regulations, licenses, labor restrictions, union requirements and the like. We see government forcing or restricting participation in markers (Obamacare an obvious example). And government makes rules about what information must or must not be shared on products and services.<br><br>Taking the first requirement as an example - in a free market, if one determines that there are not enough suppliers in a sub-market, and that prices are too high of course, then one can become a supplier in said market. This is the free market solution, which is far superior and consistent with your video, than government regulations, price controls and the typical regulations that end up destroying the market in the first place.", "comment_date": "2019-04-30T22:37:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The dark side of science", "comment_text": "One day when you\u2019ll have one million sub I will be able to say that I knew this channel when it was at 83 000", "comment_date": "2019-04-30T22:36:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Petts", "comment_text": "I love these simulations.", "comment_date": "2019-04-30T22:34:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J\u00e3o", "comment_text": "As a student of economics, this video is great!

I feel that the term should be used only for the seller if he gets above the price he got the rocket. For this particular example, the seller was willing to use some of his money to become a seller, buying the rockets and opening a shop. Once he do that he needs to sell otherwise he is loosing money, because he has no reason to keep the rockets if some buyer shows up, other than waiting for some other buyer to offer a better deal. The buyer on the other hand will buy if he thinks that the price is not outrageous and he has enough money to buy the rocket, of course he will search for the lower price but saying he got surplus is like he is 10 dollars richer after the transaction. It is as if the buyer already had spent 40 dollars just form the intention of buying a rocket and by getting the deal for 30, magically, he was given a 10 dollar bill.<br><br>2)It is very strange to say that the market organized it self. You organized it that way, you wrote an algorithm that did just that and then got surprised of the thing doing some kind of unexpected thing : organizing that way. You wrote the rules, i repeat you organised it, then by mathematically analysing your algorithm, found out its behaviour. But it didn&#39;t self organize, you had to carefully write the behaviour of each of the &quot;agents&quot;. Maybe something we could say instead is that we suppose that people willing to trade, will more or less organize this way.<br><br>3) this thing of generating maximum surplus at the equilibrium is also very strange. Maybe you should have given the proof because i don&#39;t see why it is true. You just said that the next buyer and seller will make negative surplus, meaning that the couple buyer and seller that meet at the equilibrium are actually making zero profit. When prices stabilize at the equilibrium actually profits end, your algorithm is just making each agent tend towards this couple where the curves meet.", "comment_date": "2019-04-30T20:17:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Felipe Rotilho", "comment_text": "Now add government and copyright and make the rocket cost 10 times more due lack of competition.<br><br>You can replace rocket with medicines.<br><br>Obs.; Your videos are great", "comment_date": "2019-04-30T20:16:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edgar Froes", "comment_text": "How can I donate to endorse more content like this?", "comment_date": "2019-04-30T20:11:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abhinav Baruah", "comment_text": "You are like the god of blob world.

They collect money based on certain money-collecting traits, like intelligence, social connections, or wealth of a blobs parents, and stumbling-block traits that make blobs miss out on money like being born with a disability or sustaining an injury. These traits could be treated with healthcare. If they don&#39;t get enough money, they cant buy healthcare and die if they were born with or develop a condition, or die if they don&#39;t have enough money for food. You could just subtract a set amount of money from a blob&#39;s savings to simulate a blob buying and eating food. You could set the price of healthcare with a monopolistic model based on the willingness to pay of the blobs, which would be dependent on the income distribution of the blobs. I think that as income distribution increases, healthcare would increase, causing blobs with traits that are not competitive in capitalism to die. In other words, as the rich get richer, undesirables die.<br><br>This goes into price discrimination. Basically, a buyer is able to know the maximum price any costumer is willing to pay for a good and will only charge that price, so the producer surplus is maximized and the consumer surplus is zero. This is (basically) the pricing model behind bidding on eBay and when you haggle for a price on a car.<br><br>But say the monopolist is not able to differentiate between individual costumers so the demand for each costumer is unknown. Now the monopolist only knows the aggregate demand (AD) of all the costumers through marketing data, so the demand curve can be drawn. Say the monopolist can only charge one price for their good or service. What price do they charge? A suuuper high price, but not too high. This price can be calculated from the quantity where the monopolists change in production cost (MC) is equal to the change in revenue (MR), and that quantity&#39;s corresponding price on the demand curve. For example, say MR = MC = $1, and at $1, quantity = 10. If Q = 10, then say on the demand curve customers are willing to pay $10 when Q = 10. This is a massive price increase compared to what it costs the monopolist to produce at. This is why you may see not all but many life saving pharmaceuticals being produced inexpensively, yet sold at a very high price. This is an interesting case for life-saving pharmaceuticals because if the pharmaceutical is controlled by a monopolist or an oligopoly, they know that you are willing to pay as much as possible for your life. But they can only charge one price for a drug, so they calculate the optimal price which some consumers cannot afford. Finding how many people are not able to afford medication goes into the income distribution of a nation.<br><br><br>This is why markets have regulations, mainly to get rid of monopolies and to increase competition, lowering the price.<br><br><br>You could also test a mixed socialist-capitalist healthcare market but that is for another time.", "comment_date": "2019-04-30T16:56:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ismael Alves", "comment_text": "The end of the video is like this: forget all I just teached about supply and demand, it will be fine... wait, why the hell Cuba, Venezuela and Soviets gone so wrong?

The only effect that buyer sentiment has is to determine how many rockets will be bought at that price, and thus how many rockets will be produced.

Free markets are not perfect but it&#39;s the best way to let an economy to organize itself.<br><br>For example, the producers that do not fit the buyers prices&#39; expectatives will be expelled from the market. With the intervened economy you showed at the end you&#39;ve eliminated meritocracy in both sides: the buyers (doesn&#39;t matter how much money you&#39;ve got, which is directly related to the amount of money you are willing to pay, among other factors) and the sellers (doesn&#39;t matter how efficient you are at creating products and bringing them to the market, you have insured the sells, your company and your rents).<br><br>If you introduced a factor of market&#39;s survival (in which you exit producing products if you don&#39;t manage to sell anyone after a couple of days) then there would be an interesting market&#39;s opportunity for competitors, because there&#39;s potentially less sellers to sell and the same buyers demand.<br><br>Intervening markets are inefficient in he way of showing real prices also. That&#39;s the reason of the recent housing bubble, for example. Many, many variables not taking in count to avoid any possibility to choose an intervened economy as the best option. The best simulation you&#39;ve actually got is real life and we know how liberal markets and socialist countries go on.

The problems with the explained market are all the assumption on that model. In oder for this to relliably work one has to be a computer without emotional outbursts, without feelings, always calculating the best offer to maximize a certain goal. In this example the goal is to maximize value ( well money, not exactly value ). And that&#39;s where the problem lies. If I wanted to code up an agent to maximize some value function, this model has a lot going for it, but for human beings this is disasterous. Almost all assumptions are not true in really almost any Market. Perfect information is never possible. Also for this to be fair, everybody should at least start of with an equal amount of value ( money in this system ), but the divide between rich and poor only widens as capitalism progresses. So to just try to regulate it will not work because the problem is not some faults in capitalism but capitalism itself. <br>So to conclude, I think these kinds of oversimplifications are more dangerous than helpful because they give a false sense of understanding. Although you made a good effort in exlaining why this model might not work. I just think you did not go far enough explaining the riscs attached to this model.<br><br>Ps: Ever thaught about why we have patents for everything? This is also just a weird regulation or patch on the system called capitalism in order to not break down. But it makes no sense to implement such a thing. Why should we lock out other people from our ideas and creations? I belive if we were able to share our resources, like you do with this video, we humans would be a lot farther as a species.

In a situation where there are more sellers than buyers - say, the labor market, where prospective employees outnumber prospective employers - the buyers (in this case, employers) are empowered. In the opposite situation, like the internet service market (or the majority of markets in general), the sellers are empowered. This strikes me as fundamentally anti-democratic: in a democracy, the larger group wields more power, while in a market, the smaller group wields more power.

Though I would personally emphasize the limitations of the model a bit more: for one, accurate consumer information is really difficult and time-consuming to obtain. To pick a concrete example, if you\u2019re conscious of environmental problems, you may want to buy products that don\u2019t harm the environment as much as others. Many larger companies, of course, have by now noticed that marketing their products in an environmentally friendly way stimulates demand for their products, but because actually changing their production process would mean cutting profits, they instead resort to marketing campaigns, fake labels (the Rountable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is a great example of this), etc. to give off the impression that they are working towards reducing environmental impact without changing anything. This works because an overwhelming majority of people doesn\u2019t have the capacities to check anyway. Additionally, production chains are often very long, so it\u2019s not at all easy to really trace everything back. Being informed about this stuff in this day and age means spending multiple hours a day researching those things \u2013 hours that very few people actually have to spare.<br><br>And that\u2019s assuming that economic decisions are rational to begin with, when they are frequently much more emotion-based (of course, there\u2019s no clear way to distinguish rational actions from emotion-based ones, but you get the idea). Advertisement is specifically designed to invoke these emotional responses, after all. If these decisions were in fact largely rational, however, we would still have the problem that most people don\u2019t have the capacities to make these rational decisions to begin with because it takes a ridiculous amount of work to compare prices, the features of a product, etc. and buy the one best suiting the individual\u2019s need based on that. <br><br>Furthermore, in many cases, economic transactions are really not voluntary. Most people don\u2019t spend a lot of money on pointless luxuries, but on things they need to survive and take part in social life. If you can\u2019t get any food, you starve. If you don\u2019t have access to the Internet at home, your employment opportunities will be drastically reduced. If you don\u2019t have a job, you can\u2019t really earn the money to afford these things. The standard example that we see pretty much everywhere in Western countries are the ludicrous costs of housing in major cities and the large amount of empty homes that are empty purely for speculatory reasons, all while homelessness is incredibly high. A lot of the time, there is very little influence on behalf of consumers in price formation. Yes, maybe the some other competitor will then offer them a better deal, but free competition is a pretty big ideal to start with. Starting a business requires a good amount of capital to begin with, and even disregarding the hurdles of entry, when a market is largely dominated by a few suppliers, there\u2019s a huge incentive to just charge a more or less equal price for a product. Going ahead and lowering prices if it\u2019s possible to reduce production costs is a risky move, especially since profit rates have a tendency to fall over time anyway. On the macroeconomic scale, prices are often anything but flexible \u2013 standard mark-up pricing will generally suffice. Just because something works on, say, a bazaar doesn\u2019t mean it can be generalized accurately into the world of macroeconomics.<br><br>This is far from a comprehensive coverage of the limitations of this model, but I just wanted to throw it out there and possibly inspire discussion.
