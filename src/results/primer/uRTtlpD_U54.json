Every single country, regardless of personal or political views, follow a very very specific birth rate route. Going from having ton of children, due to fear of child mortality, to continuing to have that amount of children as medicine gets better, that group of people have less children due to child mortality getting less likely, then the next group averages a little over 2 children, which balances death rates and puts population growth to a standstill. This has happened and is currently happening to every single country on the planet, though specific countries are at different stages, which is why we see such massive spikes in population growth. However as more and more countries reach that last stage, other countries have been getting there faster and faster. Iran was in the first stage less than 100 years ago, and is now stable and in the last stage.<br><br>All countries will reach stability, however certain countries face decreasing populations, such as Japan, but that&#39;s not due to lack of resources or birth rate routes, but are instead affected by local issues, such as lack of progression, which leads to overbearing societal pressures and expectations, racism, sexism and lack of immigration. Mathematicians and economists have calculated the global population, many many times, and claimed that the 12 billionth person will never be born, and by a simple examination of birth rates over the years, it&#39;s apparent that the rate is now slowing down. The rates from 1950 - 1970 are massive, 1970-1990, massive but slightly less, 1990- 2010, still growing but less than the last one, and 2010- now it&#39;s slowing still. Many graphs only graph things on large scales, and not spaced 20 years apart, which leads to misinformation, but it is slowing, slowly but surely. <br><br>When all countries reach that last stage, which they will eventually, assuming there isn&#39;t some nuclear war that sets them back, the world population almost assuredly not exceed 12 billion, 13 billion at the absolute most, assuming medical progress is forcefully stopped in a population growth area, but even 13 billion is fully sustainable both land and food wise, pretty much forever. The only non-sustainable things would be our planet, since global warming will need to be fixed or we will die off since land will continue to dry up like it already has been, starting from the equator and moving outward. Besides that, everything from food to energy, and precious metals, are 99% sustainable. In which the only factors we need for long long term survivability is to come up with solutions to quell global warming, hopefully, stop it, and to find ways to create materials efficiently, such as the hydron collider, which can create any element, but on a much larger scale, or to find a way to mine asteroids.", "comment_date": "2020-11-08T03:02:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "David P.", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRTtlpD_U54&amp;t=5m50s\">5:50</a> Green is doing better than blue because the chance of blue turning into green is doing something equivalent to adding to &quot;green replication chance&quot; while also adding to &quot;blue death chance&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T10:45:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pvt.

Blue creatures are losing children to your green, cancerous, hulk mutants; having those instead of having healthy blue creatures. That means the birth rate of blue creatures is lower, effectively, as they&#39;re not always giving birth to blue creatures, but sometimes give birth to orange or green ones.

Ask yourself:  How exactly do galaxies form?  The current narrative is that matter, via gravity, attracts other matter.\r<br>\r<br>2.  Ask yourself:  How exactly do galaxies become spiral shaped in a cause and effect state of existence?  At least one way would be orbital velocity of matter with at least gravity acting upon that matter, would cause a spiral shaped effect.\r<br>\r<br>3.  Ask yourself:  What does that mean for a solar system that exists in a spiral shaped galaxy?  Most probably that solar system would be getting pulled toward the galactic gravitational center.\r<br>\r<br>4.  Ask yourself:  What does that mean for species that exist on a planet, that exists in a solar system, that exists in a spiral shaped galaxy, in an apparent cause and effect state of existence?  Most probably that if those species don&#39;t get off of that planet, and out of that solar system, and probably out of that galaxy too, (if it&#39;s even actually possible to do for various reasons), then they are all going to die one day from something and go extinct with probably no conscious entities left from that planet to care that they even ever existed at all in the first place, much less whatever they did and or didn&#39;t do with their time of existence.\r<br>\r<br>5.  Ask yourself:  For those who might make it out of this galaxy, (here again, assuming it could actually be done for various reasons), where to go to next, how long to get there, how to safely land, and then, what&#39;s next?  Hopefully they didn&#39;t land in another spiral shaped galaxy or a galaxy that would become spiral shaped one day, otherwise, they would have to galaxy hop through the universe to stay alive, otherwise, they still die one day from something with no conscious entities being left from the original planet to care they even ever existed at all in the first place, much less that they made it out of their own galaxy.  They failed to consciously survive throughout all of future eternity.\r<br>\r<br>6.  Ask yourself:  What exactly matters throughout all of future eternity and to whom does it exactly and eternally matter to?\r<br>\r<br>Either at least one species truly consciously survives throughout all of future eternity somehow, someway, somewhere, in some state of existence, even if only by a continuous succession of ever evolving species, for life itself to have continued meaning and purpose to, OR none do and life itself is all ultimately meaningless in the grandest scheme of things.\r<br>\r<br>Currently:\r<br>Nature is our greatest ally in so far as Nature gives us life and a place to live it, AND Nature is also our greatest enemy that is going to take it all away.

There has been no evidence or observation of mutation leading to new kinds of animals.  We have only observed new varieties of existing kinds (think &quot;families&quot; when I mention &quot;kinds&quot;), such as all the different breeds of dogs, which come from canis lupus, etc.<br><br>The problem with evolution comes from the fact that it violates information theory.  Computers use strings of binary code in order to function.  Mutation of that code inevitably leads to errors which if not immediately fatal, it is always harmful.  This is why programs, even computers, will crash or become unstable.  In essence, mutation constitutes a loss of information.<br><br>This same principle can be applied toward DNA.  Because DNA can be ordered into any sequence, self ordering is insufficient, that is to say astronomically unlikely, to organize into anything meaningful.<br><br>The reason for this is because of proteins.  Proteins require a very specific sequence in order to form correctly.  Any change in the sequence will result in a malformed protein molecule that will not perform properly if at all.  Additionally, it takes three codons for each encoding of a single piece of the protein.  So the chances of any mutation being harmful extremely likely.  In fact, in order for mutation to randomly produce anything beneficial (ie transforming one protein into another) requires many mutations without causing death of the organism.  In short, the chance of this is infinitessimally small. <br><br>So far we are only talking about protein synthesis.  We haven&#39;t even started discussing all the different types of proteins required to create a single cell and all the structures it requires in order to be formed, or the coding of which proteins to create, when to create them or where they are even supposed to go.<br><br>Just single cells are extremely complex.  Colonies are increasingly more complex as they grow in variation and size.  By the time you get to animals and plants, the chances of mutation causing a positive effect has grown from infinitesimal to practically impossible.  In short, the amount of time it would take would exceed the heat death of the universe.<br><br>No, mutation simply does not create new kinds.

That effect is real, but it&#39;s too small to tip the scales, and I determined it was too complex for the main message of the video. But because some people are interested, I thought I&#39;d lay it out in more detail here.<br><br>Only 1% of replications by blue creatures produce a green creature (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRTtlpD_U54&amp;t=4m52s\">4:52</a>), and another 1% produce orange creatures. This means blue&#39;s replication rate is effectively only 98% of the stated value. 9.8% instead of 10%. The green population gets an expected influx of creatures each time step equal to 0.001 (a tenth of a percent) times the number of blue creatures. <br><br>Here&#39;s a desmos graph of the expected changes per time step for blue and green, from the equation in the video. (The green equation has an added term for bonus creatures from blue&#39;s mutations.)<br><a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zhig0dcftg\">https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zhig0dcftg</a><br>x is the number of blue creatures, and there are sliders for the other parameters if you want to play with them. N is the total, and N-x is the number of green creatures.<br>We can see that when there are 49 or more blue creatures we expect to gain green creatures and lose blue creatures. And if there are 44 or more blues, we expect to lose more blues than greens. But for any number of blues less than this, we expect green to do worse. Green is never expected to outnumber blue.<br>This all assumes no oranges. The fact that the functions add to less than zero for any value reflects the fact that orange is gaining in any of these scenarios.<br><br>So it&#39;s true that in this setup blue suffers losses from mutations to different colors while green benefits, but the magnitude of this effect with the given parameters is too small to make up the difference in base replication chance between green and blue. Additional sims I ran reflect this fact, with green regularly losing, but I chose to animate the first sim I ran because it was a good reminder of how chaotic this system is.<br><br>I appreciate folks commenting with a critical eye, and this will help me know what to explain more clearly vs what to gloss over in future videos.

By adding the crowding term, you get dN/dt = aN^2 + bN, and the solution to that differential equation is the logistic function, as stated.", "comment_date": "2018-08-26T14:13:52Z", "likes_count": 222}, {"comment_by": "Atlas", "comment_text": "Love your videos!", "comment_date": "2018-08-26T13:30:59Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Conor O'Neill", "comment_text": "Thanks - I&#39;ve been looking forward to this video for a while - you have a style that makes it very easy to listen to and understand.
