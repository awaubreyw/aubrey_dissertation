I determined an optimal threshold C and the decision rule for declearing a blob cheater or fair is :<br><br>ratio &gt; C : cheater, ratio &lt; 1/C : fair <br><br>In my experiments, a value of C around 3 was chosen. In other words, as soon as the probability of the current distribution of heads and tails is three times more likely under one or the other hypothesis, i make a bet. <br><br>With this strategy, around 60% of tested games ended quickly with a score &lt; ~100 and 0 or less coins, but the remaining 40% had both their score and number of coins diverging to infinity and a confusion matrix converging to  ~79% accuracy, ~21% false positive and false negative rates. I had to use a breaking point such that if a game lasted for 100.000 blobs it would end and the current score would be used as a final score for that game. On average, those games endend up with a score of  ~79k  and ~81 coins, meaning that each blob yields ~0.8 coins on average. The reason why many games lose quickly is due to the low amount of initial coins that make the player greatly vulnerable to unfavorable random events, or bad luck. As more coins are obtained during a game, the probability of losing that game rapidely goes to 0. With 200 coins ~2/3 of games had a score and number of coins diverging, and with 1.000 coins this happened in &gt;99% of tested games. <br><br>So with 100 initial coins, this strategy is losing (meaning the number of coins reaches 0 or less) ~60% of the time, and is winning ~40% of the time  (number of coins diverge and never reaches 0 or less).

I then calculated the expected return if you guessed at this very moment. Then I checked that value against the expected return if you kept throwing the coin (back-propagating this value from the maximum throws evaluated) including the cost for more coin flips.

Long story short, I&#39;ve written a solver in Excel. In my simulated results, it can get scores over 100 before my tables runs out of entries. It assumes a 50% chance of a cheater and a 20% chance of the coin being &quot;dropped&quot;. (Are these numbers listed anywhere?)<br><br>My methodology was pretty simple. You want to increase the expected value of a correct answer, but only while the increase is worth the cost of the flip. It&#39;s a stateless game, so all you really need to consider is how many heads and tails you&#39;ve seen in this round.<br><br>So I started by determining the odds of getting a given combination of heads (H) and tails (T) for both a fair coin and a biased coin. This is done using a binomial distribution. (built in to excel)<br><br>From their you can determine the chance that the blob is cheating. This is determined using Baye&#39;s Theorem, which in this case is just a fancy word for a weighted average.<br><br>Now you know the chance of a cheater for any given distribution. You need a 66% certainty either way to break even. But what we really want to do is maximise certainty while minimizing the flips. The real question is whether to flip once more, or take a guess. <br><br>The easiest way to approach this is to consider the expected outcomes of each choice. If you take a guess now, you will win or lose based on the known expected value. If you flip once more, you&#39;ll lose 1 flip and then either 1) lose the coin or 2) get a heads or 3) get a tails. If you get a heads or tails you&#39;ll know more about the round but might actually reduce your certainty in your position. You should consider the expected value of the resulting positions (more on that in a bit). You could also assume a 50/50 chance of heads or tails when calculating your expected value, but you actually know more than that. There&#39;s a chance the blob is a cheater which will increase the odds of getting a heads.<br><br>So we can now make an informed decision about whether we&#39;re better off guessing now or trying our odds with a flip and guessing then. But that still leaves out a big piece of the puzzle. What if we keep flipping, can our odds improve and how does that inform our immediate decision? The standard tool in the programmer&#39;s toolbox for this kind of problem is recursion. Now, I&#39;m sure a mathematician could produce some infinite series and prove it converges to a simple function, but I&#39;m not a mathematician so I&#39;m going to make the computer do the thinking.<br><br>It turns out, if you recursively evaluated the expected value at each state, you&#39;re encouraged to flip more than if you naively take the expected value of a guess at each state. As you add more levels to the recursion, it does have diminishing returns (it converges) but not as quickly as you might expect, so it&#39;s probably worth optimising. <br><br>What&#39;s also surprising, from my findings, there&#39;s also no definitive &quot;end&quot; to a flipping sequence. If the distribution hovers around the midpoint of the two expected distributions, it stays in your best interest to keep flipping. This is counterintuitive and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ve gotten that entirely right (again, not mathematician).<br><br>Still, whether I&#39;ve done the mathematics right or not, my little excel script seems capable or almost limitless play. I&#39;ll have to take a crack at the leader board. This was a great thought experiment and even though it&#39;s dealing with entry level probability material it did genuinely challenge me to think creatively and the results surprised me. It also gave me a great excuse to abuse Excel and use its functional programming in ways it was never intended.

Your overall confidence if you flip just once is 62.5%, even lower bellow the necessary 69% to play forever.<br><br>The fact that adding more rolls brings you closer to sustainability suggest that there may be one of many number of flips that will keep you playing forever, but there might also not be one, and I can&#39;t be bothered to do the math for 3 flips because the math gets tedious, with 1 extra outcomes to analyse instead for every extra coin.
