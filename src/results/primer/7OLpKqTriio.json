I have just discovered them and really enjoy them. I work on infectious disease for a living. R0 is in part determined by the period of infectivity. In this video you talk about modeling an infection with one day infection vs two day infection. It seem that you are inferring the one day infectious period would be \u201cless infectious.\u201d  In that case, with all else equal, the R0 cannot remain the same. Setting your RO at a specific number but changing the period of infection would, in practice, indicate that despite a longer period of illness, people are infectious for the same amount of time. I recognize this is just a model, but if you intended to reflect different \u201cinfectiousness\u201d I think using a fixed R0 would not work.  I could just be misunderstanding what you said.

It is true that a vaccine helps us reach the point where people become immune faster than new susceptible people enter the population. However, missing from this model is how easily the virus mutates.<br><br>You can essentially model viral mutation by multiplying the chance of mutation per infection by the number of infected individuals. Multiply that by the chance that a mutation allows the virus to infect immune people, and you can effectively see at each stage of the pandemic&#39;s life cycle what the chances are that new strains will emerge that evade the vaccine and spark a new pandemic.<br><br>This is how diseases like the seasonal flu remain endemic, despite new vaccines being invented each year: the number of people already infected with the influenza virus reached a critical mass before there was ever a vaccine that new strains distinct enough to evade each new vaccine continue to emerge. Part of this has to do with the fact that the mutation rate <b>itself</b> was one of the things that was able to mutate, meaning we essentially reached a point where even a small population of infected individuals is enough to allow the virus to mutate and reemerge every year. <br><br>The only way to prevent a post-vaccine endemic COVID-19 is to vaccinate enough people quickly enough that, even if the mutation rate is already high, the number of infected individuals decreases quickly enough to overcome the chance of vaccine evasion. Unfortunately, due to corporate greed and an unwillingness to use political power to massively expand vaccine production/distribution, we&#39;re already seeing that endemic COVID-19 is inevitable. Vaccination rates in the US are pretty good, but billions of people in poorer countries are not receiving the vaccine in high enough quantities to prevent the virus from reaching the endemic stage there--and eventually, every other country.", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T17:56:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aayan's Creative Lab", "comment_text": "COVID", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T17:39:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jus64", "comment_text": "We are in a pandemic and Endemic", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T17:19:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeremy Higgins", "comment_text": "Recently discovered this channel.

What about passively acquired immunity? In this case a baby acquires the immunity of the mother for the first few years of life, provided that the mother breastfed. If the baby is on formula it seems to last around 6 months. How would the inclusion of passively acquired immunity affect these models? <br><br>Also, what about asymptomatic individuals who show no symptoms and also never recover but remain infectious? Typhoid Mary was a classic example of a carrier who, for the remainder of her life, was infected and infectious but never showed symptoms. I&#39;m under the impression that it&#39;s very rare for a carrier to maintain the infection lifelong, even more rare than carriers themselves are, but it has been shown that carriers of covid-19 are testing positive several weeks later with only around 1 or 2% on average eventually developing symptoms if they were previously determined to be asymptomatic. This shows that the duration of the infection can be longer in a portion of the population that does not show symptoms, although not permanent in any known case that I&#39;m aware of. So wouldn&#39;t your model have to account for an asymptomatic individual who was always infectious and never recovered? Or a group of individuals who were infectious for two to three weeks longer than the average, and along with that wouldn&#39;t we have to account for individuals who died of the infection and therefore are not infecting others as long as they could have?<br><br>Call so, there are a few issues with vaccine predictions. Most notably is the fact that mutations occur silver vaccine becomes ineffective against later strains. we see this all the time with flu Seasons. Occasionally a flu vaccine is released that is ineffective against the current season&#39;s flu because of a missed prediction. more seriously though is the fact that taking A vaccine has been shown to decrease the rate of increase of killer T-cells. That is to say, you still produce new killer T-cells, you just don&#39;t produce as many in relation to the number of vaccines you received. this means that while the vaccine protects you against the predicted strain you are, as a consequence of taking the vaccine, slightly less able to mount an effective immune response to what you are not protected against. in a given year there can be more than 50 different respiratory infections going around, more than just the common strain of the cold or flu, but if we vaccinated against all of it it would actually cause problems more than it would help. It&#39;s more than an issue of cost. If, for example, you wanted to eradicate all 2,000 ish strains of the common cold  you would have to vaccinate 60% of the population 2000 times. the truth is that we have no idea what. Many vaccines would do to the body or what problems it could cause. I would infer though that if a population took an increasing number of vaccines it would actually lead to an outbreak of something else entirely. I&#39;d be curious to see a simulation on that though.<br><br> a much better model than the vaccine model that I&#39;ve seen is the blood serum model. That&#39;s what we used before vaccines existed, but in order to get the blood serum you have to extract it from an individual who recovered from the infection. It&#39;s Superior to vaccines in that you can give it to someone who is currently sick to treat them as a cure or you can use it as a vaccine equivalent without the issues of reduced immunity to other strains. Some years ago actually recall reading about a genetically modified tobacco plant that was used to produce synthetic blood serum, but it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve heard any news about it so I don&#39;t really know if There were any problems with this approach though. Still, I would be very curious to see how a cereal approach might differ from a vaccine approach in these models. for example, suppose you wanted to eradicate the common cold and you had a cure ready to administer for all 2,000 strains and suppose you had sophisticated enough testing to know which individual was infected with which strain and could deliver this treatment within 3 days of infection whereas an untreated individual might take up to two weeks to stop being infectious. Would that be an effective strategy?", "comment_date": "2020-07-26T13:26:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "noob  Friend", "comment_text": "You talking about corona virus when it 1st started in now With corona virus I just wanted to say Hi future me and Bye corona virus In the future", "comment_date": "2020-07-26T04:59:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dog", "comment_text": "The problem here is that EVERYBODY lives.", "comment_date": "2020-07-25T13:25:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anne Eva Kristina", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OLpKqTriio&amp;t=12m04s\">12:04</a> I was SO sure he was going to talk the subscribe button.", "comment_date": "2020-07-25T08:28:31Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Frederick", "comment_text": "you should have added a chance of dying, depending on how much hospitals the city has.

Maybe there&#39;s a connection there... But this continues...<br>The Earth vibrates at certain frequencies, and taking those away from you, would cause you to get very sick and pretty fast (and this is tested). Right... So could these missing frequencies cause deficiencies or &quot;dis-ease&quot; in your cells? Or the &quot;dis-eased&quot; cells do not function properly in your body unless you have these harmonic frequencies playing out from the Earth? So is staying home really a good idea?<br>So, if frequencies of the Earth can keep us in good shape, then what about all the noise generated by radiowaves, 2G, 3G, 4G and now 5G? The amount of radiation around the world has exponentially grown since the first mobile phones. It&#39;s all the same stuff yeah, but the frequency range changes per generation. But what if you were able to &quot;dis-ease&quot; cells in your body with certain frequencies, like causing some disharmony? Corona &quot;infections&quot; and 5G countries correlate so very closely that it&#39;s kinda making me curious of why. It sure sounds like a fucking hilarious joke, just like the mainstream media paints it as... But think about it for a second... I double-dare you to think about this for a second.<br>Also, I really wonder what Bill Gates has to offer us with his &quot;new and amazing vaccines&quot; he makes for us.

Still capable of infecting others who live in the same house who are susceptible.

(A lot of people treating infected patients have died, presumably quite a few have gotten the virus multiple times.) There&#39;s no such thing as immunity == no susceptibility, it merely means your body <i>should</i> be able to produce antibodies when it gets sick <i>again</i> . The other issue at play why herd immunity tends to not work well in real world scenarios is due to a very big variety in how capable people their immune systems are in dealing with any virus. That&#39;s how healthy people end up on the intensive care. Even when there&#39;s no inheritance of immunity, you absolutely inherent a large part of what your immune system can be, even when you have to get sick multiple times to really &#39;train&#39; it. The other issue is that for a herd immunity to work, you would <i>still</i> need to isolate the weak, which is pretty much impossible. You&#39;d also have to be pretty sure there are enough healthy people that wouldn&#39;t die of the disease, where with a required 60% of people having gotten sick, this means most countries would end up with a LOT of elderly people sick and dying. Just about any country with a population ageing will have serious problems with any kind of herd immunity theory, as it would <i>STILL</i> result in a lot of elderly people dead. The short story is that isolation is the only solution for any disease that has no vaccine or cure / treatment. In terms of real world numbers, keep in mind that even in massive countries like the US literally only 1% ever has gotten the disease. Imagine that being 60x times more and imagine the current death toll being 60x worse or more. And you&#39;d quickly realize herd immunity is a pretty ridiculous concept for a virus of this nature. It might be cool for influenza that barely would kill anyone.
