These days I try my best to discuss things without trying to position myself as someone who has authority on it ; I am just a learner whose only desire is to find the truth, <br>whether that means I was right to begin with or, more likely, I wasn&#39;t.", "comment_date": "2021-08-29T14:47:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "James Ford", "comment_text": "Holy shit; this man is honestly something else \ud83d\ude4f", "comment_date": "2021-08-29T13:52:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Enna Ojala", "comment_text": "Holy shit this hits me hard!!! Those things explain exactly why I\u2019m wrong when I\u2019m wrong \ud83d\ude02 and also why I have anxiety \ud83d\ude2c<br><br>1 &amp; 2. When thinking/wanting to do something what\u2019s the best thing to do now for the future I can easily fall into many logical fallacies and eventually in a paradox because I\u2019m thinking too much in absolutes and at the same time considering multiple possible outcomes. I tend to cling to my way of seeing future outcomes that I can\u2019t really know for sure but like I\u2019m seeing them in general like that\u2019s going to lead to more work to fix the wrong outcome that could\u2019ve been avoided all along \ud83d\ude05 <br><br>Although same time I know something might not go the way I think. Still <br>A) the past evidence points that I\u2019ve usually been right in the majority of cases and I\u2019ve got praises for been so thoughtful that others have end up saving time/resources etc<br><br>B) those are still possible outcomes, I might be right or wrong just like anyone else, since no one knows the future for sure until it happens (also the reason why I can\u2019t relax until the time has passed and we all know how it played out. That\u2019s how I get stuck in the paradox) <br><br>C) I have the right to prepare myself for any future outcome etc that I see coming (or try to prevent something from happening) even no one else agrees it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to happen (heavily leaning to the points A and B here and knowing what would happen if I end up been right, why I would mostly start any of this in the first place) and because something happens despite whether we do something about it or not so why not choose the better option? \ud83d\ude2c<br><br>For me life just goes on even if the outcome I predicted doesn\u2019t happen and that\u2019s amazing and I would love things going well every time but that\u2019s not my reality and my suggestions usually aren\u2019t anything too complex but they would ensure or at least make it more likely that we all get the wanted outcome.<br><br>So I end up asking why would anyone disagree with me since the alternative could be anything from wasted time to someone dying \ud83d\ude02 yes I know that those two aren\u2019t the same at all but in my head I just can\u2019t comprehend why would anyone waste their time/resources etc when there is clearly a better way of handling things etc (and nothing pisses me off more than agreeing to go the wrong way just to end up in situation where I hear you were right/we should\u2019ve listened to you \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21 happened way too often so now I\u2019ll cling even more to my way of doing things etc than before)<br><br>3. I\u2019m always looking people to confirm my reasoning and will challenge them kinda passive-aggressive ways so they don\u2019t even dare to say anything against my point and also use lot of time to prove their sayings wrong and mine right or what my point was and how they didn\u2019t got it. I also realize now that I do look for people who are going to agree with me and discard anyone who don\u2019t. And be like look look I have this much people who agrees with me so you just don\u2019t get it \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 <br><br>4. Story of my life \ud83d\ude02 I have adhd and I\u2019m autistic (and more) so patience is not my strong game \ud83d\ude2c I just see resolution and can\u2019t understand why others don\u2019t and what\u2019s taking them so long and with the experience that it\u2019ll lead to them wanting to do things my way anyway so why couldn\u2019t we just jump right there \ud83d\ude2c (still willing spend lot of time to prove them wrong but it\u2019s annoying and I would gladly jump over that part) <br><br>5. And all of the above leads me to be overconfident in my reasoning and not give up easily \ud83d\ude2c<br><br>Now if you made to end of that novel congrats \ud83c\udf89 it took me awhile to write and I don\u2019t even know anymore who did I write that to someone to benefit from it or myself. Well either way your welcome or me welcome \ud83d\ude02<br><br>But one question remains why am I so often right even when I use so many fallacies and cognitive biases in my thinking/speaking? \ud83d\ude05<br><br>Edit. Now that I\u2019ve fallen in the rabbit hole of researching about fallacies and biases I\u2019ve found an answer to my question and it goes as such \u201cThe conclusion of an argument may be true, even if the argument contains a fallacy. Finding a fallacy just means that the arguer needs to look for other, better reasons in support of their conclusion.\u201d<br><br>I notice that I experience false consensus effect in a way it makes me frustrated when others seem not to get my point and I think I\u2019ve been very clear and the subject isn\u2019t even that complicated and they must get it like I do but are they making it hard for me on purpose or are they just idiots \ud83d\ude02<br>And even when I really want to present my case as clear as it\u2019s in my head It\u2019s really hard to communicate/explain anything what goes in my head so others could see it as clearly as I am.

First is the grey area comparison they make in point 1 and 2. In point 1 they talk about having to avoid both the appeal to authority fallacy and the fallacy fallacy. In point 2 they talk about the probability of being wrong vs Four decades of peer-reviewed research being wrong. My big disagreement here is that there is something wrong with being wrong. I believe that there is virtue in following every line of thinking to it&#39;s logical conclusion. To agree with Hamilton&#39;s rule because of authority and decades of research when your own analysis disagrees is a form of dishonesty and hypocracy.<br><br>(I agree 100% with point 3 so I&#39;m going to skip over it. You should seek people that will disagree with you on the topic and people that have already formed their own opinions on the topic.)<br><br>Secondly he talks about impatience and about publishing his work too early. In itself that&#39;s understandable, regularly putting out content is commendable. The point where things start to seem like a mistake is with point 5 when you take into account his audience size, his reputation as an educator (and the great videos he&#39;s put out in the past), and the fact that his audience probably isn&#39;t made up of experts in the topic. After considering those factors puting out misinformation might seem like the worst possible thing you could do, but I don&#39;t think that this is the case. One is the idea of individual responsibility. Youtube watchers should not trust information from youtube channels. Not educators, nobody. Diversity of your sources of information, not &quot;quality&quot; of your sources should be the most important factor for watchers. Being honest is not only inherently valuable, but it will also give your audience a much needed peek into how reliable you actually are as a source. They might be harmed in the short term by not trust you when you tell the truth next time, but they will be more independent and better critical thinkers in the long term.<br><br>Thirdly with point 5 Primer discusses another grey area, underconfidence vs overconfidence. They say that not speaking up when you are correct is a problem with underconfidence and that there are even situations where speaking up when you are wrong will help you gain a better understanding, but they incorrectly assert that &quot;publishing is not one of those situations.&quot; Choosing not to introduce a group of people to a new idea is just demeaning. If a large number of people are talking about something then the overall knowledge will improve. Experts joining the frey will get more experience talking to confrontational laymen and the laymen will learn how to think deeper about it. Primer seriously did prove wrong an incorrect conception of Hamilton&#39;s rule and hopefully encountering this disproof would make other communicators much more careful not to accidentally put bogus ideas into the heads of poor people like Primer. And as for Primer himself, what are the chances that real behavior ecologists like the mentioned Sally Le Page would reach out specifically BECAUSE of a published video like this?<br><br>I think a lot of people censor themselves a bit too much and are far too hard on themselves when they are wrong.

It will just lead to the same outcome.<br>You need a more complex system to simulate Hamilton&#39;s rule. The problem lies inherently in the fact that imposters are unrecognizable. Try a system where the color of the beard is freely mutatable as the color encoding itself, and where the altruistic behavior itself is defined as altruistic towards color ranges on all RGB axes. Also, make the mutation probability for color and altruism itself mutatable. And finally, make the mutation function more complex and evolvable so that a link between altruism towards its OWN color can evolve dynamically that survives color changes. That should make for a more interesting model. It will probably make it so that altruistic behavior appears but gets destroyed once an imposter appears UNTIL a population arises that have a high mutation rate to its own color but evolved a mechanism where the altruism towards the own color is preserved over generations even when the color changes. Kind of like animals recognizes kin over smell.<br>All very interesting stuff. But it will probably work once you introduce more factors like that.<br>Notice that none of the things I suggested require sexual reproduction, I am afraid that you might have fallen for the same fallacy fallacy once again, by prematurely proclaiming asexual reproduction to be a dead end because you didn&#39;t get it to work.

I am a firm believer that the Earth and other large items in space do not curved space-time. My belief is that they have a curved on objects but it doesn&#39;t have any reference about time actually I disconnect the time equation component even though that may have something to do with literally ignoring the fact that satellites adjust for different time variance as they go up into higher altitudes and stratosphere&#39;s or whatever where the gravity is weaker and the timepiece shows a different time. Because my firm belief is that gravity is affecting the timepiece not the actual passage of time if that makes any sense. It&#39;s the same to say that friction-free water is going to affect time it won&#39;t that&#39;s my firm belief. Same thing to say that speed will not eventually end up manipulating time if you go past the speed of light I firmly believe it will not in any way affect time either for your perspective or just on the elements that are affected by the speed it just won&#39;t. I&#39;m basically saying space-time Believers are flat earthers. The direct ignorance that I feel that space timers have is based on Sound Logic is what I would say to myself and to everyone in any video that I make multiple videos that I make. And I&#39;m not going to take down every video that I make that I make a statement in that turns out to be true or false later on if I said otherwise. But the sad fact is the even if you don&#39;t have as much gravity and buoyancy is a lot less packed in time really isn&#39;t affected even in the trillionth of a second in reality. The atomic particles can react but it actually isn&#39;t affecting time there&#39;s no way to make a time machine out of that and I feel sorry for anyone who believes that notion. Because eventually we&#39;re going to end up being able to go as fast as the speed of light perhaps in some way or at least make a signal that can go the speed of light and or Beyond it and hope that that signal is able to somehow come back at us in the past. Or the person or object will come back in the past. It doesn&#39;t happen. The best way to prove it is if there were faster than light sings that then turned around and started going backwards in time for some reason then it would just make sense that if you put those fast sings into a friction state that slows them down just like late can be slowing down in a medium. Time would be able to be visibly spectrally just constantly flexing at greater depths potentially. We don&#39;t see this. Among that basic logic tells me firmly that people are wrong to ever say that because of body like a planet or a star is large it will affect time like a black hole will affect time in a big way when you get closer and closer to it. I don&#39;t have any experience with equipment that could possibly prove or disprove this but people back in the 18 hundreds and before then knew about physics without equipment. people speculated the atom before they were able to see the atom. I also believe a couple of things may or may not be correct about gravity. how it&#39;s a function of momentum as well as electromagnetic gravitation. Which most scientist believe electromagnetic gravitation finding planets and stars together is not what&#39;s happening. The belief seems to be the planet curved space-time thus it&#39;s predictable how things will move around it I don&#39;t see that at all I see a bunch of kites out in a big wind which is space. and we are all connected by electromagnetism on a very subtle amount. the gravity that pulls people and other objects to the planet is a totally different momentum-based function. and in my mind it pains me to see anyone thinking otherwise. and I&#39;m not somebody who works at the Hadron Collider or has used an electron microscope. but I also believe that in the two slit experiment the electron has never stopped being a particle it was never a wave but it has electromagnetic radiation which does work in waves. And these electromagnetic radiation waves affect the electron particle. electrons protons and neutrons are not purely positive negative and neutral but have components for each function. And the different particles have these different function pieces in different proportions. The neutron that has less repulsive functions and the proton has more that don&#39;t affect the neutron which is actually more positive towards the proton yet not affecting the electron which only the proton seems to attract however not allowing the electron to stay attached because the electron has a repulsive component. the so-called probability of where an electron might be is actually just because we don&#39;t have the ability to measure it as instantaneously as its movement. it isn&#39;t actually quantumly in random spots that we can&#39;t see it is predictable we just don&#39;t know how to predict it which is saying a lot against the scientific community in all of these statements I&#39;ve made. As well as perpetual motion is a planet and weather system which is only as lasting Perpetual quote on quote because it is a living planet the moment that the planet dies it will stop being perpetual. and all atomic particles decay. and the laws of conservation of energy no energy is ever conserved but all dissolve over time. and all are eaten by fire and spit out less than what was once there and do not just change forms but are eliminated and we must admit some process created particles. Another bold statement not just of mine but of others. because the heat death of the universe is inevitable without interference from some intelligent species the material from the universe had to have come from some process that for lack of any other evidence must be creation meaning there must be a god. And no one likes the idea of a god. Free energy devices it is possible together energy in certain amounts and through some process of amplification and momentum staying then build up and momentum acceleration as well as taking the Heat from the material itself or near it and using the cold from a similar device and using electromagnetism or neodymium magnets it is possible to make a machine that makes more energy then it takes to run. of course neodymium magnets take 10 years to drop by 10%. by that time we can make more magnets using the power made by the magnets and other functions. A simple circuits of capacitors can take small amounts of energy build it up to a small burst of energy and start a flywheel. give it another burst the wheel can be long lasting and the energy can be generated consistently. once the power and the momentum are past the starting phase the generator can run pretty much without effort. all components will fail so nothing&#39;s Perpetual but we can make the power generation and Power storage be more and more efficient over time. If I told you that the cold off of your window in the winter and the Heat of an appliance such as your router for your internet or Transformer that you used to plug in your computer can change the states of two wires enough to make an extra amount of energy. based on a video I&#39;ve seen and the logic seems sound. I would say that is a tappable energy we should have been holding on for decades. Electromagnetic levitation. gaining power off of a person&#39;s neurological energy. If you have a device that can pull the energy out of your own body using capacitors to store and then jolt it is possible a person&#39;s body can make power. the small amount of power a person can make could power nanotechnology. which can add to our immune system or even help in maintaining our DNA. we can even tap into extra senses and possibly telepathy using technology eventually which already has been tested in small amounts with very limited connectivity to the nervous system. and some of what I&#39;ve said goes against things that really well-known and really deeply educated people somehow I firmly believe. as if the universe requires an observer for the electron to be a particle or a wave. but then if we can&#39;t change time using momentum or mass will we ever achieve it someday? At first glance no. hardly anything that I&#39;ve talked about is applied currently but I feel it&#39;s important people understand the truth but other people believe in aliens and their just as wrong. not so loud still life can&#39;t but that life didn&#39;t produce anywhere else to the point of making an actual organism. the Fermi Paradox says that if there are so many planets and galaxies and all of that and chances for life and life bearing planets possible then why don&#39;t we see civilization considering that in a hundred years time will have trade routes with Mars and possibly all the planets in the Solar System will be occupied somehow. Any other civilization in space could have easily surpassed us. So why is there no evidence no Direct contact? and people talk about harnessing radio waves in order to make energy and I don&#39;t see why not. if you can grab some even a little bit couldn&#39;t you rig an entire building to grab a lot. even if that lot only Powers One battery per cubic metre. Wait that&#39;s actually a lot of power in a month. It&#39;s still a lot. worth the investment I don&#39;t know. if you found this interesting this is how interested I am in the videos you make covering topics that I don&#39;t usually research. never worry if you&#39;re worth it because you are.", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T04:32:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wryip77", "comment_text": "Wow, Glad  there was a reason that  he stopped making videos.

Almost 2 years ago now I started dating someone and over time signs started coming up that this person just wasn&#39;t ready for a relationship and that it would be miserable for both of us. Heck, I WAS miserable the first time I noticed these issues, but I thought that I could handle it because I felt like I&#39;d worked hard enough on who I was as a person to be the emotional support system for two. &quot;I can handle this, I&#39;m thoughtful and patient, it&#39;ll get better.&quot; Of course, things happened simultaneously that confirmed my bias towards my ego and further bolstered my belief that I could be enough for both of us. Essentially, something bad would happen and my mind would be screaming at me &quot;break it off, break it off&quot;, but I&#39;d tell myself &quot;just wait it out, it&#39;ll blow over and things will get better.&quot; And the pattern formed, something bad would happen and I&#39;d want to break up but I kept telling myself &quot;no, it&#39;ll be fine, just wait it out, things will get better.&quot; Many times, things did seemingly get better, a lot of the time they were great! It just didn&#39;t last though, and those spans of bliss were much too far and few between. I honestly believe I&#39;d have kept this up for years had they not had the compassion for themselves and me and finally broke it off after having accepted that they weren&#39;t ready for a relationship. Only now am I realizing I may not have been ready either. There were more things at play such as my impatience prior to our dating as I hadn&#39;t been in a relationship for quite a long time before then so it seemed like I was missing my one opportunity to find my person. Also, the struggle of &quot;making things work&quot; further confirmed my bias of hard work equating to success, and hard work can sometimes be painful so this pain felt like just a symptom of the hard work I was putting into the relationship. However, a romantic relationship shouldn&#39;t be painful, it&#39;ll have struggle no doubt, but it shouldn&#39;t be painful, at least not 2 years in, and certainly not right at the start. Anyway, I just wanted to share how I related to your video in case anyone else might have had a similar experience and could relate.

Good on you, mate!<br><br>However, one common trait of these videos is that they get too, I guess you could call it &quot;guilty&quot;. CGP Grey&#39;s commentary video on TEKOI is a good example of this. He makes it clear he&#39;s made a terrible, <i>soul-rending,</i> <b><i>world-breaking</i></b> mistake and he&#39;s a moron for missing all the obvious signs and a dunce for not putting in yet another month of effort to find and correct it. You can tell he&#39;s deeply disappointed in himself and he&#39;s going to completely upend his production routine so these kinds of things never happen again. And while it&#39;s good that he&#39;s trying to improve the quality of his research, I can&#39;t be the only one who thinks he&#39;s taking his mistake a little <i>too</i> seriously.<br><br>I think I know why Mr. Grey felt that way: it&#39;s because disappointment compounds. He saw he made an error, and he was disappointed in himself. He realized it was something really simple, and he was disappointed in himself. He looked back at all the times he could have caught it, and he was disappointed in himself. And he begins writing the apology video and thinking about that whole process again and again, and thus he was disappointed in himself. What started as a mere &quot;I made a silly oopsie&quot; turned into &quot;I&#39;m ashamed and I need to change everything so this never happens again&quot;, not because his error was actually that cataclysmic, but because he looked at it over and over and felt just a little worse each time. So when the apology video came out, he thought he made for the viewers, but in reality, he meant it for himself.<br><br>Mr. Primer, I&#39;m happy to say your apology video is not very guilty. BUT. I want you to remember something the next time this happens (because it will):<br>1) It&#39;s okay. Everyone makes mistakes.<br>2) You will be more angry and disappointed at yourself than everyone else combined.<br>3) Learn from it.

I work in microbial evolution and there are examples of kin-recognition and kin-selection in asexual populations. From one perspective, even the concept of multicellularity itself is based on relatedness-mediated altruism, which for instances causes your skin cells to participate in the propagation of your gametes into the future. Their high relatedness is key here, which is visible when we contrast humans to the slime mold dictostelium, were potentially unrelated single cells sometimes aggregate to form a transient multicellular fruiting body. This phenomenon is susceptible to competing and cheating genotypes that try to end up in the spores (the cells that form the next generation) in disproportionate amounts. This suggests that high relatedness is essential in suppressing cheating to the extent that true obligate multicellularity can evolve. In us, this is effectively enforced by our germ/soma separation. <br><br>Anyway, looking forward to the video&#39;s that will delve deeper into this matter.

The logical fallacy is actually appeal to unqualified authority, and that is an important distinction. Appeal to authority is an inductive argument which is basically &quot;the expert says this, so it is probably true.&quot; The probably is a key thing since inductive arguments aren&#39;t black and white in validity or &quot;strength&quot; as it is refered to. The fallacy is when you use that argument, which can be strong if used properly, but the &quot;expert&quot; isn&#39;t actually an expert. For example, &quot;my economist doesn&#39;t think that there will be a covid vaccine soon, so it is likey that there won&#39;t be a covid vaccine soon&quot; commits the fallacy of appeal to unqualified authority since my economist doesn&#39;t really have any experience with that.<br><br>Appeal to authority can be strong and aren&#39;t a fallacy or an incorrect way of thinking, but since it is on the inductive side of logic, it has to be taken with a grain of salt.<br><br>The moral of this story is that just like the logical fallacy, listening to people who aren&#39;t qualified to be speaking can lead you astray.

I&#39;ll think of an apparent counterexample pretty easily and leave a comment describing it and basically asking &quot;what&#39;s going on&quot;. Someone (usually not the author) will leave a response to the effect of &quot;you forgot that X is true&quot; (even though my original comment was about demonstrating that X was false in a specific scenario) and often stating that X is a well-known result. The phrasing will usually cue me into an assumption that they and the author were making but which no-one stated. Turns out the actual well-known result is &quot;if Y then X&quot;, and my counterexample was a scenario where Y was false. If I&#39;m lucky, that leads into a discussion about what actually happens when Y is false and about what situations have Y being &quot;close enough&quot; to being true in order to get reasonably-accurate results from assuming Y and thus assuming X.<br><br>It reminds me of the pumping lemma, which is a well-known result in abstract computing which is notorious for people stating an incorrect version of it whenever they try to describe it informally. Naturally, I&#39;m about to try to describe it informally :p<br><br>A deterministic finite automaton is an abstract machine which can be in one of many (but not infinitely-many) states. It starts in a specific state and transitions between states based on what letters you feed it. Those states are its only form of memory, so if it&#39;s in state X and you give it letter Y, it will transition to state Z -- no matter what. There are no &quot;dead ends&quot; except in the sense that a the machine may &quot;transition&quot; to the state that it was already in. That&#39;s what defines this kind of machine.<br><br>If you feed it enough letters, the machine will have definitely hit one of its states at least twice (there&#39;s finitely-many states, so it would &quot;run out of options&quot; if it were to &quot;try&quot; to avoid duplicate states.). This means that if you were to restart the machine and given the same letters, but you skip the letters in between the machine&#39;s two visits to that one state, the machine will end up in the same place at the end of your &quot;sentence&quot;. Similarly, you can duplicate that phrase arbitrarily many times (next to the original phrase, not scattered throughout the sentence or inserted into the middle of the original) and create a sentence which again puts the state machine in the same state as your original sentence.<br><br>That threshold length will be different for each machine, but it will be at most the number of states that the machine has.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T02:29:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Pajam", "comment_text": "Thank you for this video, I&#39;ll keep it in my registered videos, because you listed the reason of mistake, and it&#39;s prone to have a skeptical mind, and lot of people need that", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T02:29:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katie Xu", "comment_text": "Alternate title: Primer&#39;s Face Reveal", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T02:29:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katie Xu", "comment_text": "Give this man a taco.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T02:26:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andres Sanchez", "comment_text": "You are amazing and a great content creator, keep learning and make more of your great content", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T02:24:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RAF74 Hawk", "comment_text": "Respect.
