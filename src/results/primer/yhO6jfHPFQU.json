So any plan I come up with need to pay off preferably 2 month before elections, so it&#39;s fresh in the people mind.

That is basically free money. So the governement got a few way to realise this plan.<br>1- Drastic measure, the government cut all services and help system other then the strick necessity (hospital for ermergency only, police, fireman, road, school) and increase taxes. They repay the dept in 5 years, but all that extra money will be used by the next government, and since they cut everywhere and made everyone life harder for 5 years, they probably won&#39;t be reelected, and the next party will rip the rewards.<br>2- moderate measure, the government do some cut here and there trimming the fat, slightly increase taxes in &quot;hiddens way&quot; like increase teh price of lottery of taxes on alcool. The dept will take 15 years to repay, but before next election their take some of the extra money saved from teh dept (maybe now just 20% is require to pay the interest) and they give back that 10% as gift, so the population is happy just before alection and might reelect them, but some people still remember the previous 4 years and might hold a grudge, and even if the party stay in power for 2-3 mandates, eventualy they will loose and the next party will rip the benenit of your hard work.<br>3- Do nothing, yeah it&#39;s a gret idea, but let&#39;s leave the other party to do it, and we&#39;ll rip the benefit from their sacrifice. That sound way better, let&#39;s keep spending and make our population happy today without caring about tommorow...<br><br>We need a system that take into consideration human stupitidy into account. a System that remove the charisma factor, the door to door leg work. The chef of nation shouldn&#39;t be the guy who kisses the most babies, or who participated in the most TV show. It shouldn&#39;t be the guy who offer give us Candy neither.

I said, you do understand the preferential voting system right?  No answer :)      Anyway, it allows us to vote for a party that may have little chance of getting in but the major parties will see that the smaller party is growing its 1st preferences ..... so, the major parties change their policies to get those votes back again, thus preventing any minor parties becoming major.  So, we basically still end up with 2 major parties but we have more opportunities to nudge them.  Edit: Just a quick addition:  Voting in Australia is compulsory.

This ultimately leads to the rise of Centrism, or what I like to call rulership of the lazy greys.

You didn&#39;t mention closed party list, parliamentarian democracies with proportional voting systems. Might be a very dumb system in an American context due to the huge diversity of the country,&#39;s interests, though, making the US hard or impossible to govern. I find majoritarian democracies from the standpoint of representativeness and not as much from the standpoint of effective governance, to be excluding of so many of its citizens. All the flaws with the systems you described are related to this being majoritarian voting systems. While they have their upsides, majoritarian systems aren&#39;t designed for being representative - I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s a key feature of majoritarianism. That&#39;s my honest opinion. <br><br>EDIT: Btw, I don&#39;t agree that the plurality system is &quot;just bad&quot;. It depends on from what criteria you judge it. It is a terrible system from the standpoint of representativeness, but so is instant runoff. Australia, as you showed, basically has a two-party system. If you value representativeness of the entirety of the population, a critique of it is legit. If you value it from the standpoint of accountability, not so much. Usually parliamentary seats in a plurality systems are based off of local districts. An MP who wants to keep his/her spot has to convince the local constituents that he/she is representing their interests well, otherwise they are going to punish the MP by simply not re-electing them. Another positive side of plurality that I can think of is effective governance. America would be a clusterfuck to govern if it didn&#39;t sacrifice some representativeness, going back to the reasoning above that you only included majoritarian systems in this video (since none of the 3 systems is perfectly representative). There are different models of democracy, and while I personally prefer a system of democracy to be representative, it might just not work well as a key principle in some institutional contexts. <br><br>I don&#39;t know man, institutional arrangements are complex.

Sometimes, if the third and/or fourth-place candidates don&#39;t reach the quota, they will need to be deemed elected by default in order to ensure the seat is filled. This angers many voters because it means that minor parties rarely make any progress in terms of being elected. It&#39;s also easy to exploit since there is no minimum votes required for your ballot to be accepted, e.g. you can choose to vote for only 1 candidate simply by writing &quot;1&quot; beside their name, if you wish. This means that if the person&#39;s &quot;1&quot; choice isn&#39;t elected, there is no &quot;2&quot; to keep the ballot alive, and so it is scrapped. This means other candidates get an opportunity to be elected rather than placing them all in order of preference.

Also, the two highest turnout elections in the last 100 years yielded less than 70% participation. Typical US elections yield far lower turnout.

Under a plurality system, the most important decision -- exactly WHO is going to represent each party -- is made during the primary... and moderate voters (who just want to live their lives in peace) don&#39;t typically vote in primaries as much as voters with a cause do. So candidates win primaries by being more extreme. Sometimes this is good, when it comes to huge parties that primarily have corporate interests at heart, but it also leads to a government that&#39;s incapable of compromise, and therefore incapable of action.<br><br>(On a side note, plurality elections are also much more expensive to hold, because you have to hold two separate elections -- the primary and the general.)<br><br>Speaking of primaries, I recently had a local primary where there were, I think, 9 candidates for my party for one office. Most of whom I liked. But I had to pick one, because... plurality. Even though that really didn&#39;t make much sense. :( And then I think the winner of that primary won with about 34% of the total vote. Which, last I checked, is not over 50%, and is therefore not a majority. RCV (as well as most other voting systems) has a simple fix for this (and small correction to the video: with RCV, you don&#39;t necessarily keep eliminating until there are only two candidates left. You keep eliminating candidates, and then re-tallying the first non-eliminated choice on each ballot, until one candidate has over 50% of the total vote. At which point they&#39;re declared the winner, because they have an actual majority of votes).<br><br>Plurality voting also contributes to low voter turnout, because... well... if your choices are: vote for the lesser of two evils, or vote for somebody who has no chance of winning and may actually be blamed for the next best choice losing the election... you&#39;re not going to feel hugely motivated to go to the polls. You may even leave with kind of a sick feeling in your stomach, which is the exact opposite of the empowered feeling a voter <i>should</i> have when leaving the polls.<br><br>Which brings me to the data problem. Voting is, in many ways, a poll. But a plurality vote really, really sucks as a poll, because the only data it can truly provide is who most of the voters felt was the lesser of the two evils. It says nothing about where the voters actually stand on issues. There&#39;s nothing to analyze.<br><br>And then there&#39;s the indirect effect that plurality voting has on society at large. As a fortysomething who grew up in the USA, I literally have never experienced a general election where the majority of ads have focused on actually promoting a candidate. The majority of ads in any major general election are all about how horrible the other candidate is. We all -- and I do mean ALL of us -- have been trained over the course of our entire lives to vote out of fear of the other party. To the point where it&#39;s almost strange to think of a world in which we could go to the polls to vote FOR a candidate, not AGAINST a candidate (at least, not without risking the spoiler effect). This keeps us from expecting too much from our elected &quot;representatives&quot; (which I&#39;m sure is just fine with them). But it also hardwires an &quot;us vs. them&quot; mentality into our brains, and has made our society even more divisive than it would otherwise be. I doubt this happened deliberately. It&#39;s just that, with plurality voting, negative advertising is just more effective than positive advertising (not to mention easier for the candidates), so it&#39;s always (ALWAYS) been used, by both of the major parties, always. With instant runoff (I&#39;m not sure about approval, just because I haven&#39;t given it much thought), it&#39;s proven that negative advertising just doesn&#39;t work as well, because voters have more than two realistic choices... and, from what I&#39;ve seen of local elections, this leads to a much saner society.<br><br>So. In short, with plurality voting, we have voters who are pressured to vote out of fear of the party they hate the most. They&#39;re rarely excited to vote, and really, everyone who isn&#39;t also a major donor to a campaign is disenfranchised, because even if they do vote, their candidate has no real accountability to them, and everybody knows it. It&#39;s also expensive, gives no useful information about where the majority of voters actually stand, and leads to divided societies.<br><br>...and I still feel like I&#39;m forgetting something.

It seems like the issues with center-squeeze and the chicken dilemma would come up less often in this or any other score voting system, since it\u2019d function like approval voting, but you\u2019d have less of an incentive to get greedy with your votes since you still probably like your second choice enough to not risk them losing to your third\u2014 especially in a grading system where you could be extra flexible with how you rate your choices, increasing the chance of someone at least rating their second honestly instead of rating them very poorly or not rating them at all.

This would have less flaw than an approval system because, for one, when a voter feels neutral about a candidate, they wouldn&#39;t care about either approving them OR disapproving them. Therefore, they would instead give their vote to their neutral opinion where before they wouldn&#39;t have voted at all. Secondly, if a voter doesn&#39;t feel confident about any of the candidates, instead of entirely abstaining they would have to go and vote to have a voice. This was incite the voters to do more research, and most likely not disapprove the candidate they feel most comfortable with -- which would then make the voters that would have otherwise never have voted instead vote for their honest preference.

What it does is run a binary election between each candidate, using the ranked values of each of the voters to determine which of the two candidates in each binary election those voters would pick over the other. This can lead to, in some cases, a rock-paper-scissors issue where there is no condorcet winner, but that&#39;s fairly rare. The up and down side of it on its own with people voting honestly is that the condorcet winner tends to be a compromise candidate. This means, in the &quot;all in a line&quot; setup, the moderate will tend to win...unless people vote strategically. <br><br>The major problem, though, is that it tends to encourage those with passion to vote strategically which is harmful.<br><br>So, I propose the following: A ranked ballot that performs both an instant runoff and a condorcet election in parallel. Independently determine the winner of these. If they agree, the agreed-winner is (obviously) the winner. If they disagree (but each has exactly one final winner), do an instant runoff/condorcet between the two! It&#39;s now the same procedure, when you have two and only two candidates. If there is a condorcet cycle (A beats B, B beats C, but C beats A in the respective binary elections), and one of the members is the winner of the Instant Runoff, then that one wins (because he&#39;s a condorcet tie-winner and obviously he was a more passionate choice overall).<br><br>Finally, if there&#39;s a condorcet cycle and the IRV winner isn&#39;t in it, the whole procedure is repeated with just the condorcet cycle and the IRV winner. (Condorcet winners win THE MOST binary elections, which may mean that, in a crowded field, the IRV winner didn&#39;t lose to all or even most of the Condorcet cycle-of-winners, just didn&#39;t win against as many other candidates as they did. It is also possible that the condorcent cycle winners got knocked off the IRV tickets early despite being second or third choices for a fair number of voters, so the IRV can turn out differently.) If the net result of the repeated procedure is ever the same as the starting point (i.e. the repeating procedure didn&#39;t work), the final round IRV winner wins on the grounds that the condorcet cycle proves there&#39;s no good compromise.<br><br>The goal here is to avoid the &quot;squeeze&quot; effect with the condorcet method and avoid the possibility of passion getting in the way of moderation from the condorcet effect. With the level of complexity here, there&#39;s no really good way to predict how the parallel elections will go, so strategy is almost impossible, and thus voting honestly is the best strategy. It will tend to reward the candidate who has the most passion behind him right up until he&#39;s so polarizing that he divides people sharply, while not having support for the compromise choice really work against him.<br><br>Let&#39;s say Trump is the super-polarizing candidate where people adore him or loathe him, Romney is a &quot;compromise&quot; candidate that passionate Trump supporters would accept if Trump really can&#39;t win, and passionate Trump-haters will either have as their first choice or will accept if the polarizer on the other side can&#39;t win, and Hillary is the super-polarizing candidate on the far side.<br><br>Condorcet will have Romney as the clear winner, assuming everybody votes honestly. If they vote strategically, everyone who cares passionately leaves Romney off, and some of Romney&#39;s voters are having to strategically vote for the polarizing candidate they hate least if they suspect this is happening. This is the issue with Condorcet.<br><br>On the other hand, IRV will be harder to predict without knowing exact numbers of supporters. But if we assume Romney is more of a spoiler for Trump than for Hillary, the first round likely has the very passionate Trump vote in second place to Hillary&#39;s passionate voters, with Romney in last. IRV second round of Trump v. Hillary will likely give it to Trump (though, again, it depends on whether Romney was more spoiler for Hillary or Trump). <br><br>Let&#39;s say it comes down to Trump winning the IRV path and Romney the condorcet path. This means now we do a binary round of Trump v. Romney, and see if the &quot;we hate Trump&quot; + &quot;we actually like Romney&quot; vote is bigger than the &quot;we love Trump&quot; vote. (Given that Romney won the condorcet, it&#39;s probably going to him. This...might not be the best example; I think I hsould&#39;ve had Bernie in there to ensure the condorcet winner wasn&#39;t automatically going to beat all other candidates in a head-to-head matchup.)", "comment_date": "2020-11-16T01:35:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Logger067", "comment_text": "Any voting system is good if votes are counted properly.

The problem is party hacks in Proportional Systems choose their favourites and order them in voting lists so the Party&#39;s choices are at the top and more likely to win and thus be beholden to the Party selector and not the voter.<br><br>This problem is fixed in Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory. Seats are assembled in regional groupings. The ACT is 5 seats in 5 districts, a total of 25 seats available.

The voter numbers the candidates in order from 1 being the most preferred to the number of candidates being the most disliked. <br><br>Anybody with the least votes is eliminated and the election officials go to who is next (No 2) on their list of choices and that vote is passed on.<br><br>Simple maths tells you that a candidate with \u2159 th of the vote + 1 has a winning &quot;quota&quot; (more than the \u2155 th votes, plus the balance of unsuccessful votes) so any candidate with the quota is then elected to a seat.

Since the extremes of any spectrum are usually sparsely populated, this should (in theory) keep as many votes as possible away from third party (which generally ends up more focused).

So the strategy to counter the Center Squeeze effect is to make sure your stance on a subject is greater than your opponents. This then shuts down the chance at a generalized candidate because it discourages trying to pander to as many people as possible.

Its only benefit is that it&#39;s easy to understand. For example, the flaws you listed would not exist in a Condorcet method for ranked choice voting, as it would guarantee a strong candidate who can beat any other candidate 1-on-1 will always win.<br><br>For your approval voting example, I think the issue is I don&#39;t know of any way to reduce strategic voting under an approval system, unlike ranked choice voting. This may be marginally better than Plurality, but you can guarantee a high dose of toxity and infighting because of that, unlike Condorcet methods which does a better job in reducing strategic voting. Ultimately, each voter&#39;s radius for that imaginary circle will be different, and a lot of strategic voting relies on convincing your constituents to draw a tighter circle to avoid giving your votes to purple (if you are orange).

Your error is that you assume that the majority would eventually shift to the third party, but even in runoff elections systems with two elections, the smaller parties play spoiler in the first go and then the two majors try to convince them to join with them so they can win the second run of the election. The same thing happens here, but the two parties do polling, realize they need to reach out because too many have strayed to a third party, and then try to find common ground to win the single election. Just because you don&#39;t see the active consolidation, doesn&#39;t mean your theory that two parties are this forced thing that is bad. If everyone got the candidate they most wanted, we would have thousands in the running, there would be no unifying person. Look how crazy it gets when the sides are split 50/50, now imagine the social in-fighting when you only can associate and relate with 2-5% of the population because we are all forming new and unique parties. Two parties are preferred, because it allows for a simple majority to win more often, and thus provides stability.

But Approvalvoting has some major flaws if we look at it from a sociological position: Some vots from some voters have more value than votes of other voters, let me explain:   A and B are politically close together, C has different ideas. So lets say out of 100 people 50 people approve A (A50), and 48 approve B (B48). Furthermore 36 approve C. (C36). They only approve the person in which cycle they are, like in the video. A would win - ok, A is the Person the most people want. It\u00b4s fair. But if we take a closer look, we find:<br>B is second, which could mean: A becomes president, B becomes vice-president. C gets nothing. Now lets look at the the votes wich only went for 1 Person: We maybe get C32, A30, B28. The 20 people voting for both A and B now elected the president and the vice-president, because their vote had double value compared to the others. If they olny voted for one, they would most likely elect just the president and not the vice-president. <br>So approvalvoting does not work if you vote more than 1 designated Person into 1 designated postition.

Pluraity is an issue in governments with top down approach, where u vote for ur president and then the cabinet is formed. In case of India pluraity has better outcome in the sense of not having only 2 powerful party (although ofcourse the candidate problem of nobody voting purple still exists, but in a large scale we dont have only two reigning party) because we have a bottom up approach. Which means that people vote for local politicians and they then go and form the government. In such a case even if there is an individual hailing from a state, he still has a chance to win if enough people approve of him and he can still have his seat in the cabinet. This gives a boost and confidence to people to vote individuals also. Also, the fact that people are forced to vote orange over purple is because there is only one candidate on the other side (green). But in a case where there are many more parties....there will be others on greens side too.

Ok so Queensland Australia held its state election on Saturday. Probably the most recent example of what you\u2019re talking about. We have two major parties, the LNP which is broadly economically and socially conservative, emphasis on regional and rural areas. The other is the Labor Party, traditionally the left-wing workers party. But in some areas third parties have big enough support to win seats.<br><br>In the inner city seats of the capital city, Brisbane, the Greens have increasing support. This election they gained an extra seat. The Labor party is being squeezed in these seats. <br><br>Something you didn\u2019t touch on is that the other two parties are able to maximise the benefit they receive from this.<br><br>We have how to vote cards. Voters can obviously go in and chose what order they would like to rank the candidates in. However, if they chose to vote for a party or even a well organised independent candidate, they will usually follow that candidates how to vote card. It tells them what order of preferences would be most reflective of that party / independents position, or sometimes, most strategically beneficial.<br><br>So the LNP who despise Greens policy, chose to preference the greens over Labor. In fact they preferences the greens second in these seats, and even preferenced Labor last.<br><br>In a close inner city seat where the fight is between the two left wing parties, the LNP are able to swing the seat based on their preference flows, not based on ideology, but on strategy.<br><br>It\u2019s pretty interesting. Most people I guess don\u2019t care. But to me what someone does with their how to vote is something I would consider before voting for them, and definitely before I follow that card. We have a far right nationalist party called One Nation here, there is a billionaire who was buying up millions of dollars of advertising but had no real policy and was lying about the policies of the government. There is an anti-vaccine party, and many independents of varying suitability. So for me, when the LNP puts Labor past, I can see no good justification for that.

Seems better, as none of the winning candidates had true majority approval in these 3 systems at all. Maybe they&#39;d win with 55% but only because there were really only 2 options, and 20 of the 55% only voted for the winner so that they&#39;d be on the winning team. Take out the representative, and the line model works perfectly, with blobs that fall on one side voting no, the ones on the other side voting yes, and in the middle 3rd, blobs that are allowed to not have a voice on this one issue, but still have a voice for other issues. If you vote for a candidate to represent you on all issues, then issue by issue, you only end up with assumed pink, or green blobs. The problem with these models is that as they are representative systems, so you always have every blob on the map, even if in reality a blob doesn&#39;t care about apples, mangos, or home architecture in the slightest. If you ONLY vote on issues that concern YOU, a third category voter emerges. One that isnt forced to be represented as a pink blob, or green blob, issue by issue, when really they aren&#39;t... the indifferent blobs, the grey blobs. In a truly democratic system, if 10 out of 100 blobs voted option 1, 70 didn&#39;t care, and 20 voted for option 2, option 2 wins. Lets say the same approval rating of voters exists in a plurality representative system for a single issue, 10%apples, 20%mangos, 70%indifferent. Now let&#39;s say that the whole apples or mangos thing never came up once during the election process, but now, mid term, the elected representative has to decide which. We never talked about invading Afghanistan before electing the representatives that made the decision to for example, as there was no reason to discuss invading a country that we haven&#39;t perceived as attacking us. Why would it possibly have come up in the election. So the representative has little to no knowledge of what the overall approval of the populace is on the issue, and he/she now has to make a decision. Now let&#39;s say that the 10%apples crowd, and another 50% of total voters who were indifferent to apples, and mangos but loved the &quot;whole kiwis are better than cherries&quot; stance that the representative took during election, and he/she was elected 60% to 40%, then now, percieved as nothing more than winner kiwis, and loser cherries, no one in the populace has any voice at all on the apples to mangos issue. The representative decides to go with apples, and now you have twice as many sad blobs as happy ones. 10%winner apples, 70%individuals, and 20% disenfranchised pro mango voters. The plurality representative system only works if you have a party for both sides of each issue facing blob-kind. A party that is solely pro apple, and also has no opinion on the housing, and one that is pro mango that also doesn&#39;t care about the housing. You&#39;d also need a pro apples, and spooky house party, a pro apples and nice house party, a pro mango,and pro spooky house party, so on and so forth into infinity. That&#39;s the only way you&#39;d never be forced to have your vote go to a party that doesn&#39;t  align with you on any given topic in a representative system.

It also can come to a three way or more party government and sometimes parties who are totally opposite come together which also doesn&#39;t really work that well. Theoretically it could also happen that two big parties only get like 45% and they would work together but to get power in the government many small parties come together to form the government, which hasn&#39;t happened yet but it is possible. <br>It is not perfect but I think it works quite well.

This means there&#39;s not a guarantee of the PM&#39;s party having a majority of seats. The first time Justin Trudeau was elected, he actually won a majority, but the latest election he was re-elected with only a minority government, which requires more cooperation and compromise with other parties to pass bills, as the elected MPs are the ones who vote on those. &quot;First past the post&quot; makes more sense when &quot;the post&quot; is something like needing at least 35% of the vote, instead of an absolute majority.\r<br>\r<br>Locally, strategic voting may differ from nationally.

So if you&#39;d prefer either Liberal or NDP over Conservative, it&#39;s more strategic to vote NDP, and this gives minority parties seats to advocate their position and vote on bills and gain support, without getting butted out of the government altogether just because they won&#39;t get PM.

Most of the time votes are cast to determine the distribution of seats in a democratic body (like a house, senate, parliament, etc.). For this you don&#39;t need a &quot;winner&quot;. The point of the voting system is to allocate seats relative to how people vote, not determine one person who wins overall. I live in a country with direct proportional voting system (where % of the popular vote directly translates to % of seats). The &quot;winner&quot; is just the largest political party at the end, but due to this system it will be very likely they will not have a majority. The largest party not having a majority means they are forced to work together with other political parties to form a government. This means that voters can vote for the party that best suits them and even if they only get a small number of votes, it is guaranteed they still get represented and their party might even become part of the coalition government, even if not that many people voted for them. No vote is wasted.<br><br>P.S. the first past the post system refers to picking representatives through small local elections and sending that representative to parliament. While in a proportional vote system you just tally up all the votes in the country and allocate seats based on the national vote.

Let&#39;s take the example of Germany, the one I know best, because I am German: There are six political parties that have a realistic chance to make the parliament: Die LINKE (left-winged socialist-leaning), SPD (social democrats), B\u00fcndnis &#39;90/Die Gr\u00fcnen (the green party, somehow leftist and ecology-centered), FDP (liberal, a little to the right and economy-centered), CDU/CSU (conservative, also called &quot;the Union&quot;, because it&#39;s actually two parties, but CSU only exists in Bavaria, CDU in the rest of Germany) and AfD (right winged, partially to the point of being extremist). The SPD and CDU/CSU are the dominant political parties with no other party ever providing the chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany (FDR) since its foundation in 1949.<br>First of all: There&#39;s no &quot;winner takes all&quot;, unlike in the USA. If a party scores more than 5% of the votes overall, they are eligible for the federal parliament. The number of seats they get roughly corresponds with their percentage, when all parties with less than 5% are left out of the picture. Until today there was no case that any of the two dominant parties had an absolute majority (over 50% of all seats). So, to form a government, they have to collaborate with each other, compromising their goals into a contract that somehow fits both partners. Usually the Union wants to coalate with FDP and SPD wants to coalate with Gr\u00fcne. But if they don&#39;t get a majority of seats, they cannot form a stable government.<br>So when you, for example, want to vote Gr\u00fcne, but don&#39;t want the CDU to take power, you can still vote your favourite party, because they would - if possible - coalate with the SPD. But at the moment, the Union is the strongest party and that would not change if you either voted green, SPD, LINKE or any other of the six big parties.

In Canada we don&#39;t vote for a Prime Minister, we vote to elect an MP for our constituency. Provinces are granted constituencies based on population. For each constituency won by a party, said party is granted a seat in the House of Commons. The party with the most seats will become the leading party and have its leader be the Prime Minister. The second largest party will become the official opposition. Having a system of governance like this means that even though one party is the leader, the other parties have a say and can represent their voters interests. This is taken to an even greater extent if the leading party fails to take a majority government, meaning they dont get at least 50% of the seats. But I imagine you can already see the problem, our system is still flawed, just on a multitude of smaller scales. Although Canada has many parties, most of which see some marginal success like the bloc de quebecois and the NDP, there are still two major parties. The Liberal and Progressive Conservative parties. Meaning that we still experience the problems of plurality, once again, on many smaller scales. Proportional representation would do away with the constituencies completely, and instead you would simply vote on who you want to win. Seats would be awarded based on the percentage of the population that voted for your party. If 36% of the population voted for your party, you&#39;d get 36% of the seats. Parties that wouldn&#39;t even win a single seat with first past the post would win seats with proportional representation. You&#39;d be encouraged to vote truthfully, even if your favourite party is a lesser one. Because with this system, they are ensured to gain at least some say in the governance of the country. And their say would be proportional to the amount of people who wanted them. This is still plurality, as you are simply voting for who you want to win. First past the post and plurality are different things, they aren&#39;t synonyms. At least not by the definitions in relation to Canadas government. Plurality would be the method by which you go about voting within a first past the post or proportional representation system of election. I dont think plurality is what the problem is, it is the system of governance. And I just realized this probably falls under the multiple winner thing you mentioned and it was a moot point bringing it up as it was technically irrelevant. <br><br>Edit: This system still wouldn&#39;t be perfect, the biggest flaw I noticed was the question of who will fill the seats in the house of commons. If you aren&#39;t voting directly for each individual MP, then how will they be chosen? Of course we could keep our first past the post system of election and instead do away with plurality.

He can also free you of depression, tears, sadness, and of a life that isn&#39;t great or fulfilling. I have found that in Christ, a happy, fulfilling, holy, and a better life. Many others have as well,  and I hope you do too. Jesus loves you so much that He died for you on the cross, taking your sin and death that once was hard to take back. Jesus forgives you of your sins and helps you to repent, and leads you into salvation which is given by the cross to accept the reward of Heaven, Jesus&#39;s Kingdom. We cannot earn it nor work for it, if you believe in the Son of Man, Jesus Christ, you will be saved. To be saved means to be saved from God himself, God&#39;s wrath lies on those who do not believe and rebel, joining the world in its evil deeds and practices. Jesus rose from the dead, showing the people that if He could conquer death, you can too. Heaven is where you conquer death. True salvation requires sacrifice, but in the end it is worth it. A life is never the same when Jesus impacts it. We are punishable by death by sin, but if you would say to the Lord, &quot;forgive me, help me to repent and sin no more and live a life for you&quot; we would do better, be better, and repent and be saved by Jesus Himself.

In a ranked voting system it pays to make your candidates as extreme along your measured line as possible without getting farther away from the center than your foe so that you still win when the centrist is eliminated and can pick up the voters on the extremes. with plurality systems, both candidates are encouraged to run as close to the middle as possible so as to ensure the other candidate doesn&#39;t take the center and win automatically. this also has the handy effect of traping extremist ideology on the fringe rather than elevating it to prominence. and preventing majorities electing horrible extremes was one of the key concerns of early democracies. plurality makes valleys in the electorate harder to maintain (though not impossible as we can see today) the larger the valley gets between your choices the more tempting entering the valley becomes for both candidates. In ranked-choice, this is not the case. you need a giant valley for the center to win and making the valley bigger is incentivized by both outside parties to draw in the extreme flanks and maximize participation. only once that valley starts winning will the sides move in. then you end up with a mountain from which the center will rule and the parties play king of the hill.<br>until of course, one side of the line manages to move the center. If the center goes left or right (on your line) not by the parties moving but by the line shifting then you need redo your system again as rushing to the extreme and activating non-participants becomes more palatable to the loser of that shift than running to the new center and it has a chance of moving the line back as well as the box of acceptable expands.  the new center also becomes harder to eliminate because the side that lost ground is now further away than before(hence why many countries switch from plurality to ranked after massive landslides or long periods of single-party rule, America is actually kind of unique in not doing so despite longterm republican rule after the civil war. then the democrats ran to the far left activating socialists of both national and revolutionary varieties from Wilson to FDR and into the cold war which in turn shifted the line underneath them back again. now republicans are trying the same trick since they lost their opportunity to lock in advantage with ranked voting only with extreme individualists instead of extreme communalists.)<br>plurality promotes centrism and unity as a clear majority is needed to win, though this breaks down if less than half your electorate is participating (hence modern-day America until trump less than 50 percent of the electorate voted in more than a decade) ranked-choice promotes extremism and subdivision of the electerate where no one likes the winner because very few people ever voted for the winner as their first choice. this happens a lot once you go beyond 3 participants and the system actively encourages people to put forward their favorite flavor rather than settle for good. the ranked-choice system often makes perfect the enemy of the good over time. <br>approval is super rare because even though it has far fewer disadvantages it looks more like cheating to the observer. it is no longer 1 person one vote but instead 1 person however many votes they want (even if they cant double vote for the same person which you never actually specified. not being specific about this could lead to saying a person choosing their favorite multiple times and make the strategy problem worse.)

And this is where analysis of different voting systems fail, the real world isn&#39;t perfect. The US is a representative voting system. In the early days this meant you selected electors that would go on to pick a candidate that they believed would be a best fit for your state. With states attempts to gain more power that shifted into a system of semi-direct democracy which shifted the country from a true &quot;Any Party&quot; system to a &quot;Two Party&quot; or plurality voting system. But back to the original point, no voter will be 100% educated on every possible policy or policy initiative, or candidate, or possibly won&#39;t even care about certain things, so by increasing our variable space for this is unnecessary and becomes an educational exercise more than a realistic possibility. Instead we can investigate why, even in these other systems, two party outcomes are still the most likely. And this comes down to preferences and not policy. Lets say that individual i chooses not to educate on candidates or precedent or past government policy and chooses to vote for the person they believe will react in similar ways to them, how most people globally vote. If the candidate is not lying about their position or fundamental beliefs then individual i has not reason not to trust that those reactions will be mostly in line with their own. This is a drastic simplification to the problem. Individual i will then believe in general that either more government, less government, or no change is the appropriate solution to the current major issues they care about or just in general. With this philosophy of voting a natural minimization problem is set up at each election. This minimization forces candidates to minimize the distance to the majority of voters until what we see today GLOBALLY is that candidates either generally fall in the category of increased government intervention or decreased government intervention with several key topics being the focus of most voters decision making. Jumping to the US election and party&#39;s specifically, The republicans and &quot;conservatives&quot; in general believe less intervention is needed and democrats and &quot;liberals&quot; believe more government is necessary in general with independents and other third party&#39;s either having generally more extreme views or just falling in between the candidates. Now if any government on earth was set up to be run by a single human and all approvals would go through that single human, yes a multi party system or more importantly a system where peoples favorite candidates are given votes in a way that isn&#39;t parasitic to others would be best. But with these large complex bodies of individuals, the party&#39;s are more as what I described being &quot;Guidelines&quot; for voters to get a feel about the general leanings of the party and each election gives them an opportunity to deliver specific information on various topics. A political party and politicians in general are very dishonest and implementing a system where literally trillions of possible policy combinations are possible it forces both the voter and the politician to do things that are physically impossible. And I mean impossible based on actual physics. The universe is not old enough to simply state all the combinations much less study and understand the intricacies of each. On top of that 2020 highlights immensely the importance of selecting a candidate who is going to instinctively act as you want them to act and not have a pre-planned response. If you believe in times of economic crisis the governments role should be to provide aid, relief, and support to individuals, and intimately interact with regulation to improve the situation then vote for someone who in general believes that. If you believe that in times of emergency the government should let go of the reigns and allow individuals to handle it then vote for someone who believes that. Complicating an optimization problem only ever makes it more difficult to solve not easier. It makes it take longer to solve.

They stem from 3 bad assumptions.<br>1: That all voters have a universal approval &#39;radius&#39; <br>2: Voters don&#39;t have a preference order<br>3. Any change in your vote is a tactical vote. (tactical votes are votes that don&#39;t represent your true preference)<br><br>In the first case where there are blobs that approve/disapprove of all 3.  Even though they might think all 3 are acceptable or none are acceptable, they still have a preference where  A &gt; B &gt; C Then giving a vote of approval to A and B is not a tactical vote. It is a truthful vote that expresses their desires more accurately than the vote of A, B, and C.  Similarly for those that don&#39;t really like any of them.  They will have a least disliked candidate.  And in the unlikely event they have truly no preference, there is no goal for them to aim for, so tactical voting is impossible for them.<br><br>In the second case, you bring up.  What the blobs are doing is choosing the radius of acceptable candidates. Which is entirely in the prerogative to do, again it&#39;s not a tactical choice because if they prefer A&gt;B&gt;C  voting for only A is not a tactical vote, it is still a truthful vote. Voting for [A,C] [B,C] [B] or [C] would be tactical votes, but they are all going to be worse votes for you to cast. Unless you have really good reason to believe that the race is only between A and B, but in which case why vote for C at all?<br><br>And the &#39;chicken dilemma&#39; becomes even less of an issue with more candidates, which is the ENTIRE reason to do an approval voting system in the first place.  <br><br>If there are more candidates and you prefer B &gt; H &gt; E &gt; Q &gt; S &gt; Z &gt; N &gt; Y &gt; J &gt; X And you choose to vote for only B, that is still a truthful vote you are a super &#39;picky&#39; voter, that&#39;s willing to discard the rest of you ability to influence the decision.  But if you say you want to &#39;hedge your bet&#39; by also voting for Z who seems to be a crowd favorite that you think has a better chance of winning.  There is no reason not to also vote for S, because if Z ends up winning, you&#39;d have been better off voting for S, and if S ends up winning you&#39;d have been better also voting for Q, And so forth up the chain.  <br><br>So yes there is a minimum threshold you have to pick, but once you pick the minimum you&#39;re willing to work with, you&#39;re better off picked everyone else above it. Unless you already know what everyone else is voting, but then you also have no reason not to vote for the true preference that expresses your preference.<br><br>Also one really nice thing about approval over rank choice. It&#39;s super simple to implement, you don&#39;t have to worry about the confusion between ranking orders and giving points/scores, you are always encouraged to give a truthful preference, especially since most people aren&#39;t that likely to play chicken with their own favorite candidates, and more likely to do it with the candidates they are less likely to prefer. And a benefit that is rarely brought up.  Given that people&#39;s preferences are nowhere near that organized across all issues, it makes it so that two candidates that seem very similar to one set of voters, are actually very different to another set of voters, which is where you&#39;ll get better decisions made from people who can see how the candidates are different than how they are the same. So sure you&#39;ll still get the 70% of the voters who just vote straight down a party line, checking all the Ds or Rs as if that began to approach their civic duty to vote.  But then the people who are more likely to evaluate the candidates more critically will be able to serve better as tiebreakers.  <br><br>Now as to why no government has it.  Well, it&#39;s quite simple, politicians hate it.  They&#39;d much rather let the party have more control over the candidates that are on the ballot, so they can force us into ever-increasing no-win scenarios which are far more exploitable for political gain.

Your second vote is for a party, the percentage of votes a party gets, determine their percentage of seats in the Bundestag. Well, partially. Now we get the political fuckery: If a party has more direct mandates (by winning voting districts) than seats they should get based on their percentage, they just get the direct seats. This lead to the two biggest parties frequently having a higher percentage of seats than they should have. This was now remedied a little in recent years.<br>The interesting result is, although a party needs to have only 5% of votes or 3 direct mandates to join the Bundestag and therefore there are multiple parties in the Bundestag, technically two parties always could have formed the german government.

You say this results in the same problem as the plurality voting method because if purple had instead put yellow as their first choice then yellow would of won the first round and then beat green in the second. But their are 2 flaws to this logic. One, if purple put yellow first that means there would be 0 purple votes because nobody wasn&#39;t purple as there first choice. That means there are only 2 parties competing for everyone&#39;s first vote hence there is no need for a runoff because it&#39;s a 2 party vote. The second Flaw is green win&#39;s because more people from the yellow group had there second vote listed as green because that&#39;s what they identified with more. The only way your logic makes sense is if you assume purple and yellow are both opposed to green. but then if that was the case then all of yellows second vote would of gone to purple and purple would of won. But that&#39;s not what happens, some have green as there second and some have purple as there second. Run off essentially makes it so that the race is narrowed down to two parties and then asks which of the two top rated parties do you like most. <br><br>Example votes : <br>Purple: 5<br>Yellow: 3<br>Green: 5<br><br>Yellow get&#39;s eliminated so now we hold a second vote saying ok yellow is out. Out of purple and Green What do you prefer most. 2 people say fine I&#39;ll vote green then since they are most similar to what I want. Meanwhile only 1 votes purple so it looks like this<br><br>Purple: 6<br>Green: 7<br><br>You see green did and should win in these circumstance. But you argue this presents a systems where purple actually could of won if people did strategic voting to get their favorite or maybe it would be better to say ensure their least favorite candidate doesn&#39;t win. But that makes no sense. there seems to be no good reason to strategically manipulate your true first and second vote because it all it can do is potentially harm you. <br><br>EDIT: I&#39;ve figured out what he&#39;s referring to with manipulating your true vote to alter result. <br>Example: lets say their are two people voting purple who prefer yellow as their second but they absolutely do not want green to win. So instead they put their first vote for yellow <br><br>Purple: 5 - 2 = 3<br>Yellow: 3 + 2 = 5<br>Green: 5<br><br>Now yellow gets into round 2 not purple. this means it&#39;s 5 v 5 plus 3 votes from purple need to be distributed. Because, it&#39;s purples second vote they are alot more likely to vote yellow for their second not green. <br><br>Yellow: 5 + 3 = 8<br>Green: 5<br><br>In this scenario changing your preferred first pick. Can change the winner to one you desire. So if your purple in this case its better to vote for yellow unless you are confident purple will win in a landslide.<br><br><br>Edit: (replace yellow with orange)", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T07:15:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Damien Walker", "comment_text": "What if we use &#39;run off&#39; system but this time the voters vote in two aspects, one is the one they want to win and the other one is the one the want to eliminate..?", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T07:14:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "J M", "comment_text": "Now do the Schulze Method!", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T07:14:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YK L", "comment_text": "Arrows impossible theorem", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T07:11:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eric Sandnes", "comment_text": "Very well explained, but why the heck the nonsense background noice?

Enduring 4 years of lies and constant attacks from the Liberals and their pack of amoral media whores would be extremely distracting for anyone.

The distance is squared, the average from all voters is taken and then inverted (I have also tried this with the raw distance without squaring, but it did not seem to make a difference). The higher that number the more satisfied the voters are. This metric may have its flaws, but i just went with it for a lack of better ideas.<br>Anyway, the result I found is the following: The average satisfaction for plurality is the lowest, followed by the average satisfaction for instant runoff.

It should be noted that while different political parties can tell their voters who to preference, the voters are not mandated to follow those requests.<br><br>For a real-life example,  the state of Queensland in Australia has just had its state elections. The Greens party of Queensland lost primary votes (first-choice votes), but they still managed to win a seat off the current state government because of the preference choices (2nd and third-choice votes). It should also be noted that mini plurality style voting can happen when only 2 political parties are running in a particular electoral seat. This primarily occurs because the bigger, more well-established parties have greater resources than smaller parties, so the bigger parties can afford to put candidates forward for more seats, smaller parties find this difficult to do. <br><br>Now for some interesting Queensland voting facts. The state can essentially be split among three primary voting areas; Northern Queensland, Central Queensland and South East Queensland. Northern Queensland is mostly small and medium towns with mining and agriculture making up a large part of that area&#39;s income, Central Queensland is similar, but with fewer and smaller towns, with mining and agriculture making up the majority of that area&#39;s income. South East Queensland has the capital city of the state, Brisbane, is the most densely populated part of the state, and gains more money from services and finance. <br><br>The current controlling party, the Labor party,  has managed quite a feat in the election just passed and has electoral seats from across the state. The current opposition party, the LNP, primarily holds the regional seats that have a heavy reliance on mining and agriculture, and the rich affluent seats on the coast. The smaller Greens party is essentially confined to South East Queensland and the city, and a party called the Bob Katter party only has seats in Northern Queensland. There was another party called one nation, but their vote tanked by an average of 8% in all the areas they had candidates in, with some seats showing 13-15% drops in votes. The leader of this party is knowing for taking huge blows like this, hiding for a few elections then coming back out of the woodwork to try again, but by the time that this could happen, it&#39;s likely this leader will be too old to run or dead, and when either of these things happens her party will die and its voters split among the various other parties. <br><br>The Katter party is an interesting one. The Labor government has formed a minority government with the Katter party in a previous election when they did not meet the seat threshold for a majority government, but the LNP is also open to working with the Katter Party. The Greens hate it, but they don&#39;t really like any party that doesn&#39;t have near-identical policies with them. The Katter Party also appeals to voters of almost every other political party in some way, so because of these factors, the Katter Party sits in the extremely favourable position of having both major and many minor parties holding it in an okay view, and having many voters holding the same view. It is for these reasons that the Katter Party looks set to be the Labor parties primary opposition in the future. I would also say that if the Katter Party becomes the primary opposition to the Labor party, the voting system will likely closer resemble a plurality system because of the Katter Party&#39;s wide voter appeal.", "comment_date": "2020-11-02T15:15:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Globaros", "comment_text": "Based Blob", "comment_date": "2020-11-02T15:15:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mr Kommentator", "comment_text": "Why then does plurality voting work in European countries?<br><br>And what about a 1 yes 1 no vote system?", "comment_date": "2020-11-02T15:14:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jisper Plomp", "comment_text": "And when the world needed him most, he returned", "comment_date": "2020-11-02T15:14:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mateusz Cetnar", "comment_text": "I assume that by multi-winner you mean a proportional system when the constituency has several mandates given proportinally to the number of received votes.

Then you have a secondary vote where you vote for one of the parties that are available for election, which is usually quite many. Every winner of the primary vote then gets a seat in the parliament, with the rest of the seats being assigned proportioally to those parties that got at least 5 percent of the votes. Theres a problem with direct mandates as assigning the remaining seats proportionally may be impossible because a party has too many direct mandates, so would be overrepresented, which leads to extra seats being assigned to the other parties to compensate this. This leads to the parliament growing basically every election, because of which germany has one of the biggest parliaments in the world.

(Each state gets 12 senators, and each territory gets 2, everyone in that state or territory regardless of their specific electorate votes for the senators from their state directly. We\u2019re usually given a comically large ballot (A2 paper maybe?) with 150ish names of potential senators on it, arranged in their parties. You can vote for the parties you\u2019d prefer, or you can vote for individual senators. You\u2019re given a minimum number of choices you have to provide (usually about 5 for parties, or 12 for individuals), though you are allowed to rank every single party or every single candidate (yes, over 150) if you want to. Then some magic happens, and someone works out how to parse the different inputs and either individuals are directly elected by having received more than 6% of the vote, or parties receive enough of the vote that they\u2019re allowed to allocate X number of senators) For some reason, it is relatively easy for minor parties and independents to pick up seats in the senate<br><br>Our Lower House, uses pretty straight forward ranked choice. Each electorate directly votes for who they want to hold their seat. There\u2019s normally 2-9 choices. (2 major parties, LNP and ALP contest every seat, the Greens will generally contest most seats, some seats have several independents, and other minor parties as well). In this set up, it is quite hard for anyone but the two major parties to win seats. Usually out of 150 seats, only 3 or 4 go to someone other than the two major parties, and going back a few years, it was even less common for minor parties to win seats. <br><br>TL;DR the promisingly mixed results you claim are the result of ranked choice come from a somewhat arcane mutant sibling of traditional ranked choice voting, our more straight forward use of ranked choice in Australia still normally elects mostly just the two major parties<br><br>Edit: the Australian senate probably most closely resembles approval, but it\u2019s still oodles more complicated", "comment_date": "2020-11-02T09:27:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viktor Suuta", "comment_text": "I am really opposed to single-winner systems for legislature assemblies, since they inevitably will leave around half of the population outright unrepresented.

A reduced dimension that dictates approval-disapproval may be irrelevant population-wise, but especially salient to a given voter (or subset of voters).

I wonder if there would be a realistic way of accounting for these sparse controversial dimensions that single-issue voters cling onto thus influencing elections, perhaps some sort of +/- attribute assigned to voters based on the polarity and magnitude of the issues relevance to the voter (though, this would depend on a greater understanding of the distribution of salience voters assign to the various dimensions of variation among candidates, something I don&#39;t think a party-representing model would be able to easily parse out due to parties issue-conglomerating tendency.)

More people need to be wary of the over-promises of IRV that&#39;s being done by its promoters. Unfortunately, this visualization here wasn&#39;t very good in this regard. If you guys want a more detailed explanation let me know and I&#39;ll write something more in-depth, but the basics is this:<br><br>A ranked preference between A and B is a binary classification. It draws a line between A and B and forces everyone to take sides. Crucially, it is the candidates who end up drawing the line, not the voters, so all ranked systems (not just IRV) work in terms of &quot;forcefully splitting the group into two maximally-competing factions&quot;. Approval voting and other cardinal methods do not suffer from this problem, as nobody has to &quot;take sides&quot; on anything.<br><br>The logic behind IRV, with its transfers until a majority preference appears, assumes there are only two big factions A and B competing in an election, and that they have an hierarchical structure with many subfactions (A1, A2..., B1, B2, ... etc.), where each subfaction is a candidate. The goal of IRV is to dismiss this internal structure and let the &quot;battle&quot; between the two big factions proceeded unimpeded. It&#39;s a system solely intended to prevent the structure within two competing groups from changing the winner. But it HAS to assume there are two groups, and only two groups.<br><br>In order for IRV to work and make sense, these factions A and B can never have any overlap, not a single voter. This means everyone votes (some order of A/B) &gt; (some order of B/A). If a SINGLE voter votes, say A1 &gt; B1 &gt; A2, then you can have all the pathologies of the system appearing.<br><br>This mechanics of &quot;two big factions&quot; A vs B renders all other ideological structure largely irrelevant, as the entire space collapses into a 1-dimensional axis defined by A and B, NOT the ideological distribution of voters. You end up with a two faction/coalition system, even if you have more parties. The parties become symbolic. The dominating voices in the A and B factions then get to split the electorate however they see fit, and this is how you get a bunch of political issues correlated, lack of options and stagnation. IRV will just hide the problem under the carpet, as it has done historically everywhere it has been implemented. It&#39;s a voting method mechanics improvement over FPTP, but it&#39;s not a political improvement. The main problem of FPTP isn&#39;t the spoiled elections, but the ideological collapse into two big factions. IRV completely internalizes that problem.<br><br>The way out of this is to adopt a voting system that is not factionalist, but instead consensus-driven. Of the ranked systems, Condorcet methods do this best. They work by finding the most significant &quot;A vs B&quot; faction split among all possible pairwise matches between candidates. A candidate who wins every pairwise matchup is the Condorcet winner, and they are in a sense the faction closest to the &quot;ideological consensus&quot;.<br><br>The systems that are consensus-driven and don&#39;t impose any faction structure are approval voting, STAR voting, score voting and other cardinal methods. They don&#39;t work by forcing people take sides. Candidates don&#39;t get to &quot;draw the line&quot; to split the ideological space however they see fit. Candidates win when they are the most representative of the consensus on issues. (This has nothing to do with centrism/moderates, because the ideological space is not one-dimensional. If there are multiple polarizing and multiple consensus issues, the notion of a &quot;centrist&quot; doesn&#39;t make sense. A centrist is a fringe position in such a scenario.)<br><br>These cardinal (and the Condorcet) methods would radically address the main issues we have we politics and democracy worldwide, on a deeper and much more important way. We desperately need to move away from factionalist methods like FPTP , top-two runoffs and IRV, as well as changing the similarly-motivated decision processes we have adopted everywhere in our societies.", "comment_date": "2020-11-02T03:11:12Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Caron", "comment_text": "I know it seems obvious, but I don&#39;t remember you actually stating anywhere that for the instant run-off the threshold for winning is at 51%.
