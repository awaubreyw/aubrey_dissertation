I presented that part a bit strangely.<br><br>At  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM&amp;t=2m14s\">2:14</a>, I say moving quickly is less efficient, giving the example of a creature moving a unit distance in half the time, using twice the energy. Then, at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM&amp;t=4m53s\">4:53</a>, I show a formula for the energy cost per unit time, which depends on the square of the creature&#39;s speed.<br><br>I gave distance per time, energy per time, and distance per energy at separate parts of the video, and that was confusing.<br><br>So here&#39;s a more explicit summary.<br>If we double a creature&#39;s speed...<br>- its distance per time is doubled (the definition of speed)<br>- its energy per time is quadrupled (because it depends on the square of speed)<br>- its distance per energy is halved: (2x distance per time) / (4x energy per unit time)<br><br>That last bullet is the &quot;efficiency&quot; from the video.

One such discovery is that polymerase is a product of it&#39;s own translation, which proves Special Creation. Another is the discovery that the cell&#39;s structural design is not generated by genetic information, but is instead passed on by reproduction from the reproductive cells of the parents (Cortical Inheritance/Cytotaxis) which traces back to the original created organism. Evolutionism is a philosophy which is contradicted by science. Over 100 yrs ago, Evolution Theory was plausible for naturalists because of their rejection of God. Biological science was rudimentary and archaic, and provided no information about the operations of the cell. Modern biology has very greatly changed what is known of genetics and biology. It has been discovered that life is based upon information which is digitally encoded and stored in a more compressed form than man&#39;s best computer compression schemes.<br>\r<br>DNA is a material medium encoded with digital information which is compressed to a level greater than man&#39;s best information compression schemes, operates with linguistics by employing phonetics, semantics, punctuation, syntax, and grammar which is more complex than any spoken human language, operates algorithmically, operates semiotically (the application of meaning to a symbol and interpretation of meaning from a symbol), is prescriptive, functional, and possesses meaning. There is no potential for the material actions of chemistry to produce information, algorithms, and linguistics. They are non-physical fundamental entities that can only be produced by intelligence because they require forward thinking - consideration of and planning for the future. These facts are proof that all life was designed by a mind of supreme intelligence. Modern discoveries about biology have overwhelmingly demonstrated that evolution is impossible and creation is a scientific fact.<br>\r<br>During an organism&#39;s development, the genetic information instructs the cell on how to turn on and off, like chemical switches, numerous sequences of information of the DNA in a supremely complex and yet to be understood orchestral arrangement of groupings and orders so as to build the structures of an organism. These patterns of genes being switched on and off is so complex that man will likely never be able to decipher it.<br>\r<br>If you want to believe in evolution because you refuse to acknowledge the existence of our creator, nobody can stop you. But doing so is to be a denialists of the discoveries of modern science because the truth is uncomfortable, and to continue to believe things which the outdated concept of Charles Darwin over 150 yrs ago could not have predicted. Believing in evolution today is as antiquated as it was to believe that flies arose from meat, or that frogs arose from mud a century prior to Darwin.<br>\r<br>Eugenie Scott, a militant anti-creationist and promoter of evolutionism has stated, &quot;If your local campus Christian fellowship asks you to &quot;defend evolution,&quot; please decline. Public debates rarely change many minds; creationists stage them mainly in the hope of drawing large sympathetic audiences. Have you ever watched the Harlem Globetrotters play the Washington Federals? The Federals get off some good shots, but who remembers them? The purpose of the game is to see the Globetrotters beat the other team. And you probably will get beaten.&quot;<br>\r<br>Atheists and agnostics in fact hate the Scientific Method and refuse to employ it. The most obvious example is the scientific knowledge of the effects of random genetic mutation. Random genetic mutation experimentation has been conducted for over 80 years. Over one million studies have been concluded, and they have provided consistent results demonstrating that random mutations are destructive and have negative effects upon organisms, both biochemically and anatomically, and do not add anything useful to the physiology of any organism, not even incrementally. What do we therefore conclude? We must conclude that mutation cannot be a mechanism for accruing change that results in macroevolution. But what does the atheist conclude despite such a massive body of evidence? They continue to claim that random mutation IS a mechanism for accruing change that results in mind-bending complexity, microscopic interdependent machinery, and macroevolution. They do this not because of science, but because their worldview requires it to be, since if evolution were true, random mutation would have to be the base mechanism for evolution since genetic information prescribes the features of organisms. In this way, they refuse to come to the correct conclusion because of their paradigm, tossing out the Scientific Method and the conclusion it would require them to accept.", "comment_date": "2021-04-17T02:29:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Glassby", "comment_text": "Please say that this is an actual game that we can play and mess about with", "comment_date": "2021-04-17T00:34:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "James Ali", "comment_text": "4 minutes into this video just subed", "comment_date": "2021-04-16T21:24:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Fitcher", "comment_text": "The irony of the m0dern world is that the snowflakes want \u201cequity\u201d even if they\u2019re weak", "comment_date": "2021-04-16T12:54:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drip Monkey", "comment_text": "This is controversial", "comment_date": "2021-04-16T01:52:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Falconer", "comment_text": "Moira?

But, sorry, this is the same s* who have been told for generations being stuck with an evolutionary theory based on the capitalistic dreams of an 18th century British economist. Here, like in 99% of the time, that evolution is explained, one important factor, which, luckily,  has been demonstrated during the last 20 years to be even more important than how strong and handsome you are, is obviated: cooperation. Cooperation with both environment and your own species. Stronger groups have demonstrated to have higher survival rates than stronger lonely individuals, that at the end monopolize resources and ended up destroying them. Red Queen theory works pretty well with hunter-pray interactions for it ANIMALS. But what about plant-animal interactions, or even, soil-plant/animal interaction, which are the majority. In these cases, the mutation rate is very different (obviously non-existing for soil and other geological resources) and a very well adapted species can end up with a whole ecosystem in a matter of few years. Balance, integration in the ecosystem, interaction intra- and inter-species are factors that have been taking out of the equation for hundreds of years. Evolution happens in millions of years, not in one generation. Adaptation is not about how much you can monopolize a niche, but how long can u use that inch and how much can you optimize that niche exploration by cooperating with another species (in many cases from different kingdoms). Complex ecosystems are demonstrated to be wey more resilient than simple networks. Is not about competition, is about cooperation. <br><br>Those factors that I mentioned are the actual game-changing in evolution. Let&#39;s move to a new century and re-think the way we teach evolution. Being stuck with the same approach for 200 hundred years does not sound very scientific. This sounds difficult to digest nowadays since we are tough to compete with everything around us since we are born.

In reality it&#39;s a 3 or 4 pronged system (food, breeding, negative health effects, and averaging) eating food does not guarantee breeding, you still need to partner up, while eating food does increase the chances of negative health effects; so for creatures which eat more than thier fair share it should increase thier death rate by decreasing lifespan. Meanwhile also in relation to food, you need to consider that creatures can actually live substantial amounts of time without food in real life and still recover from it, that does not always decrease lifespan, in fact some say it might increase it in some instances where the lack of food does not happen over long periods or frequently.<br><br>then you need to isolate genders, and add priorities &quot;food or mating?&quot;. if you ran that simulation you&#39;d find that those with the best and brightest traits end up struggling to survive and those with negative or average traits tend to just hang around and breed and eat occassionally. Meaning the population steadily decreases in quality but increases in number meanwhile truely &quot;advanced&quot; beings are a rare occurrence and while they carry on they end up breeding with a creature with worse traits at which thier traits are averaged.<br><br>There is only one direction; Down. welcome to devolution. that is &quot;de-evolution&quot;. one look at people and nature and you find that there are very rarely any truely superior specimins in any way shape and form and the traits of the majority of the population are actually generally not the best choices, they were just the most available choices that were not preoccupied with bettering themselves and then these offspring stunt the progress made by the best by forcing their offspring to be dumbed down by the massive swaths of inferior creatures. the whole &quot;natural selection always chooses the best&quot; is a load of feces.

That&#39;s a great video and an even greater algorithm you&#39;re presenting! <br>However there&#39;s one critical point in your observations: You never determine a convergence rate - or you do not tell us about it. I mean, maybe a population adapts to certain circumstances, but somehow you just stop after a while and make your statements.

No hindsight, no foresight, and no goal. It is wholly dependent on an undirected process.... a slave if you will. It doesn&#39;t &quot;select&quot; anything. It&#39;s a descriptive term for the process leading to survival of the fittest. The result of accidents. The mutation lottery is utterly and unceasingly unreliable. The notion that together these provide a mechanism that can code the DNA with the instructions for the assembly of every uniquely shaped protein required in the history of life is nonsensical. Try writing an intelligible book via an alphabet lottery. Now how about the book of life?  You need a mechanism that possesses a reasonable degree of both creative power and reliability.... if it is to drive, that is, life towards ever increasing complexity... consistently... over eons of time... from bacteria to Beethoven  It must buck the tide of randomness. And it is a relentless tide.  Proponents of the theory have, out of necessity, imbued natural selection with truly fantastical powers just to suit a worldview.. The proposed mechanism does not manifest where these never before seen but vital protein shapes come from or why they come at all. Their assembly requires the utmost in precision and new information The number of possible combinations of amino acids at each peptide bond in even a relatively short protein chain of 150 amino acids easily eclipses human comprehension....it inflates  exponentially. in an explosive manner. But if you need hemoglobin you better be absolutely dead on target with the information supplied by the DNA or the protein will not fold into the required shape, This newly acquired information  is supposedly brought about by random damage or mutations. Natural selection is impotent in this scenario.{where&#39;s a friend when you need one?}  <br>.       Random copying errors are... ready for this? ...random. . This antiquated theory belongs to the 19th century where a single cell was thought to be scarcely more complex than a blob of Jell-O  And let&#39;s not forget we need organs, body plans and staggering diversity. To buy into this wheezing fairytale, one must check reason and logic at the door. Count me out.<br>       Did I mention the Cambrian Explosion?...in reality a mega-explosion of hyper- precise information. Reminds me of an old Dracula movie. Think of it as a stake in the heart of the theory. For adherents to the theory speculation and assumption are the tools of the trade... and have little gravitas.

You mis considered concentration of food on map ! When food decreased , the map size didnot decrease , so the food conc. Decreased. This is what gave sudden advantage to sense and speed over size. But in a high food density map you dont need sight baby because there is food where ever you land especially if you were large and can consider smaller over populated friends as food also. In this scenario you need size much and you wont even need sight because all the map is food ! Sight and sensation only pays off if the target is very small and lowly concentrated. But if the target is all over the place then sensation would be a luxury and size would be vital for survivability because you are crowded with large sized preditators so you have no place to escape to unless you are large as them or you will probably end up as their food. No place to escape. All are large and the map is filled with them due to high food conc. So if you change food amount change map size also. And by the way. They all died when the conc decreased all of a sudden because they were all blind fat and slow. The low conc env. Favors sight and they were blind. So they didnot have time to evolve sight and speed so they died out of blindness mainly. Given enough time they became sensing , agile and slim. This tells us if conditions are good and food abundant you grow weak fat slow and blind. If you are stressed and challenged you will have to adapt or you will die out of weakness even if there is still some food to support a portion of previous total population.", "comment_date": "2020-08-15T17:14:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MitskiKatstoo *__*", "comment_text": "Hey can u make this a game plz this is very satisfying", "comment_date": "2020-08-15T16:43:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "International funny man", "comment_text": ".nice", "comment_date": "2020-08-15T16:09:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dukky", "comment_text": "Does anyone else keep seeing this in their recommended and has only now relented into watching it?", "comment_date": "2020-08-15T15:28:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Milos Hirko", "comment_text": "What if you do simulation with gradual increase of food.

Neo-Darwinism is nothing more then a worldview... and we are, and have been living in, the Dark Age of science for too many decades now. It is high time we put the 19th century in the rear view mirror. It is also disgraceful this antiquated theory is still being taught as fact to precious young minds. The fossil record simply does not support it... a great concern for Darwin.. Natural selection is a nice sounding term but it is nothing more than a slave to a random process.  It possesses no hind sight, no foresight, and it has no goal. It is in a permanent coma. A creature either survives or it doesn&#39;t. No one, BTW, takes issue with micro-evolution. A beneficial mutation is very rare. and it is the result of a crapshoot. Mere chance. A longshot. Supporters of the theory want you to believe that if you add enough crapshoots together you will get the body plans of every creature that ever lived. Reams and reams of hyper-precise coding that never exited before.  The coding for new, never before seen, vital function proteins, via the mutation lottery, is, as Spock might say, not rational. The demands are far, far, too great. The odds of success way, way too small.  How do you get from a forelimb to a wing?... just sustain random damage to millions of pieces of DNA over a long period of time and the all powerful OZ.... &quot;natural selection&quot;.... gets really smart. A bird in flight makes our most advanced aircraft look like clunky, lumbering toys..<br>     There are other thorny problems such as;  sudden appearance of species in the fossil record, stasis, the Cambrian Explosion, metamorphosis, irreducible complexity, the selection  of only left handed amino acids in production of proteins, highly specified and functional protein shapes from out of thin air. Untold numbers of them. Then there&#39;s the mind-boggling transition from water to land and subsequently from land to air in small increments, and to adherents of the theory the ever present need to reduce the complexity of life to that of a cartoon or a bicycle.  In the real world it is a massively challenging and ever receding horizon for researchers.  It is all about precision information and where it comes from. I unequivocally reject the idea that its genesis resides in random copying errors of the DNA. Absurdity squared. Furthermore, the mutation lottery is utterly and unceasingly unreliable. Any feasible mechanism must possess some degree of reliability in order to drive life into ever increasing complexity from bacteria to humans over eons of time.<br>       Neo-Darwinism is, in the simplest of terms...preposterous.  I couldn&#39;t care less how many people support the theory. The indoctrination has been going on now for what seems like an eternity.<br>       Whatever it once was, the theory has devolved into an entity whose primary function is to supersede the need for intelligence in the ubiquitous design we actually observe. The &quot;blind watchmaker&quot;, however, remains unemployed because...of all things... he&#39;s blind  And so is natural selection.   Whatever your beliefs may be... an atheist ,a creationist or anything in between.. this is not science. It is an agenda. It is a worldview.

As in, those that could see the farthest or had the most sense, and who also had the ability to get there quickly, survive the most. We actually see this with the dinosaurs, as large and imposing as the gigantic creatures were, smaller animals and such survived extinction instead of them after they all died, because they had the senses and speed to survive. Because of the lack of food, (apocalypse/crisis situation) slower contestants couldnt travel far enough to survive getting food, and without the amount of sense neccessary to even find &quot;prey&quot; to eat, the larger beings ran out of lives to continue with and died. However, even fast beings died because they didnt have enough sense to find food at a distance, so they ran in fast little circles until they died, wasting their time searching for food in their small circle of influence. So, your theory was right, most creatures near the middle of the simulation become sense based creatures, with gigantic circles of influence. But from there creatures needed to reach the food first, so by the end of the simulation we had only ten or so species of extremely quick, extremely sense based creatures, who lived the longest. A world where larger creatures would thrive is a smaller plane, where finding smaller beings to eat would guaranty survival and the large creatures could find them in the tighter space, not risking too much movement. You said it your self, the energy price of finding that next meal is really the nail in the coffin for larger species, which is why they are so uncommon today compared to small reptiles or mammals, and why the only kind of insects we have now, are the small kind.

So you may have a mutation for more speed but if the previous generation creates the next generation at a location further away from the food then the non speed mutation gets favoured.

All I&#39;m saying is that we need to move fast to slow down our use of carbon. I know that&#39;s hard to imagine when we all burn it up daily, including me. I live in Canada and we just had a national election that really didn&#39;t address this issue of climate disaster and carbon consumption in any substantial way. I think all politicians are scared to confront their voters with what needs to be done and just gloss over the issue. In Alberta, the province where I live, we have a Provincial government with a Premier, Jason Kenny, who will not address climate crisis. He actively fights against any policy to develop renewables of any kind. His base is conservative and completely committed to getting the tar sands crude into pipelines to the West Coast to broaden the market base for this stuff. He and Trump are cut from the same cloth, Climate crisis deniers to the core. He is even wasting tax dollars funding investigations into where climate activists in this province raise their money. He is convinced that they are being funded by groups from the US and other countries. Kenny loves globalism when it comes to the economy but not when it comes to fighting the climate crisis.<br><br><br>Californians are suffering through another year of extreme fire and that scenario is not what I want for my country. We have had huge fires here in Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario and the potential for repeated fire is frightening. Carbon that was sequestered over millions of years as deposits of oil and gas and coal can&#39;t continue to be extracted and used to produce chemicals, plastics and fuel. We need to start trying to address alternatives urgently and  cut down on the use of these resources. Burning carbon rich resources is simply not reasonable any more. There are too many people on this planet to do that any longer.  What we are doing is freeing up CO2 sequestered from an ancient atmosphere and pumping it into today&#39;s atmosphere and the globe can&#39;t handle it any longer. The Earth&#39;s biosphere and it&#39;s mechanisms buried this carbon and allowed life to evolve in an atmosphere that is supportive. We are destroying the balance and threatening future generations. Dreams of leaving this planet and starting another civilization on some other planet is not reasonable nor responsible. We, as a species, are in lock-step with our planet. We have evolved here - not on Mars.  Earth&#39;s atmosphere provides us breath and keeps us safe from deadly radiation, which by the way, threatens humans who would attempt long distance space travel. We aren&#39;t likely to crack Warp Speed any time soon so we have to deal with the conditions on this planet and stop hoping to go somewhere else to start over.", "comment_date": "2019-10-27T00:24:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephan", "comment_text": "Nah, God made the universe in 7 days \ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2019-10-27T00:01:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L Haviland", "comment_text": "Video #107: Modeling the rise of humans from bacteria.", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T22:28:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Gamesplosion", "comment_text": "I&#39;m so glad I stumbled on this", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T14:55:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrea C", "comment_text": "In 10 to 20 years we&#39;ll simulate the evolution of actual chemical to intelligent life using new kind of AI running on a quantum computer.

And so this little sim was a bit more random than what takes place in nature (I&#39;m talking about this particular context only, of course - other food items such as small mammals might in fact be spread around more randomly). A clever addition, imo, would have been to include at least two different food types - static types (which perhaps have around 0.25 Energy) and non-static types (which, although harder to find, provide our blobby friends with around 1 Energy).<br><br><br>2. Whilst it was fun to see the addition (and the effects) of speed, size and sense, another trait which I feel would have been helpful to the blobbies is inherited memory.

In other words, what I&#39;m saying is that we are now almost definitely being trained to function in a manner that is in fact counter productive to the evolution which natural selection intended for us. We - over time - will in essence wither away to become nothing but brains that rely on other species or technology to do the things we are no longer able to do on a physically level. That technology or biology is however, as we all know, not easily accessible to the general public as can be seen with mass production of goods and the genetic alteration and ownership over organics that are now being patented by large corporations like Monsanto (not Monsanto anymore i know).

Even genes are enslaved to these logical rules), and so even when starting with a small population with plentiful resources that could easily be shared by all with no hunger and poverty, the population will naturally grow up to the point were the resources won&#39;t manage to be enough for everyone.

But If I could run twice as fast but use up twice the energy, then my ratio would be (2/1)/2 = 1. The ratio of speed to energy doesn&#39;t change, so that means that traveling faster does not punish me in any way. In fact, it means I can get my food before other people do. So it&#39;s not surprising, then, that the simulated population tended towards blobs who are faster. In real life, running faster probably does not increase energy consumption by an equal amount. That would imply perfect efficiency, which does not exist in nature. Instead, it would make more sense that energy consumption increases more than speed, which would then mean that faster blobs are less efficient and that increasing speed would be very risky in a low food environment, which is pretty counter intuitive. Then, by extension, slower blobs are more energy efficient and can make longer trips, which means that they would actually outlive faster blobs in a low food environment.", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T08:02:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Submersible", "comment_text": "Just dump a billion food, that&#39;s the modern world", "comment_date": "2019-06-26T03:04:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yes", "comment_text": "So when are you going to make an .io game?", "comment_date": "2019-06-25T04:09:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wiLLiam", "comment_text": "What if it started with a single blob species and became an ecosystem with multiple species", "comment_date": "2019-06-24T23:09:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "wiLLiam", "comment_text": "Make a video like this but with environmental factors", "comment_date": "2019-06-24T22:57:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Nova Sky", "comment_text": "It bugs me this is a simulation of survival of the fittest not Natural Selection.", "comment_date": "2019-06-24T21:51:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "V\u00e4in\u00f6 Ristim\u00e4ki", "comment_text": "...

If you set the same ending conditions from different starting points I think we can in many circumstances expect different endpoints. &#39;Endpoint&#39;, of course, meaning the state of equilibrium before another change occurs, not the end or high point.<br><br>The idea I find most terrifying in this world is that the speed of climate change is happening too quickly for natural selection to solve our problems.

My point is: if one creature doesn\u00b4t need to evolve to adapt to different enviroments isn\u00b4t it a &quot;more evolved&quot; creature since it isn\u00b4t impacted by changing enviroments and thus will not die out so easily if there is a sudden change (eg sudden food shortening).<br><br><br>\u00a0There is also another point i disagree with the state that there are no &quot;more evolved&quot; creatures. Since it is possible for a creature that does everything better that another creature without a downside. In your simulation that is not possible, since every advancement has a hardcoded cost in it. But if (by natural selection) a creature evolved with for example a better mechanism for its legs that would cost less energy than the previous used one I would consider it a &quot;more evolved&quot; creature since it is both faster and consumes less energy.<br><br><br>A third thind i wondered is the size mechanism: You said if one blob is at least 20% bigger than the other one it can eat it. Wouldn\u00b4t that mean there is no perfect creature for that enviroment, since there will be an infinite size-changing to avoid the 20% &quot;breakpoint&quot; you artificially created?<br><br><br><br>Your simulation is helpful to some extend but of course very one dimensional. So i don\u00b4t think we can draw many comclusions to actual evolution.", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T19:28:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lukaz", "comment_text": "Thanks you YouTube, for once you actually recommended something I\u2019m interested in.", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T18:45:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iSemi", "comment_text": "thats really cool!", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T18:39:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Archivator-RUS", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM&amp;t=8m05s\">8:05</a>  Here it is shown several times how the second branch of evolution dies out.<br><br>Can you make two very different groups together exist for a long time?", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T18:35:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DrumtotheBass Woop", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM&amp;t=7m42s\">7:42</a> simulation of a famine in a nutshell.", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T18:31:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "74jojo", "comment_text": "Instant subscriber, very interesting.", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T18:26:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sithris Arkuro", "comment_text": "It this was a game on steam, I&#39;d buy it.", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T18:22:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blarg Blarg-Jargon", "comment_text": "Natural selection is a farce.", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T18:15:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tijana Self", "comment_text": "showed my biology teacher this video, bc its our current topic, i hope she shows our class. the only problem is were german", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T18:06:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Panini Gaur", "comment_text": "This channel may get naturally selected", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T18:04:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Good luck everyone", "comment_text": "You could have used males between the age of 16 - 25.

Are they in general comparable (with typical statistical variations of course) or will the random variations in trat changes lead to drastically different outcomes every time? To put it differently, is the selected trait combination more dependent on the randomness of the changes (maybe especially in the beginning) or the specifications of the environment.

Surprising I had different results as the males could easily catch up and mate with the slower females, the females were becoming receptive because food was spawning so close to them they could beat the fastest rivals to it.

In each simulation your high speed Blobs were able to wander for a long time around the plane, so I think bigger plane would give chance to your slower Blobs  that can reach food in the centre by sheer patience.<br><br><br>2. You may have noticed this already, but being a predator is penalized twice, which is why being a predator is not popular among Blobs. It&#39;s penalized first by a very high energy usage and penalized second time by &quot;safe zone&quot; mechanic. If Blob is small and fast it can eat food and go back home before predators catch him, once in home he cannot be harmed until the end of simulation.<br><br><br>\u00a0This could be &quot;fixed&quot; in two ways - first is to disable safe zone, once Blob is full it avoids predators until it exhausts it&#39;s energy, then it sleeps for the rest of simulation. Predators could eat sleeping Blobs unless they are too big for them. The other way is to allow predators to cooperate. First predator to touch another Blob only slows him down, second predator kills him and both of them get two portions of food from this. This would mean that predators would slowly exchange their size for numbers. There is also an option for predators to be able to eat dead Blobs from previous round (who died, because haven&#39;t found food) for one portion of food. <br><br><br><br>I must applaud your way of showing how it works, it&#39;s nicer and easier to understand Blobs running around than to simply look at statistics.", "comment_date": "2019-05-01T09:00:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simon Andersson", "comment_text": "So this is spore?", "comment_date": "2019-05-01T09:00:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicholas H", "comment_text": "Watched the whole 10 minutes through... instantly subscribed.", "comment_date": "2019-05-01T08:59:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "method", "comment_text": "they stand on the edge all watching their mates die, whatta bunch of sickos", "comment_date": "2019-05-01T08:56:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Simon Andersson", "comment_text": "Omg.

Because in nature one day the fearful ones avoid being eaten, next day the fighters keep standing and the day after those tht play dead are avoided by predators. Hence we see the development of personalities that each bring variation, each having better chances in different situations. Even your own model shows rarely one colour ending up as the only one, ike in nature there&#39;s a general direction, and exploration! And understand that the diversity of the real world, demands a hundred traits, thus will nature keep exploring alternatives. Hence people and animals are born with variations, like shy people in dominant families, 6% or something will psychopats, etc.  Your clip is so 20th century thinking in survival of the fittest and the fittest being the winner. :(  Because truly next level is how jungles collaborate between species.

It seems to me that your simulations given enough time might end up with blobs that have the best of all traits. Or if it doesn&#39;t it&#39;s because there is too even of cost benefit to make a change like the 2x speed is also 2x energy, in which case the population might tend towards pure randomness. A creature can&#39;t be the biggest, fastest, and have the most sense, or whatever other traits, because it would take a diet much larger diet to do so. This is the answer to questions creationist have like &quot;after billions of years why don&#39;t humans have invincible skin and brains as big as a car and if trees compete for light by growing tall, why haven&#39;t they reached space yet?&quot; Because an individual has to distribute it&#39;s limited energy to growing many different parts of it&#39;s body. Part of the reason dinosaurs died out is because they had enough food around them (and oxygen) to support a very large creature, but when this changed the total amount of resources an individual creature had to work with went down. And as you sort of mentioned how beneficial it is to work as a species as a group or alone effects total population size. Animals that go solo don&#39;t have to share with others and can there for be bigger, or stronger in other areas. I think it&#39;s more useful when food quantity stays constant.<br><br>I also think that creating formulas for traits or mutations that has a higher amount of variation or randomness would be interesting, because you might see two rival species form.", "comment_date": "2018-11-30T00:23:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Stevenson", "comment_text": "Love the videos!", "comment_date": "2018-11-30T00:11:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WiglyWorm", "comment_text": "I&#39;m really intrigued by the state at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZGbIKd0XrM&amp;t=8m23s\">8:23</a> where there were two distinct clumps of blob types.
