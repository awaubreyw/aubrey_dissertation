Definitely great material for teaching! I&#39;m going to recommend your videos to my peers if they need to teach evolution, I think that it is a great step-by-step exploration of some of its principles and shows to the young biologists who hate math that it is actually useful to think in mathematical terms and they should not dismiss it (I swear, even simple math is sometimes hard for some of the undergraduate students I encounter)<br><br>I&#39;d like to ask you about something, though: <br>You clearly insist in this video that the gene is the unit of selection. I understand why you do it for educational purposes here and I know that you know that there are other aspects to selection and that the &quot;selfish&quot; gene is only part of the story. I have focused on neuro-ethology these past years so I&#39;m not studying selection so much anymore and I&#39;m fuzzy on the details of the different sub-theories, but there is an argument for the individuals being the units of selection, isn&#39;t there? Genes never exist on their own, only in association with others, in viable &quot;packages&quot;. As you say, there are interactions between genes so that the same gene might result in a different version of a trait (to keep it simple like in your video) when associated with a different set of other genes. PLUS, wether a gene has a positive impact on fitness depends on the environment it and its associated &quot;package&quot; is placed in (I know, I&#39;m jumping ahead of this particular video...). We could say that wether a gene is replicated or not depends if the creature survives or not, so either the whole &quot;package&quot; survives in that specific combination, or none of those copies survive. Now since creatures actually don&#39;t replicate, but combine their genes in their offspring, this is not really true on the population level, but it means that the gene can&#39;t be the ONLY unit of selection. The &quot;package&quot;/creature is too to some extent. What I want to say, is that it seems to me like that notion of a single &quot;unit&quot; of selection is a pretty big oversimplification and that, in reality, the selection happens on multiple levels at once: the gene, the individual, the social network, etc... <br>I was just wondering what your take on this is and I think a sort of overview video towards the end of your series to explain that it is not as simple and that there are multiple, sometimes conflicting, selective forces at play, might be a really good thing.

Its a theory that there is a gene that increases attraction towards men in both sexes, which makes females more sexually driven successful and has non-reproductive siblings to help rear children. Its based on evidence that families with a gay relatives have more children. The trouble is though, no one can find the gene(s).

I am guessing your future videos will talk about kin selection and multi-level selection, I can&#39;t wait! If I may suggest a topic that blew my mind when I learned about it: *the evolution of sexual reproduction*. It is a great example of how selection does not always occur at the level of individuals, but sometimes (rarely) also at higher levels (group or species). If a mutation gives rise to a female able to reproduce asexually (aka parthenogenesis), then her reproductive advantage (x2, no need to create males) means that her offsprings will quickly outcompete all other members of the species. However, after a few thousand years, the species will eventually die out, lacking the necessary diversity to adapt to change (such as parasites). So although the mutation is beneficial in the short term and at the individual &amp; group level, it turns out to be catastrophic in the long run, at the species level. Species that happen to have mechanisms that prevent parthenogenesis are more likely to survive. Mammals are pretty good at this apparently, since there is no known parthenogenetic mammal species.<br>Again, wonderful job, looking forward to your next videos!", "comment_date": "2019-01-03T15:11:15Z", "likes_count": 17}, {"comment_by": "E=MC2", "comment_text": "I have the stupid Gene I had to watch this 3 times to understand this video", "comment_date": "2018-12-28T02:39:10Z", "likes_count": 2005}, {"comment_by": "Firenado", "comment_text": "This channel gonna blow up for sure!", "comment_date": "2018-12-22T00:58:01Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Jtktomb", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mTVtToioLg&amp;t=0m09s\">0:09</a> behold the first memer", "comment_date": "2018-12-18T21:36:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joan Martin", "comment_text": "Great video again :) Congratulations!", "comment_date": "2018-12-17T13:12:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kram1032", "comment_text": "I love this deep dive into how all this stuff works!<br>I tried simulating gene-level kin selection once (simply using the actual genetic overlap as a weight for the fitness function to accumulate the fitness of each individual as a weighted sum of the fitness of <b>all</b> the individua). The algorithm was unfortunately very slow and I bet I could have made it faster, but it worked quite nicely.<br>Doing something like that for an open, continuous simulation where the creatures don&#39;t actually have access to the DNA would probably be more difficult. Perhaps you could, like, add a certain trait dependence into the Genome, wherein, say, a the relative distance between two creature&#39;s colors (although I&#39;d go with more than three dimensions. That would be harder to actually visualize of course) can trigger behavior changes such as &quot;stay close&quot;, &quot;follow&quot;, &quot;stay away&quot;, &quot;feed&quot;, &quot;eat&quot;, &quot;fight&quot;, &quot;mate&quot;, ....<br>If actually visualizing the presence of specific markers isn&#39;t so important, one very easy way to go might be to have each of them have a random bit string as ID/part of their genome, and the overlap in bits is the proximal similarity.
