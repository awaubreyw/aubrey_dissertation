It&#39;s simple but for when there are 2 mangos on a tree just go, mango, mango, tree, to still avoid trees dropping mangos and mangos rolling further.

Collecting more than one mango like you described can have a logarithmic function attached to it in the short term but the blob should be rewarded with extra happiness for its efforts in the long term.

However it could also stockpile it, and say if it chopped a tree down, it got both the wood, AND the mangoes from it, but the tree wouldn\u2019t grow back for say 3 days. And so it had to figure out an optimal strategy to farm food from the trees, while also being selective about when and how many trees to cut down, knowing it needed wood to survive, but also knowing it could stockpile the wood, while also knowing the less trees it leaves in the Forrest, the less mangoes it has to pick the next day until the trees it had chopped down regrow. And then run it for like a \u201cmonth\u201d of its time and see what it\u2019s 1 week routine was to give it the highest happiness score while balancing what it takes from the Forrest. Maybe make 1 tree worth 2 wood but you need 1.5 wood per day to burn to stay alive. Then also maybe adding in the possibility to harvest mangoes and rather than eat them, plant the seed from it and give it a 50% chance of growing into a tree in 2 days.<br><br>I know that\u2019s a lot more coding to do, but it would be cool to see. And figuring out the happiness values to give it based on all those circumstances would be more difficult, especially things like if it\u2019s going to harvest a mango to plant it\u2019s seeds vs harvesting a mango just to eat like how would the happiness score be different? I guess it wouldn\u2019t necessarily, it\u2019s just that it would learn that taking the time to plant a seed or seeds instead of collecting more wood or mangoes might give it a higher happiness avg per day for a week because the trees it took would be replaced sooner.", "comment_date": "2021-02-04T18:22:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Teogin", "comment_text": "When it comes to wood shouldnt more wood mean more happiness?

You even accept this in one of the evolutionary videos. Using simulations to understand (and explain) these concepts is just bad epistemology as you asume certain things that are not true (or are, at least very limited). So you&#39;re basically sending any message you want and disguising it as science through cute animations and pseudoscientific non-empiric methods. You see, the problem of trying to learn things about real life phenomena based on simulations is that you end up learning things about your simulation, which is of course limited by your arbitrary assumptions. This process of learning about your arbitrary assumptions is what I like to call &quot;Epistemological Onanism&quot; and is sometimes useful, but I don&#39;t think you are not presenting this in an honest way. Viewers probably extrapolate and think that what you are saying is a good model for reality (which is not). This makes your message as dangerous as that of any shaman.<br><br>In the Supply and Demand video you trick the viewers by using rockets as something to exchange, rather than blob-food, for example. The result of this is a model that differs from most market interactions that happen throughout the planet every day, as these more often include &#39;needs&#39; and not &#39;wants&#39;. People can go without rocket toys, but they can&#39;t go without food or water or housing. As a result of this, those who offer these goods and services often have far more bargaining power than those who demand these goods and services. Ignoring this is disingenuous. You also ignore the fact that the scale of those who offer goods and services is often far bigger than that of those who demand good and services and so, again, their bargaining power is far larger. Walmart is far bigger than any individual who buys in Walmart. If 1000 people go individually to buy one apple each at a shop, they will all get a certain price X, but if restaurant goes to buy 1000 apples, it will get a lover price Y (Y&lt;X). You seem to choose to ignore these things in order to deceive your viewers. <br><br>[Note that the individuals mentioned in this example will also keep the doctor away if they repeat this every day]<br><br>In this video you present the Law of Marginal Utility. It is not surprising that you explain this economic concept using melons and not wood as this Law of Marginal Utility might not work with this other resource. If you use the wood to build a house, the first wooden boards will be used to build the walls and so will have very low utility as they will fail at protecting you from the rain and snow. However, the more wooden boards you add, the more each wooden board will contribute to protecting you from the rain and snow. The last wooden boards will be used for the roof and so each will add the maximum marginal utility. Your choice to use melons as an example to explain this law also causes a very limited interpretation of it&#39;s implications. If instead of lemons we take a certain service like watching Netflix episodes we soon realize that the fact that the marginal returns decrease does not result in limiting the use of this service but rather the oposite, one might try to archive the same level of utility as they did in the first episodes by watching more and more episodes. This explains compulsive and addictive behaviour and why people binge-watch full seasons of tv shows in Netflix, and end up feeling even more empty than when they started. We see this behaviour in the compulsive and addictive use of social media too. <br><br>I guess that in the next video you will try to convince us of how Free Market, in combination with this Law of Marginal Utility, results in the utility maximization of both the blue blob and yellow blob. However, lets stop and consider that there where many green blobs (maybe black blobs if we want to be realistic) that do not own any forest (means of production) to start with, but still have to eat melons in order to keep living. Considering all the above, the blue and yellow blobs can exploit the green blobs making them work for a very low melon-salary, in order to extract the maximum plus-value from them. The green blobs will be therefore coerced into generating wealth for the other two blobs, and will have no freedom to refuse to do, as they need these melons to prevent themselves from dying. The blue (Jeff Bezos) and yellow (Warren Buffet) balls would then become addicted to hoarding melons and wood because they would need more and more units of woods and melons in order to get the same kick/high of utility they got with the first melons and woods. This would be a far more realistic model.", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T02:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CarMello ____", "comment_text": "I really enjoy this content!

Which would make one happier?<br>Happiness scores can also increase or decrease by their value (e.g: increased health), their short-term objectives (losing weight) vs long-term finality (aiming to reverse diabetes naturally for instance), and their overal POSITIVE impact on one&#39;s life. (possibly expanding one&#39;s life span + increase self-care+ self-confidence + having a more stable life).<br>What do you guys think? It seems like a complex  way to help one make choices on the daily, major life decisions and reoriente their goals.

Aka you would never get 9 mango, when you can eat only 2, unless you would sold it.<br><br>If you would add the concept of carpentry to a database, with items, it would change everything. You can eat two mango, as it gives happiness, but if you eat only 1 you might be able to make 2 items. Which could make you richer, faster or better -&gt; prosper. But also, surplus mango could be sold, and gold gets you items.
