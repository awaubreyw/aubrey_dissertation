I think we will reach a peak, perhaps at 10.4 billion as the current estimate suggest, and then slowly decrease in numbers. <br><br>This isn&#39;t alarming, the population decline is slow if the number of children is say 1.5 per woman, it would take us centuries to reach 1 billion.

Many countries already reached it&#39;s peak and now having really rapid fertility issues that go down every year. China and Japan are already losing people, more than half milion last year. Overpopulation was a myth in 70s that somehow got popular, but due to the issues of people not wanting children, we are in the crisis of population decline, not only that, population collapse. The only thing that can save us is the technology that will make us stop naturally die and artificial intelligence. Also universal basic income, because kids are not cheap. Our planet can withstand 100x or even more of our current population, we can build underground, in the skyes, in the oceans, in the atmosphere, but I think that unless people will change culturaly, there will simply not be enough of newborns. Also UN saying that decline will start in 2080 shows you how stupid they are. Last year it was Japan, this year it&#39;s China and Korea, other countries will quickly follow. US is already like 40 years below the minimal birth replacement rate. What you have shown people can motivate them even more to have less kids, which is the opposite of what we want.

I hunted around and I found the hubble volume is about 2% of the observable universe, which is the portion of the universe we can ever reach. The hubble volume therefore contains about five billion galaxies. A researcher estimated that the average galaxy has about 100 million stars while the milky way has about 100-400 billion stars. I decided to go with 100 billion so I could do the numbers in my head. So we have a tredecillion human lives divided by a thousand to find the average human lives a galaxy can support times five billion galaxies in the hubble volumes gives me five quindecillion humans that can ever live. <br><br>That&#39;s 5x10^48.<br><br>Then if we accept the fact that humans will change in the future, things get wacky, as if they weren&#39;t already.

We can support Earth&#39;s population using 1980s tech with only the arable land in California, California of course not being the greatest place for farming. Logistically that wouldn&#39;t work, but it&#39;s something to keep in mind. With modern methods including the dry/indoor/multilevel farming meme, our population could easily be multiplied by ten without issue. The limit is not ability, rather, it is culture - desire. People increasingly prefer to live in disgusting cities with exorbitant rent over forming large families 30 miles away in cheaper, safer, quieter, lower crime areas.<br>This may be a hot take, but humanity does not suffer from resource scarcity, we suffer from local resource availability, and in the future we expect to find issues with sustainability. Millions of tons of useful product go to waste each year, these useful prodcuts could have been consumed, yet they became landfills due to logistical economic concern.<br>I cannot predict future technological innovation, but you should be able to notice the trend (as the video author seems to have done) that population estimates only ever go up. Decades ago, we thought Earth had limited carrying capacity, this mistake has been corrected. One decade ago, we thought birth rates would fall faster. In another decade, increased quality of life, medicine, wages and so on will only increase the estimated number of future people.<br>Really, there are a short number of possibilities. We could go extinct, we could reach the &quot;end&quot; of knowledge and run out of improvements to make, or we will continually see improvements which inevitably lead to increased populations.

Conceived for modern armored ground warfare and now one of the heaviest tanks in service at nearly 68 short tons (almost 62 metric tons), it introduced several innovative features, including a multifuel turbine engine, sophisticated Chobham composite armor, a computer fire control system, separate ammunition storage in a blow-out compartment, and NBC protection for crew safety. Initial models of the M1 were armed with a licensed-produced 105 mm Royal Ordnance L7 gun, while later variants feature a licensed Rheinmetall 120 mm L/44.\r<br>\r<br>The M1 Abrams was developed from the failure of the MBT-70 project to replace the obsolescent M60 tank. There are three main operational Abrams versions, the M1, M1A1, and M1A2, with each new iteration seeing improvements in armament, protection, and electronics. Extensive improvements have been implemented to the latest formerly designated M1A2 System Enhancement Package version 3 or SEPv3 and M1A2 SEPv4, respectively versions such as improved composite armor, better optics, digital systems and ammunition. The Abrams was due to be replaced by the Future Combat Systems XM1202 but due to its cancellation, the U.S. military has opted to continue maintaining and operating the M1 series for the foreseeable future by upgrading with improved optics, armor and firepower.\r<br>\r<br>The M1 Abrams entered service in 1980 and currently serves as the main battle tank of the United States Army and formerly the Marine Corps. The export version is used by the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia, and Iraq. The Abrams was first used in combat in the Persian Gulf War and has seen combat in both the War in Afghanistan and Iraq War under U.S. service, while Iraqi Abrams tanks have seen action in the war against ISIL and have seen use by Saudi Arabia during the Yemeni Civil War.", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:54:15Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "linoF1", "comment_text": "Finally a new Video yay", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:53:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruhstripe", "comment_text": "Finally\u2026 another primer video.", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:53:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheLazyDog", "comment_text": "I\u2019m first", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:53:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TiramisuTime", "comment_text": "wow", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:53:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yeet it over", "comment_text": "amogos", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:52:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dungeons And Dragons", "comment_text": "Dude Kurgestat, Rational Animations, and Primer all coming out with basically the same video at the same time is insane!", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:52:50Z", "likes_count": 21}, {"comment_by": "Dartex", "comment_text": "Hi", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:52:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Red bear", "comment_text": "Cool", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:52:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A&M Productions", "comment_text": "Hello primer", "comment_date": "2022-08-16T15:52:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Choo_Choo_Oreo", "comment_text": "0 views, 1 likes(My like), 0 dislikes.
