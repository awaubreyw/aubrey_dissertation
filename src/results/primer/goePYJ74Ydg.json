So far it seems to be designed for solo animals with limited socialization.  This of course means that altruism is nonbeneficial.  As we see in many animals who tend to be loners, they tend to not help their own kind but are actually fiercly territorial (often predators).<br><br>Now the simulation has another problem.  These blobs seem to be asexual, which completely ruins the genetics race as of course cowards and imposters would thrive, they do not need to watch out for a mate and make sure the mate also survives.  <br><br>The video recognizes that altruism is an intensely complex circumstance and it would be hard to accurately mimic it in a simulation but simulations have to be aggressively complex for it to be understandable.<br><br>For example, creatures in a simulation would need to aspire social circles.  Predators would need to be able to threat assess their chances based on strength of social circles.  You instantly can see &#39;cowards&#39; being picked off of the gene pool pretty much instantly if that was added to the simulation.  However, imposters... would still benefit from this.  Unless there is a situation where an imposter fails to meet their altruistic duty and is outed from the social circle.  Thus they&#39;d need to either sneak into a new one, or be left alone and be picked off.<br><br>Altruism is most noticed in creatures that have strong family and/or social bonds.  Pack animals.  You can argue that Altruism is most noticed by many species&#39; parents protecting young.  You could say that this isn&#39;t altruism but by the definition of putting yourself in harm&#39;s way to protect someone else at no benefit to yourself, most animals DO follow this since their offspring often leave their nest/abode, or will turn on their elders when they&#39;re older, or even will leave the old and sick to die later.  They do not have the understanding or function to care about keeping their species going, but their instincts guide social creatures to put themselves at risk if feasible to protect others for long term survival.", "comment_date": "2021-08-11T03:02:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Memester but different name", "comment_text": "What if the Cowardice running away has a chance to alert the other blob of the predator depending on how close they are to the blob.

I&#39;m a bit late to the discussion, but I thought I&#39;d share some thoughts anyways. First of all, I think in creating your &quot;green beard altruism&quot;, you&#39;ve done less to simulate altruism itself, and more to simulate in-group mentality. From your simulations, it&#39;d clear why in-group mentality is so powerful and pervasive in human psychology and behaviour, which is so cool! However, in-group mentality and altruism are fundamentally different. Secondly, I think one of the main reasons why your Pure Altruism (ie suckers) genes were culled so quickly comes down to your operationalization of altruism. in your simulation of Altruism, you failed to account for the basic fact that being nice to people makes them like you, thus increasing your reproductive chances. Higher reproductive chance would offset the cost of saving cowards and increase the beneficial aspect of saving other altruists.

Altruism would more likely lead to the blobs defending each other and maybe even causing the predators to avoid them. Which means more potential mates and young would end up surviving.<br>E.g. When chimps band together to attack an incoming threat. Some may die, but the group, including its costly young would survive. If every chimp ran away then the slow and the young would probably all get destroyed and the chimps would have to exude a lot of effort to make more young and have a next generation.<br>So even though cowardice wins in a selfish emotionless environment, it wouldn\u2019t be practical in the long run. So a purely social darwinistic society where every individual only acts in their sole self interest would probably not survive in the long term, or atleast not with a large sustainable population.<br>Maybe that could have been demonstrated if cowardice had a lower chance of reproducing than the altruism (less mates) or perhaps an energy penalty (since each individual would have to gather for themselves instead of sharing food)<br>(Not a criticism of the program, just adding my opinion)", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T18:57:33Z", "likes_count": 45}, {"comment_by": "Box Of Cereal", "comment_text": "Tomar thumbnail", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T17:01:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ThatRandomGuy969", "comment_text": "Look Tomar its you!", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T16:44:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jumbomuffin 13", "comment_text": "Makes sense why humans are cowards", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T16:33:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Axolotlofdeath", "comment_text": "why are you simulating wholesome", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T15:43:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DFNDAF", "comment_text": "make more videos", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T13:33:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Idont Care", "comment_text": "red sus", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T04:56:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Viewer 6629", "comment_text": "Yella", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T01:33:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "perrythefuzz ", "comment_text": "the green beard blobs are bolobist", "comment_date": "2021-08-06T14:17:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaiah Tapia", "comment_text": "Tomar", "comment_date": "2021-08-05T03:43:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zachary MacLeod", "comment_text": "I feel like the thing that&#39;s missing is that Blobs would notice if an Imposter isn&#39;t a True Beard after witnessing them being non-altruistic towards a green beard, and Remember That\u2122", "comment_date": "2021-08-05T02:06:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aindri\u00fa Mansfield", "comment_text": "I think it&#39;s worth considering adding in a possibility of a coward&#39;s counterpart surviving an encounter with a predator.

They always had the choice to run away and no chance of being caught during flight anyway. This would cause their gene pool to sky rocket in any case. Then altruism gets redefined as... well... not altruism. Rather it becomes, as some other commenters have indicated, a type of racial exclusivity, a selection process that in and of itself differentiated non-green beards as &quot;other&quot; and in a way, &quot;sub-human.&quot; This defeats the beliefs that altruism propagates. Just thought it could be interesting to revisit this sim and even the playing field a little. I feel that acknowledging the flaw in the system could have been as simple as adding a third sim that acknowledged a flight risk to cowards, not allowing cowardice to always win out in the end  but have its own environmental cautions.

Altruism then is other things, particularly sharing resources. Hence, this could be simulated much better by giving each blob a chance of getting fruit, e.g 30%, to simulate \u201cforaging\u201d. It must get &gt;1 piece of fruit each time. Then, impose the restriction that if a blob goes 3 days without fruit it dies. From there, code two behaviours: altruism and gratitude. Altruistic blobs would give one of their fruits to others who lack fruit, grateful blobs will not give food to just anyone who is short, but will \u201crepay their debt\u201d if their altruistic friend is short.

Violence is not altruistic. The communities that <b>actually</b> practiced altruism are Black, Indigenous, POC - racialised and other marginalised communities, that is - with our long history of mutual aid. Racism is systemic and institutional - racist policies in law and financial and power establishments, and the corresponding racist discourses in media and education institutions. Acts of altruism are, however, separate and individual - even when it&#39;s following a universal rule as in green beard altruism, the acts upon which altruism is granted is still dependent on isolated interactions, which is again why each run has a different result regardless of having a general trend or the lack thereof, because it is driven by independent interactions that are happening by pure chance. Racism does not happen by chance, and racism is systemic. Racism operates on the scopes of politics, economy, education, psychology, medicine, beauty, technology, etc, every area of life, but it is not created by a combination of factors within them. Racism is created by hundreds of years of racist policies, practices and discourse that effortlessly propogates and reproduces itself except on the rare occasions when people had modest success interrupting the cycle just momentarily. I know the channel creator is white and is therefore not expected to know a whole lot about racism let alone anti-racism. But it is an important moment where we hold ourselves accountable and start to learn about race and anti-racism, and have meaningful conversations and take meaningful actions.", "comment_date": "2021-05-22T10:37:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MonkeGotPower", "comment_text": "Red is sus", "comment_date": "2021-05-22T09:13:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Fairlamb", "comment_text": "Great video (and channel!)

One species is fully selfish and cowardly, the other is altruistic. I also think you need far less tress, so there is more competion. Each individual creature can only live 4-5 cycles at most, and no longer. Every creature needs 1 food to live but be hungry, 1 food to live and be full, and 1 additional food to procreate the cycle after.  Only getting 1 food at the end of the day will result in 1 day off your cycle max, and 0 with instant death. Every tree has 12 food on it, and some have predators. When going to get food, if 2 or more creatures go to the same tree, whoever got there first gets a choice. If they are altruistic they will divide the food equally, regardless if the creature they are sharing with are altruistic or not. They will not dive lower than 2 each, so anyone who doesn&#39;t get anything will die. If a selfish person gets there first, they take 10 food and leave the 2 for the next person to grab it. They will take it without a choice. Getting 10 food in a day will result in a 10% speed boost for the next cycle only. For tress with predators, Selfish and cowardly creatures will take 1 food and have a 80% chance of fleeing safely. Altruistic creatures will do the same, and both will remember that tree being dangerous. If 2 or more creatures go to the same tree with a predator in it this is what happens. If 1 only creature is altruistic, it will risk it&#39;s life to save the others, so it will have a 50% chance of survival and should it survive it will get 1 food, while all selfish creatures have a 100% chance to get away with 1 food, however, there is a 15-25% chance they will become altruistic themselves for the rest of their life. If 2 or more creatures are altruistic, altruistic creatures get away with 2 food each, and each have a 75% chance at getting away unharmed, the selfish ones get away with 3 food each, and a 30% chance of themself as well as their future children to turn altruistic. All creatures will once again remember which trees they encountered, though memory only lasts 1 cycle. At the end of the day altruistic creatures will tell their adjacent neighbors which tree was dangerous, so they can avoid that 1 tree the next day. If that neighbor was selfish and didn&#39;t know about that tree already, then they have a 15-25% chance of becoming altruistic. Selfish people will still avoid that 1 tree in the next cycle, however, they will not inform their neighbors. <br><br><b>****End Of My Preferred Simulation****</b><br><br><b>****My Reasoning****</b><br>Altruism shouldn&#39;t only go to altruistic people or you miss the point. I believe altruism is inherently a beneficial thing for one&#39;s own survivability, so to me all altruism, is selfish alruism whether you intended for it to be or not. Altruism helps with 2 things. One is one&#39;s own mental health and happiness. People more willing to be truly altruistic are reported to be vastly happier than people who are either not altruistic or are selfish. Human beings are also naturally sociable, even introverts, since time alone without any communication to any living being, human or otherwise, can leave us feeling depressed, and can actually cause us to lose some of our sanity. The second point is on the same terms of sociability, but this involves trust-building. Altruism breeds altruism whether we intend to or not, whether that&#39;s toward other humans or animals, building trust has many personal benefits toward one&#39;s own survivability. Whether that be directly for survive or simple to support us mentally. Animals even do this too. Certain mammals take in and care for other animals and birds, instead of eating them. Whether this has happened in their pack before or not, many animals still show tendencies to do this. Intended or not, many of those helped animals actually help with overall group survival chance. For example, birds can alert mammals that sneaky predators are nearby, while smaller mammals help gather grubs from harder-to-reach locations. Group actions make food hunting less of a daily risk and vastly more stable. Ants have been shown to save or sacrifice their own lives to protect others, regardless of species, though it is often strategic. For example a specific breed of fire ant that is capable of taking down certain larger animals when in high numbers, doesn&#39;t do so even though it would make them safer, instead they often feed, take care of and take the food intended for the predator, nearby an enemy ant hill. The predator kills the enemy ants, while choosing not to kill the ants that helped it. Doing so results in stable food and safety for all parties. True altruism will always be a little subjective, since true altruism will always help us in return, either as an individual or as a species. More people who survive and are happy and healthy leads to more minds boosting the economy and or making strides in science and medicine, making life even better, and that&#39;s true whether or not we consciously thought of that while helping. Selfishness is a pretty straightforward and static way of operating. It&#39;s ol reliable.

Some are simply disposed towards helping others, even at risk to themselves.<br>Life experience will tell you however that in order for selflessness to survive, effort, intelligence, and nuanced understanding are needed. Neither of these things are being displayed here.<br>For instance, logically those blobs should have ran away while yelling, that would have eliminated the risk to them entirerly. Also this simulation runs without any modifiers during its course. <br>In a similar real scenario, people would come together to find a solution to the problem with simply exterminating these predators being the resulting main goal. That&#39;s what humanity have done already, the cities we live in proves that. Finally, since these blobs are just simulations, they are incapable of reflecting on their actions, have an empathic response, or be driven by the flock instinct we humans share. They literally just see an existing condition and follow orders, no questions asked.<br>The sad thing is that there are some people who don&#39;t think deeply about the human condition and just takes basic simuations as gospel.

That&#39;s how we rise above being mere animals.<br>And mere animals will kill you for being different. Did you know white ravens are not actually uncommon?

The entire thing fits quite well to the model of humans, just imagine how less you&#39;re willing to help someone that&#39;s exploited you, while you and your friends both gain extra chances of success from each other&#39;s support. I don&#39;t have any links on hand, but this area has been a hot topic for as long as people have been thinking so there&#39;s plenty of studies and thought experiments out there for people who are interested that show just how absurdly powerful an altruistic species is, a famous one is the altruism prisoner experiment I definitely recommend checking it out.", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T06:39:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PythonTron", "comment_text": "The altruism gene will be  Y E L L A H", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T06:11:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Often Elsewhere", "comment_text": "You just showed how our Congress was formed in the 20th century", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T05:59:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rayden Creed", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goePYJ74Ydg&amp;t=6m30s\">6:30</a> So...

But, I&#39;ll point it out anyway... &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; refers to those who fit best. Not the fitness of the individual, but the ability to fit the role they play in their environment. Case and point, the extinction of the dinosaurs, who were generally both physically and mentally superior to just about anything else on the planet, including those who survived long after the dinosaurs were gone. The environment changed, and they were no longer fit to survive it, plain and simple.<br><br>This alone answers the question of altruism without the need for further explanation. After finishing the video, I noticed that the simulations also have some pretty glaring flaws... the &quot;coward&quot; behavior guarantees a surviving coward and a death. In addition, reproduction utilizing only a single individual renders the population total pointless, as well as prevents the mixing of genes, thus nullifying the benefit of altruism altogether.

It basically explains why the Green Beard effect isn&#39;t seen that often in nature  - basically there are two parts to being a &quot;true&quot; Green Beard 1) having a green beard 2) helping out other green beards. But the first part gets you all of the benefit, and the second part gives you all of the costs. So if these parts are coded for by different genes which are inherited seperately, the gene for having a green beard will do well, but the altruistic gene will go extinct. And it&#39;s very unlikely a single gene can code for both parts.<br><br>The reason it works in fire ants is pretty cool! What&#39;s acctually happened is that a huge section of fire ant DNA has become locked together, so all of the genes in that section are always inherited together. From an evolutionary point of view they act like a single giant &quot;supergene&quot;, which can code for loads of different things at the same time, including both parts of the Green Beard effect.

This way the Cowardice ones and the Atriusm ones both had a chance of dying, because the other times the Cowdardice ones could just be immortal. This way they would always reproduce and they were keep growing, what if there were actually the same amount of atruism ones throughout the sim but the cowardice ones just kept growing until they outnumbered them 100-0 or like 200-1. Or you could add a type of blob that is also completely clueless that the atruistic ones could actually save instead of just yelling and running away. Also I didn&#39;t see any new homes popping up, either they only had a small chance of actually getting home after each generation, or somehow the sim kept going without any rise or fall in total population. Also it takes the atruism ones longer to get home because they take the time to holler than come back, but the cowardice ones just keep coming back instantly when they see the monster.

Another thing it is missing is the adaptation of predators to their prey reactions. Predators in time will pick the selfish ones because their hunts are much more effective that way. It will completely change the survival rates of the green beard societies, because predator will avoid spending energy on green beard when he can spend half of it on hunting the selfish, without this &quot;warning&quot; bs making his hunt less efficient. If you want evolutionary examples, the neanderthals were stronger and very likely more intelligent than homo sapiens, but they were more selfish, incapable of working in groups hence it made them much easier to feed on than the organized groups of homo sapiens despite being individually stronger. It made homo neanderthal extinct in the end. We have pretty much today big example USA &quot;greed is good&quot; version slowly going into the decline.

Preference towards people of your own race and ethnicity is not racist, it&#39;s natural and healthy in order to survive. White people need to start acting as a group, helping each other instead of acting as individuals, while other races are encouraged to act in-group. Also multiracialism is a social experiment doomed to fail, when there&#39;s different groups coexisting they are doomed to go extinct until only one survives. Multiracialism failed in Zimbabwe and Haiti, with a white genocide. It failed in South Africa, where there&#39;s currently a boer genocide taking place (white farmers). It&#39;s failing in America where there&#39;s self-segregation and hatred towards other groups is flourishing (not only between blacks and whites, but between asians and blacks, asians and hispanics, hispanics and blacks,....). It&#39;s failing in Europe too. And it will fail in Japan and South Korea. Each race and ethnicity needs a land of its own where its people can thrive without being threatened by genocide. By 2060 white Europeans will be a minority in our own homelands, white people are already a minority within some cities like London and Malm\u00f6, where it&#39;s become a very dangerous environment for white people (and east asian people as well). White people are a global minority, less than 10% of the global population and we have a right to exist and preserve our rich cultures, same as any other race and ethnicity. It&#39;s okay to love your race more than other people, it&#39;s okay and healthy to have in-group preferences. If we don&#39;t want a future where white people (and other races) stop existing we need in-group preference and a land of our owns.

Racism is, broadly speaking, an outbranch of tribalism; humans have been programmed by this &quot;benefit the tribe&quot; bias to prioritize, in general, people with similarities to themselves, because that correlates to being part of the same tribe. Skin color is easy to notice, and so the &quot;benefit the tribe&quot; function in our brains laches onto it.

They run away, there\u2019s a 100% chance of a blob dying. If they yell, there\u2019s only a 50% chance, pretty straightforward. Now of course this is hard to replicate if the goal of the blob is to achieve the best \u201clife score\u201d and stay alive and repopulate, because then it won\u2019t care about the other blob, it\u2019s not going to risk a 50% chance of dying and having a worse life score, it\u2019s gonna take the 100% chance of living and just run away. Good way to combat this to actually give the blob a choice to make, is to make it so that say each day a blob survives they earn 10 life score. By reproducing they earn an extra 5. Say by eating the food they only have a 75% chance of reproducing to make it so they may have to go out and try again and risk death. Now, if the blob goes to a tree and is the one chosen to notice the predators, If they do nothing, let\u2019s say they get their +10 life score for surviving that day, but they don\u2019t get any food that day, so no chance of reproduction, and the next day if they do get food, their chance of reproduction is only 25%. So it\u2019s a bit of a penalty to have some consequence for saving themselves. Now if they notice the predator and warn the other blob, if they do get eaten, their life score is still increased by say 5, so they sacrificed themselves for a higher life score, and the next day the blob they saved now has a 95% chance of reproduction. Now if they yell and survive, their life score is increased by say 15, and the next day both them and the blob they saved chances of reproduction are both 95%. This means for the blob that notices the predators, they have a choice to make, either guarantee their survival and get their 10 guaranteed life points, and still have a chance of reproducing the next day even if it\u2019s a smaller chance, or risk themselves with a 50% chance of dying, to guarantee 5 life points and the blob they save having a higher chance of reproducing the next day, or a 50% chance of living, getting more life points for being brave and risking their life, and both them and the other blob both having higher chances of reproducing the next day. Also in this scenario the blobs goal should be a hive goal. The simulation should be run for say 100 \u201cyears\u201d and the goal of all the blobs is to have the highest average life points. However obviously a certain percentage should be put in who\u2019s only goal is their own personal life points. And each time a new blob is born they have a certain percentage chance of being either for the species, or for themselves. I don\u2019t know what the right percentage should be for that but let\u2019s say it\u2019s a 20% chance. Might be a bit high but would be cool to see the balancing point for all of these factors.<br><br>This would make it so that some blobs make their decisions based on what they want to risk or think is best for the species to get the highest amount of life points, and some make their decision based solely on their own goal of achieving the highest amount of life points. This is unique because the blobs only caring about their own life points may still yell and warn the other blob for the chance of surviving and bagging more life points than if they didn\u2019t, snd then having a higher chance of reproducing which would also get them more life points. While some trying to look out for the entire species may not warn the other blob....oh wait no they would warn them 100% of the time because if they didn\u2019t there\u2019s only a guaranteed 10 life points and then a lower chance of reproducing the next day, vs if they did there\u2019s 100% chance of a guaranteed 15 life points for the species with an even higher chance of one reproducing, with then a 50% chance of if both of them having a higher chance of reproducing. So maybe you don\u2019t make it a guaranteed death if the blob doesn\u2019t warn the other, maybe that blob still has just a 50% chance of surviving and also have a lower % chance of reproduction the next day. So then the blob looking out for the species may not warn the other blob as it would still guarantee 10 life points, and still have a 50% chance of that blob surviving. Oh but then it still won\u2019t do that because by warning them it\u2019s a guaranteed 15 points with better reproduction chance vs a guaranteed 10 with lower reproduction chance, and still with a 50% chance of the other one surviving with a lower reproduction chance as well. So maybe instead, by not warning the other person, the blob gets guaranteed to live that day, and also earns 1 food but with a lower chance of reproduction that day, say 25%, and so then had to go out the next day with a chance of dying and getting no more life points.  So the blob can either warn the other blob, guarantee 15 life points and the other blob having no chance of reproduction that day, but having a higher chance the next day, and then having a 50% chance of surviving and also having a higher chance of reproducing the next day, or not warning the other blob, guaranteeing only 10 life points, but also getting food that day giving them a chance of reproducing that day but at a lower % chance and also a lower chance the following day, with a 50% chance the other blob will survive and earn another 10 life points and have a chance to reproduce the next day as well.", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T14:09:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kobidreamer", "comment_text": "One key component that does emerge from human complexities is a measure of accountability we know as reputation.<br>People&#39;s natural inclinations manifest reputation as an important aspect of how we relate to each other.<br>Degrees of altruism vary greatly according to the level of trust between individuals.<br>Reputation is human natural social currency used to trade in trust with one another which modulate altruistic behavior.<br>Outsiders disconnected from our social awareness are thus often treated with an attitude opposite of altruism.", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T14:08:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alan smithee", "comment_text": "I discovered little shop of horrors 2 days before this vid came out so to see you using flytrap-esque creatures as the predators, as little as I care for the musical, is something.", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T14:08:38Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Skonk", "comment_text": "When Imposter Is SUS<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>AMOGUS", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T14:00:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chococraft", "comment_text": "when the imposter is sus :flushed:", "comment_date": "2021-03-31T13:58:38Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Free Hashbrowns", "comment_text": "Who could&#39;ve guessed, you give one a 100% chance of surviving every round.

I bet altruism will make sense if you gave priority on who to save based on how close it was genetically. They&#39;d save family but ignore those that are not family, direct descendant you&#39;d save for sure, distant uncle, not so much. They could also do a risk evaluation, where they&#39;d definitely sacrifice themselves for a direct descendant, but would not take a high risk for an older family member or far removed family. Only when the risk decreases does it make sense to expand altruism to include blobs outside the family. People work like this, when they can take good care of themselves they can expend more energy on immediate family, once they can take good care of family they can start expending energy on the community they belong to, once that is sorted they can expend energy on the country as a whole, then the world, then animals, then all life, then rocks and light and what have you. It seems to be going on a scale from most like me to least like me. Hence we tend to care about apes and cats before we care about squid, and squid before we care about grass, and grass before rocks and so on. Also why we care about our children more than our neighbor. If not for society/tribes being able to keep direct family relatively safe we wouldn&#39;t care about the society/tribe. Altruism, or compassion, isn&#39;t as built into humans as many of us would like to think, it just seems natural to us because many of us are borne into a society where we and our family is in no direct danger, but if we and our family was starving having compassion for that neighbor with lots of food would go out the window pretty quick. So I think altruism comes from the same basic drive to want to live that all life has, and since we can&#39;t live forever the next best thing is to make sure our genes survive, then that our community/way of life survives, then that our species survives, then that our habitat survives, and so on.

So if a Selector sees an altruistic minion in its radius (Sucker or True Beard), it will follow it home, whereas if it doesn&#39;t see anybody altruistic in its radius it will go home with someone it thinks has the altruistic trait  (True Beard or Imposter).

Is the other blob certain to survive if given warning, or does it just have a better chance? If it is certain to survive with warning, an average of 75% of blobs in coward-altruist encounters survive, so the chances of a coward surviving without warning must be less than 75% for the altruism to beneficial to the overall population.<br>(c) How do survival chances change when two altruists encounter a predator? Is one chosen at random to receive the benefit of the other\u2019s altruism, or are both blobs more likely to survive? They can\u2019t both have only a 50% chance of survival, or else the green-beard altruists would be less likely to survive encounters with each other than with cowards, and so wouldn\u2019t have taken over the population.<br>I\u2019d be interested in how tweaking all those numbers influence the overall trends, but more importantly, I think knowing the odds of survival for any given pair of blobs encountering a predator would help me understand the results better.<br><br>I\u2019m also curious what the overall population sizes are for all these scenarios.

You need to be a part of a pack to reproduce. The chance of an individual reproducing is proportional to the number of individuals left in the pack at the end of the day.<br><br>There are 2 groups of genes, each with 3 genes, each pack has just 1 from each group.

Meaning there&#39;s a 25% chance they both get away, and a 50% chance of one being eaten.<br><br>Also, if two that come together show altruism toward each other, it should reduce the chances of either being eaten, because they&#39;re actively helping each other.<br><br>Caveats, some combinations are incompatible as they would produce contradicting behavior.

The other combinations I haven&#39;t the foggiest idea of how they will fare, but I do expect 1C to not fare well at all as any time they run across an A or a B at a predator they&#39;ll die, and the smaller a pack becomes, the harder survival will be.<br><br>These modifications to the simulation are simple but should simulate many more complex and emergent things we observe in the real world. For example, the sexual reproduction of the more complex creatures that are needed to even have altruism in the first place. It&#39;ll also better simulate the fact that small populations are more vulnerable to extinction. It&#39;ll also simulate tribalism, and it allows altruists to identify other altruists without the need of colored beards. Well, sort of, it should be assumed that pack members can identify each other and thus choose to help each other.

If a (true) green beard saves a blob, then news spreads and the collective consciousness holds that green beards are now a bit more likely to save than not. And vice versa, if a green beard (imposter) does not save a blob, then news spreads and the collective consciousness holds that green beards are now a bit less likely than before to save.

For example, you could have it that if a blob sees someone being altruistic and saving a life, they have a 10% chance to change their mind and decide to also be altruistic if they have the open-mindedness gene.

Especially in the first test the altruistic blobs aren&#39;t lacking a way to survive, that&#39;s looking at the problem all wrong. You have designed the simulation so that in more possible cases the coward blob survives, so of course the crowd blobs come to outnumber the altruistic blobs. This doesn&#39;t reflect nature. The altruistic blob is taking a risk, it&#39;s taking a chance that it might die. The coward is taking no extra risk. But this coward sort of behavior also comes with a risk that your simulation does not account for. A simple way to control for that would be to give the crowd a chance that he never leaves his house and starves. When more of the possible out comes result in the death of one blob type, and you assume random chance makes all out comes likely, then of course that type of blob will die more. <br><br>Altruism isn&#39;t always purely selfless, at least not for group animals. Me doing something good for a member of my group would actually benefit me too since they&#39;re in my group. Like I share food with my brother, then later on he saves me from an animal. But each one of these blobs is entirely alone, and never has to face a different sort of threat that another blob (that they have helped in the past and therefore earned good will with) is better suited to face.<br><br>Plus no blobs can ever change in this model. The blobs that receive help have no way to then help the altruistic ones later on down the line. Behavior of basically all (learning) animals can change during the course of that animal&#39;s life based on past experiences. For example, if a blob could change from one group to the other, or know if the blob in question has saved their life before (or if their ancestor did, since each day is a generation?). Generally, a human that has multiples other humans help them over the course of their life, but refuses to give any assistance or kindness to anyone else (even family) is consider to be mental ill (narcissistic/ASPD/sociopathic/etc.).", "comment_date": "2021-03-30T13:16:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AntonArson", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t get how the cowardice behaviour prospers when it 100% of the time gets a blob eaten - while the altruistic behaviour only has a 50%/10% chance of getting a blob killed??

The main missing factor is the fact that humans are social, and in our evolutionary past, we existed almost exclusively in tribal groups. The main reason this matters is that tribal groups enable reputation. Their population is small enough that each person can memorize &amp; maintain a reputation for every other member of the tribe; And, the population is small enough that you are forced into repeated encounters with the same people (in other words, your past reputation actually effects future interactions). Reputation alone is insufficient; for example, even if every person in New York City had the biological capacity to remember a reputation for all 8 million people, there are so many people that you could be a jerk to everyone you meet and never encounter them again; as long as you moved around enough. Tribal groups solve this by limiting the number of people you can interact with, such that your reputation actually affects you in the future. This is further magnified by trusted relationships between tribal members, such that reputation propagates faster &amp; further. In other words, if you exploit my friend, your reputation with me changes just as if you had done so to me. This internal system is protected by making a behavior distinction between those inside the tribe, and those outside it. While kin selection is beneficial for the bootstrapping of such a gene-behavior, once the gene is established, direct kinship is no longer necessary. All that is necessary is stable membership to a semi-small group. This system will protect against imposters, and pressure them towards extinction. An impostor exploitation strategy will not work more than a few times, within a tribal group; and you cannot jump around between tribal groups to leverage this &quot;first-time&quot; exploitation opportunity, because people outside the tribe start with a negative or neutral reputation, and in-group preference only applies once an individual has attained a positive reputation; tribal members are born with a moderate positive reputation (i.e. kin-selection); strangers must earn it. And the degree to which in-group preference is applied to you, is proportional to the amount of good reputation that you have. So, while a stranger may have earned enough good reputation to engage in trade with the tribal members, or exchange information, they may not have enough good reputation for the tribe to risk their lives for them, or let them intermarry with them, or even to allow them to sleep overnight in the tribal encampment, etc.", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T23:43:32Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gail Gayw", "comment_text": "what if groups of blobs (with mixed aleles) had to compete with each other as well. maybe the altruistic blobs would do better then.", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T23:42:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "StalenStefan", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve already considered this test.

The answer is somewhere in the middle: We might be wrong, and save someone not altruistic, but our subconscious is good at spotting and reacting to patterns, so a non-insignificant amount of the time we will be right. Whatever this success-at-spotting-altruism (or broadly, success at spotting worthwhile/good individual) rate is, is the key that needs to be integrated.

Human behaviour isn&#39;t so simple that an individual is either altruistic or selfish. Each of us is a mixture of both and both genetics and epigenetics are at play in how altruistic we choose to be at any given point. Not to mention our views of the person we choose to help (or not to help).<br><br>The difference? We can&#39;t tell whether someone is &quot;worth helping&quot; off of their appearance. But people do use social behaviour as an indicator. So whilst we don&#39;t have green beards, each individual is to some degree a coward, to some degree a sucker, to some degree an altruist and to some degree an impostor. It&#39;s the underlying social interactions between you and others that defines which both you and they are in a given interaction. Friends can become enemies, enemies can become friends. Some people fool others to reap the benefits. We might disappoint our family, or help a stranger.<br><br>This is (unfortunately still) too complex to model in these kinds of simulations. The &quot;hidden&quot; advantage to altruism is the good will you build up with others. That people remember who helped them. And of course, in the real world, not every act of altruism comes with the risk of death or even detriment (other than time and energy spent). It is why the value of a group of people can be more than the sum of its parts. It&#39;s the beauty of co-operation, the basis for which is &quot;trancending&quot; the natural selfishness inherent to all life.

The scenario in the video, doesn&#39;t seem like altruism, but that&#39;s just my opinion. I think its similar to how ants sacrifice themselves to help the colony.

For example, I predict that altruism, though it holds on for a long time, may be decreasing under capitalist economics, since it promotes individualism and competition. Whereas under feudalism I would guess that altruism increases because almost everyone has a hard life and people may become more altruistic to do what little they can to alleviate suffering. Another factor is that when feudalism was widespread most people only interacted with people most like themselves while capitalism thrives under globalism which forces differing peoples to interact for their own benefit, even if this interaction isn&#39;t within their comfort zone.<br>   <br>I would bet that the best socioeconomic system requires a balancing of cooperation and competition, just as with biology.", "comment_date": "2021-03-29T05:05:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "nintendawesome", "comment_text": "I think maybe a better way to simulate this would be to make the altruism memetic, in that it has a chance of spreading to others who are saved.

But the thing is in the real world who encounters and who gets killed by predators or other dangers isn&#39;t random and it&#39;s clear that working together, and therefor altruism increases the odds of survival for the entire group. Since predators have better chances when working together it&#39;s also clear that prey have better chances at fending off said predators if they work together. A single teenage elephant doesn&#39;t really stand a chance against a pack of lions but have a few matriarchs and suddenly the lions are hopelessly outmatched. Furthermore, more complex social interactions give greater benefits to altruism, if you have a large tribe of say a few hundred having one person heroically sacrifice themselves to keep the rest of the tribe alive provides a much bigger benefit than having that same person sacrifice themselves to just save one other person. IRL Genes aren&#39;t just passed on by a single person splitting into 2 or 3 like a cell it requires mating so that means that at the very least to have a chance to pass on your genes you also need to attract a mate, that means you inherently need a group to pass on your genes, furthermore with large and long lived animals like humans or elephants it takes a long time to grow up and pregnancy is long and energy consuming process so for that whole time you probably need a group to help both you and the kids. That means that inherently species like humans or other large animals need a group just to reproduce so that means that evolutionary pressures force us to work well with groups and that means being altruistic.

In the real world, life is so complex that being an imposter all your life is pretty tricky, and we can shame or punish people for not doing the morally right thing when called upon. Likewise, truely good people tend to have opinions and behavioural patterns that signal themselves to others, something that an pretend-good person could imitate but only to high cost, or only when under social observation. For example, if we accidentally find that someone has been doing a kind thing or donating money all their life without making a show and dance about it, so they weren&#39;t expecting a social reward, then we have very very strong evidence that they are a true beard.

If both run and succed both survive if one failes to run or fight succesfully other stiill escapes if both fight it off the predator will hide for that day or die for well ever.

This could be simulated through either sexual reproduction (though I know you&#39;re sticking with asexual for a while now) or through a simple change in the starting demographics. A standard game of Among Us has 1 Impostor for every 4 Crewmates, so (despite the game having literally nothing to do with the sim other than a shared nomenclature) having 20% each of Impostor &amp; Sucker and 30% each of True Beard &amp; Coward would probably lead to a different result than the 25% each explored, and would open up the option of modifying the starting values for those four variations in general, starting values not withstanding. <br><br>-Social Reputation: Blobs are clearly capable of communicating with each other - it&#39;s how they warn each other of danger! What if blobs could award each other honorary &quot;Blue Beards&quot; or dishonorable &quot;Red Beards&quot; depending on how Suckers and Impostors treat other Blobs. This system could naturally be abused, with Impostors trying to give a True Beard a Red Beard or a Coward a Blue Beard, but the system generally should help benefit both Suckers and True Beards by weeding out (voting off?) Impostors, depending on how much the system is abused. <br><br>-Predator Ecosystem: Predators have to survive too! Eating Blobs is a source of nutrition and per generation, successful or unsuccessful Predators have a change of reproducing or dying, leading to a change in the predator dynamic and thus a change in the Blob dynamic. Being Noticed is obviously a bad thing for Predators, so having a separate gene that affects the change of the Predator being Noticed would be a nice (albeit unnecessary since the predator dynamics aren&#39;t what we&#39;re looking at here) touch. This would also naturally lead to a chance of the Predators going extinct - something that can be used to lead into the Half Wing Problem: a Blob Historian of the Future could ponder what use the Altruism and Green Beard genes had if there was no record of the Predators making them necessary in the first place.", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T15:29:12Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Deorman", "comment_text": "I think what the test need is a gratitude gene,<br>A cowards should have 50 % to help rather than fleeing after being helped.", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T15:24:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryder Morlong", "comment_text": "Why is there a moral life quote in hear about the suckers cowards imposters and true beards like always helping never get helped lose helping others leads to helping the people who won\u2019t help you and never helping anyone but yourself just barely living and imposter becoming what others want so you can get ahead", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T15:19:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dertres", "comment_text": "this guy really simulated racism", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T15:18:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alessandro", "comment_text": "please make videos more frequently", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T15:17:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daragh O'Sullivan", "comment_text": "gamer", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T15:13:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gaemer", "comment_text": "Red is sus", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T15:13:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "flix1738", "comment_text": "@Primer <br>What would be interesting is instead of only the alleel fractions if you could also report the absolute population size.

For instance, in countries that experienced a social collapse in its economic system, or mainly cases of parental negligence, cases of feral children were reported. That is, children raised by other animals. They noticed those children adopted the behavior of the animals that raised them. There were cases of children raised by wolves in Europe, and raised by sheep in Peru.<br><br>The genetic explanation of behavior seems to be lacking in explaining these cases. Did these children have genes that adopted a sheep or wolf behavior happening merely by mutation? Seems highly unlikely, don&#39;t you think? Altruism, at least in humans, cannot be described in the terms of genetics alone. In my opinion, the best explanation of behavior in humans and some animals is radical behaviorism proposed by Skinner, as it scientifically accurate and based on observations.

There are times when it does of course, sharing your scarce food so your neighbour doesn\u2019t starve to death. But a lot of the time it can just be a kind act performed because we are creatures imbued with a rich and complex emotional inner world. Consciousness and empathy allows us to place ourselves in the shoes of another and feel what it feels like for them to suffer, for we have suffered as well.

Being an imposter isn&#39;t strictly limited to inheritance, because every new offspring in nature spawns with a random mutation added onto the combination of its parent genes. You could try coding in imposters (non-altruists, ie. narcissists) with a 0% starting population, where non-imposters have a 10% chance of giving birth to an imposter and imposters have a 50% chance of giving birth to one. Although ultimately even the resilience towards giving birth to certain mutations is in itself controlled by a gene, which it too can be mutated. Unfortunately this level of realism can quickly become too complex for a simulation to really give any further insight.<br>2. The greatest threat to a species (before the species becomes as dominant as humans today) is not competition within the species (which in this simulation is the limited number of fruit available) but rather the threat of other species, and just the general harsh conditions of nature (which are counteracted by things like making a fire, and it&#39;s less wasteful if everyone gathers around the same fire). This is certainly the biggest contributing factor to why humans are altruistic that I know of. I don&#39;t know how best to simulate it, but one thing you could try is adding in a predator species (let&#39;s call them wolves, and the predators shown in this video snakes) which, in the simulation scenario shown in this video, behaves like blobs except they eat one blob each if the wolves outnumber the blobs at any one tree, and if there are only wolves at a tree, they eat the fruit (one way then to control their population without adding in rabbits, is if a wolf eats fruit they have only a 50% chance of survival - or make them get eaten by the snakes). If the wolves are outnumbered, they run away hungry (unless maybe if they carry a risk-taking gene, where they attack the blobs anyway, with a 50% chance of successfully eating a blob and a 50% chance of being killed, or the rate depending on the ratio). You should then also code in a follower gene that&#39;s separate from altruism, which gives a blob a 50% chance of instead of making its own choice, to go to the same tree as a random other blob (and an equivalent gene for the wolves). The altruism gene that you used in this video could then behave similarly for the wolves as it does for the snakes \u2013 if the wolves outnumber the blobs, the altruists will try to catch their attention so the wolves only manage to eat half a blob each, while the remaining blobs get a chance to escape.", "comment_date": "2021-03-28T04:31:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SuperPatcheMario - SM64", "comment_text": "Hey Primer...

This is where altruism becomes evolutionistically advantageous, because while you are indiscriminately helping both other altruists and selfish individuals, it still increases the numbers of individuals that might be altruist toward you in the future. This is also why while altruist exist, selfish people also do. Both selfish and altruist people benefit from altruists, but if the species had no altruist individuals at all, it would be more likely to go extinct.

Lifes process serves as an interpretive guide. \r<br>1. Life can be neatly summarized as a complex system comprised of evolved structures and processes optimized for exploiting an available energy of the environment. For example a plant&#39;s body form optimized for exploiting the suns energy. \r<br>2. Atomic systems possess the same general theme. Physics and cosmology is a complex system comprised of evolved structures and processes optimized for exploiting an available energy of the environment. What energy you might ask? It shouldnt be to much of a surprise to people that space is comprised of a continually re-generating energy field, corresponding to Auv in General Relativity. Matter, atoms are also comprised of energy fields and the connection between atoms and space is that atomic energy fields Tuv have evolved structures and processes optimized for exploiting this energy of the environment of space Auv.<br><br>\r<br>\r<br>You want proof?\r<br>We use atomic activity to empirically define measures of time, and time is the measurement that empirically defines contours of spacetime in General Relativity. But what you have to focus on is that atomic activity is generated by atomic forces, fundamental force, so atomic force is the empirical basis of atomic activity. Therefore atomic forces is the empirical basis for the definition of time. It can be said that time is a derivative of atomic force, because we emply atomic force generated activity to define time. \r<br>\r<br>Having said all that, ask yourself how do atoms generate perpetual atomic forces/activity? Well I&#39;m going to tell you. Atoms are energy fields of complex structure and process Tuv, that have evolved optimized for exploiting a re-generating energy field that permeates space Auv. <br><br>\r<br>\r<br>This is what science is telling us that people just haven&#39;t realized yet. This is the origin of the universal complexity and fine tuning, and why physics structures and process is nearly entirely comparable to biologys structures and processes. \r<br>\r<br>Nature given a naturally available energy potential will invent a novel circumstance of Darwinian emergence, as lifes process demonstrates.

We can model this by some simple probability equations. Let P be the starting proportion of altruistic blobs, and 1-P be the starting proportion of Coward blobs, and S be the probability of survival after giving out a warning, and let&#39;s assume the chance of either blob detecting the predator is 0.5. <br><br>So for each iteration, assuming the population is large, each Altruistic blob has a probability of P of meeting another Altruistic blob, so its chance of survival is 0.5*S+0.5*P, or the chance of it detecting the predator and survive after warning, or the chance of the other blob being Altruistic and detecting the predator, so its chance of survival is 0.5 * (S+P); <br><br>For the Coward blob, its chance of survival is 0.5+0.5*P, or the chance of it detecting the predator or the other blob is altruistic, so 0.5*(1+P). With some intuitions, we can see that the blob with greater chance of survival will dominate the population in the end, and the chance of survival for the Coward blob is always greater than that of the Altruistic blob since S&lt;=1. <br><br>The same logic can be applied to the more complex simulation, and we can let C be the starting proportion of Coward, I for Imposters, S for Suckers, and G for Greenbeards, and P for surviving after the warning. Their corresponding probability of surviving is:<br>P(C)=0.5, since it only survives if it detects the predator, and since it doesn&#39;t have beard the other side wouldn&#39;t warn <br>P(I)=0.5+0.5*(S+G)=0.5*(1+S+G), since it survives if either it sees the predator or the other blob sees it and is S or G<br>P(S)=0.5*(S+C)+0.5*P*(G+I)=0.5*(S+C+PG+PI), since it survives if it sees the predator and the other side doesn&#39;t have beard, or if it sees the predator and the other side has beard and he survives after giving out the warning.<br><br>P(G)=0.5*(S+C)+0.5*P(G+I)+0.5*(G+S)= 0.5*(S+C+PG+PI+G+S), since it survives if it sees the predator and the other side doesn&#39;t have beard, or it sees the predator and the other side has beard and it survives, or it doesn&#39;t see the predator and other side sees it and will warn him. <br><br>We can&#39;t determine the exact chance of survival, but we can compare the relative chance of survival. P(C)&lt;=P(I) since S+G&gt;=0; P(S)&lt;=P(G) since G+S&gt;=0; So Coward will go extinct before Impostors, and Suckers will go extinct before Greenbeards. I won&#39;t get into rate of change since that will involve calculus and be too much for me, but one thing we can see is if the good guys, green beard, begin to dominate the population, as G-&gt;1, P(Impostor) approaches 0.5(1+G) -&gt; 1, while P(G) approaches 0.5(PG+G) and PG &lt;=1, so the bad guys will always win in the end :(. <br><br>A quick suggestion from someone with little biology background,  maybe try including an influence parameter that if an altruistic blob saves someone, the blob being saved (or blobs in its proximity) has some chance of turning altruistic if it is not already (so we take into account education or societal stimulation/pressure).

I would say you could have a scenario (and I do think you have touched on this a little bit in the past) where you can test the trading habits between different groups on top of this model and you might have very interesting results. I think this would be more important to understanding altruism in humans as one of our core principles as a species is or economic interactions at pretty much any point of our existence. Now there is also the concept of &quot;language&quot; that can make the system super complex as well (our ability to exchange information), but one step at a time - even bonobos, crows, and racoons understand the concept of trade.<br><br>Perhaps in this model you could  explore perhaps a &quot;gene&quot; that competes a green-beard/trade variant vs. its opposing set (staying in the 4 category system, if possible). What would they trade? I don&#39;t know - but it might be a little prostitution-y, lol.<br><br>You would have the tree/predator complex you have here, but add that to a second stage in where if a moog goes to a tree with no other moogs they get two fruits, one of which they can trade. If one moog dies to a predator, the other moog can take both if they were alturistic; if one moog dies and they don&#39;t have that relationship, the other will take the chance to at least get one fruit to survive before going home. Moogs that went home with no fruits can take a chance at going and &quot;trading&quot; for a chance of survival. Altruistic Moogs w/no trading will give an extra fruit to anyone who asks, allowing that one to survive. Regular moogs with trading would &quot;trade&quot; a fruit for a 50/50 chance to spawn an extra generation of themselves with a starving moog.
