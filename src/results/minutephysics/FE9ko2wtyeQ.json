If a man and a woman both earn $10 per hour but the man works 80 hour weeks while the woman works 60 hour weeks then the man will receive $800 and the woman will receive $600. Shall we then pay the woman more per hour so that she also earns $800 per week? How is this fair? Couple with this is that women typically choose careers that on average pays less (like teaching, nursing, social work etc.). Men in those same careers earn the same as the women.

I am not going to debate this particular statistic because it is not referenced, so I cannot read the details. (Through conjecture I can speculate that one of the contributing factors is that men are more likely to hold leadership positions.)\r<br><br>Now, about that gender pay gap. I\u2019ll be focusing on a common definition of the world (Western Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand).\r<br>In these nations there is a significant difference in income based on genders. (1)<br><br>If you factor out differences in profession and work-hours, the gender pay gap persists. It shrinks, but in countries such as the U.S., after factoring out variables, women earn 0.86 relative value (0.72 before factoring variables) (2) compared to a male working the same profession for the same amount of hours, having served the same amount of time in employment. This statistic is true across the western world, as major meta-analysis shows. (3, 4)\r<br><br>There are many theories proposed to explain this discrepancy. Some state that women are less likely to ask for a raise relative to men. However, looking at the gender pay gap in STEM fields, we can see that the wage increases stagnate for women until they are in their mid 30s, before they rise at the same rate as men. (5)\r<br><br>The reason for this can be explained by employers fearing costs associated with childbirth, such as maternity leave and maternity pay.\r<br>This theory is backed up by looking at Iceland. The nation has a gender pay gap of 0.94 relative value (0.86 before factoring variables) (2), which ranks the best in the world. One of the contributing factors to this may be that Iceland has three months of maternity leave, three months of paternity leave and three months that the parents are free to divide among themselves. (6) For employers, this means that one gender does not carry a greater risk than the other. (7) Similar data from other Nordic nations further backs up this theory.\r<br><br>*In conclusion*, there may be many factors contributing to the gender pay gap. It is real, even when statistics factor out variables. It does seem that instituting equal parental leave between the sexes has strong positive effects on reducing this gap among women under 40.

I cannot see this as a violation of privacy. So what if you know my birthday is in a specific month? So what if you know I&#39;m more prone to do something? It doesn&#39;t mean you know me and that&#39;s privacy. And that, is never okay to violate in any way shape or form.<br><br><br>But there is another discussion to be had here. What is privacy? What makes something private private? And sorry to say this, that is something completely subjective. Some people think sex is a private thing, then you have pornstars. Some people think birthdays are private, then you have celebrities (and they have the least amount of privacy (when the average joe considers it) in the world). I say first define privacy to the average joe. Then make criteria for said privacy studies: How many people have to believe the same privacy criteria for it to be valued as &quot;average&quot;, those kinds of things. And do that after you have all the numbers, that way you can more effectively crunch those numbers.<br><br><br>I&#39;ll be honest, I dislike how certain studies are done then represented as facts when there are no criteria for the studies. Let&#39;s look at smoking for example. We all know that it can cause cancer (keyword, can). But how do we know that? Looking at the death-toll by cause of lung-cancer? But then you have to consider pollution and the sorts. Maybe by looking at the lifestyle of smokers? But then you have to consider what the average lifestyle is among them. And then the factors change from smoking to either the pollution or the lifestyle. And when everything is considered and there is no more room for criteria to add, you can find the numbers of death by smoking. And then you don&#39;t come with a certainty. No, what we are presented with is percentages. We know it destroys lungs, we see pictures of that. But some have lived a life that&#39;s full. And then that&#39;s called anecdotal evidence. Anomalies if you will. They are not considered because they are deemed bad evidence. <br><br>I&#39;m digressing a little but it all holds some value. My point is that studies have an inherent flaw of forgetting to give context on certain subjects because we think cancer bad. And while I agree that cancer bad, we cannot stop considering certain facts because we deem it as bad evidence. In my book, evidence is evidence. <br><br><br><br>The problem with all this is that people don&#39;t think for themselves and just go with it because title means everything to them. You could be a saint sent from heaven to tell us (first of all that it exists lol) everything that is bad for us. I want proof of that though. Irrefutable proof of that. And a study isn&#39;t what&#39;s gonna prove that to me, not without the proper context. Like, the big bang. It has been proven through calculations that I could actually follow along with. Simple reasoning for that is that there are no negative consequences for humanity from that. So we get to hear about it. The higgs boson, gravity, black holes, the sun and earth, nature, all of these things have credible studies done on them. But once it concerns cancer, suddenly context flies out the window somewhat. <br><br><br><br>And here&#39;s why this all matters to me. Humanity, is not something we can judge, objectify or place value on because we are invaluable. We are priceless. We are imperfect and different under any and every circumstance. We can find averages but that doesn&#39;t even come close to finding out who or what we are in the slightest. The only way we can do that is by living. And if you need smoking or alcohol or any other substance, religion, ideology or what have you, by all means live. You are not my boss but guess what, neither am I yours. So stop believing studies because it came from a scientist, they&#39;re human too, they could be wrong and not know it. Just live your life the way you feel like doing so. As long as it doesn&#39;t negatively impact another&#39;s life too much, I&#39;m okay with it. <br><br><br><br>Now to end off, let me clarify what I mean by negatively impact and I&#39;ll be done here. I mean that you shouldn&#39;t physically harm others unless they do that to you. Even then, try not to. An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. I&#39;m too far gone for that lesson, you may not be. When it comes to emotional damage. Truth can hurt too so that&#39;s a little more vague. As long as you don&#39;t manupilate others, I say do what you feel is right. I could say don&#39;t bully people, but are you gonna listen to that? I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not gonna. Not even on purpose either. I say go ahead but make sure that you don&#39;t make someone kill themselves. And that&#39;s a whole different argument. If you&#39;re willing to have that argument, I&#39;m right here so ask away. As for mental damage, emotional damage is somewhat linked to that as I eluded to with the bullying comment. This is a no go from me. If you harm someone in any way mentally, you are the bad guy. Not necessarily a bad person, just that it&#39;s your fault. You can choose to do with that what you will but I really believe you need to own up to that and take responsibility. To give an example, I know way too many children that turned into adults at age 16 or lower because of household troubles. I know I did. That&#39;s not when you should be an adult, not in this day and age. Anyway, I believe that will do for now.<br><br><br>TL;DR, live how you want and don&#39;t let others tell you how to. And studies are not always truth, merely satisfaction for a set of truths that can form a lie together if not handled carefully.<br><br><br>I sincerely hope that if you read all of this, you at least try to understand me. And if you still don&#39;t understand, ask me. I&#39;m not here to attack anyone or anything. I merely wanted to point out a flaw and state my reason for why it is a flaw. The privacy thing was merely a catalyst for it.
