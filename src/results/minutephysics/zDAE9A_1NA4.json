(1) If it slows down quickly, strong forces are applied to the cube, prompting it to tear. (2) If it slows slowly, the cube stays intact. (3) If the cube is overly brittle, then the cube should leave the portal in the form of dust, as any breaking applied to any part of the cube causes it to tear into atomically thin pieces. Depending on the material, it might come out as (VERY) thin slices. (4) if the cube is extremely strong, it should stay in one piece, in the same way as when passing at slow speeds.", "comment_date": "2022-08-24T13:36:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yeetus Fetus", "comment_text": "ive never looked into wether it actually would work like it (its far too complicated for me to get my head around it) but ive alwys imagined portals like just passing something through a hole in a wall. not sure if this actually works though.", "comment_date": "2022-08-24T10:41:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ngetee ngetee", "comment_text": "So I&#39;m gonna be 100% honest, for the portals I don&#39;t think of them as an object in itself, and instead a hole in space similar to an infinitely short straw or for this case let&#39;s say the big hoop part in a hoopla hoop, where orange would be one side of the hoopla hoop, and blue on the other with an infinitely short hole so that your not just kinda chopped up at the atomic level", "comment_date": "2022-08-24T07:46:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Copperhead5858", "comment_text": "What if the piston started pushing itself into the blue portal from the orange portal", "comment_date": "2022-08-24T05:49:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MissTrillium", "comment_text": "With moving portals, you could take a horizontal portal on a slab, rotate it, and then stick the blue one into it.

I think succesful teleportation of moving portals would only work on very low speeds, this will connect to another theory i have below...<br><br>I also think if this was possible, the object the portal was shot at would become close to infinite mass, and would stop moving (imagine what happened to the earth moon orbits if this was right)... This is just my guess, as to how the universe is balanced out...<br><br>Dont know what else to say...

I will try to explain it a bit more detailed, but i&#39;m not sure how much of my explanation will be understandable by anyone, including me in the end. The portals are like holes into the world. They connect two (or possibly more) places, by making them the same. There was a theory about wormholes that explained it with two dots on a sheet of paper. they can be connected with a straight line. But this line is the fastest connection between the dots only in the second dimension. The sheet of paper is in the third dimension, so we can also fold the paper, so the first dot is directly behind the second one. In 2D the straight line, that is now curved form our perspective, is still the fastest connection. But the dots are also directly behind each other. We can use a needle to pierce trough both, creating connection between them. I don&#39;t exactly know how non-Euclidean space works, so i don&#39;t know if it is the same thing, but portals should be something like the connection between the two dots, just in 3D and higher dimension. If the box is put on solid ground, and a portal is lowered on top of it, the outcome should depend on the position of the portal-exit. If the portal is on the ground, the box will just appear from top to bottom in the other side, and stay on top of the portal, after all, the box did not have a starting speed, so 0, the portal was moving, but it does not transfer momentum, because it&#39;s not physical thing, its like a bridge, the fact that you are on a bridge doesn&#39;t mean you are moving. So if the direction of the gravity is the same for the box in both ends, it should just stand on top of the portal. If the portal closes with even the smallest part of the box still on the other side, this part is cut clean, right between the connection of the molecules. No material is destroyed in the process. If the box is thrown, it keeps all of its momentum, but each part that passes trough the portal is now influenced by the new direction of gravity. If the box has no starting speed, and a portal opens beneath it, and the portal on the other side is also on the floor, the box will start gaining momentum, because the gravity of each side is influencing it, and drags it down. At the beginning, the box will have almost no momentum, but it will gain more as time goes on, until it flies high enough to interact with wind/surface that will re-direct it, or if there is a flat roof, it will hit the roof, loose some momentum, possibly get damaged, and fall back down, either besides the portal, or back in just to repeat what happened already until it is influenced by outside force, and doesn&#39;t fall into the portal anymore. if the box is dropped onto a portal on the floor with another portal directly on top of it, it will start going trough the portal, but the maximum speed still depends only on the mass and surface of the box, so the box cannot possibly go faster and faster to infinity within the atmosphere, because of the air resistance. The box can reach one maximum speed, and because of the resistance of the air cannot exceed this speed without the help of outside force, and this extra speed will slowly be depleted, until it reaches its normal maximum speed. If the box is pun on flat surface, a portal is opened above it, and another one below it, and the top portal is dropped down, the box will start crushing itself, no matter how tough it is, the portals are space, they are not influenced by the normal physical interactions, so the kinetic energy has nowhere to go, besides the other side of the box, and the box is crushed. If the portals are placed on two walls and they start getting closer with the box right in the middle, the box will still be crushed, but unless it is not floating, it will also be shredded, because the gravity is dragging it down, getting it on the way of the edge of the portal. if the box is placed closer to one of the portals, it will appear halfway trough the second one, but after that it will be halfway stuck between the two portals, because of the resistance of air, and also because the portals will both push the box, but will not give it any momentum, in the end the portals will act like flat surface, just the other half of the box will be on the other side. In the end, when the two portals are close enough, the box is still crushed. As for &quot;what if one of the portals goes trough the other&quot;, that depends on how the portal works, but i&#39;ll suggest that they either directly cancel each other, and when they close, they cut anything stuck between them, like usual. This is the best explanation, if we don&#39;t want to try to explain the opening of a macro black hole or something close to it and also destructive. One box will probably be shredded, crushed AND torn apart in the same time, depending on how the box got into the portals, the exit points of the portals, the direction of gravity and so on. So yeah, according to my theory (i don&#39;t know if someone else had this theory before me, if there is someone like that, ok, but at the moment i have not heard of them, and came up with this explanation on my one) the edge of the portals is the most dangerous blade in the world, being able to cut clean trough anything physical (except atoms, otherwise there might be a chance of nuclear reaction each time a portal is opened or closed, lets say there is something like electromagnetic field right before the edge of the rift, because a portal, from our 3D perspective is basically a rift in space, and that electromagnetic field splits the molecule, but leaves the atoms on either one or the other side, not in between.)<br><br>Quite long, but i hope it&#39;s at least interesting. And again, there are probably multiple ways to open a portal, and each might have different interaction with the surrounding world, so even if i am correct, this does not mean someone else is wrong.", "comment_date": "2022-08-07T15:18:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cmilkau", "comment_text": "Portals can&#39;t be moved.

In physics, the generic concept of conservation of energy implies that a machine CANNOT operate itself. (A machine cannot be 100% efficient, and even if it can, then it cannot exceed 100% efficiency). In other words, a machine cannot produce enough energy to operate itself without external input.<br><br>Translated to this case, your piston, pulling a cube, cannot generate enough energy to ALSO simultaneously push the cube.<br><br>So, for as long as the cube stops, the piston (whose momentum only barely pulls the cube) also certainly stops, and cannot push the cube through the next portal. Because, whatever force stopped the cube simultaneously stops the piston.<br><br>If you were to argue that the piston shaft broke, its momentum would be extinguished by whatever broke it (and separated the piston from the cube) in the first place. Having already exited the Orange portal, it can only knock on whatever else is in Blue, BUT NEVER the cube it was pulling.", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T00:54:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crep 50", "comment_text": "Wait just a minute<br><br>You do not get to show us a portal in a portal and not expect someone to want an explanation", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T00:19:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alvaro Zevallos", "comment_text": "so saitama moving portals is possible Lmao (one punch man manga)", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T00:13:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JereMii", "comment_text": "Okay but what about climbing the suspended bedsheet rope to the Upside Down in Eddie&#39;s trailer?", "comment_date": "2022-08-06T00:13:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chemicaly Jake", "comment_text": "moving portals in portal 3....", "comment_date": "2022-08-05T23:26:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bugela", "comment_text": "Rasmol.", "comment_date": "2022-08-05T23:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Edward Russell II", "comment_text": "prettiest way to draw molecules imo is Zogg&#39;s: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/wQ68cQj2KqQ?t=88\">https://youtu.be/wQ68cQj2KqQ?t=88</a>", "comment_date": "2022-08-05T23:21:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raven Corvus", "comment_text": "Having played portal, some of these suggestions give me stomach knots haha.", "comment_date": "2022-08-05T23:05:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zio QQr", "comment_text": "portals are.. objects?

We can call it the warping of space, but we need to know just how much space around the portal threshold is warped to understand the effects of the force caused by decelerating the portal frame.<br>Option#1 - The threshold is infinitesimal. That means that force is conveyed entirely by the 2 dimensional surface. This doesn&#39;t cause a problem in non-accelerating problems, as the cube would just pass through without any &quot;force&quot; applied, but as soon as you start decelerating it, you realize that you&#39;ve just turned the fabric of spacetime at the threshold into the world&#39;s sharpest knife - near infinitely precision on that one cross section with near infinite shearing force. In this case, there is no material strong enough to hold the cube together - the very top flies off, and then it&#39;s effectively atomized from the place the portal starts decelerating to the place it stops, as there&#39;s no atomic bond strong enough to overcome such a sheer force - possibly not even subatomic, so this scenario could get very bad very quickly.<br>Option#2 - The threshold is an ellipsoid that warps space out to a radius that&#39;s the average of the portal&#39;s height and width. This means that when the top of the cube is through the portal, the bottom of the cube is already under it&#39;s influence In this case, decelerating the portal would impart a perfect deceleration on the cube - theoretically on both halves at once if the warping changes on both sides simultaneously to reflect the change to either - stopping all motion entirely as the portal stops. At that point gravity acting on the top half of the cube would cause the whole thing to slide and tumble out of the portal (or rest at the bottom, depending on how much of the cube is actually through vs how much remains.)<br>Option#3 - Some middle ground. This is where we see normal sheering forces and imperfect force transfers, and somewhere here - I think - is your answer of the cube continuing at half speed, as well as possibilities like normal (non-atomizing) snapping of strings and cubes alike.<br><br>However, all this raises the question - if there&#39;s a feedback between objects passing through portals and the portals themselves, than does decelerating the orange portal actually accelerate the blue portal? And what happens if the blue portal is too firmly anchored - or anchored to something heavier than the orange portal? Does that mean that the orange portal can&#39;t be decelerated unless there&#39;s enough force acting on it to simultaneously accelerate the blue one, or is the relative inertia of the portals and their anchors what allows one to be moving while the other is stationary?<br>Every answer to a question about moving portals just raises more questions. It&#39;s understandable that Aperture Scientists just avoided it all together. Or maybe it&#39;s just that the surface that the portals are on can&#39;t actually sustain the acceleration without being torn off of the wall, disrupting and closing the portal anyway?

The only real issue I see would be whether differing gravitational effects on each side creates a smooth transition or a &quot;sharp&quot; transition.  In the case of a &quot;sharp&quot; transition, that is an abrupt change, it could potentially result in objects literally being sliced by a dimensional edge.  Seeing as that isn&#39;t the case regarding even stationary portals, it&#39;s hard to imagine it could happen in moving one&#39;s, but still, resting a sharp edge against your hand is very different from moving it along your hand.<br>Thus, I&#39;d see two plausible outcomes to the initial setup of a moving portal &quot;engulfing&quot; a stationary object.  First, is that since the object isn&#39;t moving, but it&#39;s just spacetime that is being &quot;rerouted&quot; around it, it would not &quot;shoot&quot; out of the other portal, but rather, pass through, balanced on the &quot;edge&quot; of spacetime formed by gravitational differences.

The portals are just connecting two points of space, moving them at different speeds would just change the rate at which you transition from one space to another. The only force on the cube in this scenario is gravity. The object resting on a platform has a portal coming from above and is connected to a portal facing right. In theory the cube should not move until the portal extends past the halfway point and the new &quot;downward&quot; gravity force is enough to overcome the original gravity force plus static friction (determined by the objects weight, texture, ext) . At which point it will begin to slide and tumble out of the second portal at a normal fall rate. Changing the speed of the portal would just change the rate at which the two forces increase/decrease but shouldnt amplify them. Coming out of the right portal the object should never have any rightward momentum regardless on how fast it goes through the portal because the only forces acting on it at the time are pushing left (original gravity force) and down ( new gravity force.) To envision this better flip the second portal so it faces up, so gravity never changes direction and repeat the thought. Moving the first portal back and forth rapidly would just have it pop back and forth out of the second portal rapidly.<br><br>For the second scenario theres two ways to think about it. One, portals themselves are physical objects that have mass in which case id agree with your assessment that they would either crush or get pushed back depending on if their mass is greater or lesser than the object, but that introduces a host of other questions like how they can be effected by the objects forces but not forces such as gravity. Or two, the portals have no mass and moving them closer together would ALWAYS squish the object because the only forces involved would be the pressures of the object pushing on itself until the portals touch and its squished until the last of it slips out at sub atom particle thickness.

The only reasonable explanation is that it comes from the portal. This means that whatever&#39;s pushing the portal would feel some amount of resistance when going over the cube, exactly proportional to the amount of kinetic energy the cube receives when moving out. The only other explanation is that energy is just created, which ok fine, it&#39;s fiction so that&#39;s just as valid, but that seems like a bigger leap that breaks more of physics. If you think a portal shouldn&#39;t be able to do this, then explain where that energy comes from.<br><br>With that in mind, the answer for the two riddles becomes kind of obvious. In the first case, as the portal moves over the cube, whatever is pushing it would feel a resistance and transfer some energy through to portal to the cube (somewhat analogous to induction, or it would feel about the same). As the portal stops, the inertia of the part that&#39;s through would pull on the part that&#39;s stationary. This creates stress on the cube, but most likely it would not be enough to break it. It would probably just move through but with reduced speed. If the speed was low enough, it might just jump a bit before gravity pulls it back down again and it stops.<br><br>In the second case, this resistance becomes more relevant, and of course either the cube would break or the portals would stop (or bounce I guess if they&#39;re flying through space or whatever).
