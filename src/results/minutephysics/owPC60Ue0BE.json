I found a flaw in the equation: they\u2019re using the quantum state of an object to calculate it. With quantum property number one no they can\u2019t they can only be in one state at a time. Now let\u2019s talk about the quantum state of an object. In a box \ud83d\udce6 there is a cat \ud83d\udc31 as well as an atom \u269b\ufe0f if the atom \u269b\ufe0f spins clockwise \ud83d\udd01 there is a detector that will detect it and a gun \ud83d\udd2b  will shoot the cat killing it. If the atom \u269b\ufe0f spins counterclockwise \ud83d\udd04 the detector will detect it again and the gun \ud83d\udd2b will not shoot the cat. \ud83d\udc31 The quantum state states the atom \u269b\ufe0f can spin clockwise \ud83d\udd01 and counterclockwise \ud83d\udd04 at the same time. If an atom \u269b\ufe0f that spins clockwise \ud83d\udd01 is white \u26aa\ufe0f and an atom \u269b\ufe0f that spins counterclockwise \ud83d\udd04 is black \u26ab\ufe0f then some atoms \u269b\ufe0f can be grey. What happens if the cat is dead and alive at the same time, result zombie cat. \ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udddf\ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc31 Quantum zombie cats \ud83e\udddf\ud83d\udc31 So what happens to the gun \ud83d\udd2b if the cat \ud83d\udc31 is dead \u2620\ufe0f and alive at the same time? The gun \ud83d\udd2b splits into 2, the only reason why no one has seen a zombie \ud83e\udddf\ud83d\udc31 is because they have been spit along with the cat. \ud83d\udc31 But I found a flaw in that equation: AN ATOM \u269b\ufe0f CAN\u2019T BE SPINNING CLOCKWISE \ud83d\udd01 AND COUNTERCLOCKWISE \ud83d\udd04 AT THE SAME TIME! If an atom \u269b\ufe0f was grey it wouldn\u2019t be spinning at all, it would be like someone turning their head right and turning their head left at the same time, which we all know can\u2019t be done. The only for the atom \u269b\ufe0f to spin clockwise \ud83d\udd01 and counterclockwise \ud83d\udd04 at the same time is not for the universe, but for the atom \u269b\ufe0f to split into 2. So the quantum state equation is as fake as this, so maybe it is possible to have a clone in physics. The only way to find out wether or not it\u2019s possible is to redo the equation without using the quantum state of an object, because an object cannot be in multiple states at once. \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffc", "comment_date": "2022-07-18T23:26:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gemini Goal", "comment_text": "This is the best video I have seen ever!!!!!!

I prefer to use the word &quot;cloning&quot; strictly for the field of biology/genetics and so I think it is more appropriate and less confusing to use the word &quot;duplication&quot; for physics. It is true that creating a perfect duplicate instantly (with each of the positions of the atoms and particles exactly the same as the original) is certainly impossible but it is irrelevant. Those ultra-tiny differences don&#39;t matter because, even if they were to be duplicated perfectly, the &quot;random&quot; nature of the quantum world would make the perfect duplicate no longer a thousandths of a second later. The real problem with duplication I think is the printing speed together with the accuracy and speed of the scan (it would also take a lot of disk space to store the map of atoms that make up the entire body of a cat, for example, but at the rate that advances the technologies of the information storage I do not think that this becomes a problem). Then the duplicate generated, thanks to an exact map of even the positions of all the atoms and subatomic particles, would only be different from the original by being delayed a certain amount of time, seconds or minutes for example (whatever it takes for the printer to generate the duplicate) and this would only matter at the initial instant of the duplicate, since then the nature of the quantum and the entropy would make the possible minute differences irrelevant.", "comment_date": "2021-05-29T16:27:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Just Lazy", "comment_text": "His cat must have scratched him a lot...<br>Else why does he keep putting it in life threatening situations<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23justiceforcat\">#justiceforcat</a> \ud83d\ude39", "comment_date": "2021-05-22T09:28:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas King", "comment_text": "(A + B)^2 = A^2 + B^2 is true in any commutative algebra over a field of characteristic two.

I myself can\u2019t think of a detail of an object that requires both things to be known, and I\u2019m just not going to try right now, too much thought rn. What you said about not being able to distinguish one object from another is fundamentally impossible by the way you set it up and how we define cloning, idk about principle of the statement just yet. Particularly, one thing that you said was that cloning would basically require the object to not be distinguishable to another. In other words, whatever is cloned must have exactly the same properties, including velocity/position in that space and time. At that point, there wouldn\u2019t be no other physical manifestation of the clone and be pointless to describe a \u201cperfect\u201d clone that way. So we can select and choose more lenient definition of physics cloning, one that don\u2019t require them to have the same position/velocity in spacetime. However, I\u2019m not a a crazy expert in physics, but can\u2019t things in quantum entanglement basically represent cloning? Moreover, even though we don\u2019t know the full details of an object, it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t make a \u201cperfect\u201d clone does it? Since the functions don\u2019t add up, don\u2019t mean they\u2019re impossible does it? Idk enough of those functions, but what you said about I can\u2019t make a perfect clone without knowing the full details to begin with isn\u2019t always required is there? As long as I discover enough, isn\u2019t there a probability that the machine gets it wrong or right, if I get lucky enough and have the machine make it? Even if the probabilistic wave function makes the probability of making a perfect clone is infinitesimally small, there\u2019s still a chance of cloning right? What I mean by that is that, isn\u2019t \u201cperfect\u201d cloning possible? The machine might not be perfect, but with enough tries, to infinity and beyond (aka possibly with many worlds interpretation of quantum physics) there\u2019s a possibility of cloning right?

Memory is not as simple as the spin of atomic particles between neurons. Although the idea of perfect copy is surmised in the whole function of what if you know everything the truth is we are not capable of having all the information of everything and then in the same instance of time fractions of a thousandth of a second and then doing the cloning process in that same instance so that we end up with a hundred percent copy no one no saying ever in the history of all Humanity will ever have the chance to make a perfect copy it&#39;s irrelevant to make the question can you make it perfect copy because it&#39;s beyond the powers of observation of a machine or any being that we can fabricate in the future so stop thinking about it and stop worrying about it because the closest proximity is all that we need because everything else Works according to that. The proof is dust disproven or proven irrelevant. as much as you might like this think about atomic particles being at the left or the right spin truth is atomic particles spin in all sorts of ways crazily a thousand different possibilities and it&#39;s not just right or left eye resolution doesn&#39;t see it but that is what it is so in order to know that specific information you need to go way faster than the fastest anyone&#39;s ever scanned an object and I know that because I&#39;ve seen the video.

It is the something over time not a snapshot that will make a perfect copy more likely than not or the best case scenario because the world isn&#39;t made out of a bunch of snapshots they are made out of a series of events moving forward constantly and being consistent throughout their movement regardless of position of atomics.

The way I would do it is: if we say that a thing in a superposition of |a&gt; and |b&gt;, then that means that when we look at it, some of the time (say, 36% of the time) we&#39;ll see |a&gt;, and other times (64% in this case) we&#39;ll see |b&gt;.

So, say, if we&#39;re measuring speed, some of the time we&#39;ll see the particle moving at 20m/s and other times at 37m/s. Add in the fact that, when we measure it, we destroy the superposition and the state becomes 100% the component you&#39;ve observed (and none of the other ones).

Similarly with double-slit experiment if act of observing is affecting the results, then simply clone the quantum particle and perform the measurement on the cloned particle and preferably after the end of original experiment.

Though if the impact that quantum uncertainty has on a biological level is small enough as to be imperceptible by humans, then it wouldn&#39;t really matter.

Which means you always replace a qubit of data with a different qubit each time you quantumly entangle particles.   That itself is not a show stopper for teleportation, as you can design the process to control which qubit is measured.  So if you make sure the quantum information that is replaced with new random data is not part of the information you are trying to quantum teleport, then everything works out fine for making your perfect copies.   In truth there is probably a very small amount of quantum information associated with who I am.  You could probably destroy 99.999% of it in the teleportation process and still end-up with someone I would consider to still be me.   After all I&#39;m constantly interacting with my environment.   Every atom of my body is constantly being measured with chemical processes...

Riemers", "comment_text": "I am at one minute and thirty seconds into the video, and it is already clear you do NOT understand the no cloning theorem.   No point in watching the rest, let me just explain what you got wrong...<br><br>The no cloning theorem does not mean you cannot make a perfect copy.   It just means you cannot get two different results measuring the same state twice using your perfect copy.  The two versions will evolve differently over time.   In your sheep example, indeed both sheep would be exactly the same at the instant they were created.  But an instant later, after untold number of quantum interactions they would be different.<br><br>Here is the thing, the rules for quantum entangement is simply that the first measurement of each quantumly entangled particle cannot give inconsistent results.   So if I have two quantumly entangled photons A &amp; B.  I measure the polarization of A as 0 degrees, I will also measure B at 0 degrees.   After that first measurement, they are no longer entangled.   Which means if I turn the polarization filter for B 45 degrees, I can measure A at 0 degrees, and say B at 45 degrees.   That is not an inconsistency as say a polarization of both could be 22.5 degrees to produce these results.   However, here is the thing the measurement of B in this case told me nothing about A, and the measurement of A told me nothing about B.   If I proceed to measure A a second time at the same angle as B, I can get the same results, but I can also get opposite results.  For me to actually learn something about B that would effect my second measurement of A would violate the no-cloning theorem.<br><br>So what this tells me is the SHEEP indeed can be exactly identical at the instant of creation.

The first part can be explained with the third rule in this video. And the second part was explained in this comment before (&quot;...so you only have &#39;A1 and A1&#39; or &#39;A2 and A2&#39; &quot; =&gt; &#39;A1 and A1 or A2 and A2&#39; ; which is the second part of the lower equation)<br><br>Mathmatically, &#39;(A1+A2)\u00d7(A1+A2)&#39; is the same as &#39;A1\u00d7A1 + 2(A1\u00d7A2) + A2\u00d7A2&#39;<br><br>But in that case, you would have &#39;A1 and A2&#39; which is not possible in terms of cloning as you have the same state in the original and in the copy. So it would be impossible to clone a superposition but the states of the superposition separated. I just got the thought: can you split every superposition in it&#39;s states? And, if yes, could you clone them seperately? Because in that case cloning would work in terms of mathmatics too.<br><br>But logically you can clone a superposition too so with that point of view there are no problems at all. <br>And now some unstructured thoughts to this:<br>Machines are built on logic instead of math; math is the instrument that we use to find the logic behind the laws of the future but still we haven&#39;t figured everything we know out yet; there could be something we don&#39;t know yet that &#39;destroys the picture we have from our world&#39; and proves given mathmatical statements, we all think were true till then, wrong<br><br><br><br>I don&#39;t say i am right with what i just wrote, i just wrote everything down that came into my mind, even some of the unstructured thoughts, and i tried my best to translate them from german into englisch.

Sci-fi likes to throw the word dimensions about and slap it on every police box if can find but I&#39;m quite hazy on an actual definition. As far as I can tell it boils down to two in my opinion very different ideas, one being like the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics with other realities splitting off of our own due to the collapse of superpositions and then the other being extra dimensions like in string theory, which are like extra lengths I suppose, other ways of perceiving reality outside our usual 4d space time. So is this just  a linguistic overlap or is there some deeper more mathematical reason they are the same ? Am I just not getting the concepts because as far as I can tell having an extra length if you will is not the same as having a whole other reality?

This brings to light an interesting concept concerning consciousness.<br><br>Suppose that the universe is spatially infinite. Also, suppose that the number of types of particles that exist in the universe is finite. On top of that, assume that there&#39;s only a certain number of ways to arrange those particles that complies with known physical law, and that those particles can only exist in a finite number of states. As such, if space is infinite, that would mean that, if you go far enough in any direction, you&#39;ll eventually run across an exact copy of the place you just left. So, if you left earth, then eventually you&#39;d run across an exact replica of earth. Down to the people on it. Down to the arrangement of the neurons in those peoples&#39; brains. Down to the properties of the sodium and potassium ions in those brains. And not only would there be one exact copy. If space were infinite, there would be an infinite number of exact copies.<br><br>Now, as far as we know of today, there is no mystical aspect of consciousness that determines its properties. You are you simply because your brain is arranged a certain way, and your neurons are firing in a particular pattern that is unique to you. But here&#39;s the catch - if there were to exist an exact copy of you, down to the position of the neurons and the arrangement of the neural activity, then which &quot;you&quot; would you be? Which head would you reside in? What would differentiate your mind from the mind of the other you? Assuming that they truly were an exact copy, then nothing at all would differentiate the two of you.<br><br>Now, if you two were to be in the same location and interacting with each other, then it could be determined which &quot;you&quot; was you, as the very act of interacting would break the symmetry. The other &quot;you&quot; would respond to your gestures, therefore altering his neural state in a way that&#39;s unique from yours. But, if the two of you were to forever remain isolated in your little bubbles, then you could conceivably reside in both heads at once. And, if there&#39;s an infinite number of &quot;you&#39;s&quot; out there, then you&#39;d reside in all of their heads at once. And, since they&#39;d all be exact copies, then they&#39;d all be experiencing and doing the same thing simultaneously. So there wouldn&#39;t be any way for you to differentiate between the copies. <br><br>In short, your mind could be simultaneously existing in an infinite number of locations at once. You simply don&#39;t know because each location is an exact copy of the other, so you get the exact same sensory input and experience the exact same responses to that input at every location.<br><br>What&#39;s more, let&#39;s assume that every copy of you suddenly became curious and said &quot;I want to find this supposed replica-world.&quot; Afterwards, they all set out in their collective high-tech spacecraft in a random direction, intent on traveling until they run across the replica-earth. Now, let&#39;s say that after an arbitrarily long amount of time (assuming that you could somehow do it before the universe suffered heat death) you finally run across this replica world. Here&#39;s the kicker. The &quot;you&quot; of this world would&#39;ve left long ago, at the exact moment YOU decided to leave, in search of this mysterious &quot;replica-world&quot; he thought of. That means that, from the perspective of the people that inhabit that world, &quot;you&quot; set off in one direction, bound for a replica-world, but instead simply returned to your own world, coming from the opposite direction. From their perspective, you simply would&#39;ve circled the entire universe, then come back around. And the crazy thing is that, from your perspective, this would be a perfectly reasonable explanation as well, as you&#39;d never run in to any copy of you, and there would be no way of differentiating the earth you find from the earth you left behind. Similarly, a copy of you would show up on the earth you left, which the people on that world would assume was you after having circled the entire universe. So is there really any difference between a universe with an infinite number of &quot;you&quot;s and &quot;earth&quot;s, and a universe that curves in on itself?", "comment_date": "2017-01-02T19:37:44Z", "likes_count": 71}, {"comment_by": "Kamile M", "comment_text": "Loved the detail in the video!", "comment_date": "2017-01-02T19:18:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Microbie", "comment_text": "Isn&#39;t it easier to just say that for cloning you need observation and observation breaks superposition so you cannot clone superposition?

One day you&#39;ll be very ashamed that you said stupid stuff like a cat in two states simultaneously or 1 electron going through 2 holes at the same time. There will come a sane explanation and you&#39;ll be like those people who thought the Earth was flat cause... well to us it is. To you it looks like that and you fall for it just because there&#39;s no better theory behind it.<br><br>So yes, it&#39;s our current quantum mechanics understanding is wrong. Seriously, if you&#39;re cloning something, you take a stable state in time and clone it. If you&#39;re cloning an exploding barrel, fine, just add all the energy, all the spins, all the vectors to the particles and you&#39;ll get an exploding barrel that will continue doing whatever it was supposed to do after cloning is complete. If we somehow could freeze it in time til it&#39;s finished whole. Or calculate how to add matter to existing one the way it would end up as what we want. So to say, if you need to clone a molecule of water going diagonally, you start with 1 O atom going some direction, then shoot 2 H atoms at it to correct the vector. This way we create a molecule that would be in the necessary state at T=0, meaning, when the cloning is considered complete. <br><br>So you start with some false statement and build formulas on it. Of course you can get anything, even prove mathematically that our universe does not exist. Same as proof that Achilles never reaches the turtle. In false formulas it&#39;s true, in reality it&#39;s not. And I don&#39;t mean reaching a real turtle, I mean anything that would demand you to divide anything to infinity pieces. I don&#39;t know a single person who&#39;d have done that at least once. Simple logic many people ignore says it&#39;s impossible. But there are people who say &quot;if you never licked color green it only means you haven&#39;t YET&quot;. No, it&#39;s common sense impossible. Same as some other problems people make up today. They clearly say something stupid and cover with math that makes no sense.

However, A and B in this case represent probability densities - and even more so- they represent conditional probability densities. To explain myself a bit better, using the same analogy of multiplication being a product, whenever you say A*B  ( representing exploded and non-exploded states) you actually mean you would have a composite system between exploded and non-exploded gunpowder. Mind you, you&#39;re not saying you have a superimposition of these two states, but a composite system. And here&#39;s where things get tricky : the conditional probability of the gunpowder having exploded given that it has not exploded is zero and vice-versa. Therefore, A*B = B*A = 0. Even more interestingly so, B*B = B and A*A = A ( the probability of exploding given that it&#39;s exploded is one and the probability of it not exploding given that it has not exploded is also 1). Hence, if the cloning process were applied, it would result in a superimposition of probability densities A+B.

If you want your videos to attract people like me, and interest a larger demographic than just university physics students, I think you should try to slow things down, make them even more clear. I want to understand, if not every detail, at least the conclusions.

Perhaps the same goes for other people. Your content was fantastically laid out so that a large crowd could easily get on board and learn more about the universe (or race walking!) without spending hours or years just trying to wrap their heads around the fundamentals as presented in the most dry of texts. (Although I did pick up Time Reborn and it was really fantastic!)<br><br>Suggestion: I am not a YouTuber and I only know what little about making money off of the site as other YouTubers care to divulge. My understanding is that watch time and video duration does count for something and I would not blame you for needing to take advantage of this. So, perhaps instead of a long video on a single topic, how about a long video that goes over a couple of, perhaps, related topics? That way you can keep the shorter lessons but in a way that will still be economically beneficial for you? (If, indeed, that is the reason.
