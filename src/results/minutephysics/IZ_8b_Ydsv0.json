The upshot of this is that a negative test doesn&#39;t really mean all that much; infected people (after a 14 day quarantine period say) who test negative still have a 1 in 10 chance of being infected.

Therefore, you generally get the results within 24 hours not in a few days.<br>2) PCR is a repetitive reaction that makes the copies of the viral RNA until it becomes so much viral RNA that you can easily detect it.

Therefore the issue you raise here is solely about price, not about sensitivity.<br><br>And this is the main problem with the video. You claim to compare high and low sensitivity tests. But you aren&#39;t aware that PCR is very flexible in terms of sensitivity.  Therefore, putting sensitivity in this argument is meaningless. You should&#39;ve focused only on the price.

To effectively use rapid antigen tests for community screening we&#39;d need a large proportion of a community to keep getting tested on a regular basis, not just when they think they&#39;ve had an exposure or are getting tested before they travel somewhere (which itself can be a flawed strategy). Where I live, anyone who wants to get tested can go to a community center and get swabbed for a PCR test for free, but as far as I know people aren&#39;t doing this regularly. This isn&#39;t a criticism of people&#39;s willingness to get tested, because it would certainly be a hassle to go to a testing site and wait in a long line every day or even once a week, especially if we&#39;re trying to screen a whole city or town. Assuming people would have the same accessibility for rapid antigen testing, we&#39;d need to have a strategy in place to ensure that people are actually getting tested regularly. <br><br>For example, an effective but probably impractical strategy would be to have a rapid test that people can perform themselves, which would theoretically allow people to swab themselves each day and then isolate and get PCR tested if the rapid antigen test yields a positive result. However, unless these tests are being distributed for free or at a really low price, only certain people might be able to afford adding these tests to their weekly or monthly budgets, especially since people are still going through financial problems. Ultimately this means that we might still be missing a large portions of the population. Another possibility would be for businesses to screen customers before allowing them inside, but again this would be wildly impractical since people (myself included) would likely not be willing to get swabbed, then sit around for 15min if all they wanted to do was go into a grocery store to buy one item.<br><br>All that being said, this could be an effective strategy for community screening if a community has the resources to regularly use these antigen tests in &quot;high risk&quot; places (e.g. hospitals, nursing homes, doctor&#39;s offices), or for places where people are often around others for long periods of time (e.g. schools, gyms, restaurants).

At five days to peak viral load (to use the numbers you reference in this video), you want to test every 3 days or so. That can be expensive, but you can test one person 20 times over 60 days for the same price you test one person once, and you&#39;re far, FAR more likely to catch him on the up-swing towards infectiousness this way. If you restrict it to contact-tracing candidates, you could test one person 1/day over 14 days for $70, or over a measly 7 days for $35, and determine if he&#39;s caught it and is carrying much more reliably and cut the quarantine time down significantly (since we know that he&#39;d be showing symptoms after a certain point...I may be off on exactly how many days, but 7 seems like a good rough estimate and 14 is definitely plenty). Moreover, you wouldn&#39;t be saying &quot;you have it!&quot; based on fragments left over from having had it before, or, worse, from never having had it but having had some minor exposure that never reached infectious levels of viral load.<br><br>Caveat 2 doesn&#39;t apply; the rapid tests are effective enough, especially done in relatively rapid succession. Three tests in a row on a test that&#39;s 90% accurate will get a wrong result only 1/1000 times, so an expensive test would need to be 99.9% accurate to match that in a one-off. <br><br>Caveat 3 is actually a point I think you&#39;re spreading misinformation around: there is no evidence of asymptomatic spread of this particular disease. <br><br>Caveat 4 is also combatted by the same thing as caveat 1: frequent testing. One positive test means you take another rapid test, a few hours later or the next day. Quarantining on the off chance the false positive was real when it lasts for a day at most is nowhere near as big a deal as quarantining for a fortnight and until you test negative twice on an expensive test that takes a week!<br><br>Caveat 5 is just there for the theater.

A PCR test does not take multiple days. A PCR test takes about 1.5 to 2 hours if implemented properly. The reason many labs don&#39;t give you the result any faster is that the lab often isn&#39;t at the point of swabbing, that tests are batched together and that sometimes they have to be re-done. There is no good reason why a test result should ever take more than 24 hours to reach you given a competent operation with 24/7 staffing. Also, a PCR test really should not cost more than around $25. I know most of the testing companies charge a lot more than this but that&#39;s mostly because they can and because of failure to automate and streamline the workflows. Another big problem is that given the low sensitivity of the antigen tests, you would need to test people much more frequently to have the same chance of catching them during the period where the disease is detectable. You are also overestimating the sensitivity of both types of test. Even a decent PCR test can fail to catch a positive a week after infection. A negative result on an antigen test gives you no useful information other than &quot;I&#39;m probably not super infectious right at this moment I took the test&quot;.

Firstly the time taken for the samples to come into the lab and have a result is only about 3 hours. This is of course increased with large sample numbers but the main delay in the reporting of results is due to the health system in the country that you live. All tests carried out in Ireland have results generated within 24 hours of the person being swabbed. It is the health service that  delays the reporting of results but from knowing people who have gotten tested they have received their results within 1-3 days (when not priority or privet samples which  have to have reported results the following morning).<br><br>In relation to the peak of viral infection, where I live at least, people are told to self isolate if they have any symptoms until which time they have tested negative or if they have been in close contact wit someone who is getting tested.

Additionally, although you mention the false positive issue in the caveats, you dismiss the issue too quickly. It you work the math, in a general population setting assuming a prior (generous) 1% prevalence, 50% of the positive tests would be false positive. However, if you start repeating the testing with rapid test, your prior is likely to drop significantly leading to a lot more false positive tests. You can build a small Markov model and look at what happens if you test everybody every day and isolate the 0.5%-1% positive individuals you get every day for 14 days like has been suggested...<br>Finally, the larger issue is that we still don&#39;t fully understand the transmission, while the argument you make that individuals with higher viral load are likely to transmit more and thus should be detected more stands to reason, there is an alternative theory. While higher individuals with higher viral loads are likely to be more infectious, they are also more likely to be symptomatic and self-isolate. On the other hand, true asymptomatic individuals (excluding presymptomatic) are likely to have lower viral loads and even though they are less infectious, they might the ones who are more likely to transmit SARS-COV-2. Indeed, the CDC suggests that more than half of COVID-19 might be due to asymptomatic individuals. Thus, it might be more important to control the epidemic not to identify the symptomatic high viral load individuals that can self-isolate because of symptoms but to identify the average/low asymptomatic individuals that might be missed with a less sensitive test.", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T19:13:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Peregrinator", "comment_text": "\u7f8e\u570b vs \u6c99\u5730\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\r<br>(1)\t\u7f8e\u570b\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u662f3.28\u5104\uff0c\u6c99\u5730\u963f\u62c9\u4f2f\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u662f0.34\u5104\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u5927\u6982\u662f\u6c99\u7279\u768410\u500d\u3002\r<br>(2)\t\u57f7\u7b46\u4e4b\u6642\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u7684\u78ba\u8a3a\u4eba\u6578\u662f2,340\u842c\uff0c\u6c99\u7279\u7684\u78ba\u8a3a\u4eba\u6578\u662f36.4\u842c\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u5927\u6982\u662f\u6c99\u7279\u768464\u500d\u3002\r<br>(3)\t\u7f8e\u570b\u7684\u78ba\u8a3a\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4eba\u6578\u662f38.9\u842c\uff0c\u6c99\u7279\u7684\u78ba\u8a3a\u6b7b\u4ea1\u4eba\u6578\u662f6,310\u4eba\uff0c\u7f8e\u570b\u5927\u6982\u662f\u6c99\u7279\u768462\u500d\u3002\r<br>\u6c99\u7279\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u5927\u698294%\u662f\u56de\u6559\u5f92\uff0c\u761f\u75ab\u7206\u767c\u521d\u671f\uff0c\u5927\u5bb6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u96fb\u8996\u756b\u9762\u4e0a\u770b\u898b\u56de\u6559\u5f92\u89aa\u543b\u8056\u5730\u7684\u4e0d\u5408\u885e\u751f\u884c\u70ba\uff0c\u70ba\u751a\u9ebc\u53cd\u800c\u7f8e\u570b\u7684\u60c5\u6cc1\u6bd4\u6c99\u7279\u60e1\u52a36\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5462\uff1f\r<br>\u7b54\u6848\u662f\u5169\u7a2e\u6db2\u9ad4\uff01\r<br><a href=\"https://peregrinator2015.blogspot.com/2020/03/2.html\">https://peregrinator2015.blogspot.com/2020/03/2.html\r</a><br>\u5982\u679c\u7528\u624b\u6a5f\u89c0\u770b\uff0c\u9023\u7d50\u662f\uff1a\r<br><a href=\"https://peregrinator2015.blogspot.com/2020/03/2.html?m=1\">https://peregrinator2015.blogspot.com/2020/03/2.html?m=1\r</a><br>(14/1/2021)", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T18:37:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Coley Duncan", "comment_text": "My wife runs a local pharmacy and they do a lot of rapid testing.

What reason could they have for finally choosing to recognise this simple reality?<br>The answer to that is potentially shockingly cynical: We have a vaccine now. We don\u2019t need false positives anymore. Notionally, the system has produced its miracle cure. So, after everyone has been vaccinated, all the PCR tests being done will be done \u201cunder the new WHO guidelines\u201d, and running only 25-30 cycles instead of 35+. Lo and behold, the number of \u201cpositive cases\u201d will plummet, and we\u2019ll have confirmation that our miracle vaccine works.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T17:28:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "AD Electronic Teardowns", "comment_text": "Bad news COVID19 China Virus will never disappear, it will morph and be like the flu, it&#39;s hear to stay.

These programs have been piloted in city wide screening in the city of Liverpool, and are now being rolled out to support care home visits and the return home of University students for the Christmas break. Here we present data on the performance of Lateral Flow devices to test almost 8,000 students at the University of Birmingham between December 2nd and December 9th 2020. The performance is validated against almost 800 samples using PCR performed in the University Pillar 2 testing lab, and theoretically validated on thousands of Pillar 2 PCR testing results performed on low-prevalence care home testing samples. Our data shows that Lateral Flow Devices do not detect infections presenting with PCR Ct values over 29-30, meaning that only 3.2% (95% CI 0.6% to 15.6%) of total cases in the student population were detected, but that as many of 85% of cases tested in the Pillar 2 PCR lab would have been detected theoretically.<br><br>Also, these tests seem to be being used in the wrong way by the government in the UK at least.
