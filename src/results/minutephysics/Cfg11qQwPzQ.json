It was defined long ago, when we didn\u2019t know about general relativity, or the speed of light, and we believed, information travels instantly.<br>When we say \u201cthis star might be exploded already, but we don\u2019t know because the light didn\u2019t get here yet\u201d we are wrong. There is no way knowing it, so the possible explosion of the star is NOT the unknown past, but it is in fact the future in every rational way.<br><br>I propose an improved definition of \u201cpresent\u201d. Present is the wavefront of information getting here at this moment, traveling with the speed of light (speed of causality). Present is what I see. Everything before it, is the past and everything getting here later is the future. This would be the fundamental definition, which matches with our own intuition as well.<br><br>If I see a star exploding, it is happening now. The Big bang is happening now, it is a continuous process which is currently about at the edge of the observable universe.<br><br>Let\u2019s realize, that the speed of light (speed of causality) is such a fundamental concept in the universe, that it worth defining time itself by it.
