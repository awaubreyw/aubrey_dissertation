The feel of touch depends of speed and energy densitys of the meeting objects(energys or something like collectors of energy). If we are energy or mass it keeps the same to me. Those electrons meet in the same energy dimension, field or what so ever and are bound more or less to an object with possibilities to interact and even attach to another object (collector of energy) or just interact with their medium(forcefield). If the electron not meets as a particle but thinking of two waves meeting in water would have differnt outcomes but they surley will show that they are one with their medium (water/force field). A virtual particle which is moved out of its forcefield looses energy while it enters its new force field as a new wave or particle. So when we touch the skin of our partner it feels one and heat can be transferred from a in between formed heat-forcefield to us or our partner.-When the tiniest thing is like a wave everything that interacts is information it self and creates new information when it interacts.. -I ve seen a video of quantum fluid dynamics by vortex institute.
