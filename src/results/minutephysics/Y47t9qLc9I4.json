There is a belief by some that masks are completely ineffective against viruses because viruses are too small to filter which is actually true, but misleading, because viruses by themselves can&#39;t survive long in the open environment anyway. They actually survive airborne transmission from host to host absorbed inside droplets of moisture, spittle, or flem which partially protects and shields enough of these viruses from environmental variables like UV light. As long as some viruses survive the trip absorbed into one of these moisture particles, they can still successfully transmit between hosts.

Now obviously this isn&#39;t the exact formula for covid&#39;s expected spread, but this very clearly showcases the sheer power of attacking the exponent in an exponential growth curve, making masks and social distancing all the more effective the more people keep doing it.

Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal.

There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.&quot;<br><br>Viruses are much smaller than the mesh of surgical masks.

This is exceptionally misleading, because it&#39;s operating under the assumption that masks actually reduce transmission by a noticeable percentage. What&#39;s worse, it&#39;s operating under the assumption that masks worn by one individual but not the other individual actually results in a noticeable reduction.<br><br>If you actually do the math, the data just doesn&#39;t support this. Studies have shown that your average cloth mask prevents something like 90% of the viral particles from passing *directly through the material*. This is with a literal airtight seal around the edges of the cloth, which obviously isn&#39;t even close to the case in reality. Still, let&#39;s proceed using that 90% number to be super generous. Note that this number is for your typical cloth mask, not a proper n95 with a good seal. Those were shown to provide orders of magnitude greater protection, stopping upwards of 99.9% of particles.<br><br>Studies done on hospitalized patients suffering from influenza have shown that there is an average of 8000 viral particles suspended in the air of their hospital rooms per liter of air. Assuming COVID-19 is similar (which seems reasonable, given that researchers have used influenza as a stand in for covid) then let&#39;s take that number. The average human breathes in roughly 10 liters of air per minute. Without anyone wearing a mask, then it is logical to assume that on average our poor test subjects would be breathing in an average of 64,000 viral particles per minute in the presence of an infected individual.<br><br>Estimates vary, but most seem to place an infectious dose (how many particles is required to create an infection) somewhere between the low hundreds to the low thousands (I&#39;ve seen anywhere from 200 particles to 5000 particles quoted). So, needless to say.. without masks, it&#39;s easy to see how the disease spreads easily.<br><br>Let&#39;s put a mask on the infected individual and try this again. Now, we&#39;ve filtered out 90% of the outgoing particles. Instead of 8000 particles per liter, there&#39;s now 800. Our unmasked test subject enters the room and hangs out for a minute. They&#39;ll leave having breathed in 8000 viral particles in just that single minute. Again, well above the highest estimates for an infectious dose. Putting a mask on just the infected individual didn&#39;t really cut the transmission rate much, simply because the amount of outgoing particles is just utter overkill compared to the rather tiny infectious dose.<br><br>So, let&#39;s put a mask on both the patient and the test subject. There&#39;s 800 particles per liter of air, but only 80 are being breathed in. After a minute the subject has breathed in 800 particles. That&#39;s lower than the high estimates of an infectious dose to be sure, but well above the low estimates - and that&#39;s with only a single minute of exposure.<br><br>Keeping in mind that real world performance of masks would be significantly worse than the airtight seals seen in the lab setting for purposes of testing the cloth itself, and the fact that many people would utterly invalidate any protection given by a mask simply by failing to wash their hands after coming in contact with a contaminated surface.. well, masks work a lot WORSE than what most people actually think. They&#39;re effective, but only if absolutely everyone wears them, and even then only for extremely brief exposures. They simply won&#39;t be effective from stopping students sitting in a classroom from infecting the other students, or preventing coworkers working in the same room with one another for extended periods of time from infecting one another. Yet these are the very sorts of situations where our government officials are encouraging citizens to rely on masks to be effective, all the while encouraging businesses and schools to reopen.<br><br>This is more or less exactly what we see given the spread rate of the disease too. In the initial months of the pandemic almost everyone in my area was wearing masks after it was mandated that we do so, and I&#39;m from an extremely conservative region of my state - exactly the sort that are least likely to abide by such regulations. Yet, despite all that, the spread rate remained essentially unchanged. There was no drastic reduction.. and in September, when schools reopened and restrictions on businesses began to be relaxed, there was a massive increase in the spread rate (we&#39;re now up to 10x what was seen in those earlier months). The overwhelming majority of people are wearing masks (I generally see maybe 5% or less not wearing them in my area) - but they&#39;re simply not stemming the tide. That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;d expect if they had effectively no impact, and not at all what I&#39;d expect if they worked as advertised.<br><br>We should absolutely be wearing them - for brief potential exposures. For long term exposures to other people though, there&#39;s essentially no point. We should be limiting such exposures as much as possible using other more effective methods, and when such exposures are simply unavoidable (such as coworkers working in an essential job that demands they work together closely) we shouldn&#39;t be mandating mask usage when it really won&#39;t have any impact beyond such a short exposure window.

Which is masks are better than no masks.<br>In this equation you assume the effectiveness of the mask. As you mentioned the effectiveness on the box is not equal to the the prevention rate of getting the disease, this also depends on how easily the disease is transmitted. If transmissions only occurred by breading in each others face you could have this as a base model (even though that assumption would still be wrong, it would at least be directly related), but it doesn&#39;t.<br>Here&#39;s some math to take in consideration and press on people: When you are healthy, wearing a mask without the right etiquette increases the chance of &#39;YOU&#39; getting sick by XX%. I say XX because it is known and quite evident that it does, but I don&#39;t know the exact number, but also because the number is of little consequence to what follows. If you assume that most if not all people are either getting tired of wearing masks / just do it to not be shunned and abide by the law / or just don&#39;t know any better... You can state that the same XX% more people will get sick. When you get yourself sick, you start contributing to making other people sick.<br>The point to take away here is not that masks do not work, but to not just tell people to wear a mask. Rather explain to them how to wear a mask, and how NOT to handle them when used and actually show them the whole story. Not to dumb down information because we think they can&#39;t understand the whole truth or importance. I know some people give that appearance, but in my opinion it is because often they are assumed to be too stupid. None of this is too complicated to understand, the math isn&#39;t that complex. To both politicians and doctors alike: &quot;It is nice you do what you do, don&#39;t get me wrong, but you are not THAT smart&quot;.

That is the jist of the human immune system. 99.9 percent of us properly manage these invaders perfectly well. Now, a new invader (SARS-COV-II) that our immune system is not aware of will come along at some point in time if we are not sheltered in place. Our immune system will react to this new bacteria or virus by producing an immune response where 99.9 percent of the time we will not even be aware of the response or will have a mild response (runny nose, cough, slight fever). This is our body actually reacting as it should in a good way where it is producing the required antibodies and B-Cells needed for combating the invader. The B-Cells produced by our immune response will stay within our body for years in order to combat the same invader reentering our body in the future. This is really you being reinfected again (second wave) and again 99.9 percent of the time you will not be aware of the response and probably will not even have a mild response while at the same time the response has created more B-Cells reinforcing the strength of our immunity to the invader. The point is that in this scenario we were infected and then reinfected which modified our immune system and then strengthened it on the second infection and third and forth and so on. Our immune system is maturing to our environment as it should. This is going on within the population we are living in every moment we are alive. It is a fact of nature and this is the herd immune process. Mask wearing and social distancing for the healthy population just inhibits this process and results in healthy individuals at some point being infected by a multitude of viruses in their environment at the same time causing a high viral loading. Now this is what brings on serious immune responses and higher levels of hospitalizations for populations who have low maturity immune systems. Individuals in these populations are mostly persons having predisposed medical conditions due to genetic makeup or bad life styles. I mostly see these as people living bad life styles. But, in any case, I believe in our natural immune process (herd immunity) far more than current microbiological therapies in the vaccine inoculation processes that are given out to healthy immune systems by the various governmental agencies around the world. A vaccine should be used on vulnerable populations only. The science is still light years behind what our immune system has evolved into. Otherwise we will need a series of vaccines each month or day even at some point as the natural human immune system degrades over time. Giving over your inherent immune system to be replaced by the current synthesized immune system from a pharmacological company is not a world I would want my children or myself to live in. I do believe in immune system therapies which include vaccinations as long as the therapies are properly developed and only applied for people that require these therapies. Let our natural immunity eradicate these invaders by our healthy immune systems together as it should. This is why &quot;Covid numbers&quot; go up and down over time. The infection rate numbers game is really used for political and marketing purposes because 99.9 percent of healthy immune systems infected by SARS-COV-2 will have a slight immune response but according to the current gold standard PCR test will give a positive on the first test for people infected up to 60 days from the day they were infected. SARS-COV-2 has an infectious period of 3 to 10 days. The PCR test needs to be immediately performed again on the individuals with an initial positive result to find out if they are truly infectious which is currently not being done. As well, infection rates correlated with death rates is not presented clearly.

Masks did not help infected people reduce their risk of  infecting others, nor reduce the risk of uninfected people contracting influenza:<br>\u2018In this review, we did not find  evidence to support a protective effect of personal protective measures  or environmental measures in reducing influenza transmission..We did not  find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons (source control) or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility\u2019. <br>They also admitted that \u2018the mechanisms of person-to-person transmission in the community have not been fully determined. Controversy remains over the role of transmission through fine-particle aerosols. Transmission by indirect contact requires transfer of viable virus from respiratory mucosa onto hands and other surfaces, survival on those surfaces, and successful inoculation into the respiratory mucosa of another person. All of these components of the transmission route have not been studied extensively.\u2019 <br><br>2020: Two studies (here and here) suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain, potentially via the olfactory nerves and connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. Through wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, which may lead to them being able to enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.<br><br>2020: This study looked whether there was shedding of fibres from disposable and reusable masks. Research on synthetic fibres has shown a correlation between the inhalation of synthetic fibres and various bronchopulmonary diseases, such as asthma, alveolitis, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, fibrosis, COPD, spontaneous pneumothorax and chronic pneumonia. They posit that it may also cause Pulmonary fibrosis which they claim \u2018is among the worst diseases that can be suffered or witnessed. It kills exceedingly slowly, by ever-thickening matrix formation, a kind of scar tissue, obstructing the alveoli and reducing their air exchange. The illness worsens slowly over time, and suffocates the victim very gradually. Nothing is available to the sufferer from conventional medicine. Neither medication nor radiation can undo the damage of the fibrous matrix laid down in the lungs\u2019 tissue. Similarly, surgery is not available to eliminate the insidious, suffocating mesh that painstakingly takes the life of the unfortunate patient. Neither is any known cure available in the realm of natural or alternative medicine. Neither nutrient, herb, nor any other known treatment can even reduce the fibrogenesis, let alone eliminate it. The 5-year survival rate is only 20%. The only remedy against this scourge is diligent prevention of small and microscopic inhaled foreign bodies.\u2019<br><br>2020: This working paper focused on 25 U.S. states and 23 countries with more than 1,000 Covid-19 deaths (as of late July). They concluded that the data trends observed likely indicate that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) \u2013 such as lockdowns, closures, travel restrictions, stay-home orders, event bans, quarantines, curfews, and mask mandates \u2013 do not seem to affect virus transmission rates overall. <br><br>2020: This small scale study analysed 14 masks and coverings by using a tool that allowed researchers to track individual particles released from a person&#39;s mouth when they spoke the phrase \u201cStay healthy, people.\u201d Speakers said the same phrase while wearing the different models of masks, and no masks at all, to compare. Each face covering was tested 10 times.<br>\u201cThe neck gaiter that we tested did essentially nothing, and worse than nothing, because it appeared to make large droplets into small droplets,\u201d Isaac Henrion, the study&#39;s co-author, told CBS News. The experiment involved only a small number of speakers and face coverings, and the researchers stressed that more testing is needed - some gaiters might work better than others, depending on how they&#39;re made.<br><br>2020: The New England Journal of Medicine editorial on the topic of mask use versus Covid-19 assesses the matter as follows:<br>\u2018We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 20 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.\u2019<br><br>2020: This study found that 624 out of 714 people wearing N95 masks left visible gaps when putting on their own masks. Of participants given N95 respirators with an instruction sheet and then asked to put one on, only about 13% passed the visual mask fit test.<br><br>2020: This review found that masks had no effect specifically against Covid-19, although facemask use seemed linked to, in 3 of 31 studies, \u2018very slightly reduced\u2019 odds of developing influenza-like illness.<br><br>2020: Plastic face shields are almost totally ineffective at trapping respiratory aerosols, according to modelling in Japan. A simulation using Fugaku, the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer, found that almost 100% of airborne droplets of less than 5 micrometres in size escaped through plastic visors of the kind often used by people working in service industries.<br><br>2020: This CDC study, which surveyed symptomatic Covid-19 patients, has found that 70.6% of respondents reported \u2018always\u2019 wearing a mask, while an additional 14.4% say they \u2018often\u2019 wear a mask. That means 85% of infected Covid-19 patients reported habitual mask wearing. Only 3.9% of those infected said they \u2018never\u2019 wear a face covering.<br><br>2019: This randomised clinical trial of 2862 participants showed that both N95 respirators and surgical masks \u2018resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory confirmed influenza.\u2019<br><br>2018: This study shows a potential causation link between hypoxia and blood clotting and discovered that hypoxia down regulates expression of the important natural anticoagulant protein S.

The level of protein S was found to drop by 50% when O2 levels were at 15%. <br>An N95 mask simulates a similarly low oxygen saturation, which could indicate that wearing a mask may decrease your natural ability to prevent blood clots by 50%.<br><br>2018: This study provides strong evidence for the identification that surgical masks are as source of bacterial contamination during operative procedures. It recommends surgeons should change their mask after each operation, especially those beyond 2 hours.<br><br>2018: This study looked at whether wearing a mask affected the Six Minutes Walking Test (6MWT) which is regularly used in pulmonology. They found that surgical mask wearers had significantly increased dyspnea (difficult or laboured breathing) after a 6-minute walk than non-mask wearers.<br><br>2016: A review of current research written from the perspective of the dental professional notes:<br>\u2018The primary reason for mandating the wearing of face masks is to protect dental personnel from airborne pathogens. This review has established  that face masks are incapable of providing such a level of protection. Unless the CDC, national and  provincial dental associations and regulatory agencies publically admit this fact, they will be guilty of perpetuating a myth which will be a disservice to the dental profession and its patients.\u2019<br><br>2016: An article in The Journal of Biological Engineering notes that: \u2018Wearing respirators come[s] with a host of physiological and psychological burdens. These can interfere with task performances and reduce work efficiency. These burdens can even be severe enough to cause life-threatening conditions if not ameliorated.\u2019<br><br>2016: This meta-analysis found that both randomised controlled trials and observational studies of N95 respirators and surgical masks used by healthcare workers did not show benefit against transmission of acute respiratory infections. It was also found that acute respiratory infection transmission \u2018may have occurred via contamination of provided respiratory protective equipment during storage and reuse of masks and respirators throughout the workday.\u2019<br><br>2015: This study claimed to be the first randomised control trial of cloth masks and \u2018the results caution against the use of cloth masks.

After all, masks are in use in hospitals for maybe a hundred years and we still have no reliable statistics on different types of masks and how they reduce transfer of viruses and bakteria. Let alone detailed data on the effectiveness of masks in the life of everyday people, including the handling and touching of used masks. This is not to say that I question the effectiveness of masks, after all we have a good plausibility for their function as well as partial studies and incidents where masks worked well (like the hairsaloon where tho infected hairdressers with masks didn\u2019t infect any of their 130 customers due to mask wearing).

Because A: Lockdown can pause the desease, but it doesn&#39;t eliminate it, in fact, places like Argentina, that had a very extreme lockdown, had the Coronavirus low for lots of months, but when Argentina decided to end lockdown because the economy couldn&#39;t stand it anymore, the cases of COVID rose a lot, and they are now with a huge COVID spike, and they can&#39;t do lockdown, because the economy is going downhill. Meaning that not only the lockdown causes severe economy problems, but because of economic reasons, it can&#39;t last long enough to terminate the virus, and when it ends, the country is now defenseless against the virus and huge spikes appear.<br>B: Studies have shown that being an outdoor or indoor environment is a very important factor to the spread of the desease. <br>C Mask producing has a much smaller effect on the economy than severe lockdown, not only that, it can last for whenever you need it to, not causing a spike because suddenly everyone stopped doing it. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s very likely that only mask usage is gonna end the virus, and the only thing that ended up terminating it was herd immunity, so our main goal should be flating the curve and toughing through the virus, seen that a spike in the curve can cause a cascade of problems that are in the long run worse than the virus itself, colapse of the health system, which can cause economical problems, increase the lethality of not only corona, but basicly every reason why someone would go to a hospital. So, my final plan for beating the virus is:<br>Lockdown on risk groups(basicly old people, locking them down shouldn&#39;t cause much damage to the economy<br>Disencourage indoor environments<br>Mass production of masks and encouraging their use.<br>By using that, you can still mantain people working, causing less economical damage, and avoiding curve spikes. Hopefully flattening the curve in a way that less people die because herd immunity is achieved, or it gives time enough for scientists to develop a vaccine.", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T20:43:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "El Aguilar", "comment_text": "Love from my heart", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T18:57:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0391\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b7 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5", "comment_text": "and how do you know that all the people are infected?", "comment_date": "2020-10-01T17:58:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "crooney82", "comment_text": "What about the social, emotional, and economic effect of an entire population wearing masks?

Our results now indicate that the amygdala does more than mediate the fear response, it also has an important chemosensory role. ASIC1a channels in the amygdala detect a reduced pH arising from an increased CO2 or from direct injection of acid. That CO2 initiates a fear response is particularly intriguing because rising CO2 forewarns suffocation, a terrifying situation that demands sensitive detection and action to ensure survival. Thus, it is interesting that evolution positioned a sensor for hypercarbic acidosis in the amygdala, a structure that stimulates the sympathetic nervous system for fight-or-flight and links to other brain regions involved in the response to threat. Thus, the amygdala both senses a threat, posed by CO2, and initiates a response.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808123/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2808123/</a>", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T18:43:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OmriR", "comment_text": "SKS", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T18:43:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Claire Wheeler", "comment_text": "In this study on virus particle dispersal through a mask we see them state that: <br><br>Surgical and hand-made masks, and face shields, generate several leakage jets, including intense backward and downwards jets that may present major hazards.

Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.<br><br>Conclusions This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks. This is an important finding to inform occupational health and safety. Moisture retention, reuse of cloth masks and poor filtration may result in increased risk of infection. Further research is needed to inform the widespread use of cloth masks globally. However, as a precautionary measure, cloth masks should not be recommended for HCWs, particularly in high-risk situations, and guidelines need to be updated.<br><br><a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577\">https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/4/e006577</a>", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T18:42:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Claire Wheeler", "comment_text": "In this study of studies we read why masks can be more detrimental than helpful: <br>Intuition would suggest that facemasks offer a physical barrier preventing the emanation of droplets from the oral or nasal passages and therefore satisfy the efficacy requirement of the evidence ladder. However, there are a number of different hypotheses as to why this may not be the case. \u2018Venting\u2019 is a phenomenon whereby air leaks at the interface between mask and face which can act to disperse potential contaminants originating from the pharynx.5 The accumulation of moisture, during prolonged usage, may exacerbate this problem by increasing resistance to air flow through the filter itself. Moisture accumulation is also thought to facilitate the movement of contaminants through the material of the mask itself by capillary action. These bacteria can subsequently be dislodged by movement. Friction at the face/mask interface has also been demonstrated to disperse skin scales which can further contribute towards wound contamination.<br><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4480558/</a> <br><br>In fact this study goes so far as to state that:<br>It has never been shown that wearing surgical face masks decreases postoperative wound infections. On the contrary, a 50% decrease has been reported after omitting face masks. The present study was designed to reveal any 30% or greater difference in general surgery wound infection rates by using face masks or not.<br><br>During 115 weeks, a total of 3,088 patients were included in the study. Weeks were denoted as \u201cmasked\u201d or \u201cunmasked\u201d according to a random list. After 1,537 operations performed with face masks, 73 (4.7%) wound infections were recorded and, after 1,551 operations performed without face masks, 55 (3.5%) infections occurred. This difference was not statistically significant (p&gt; 0.05) and the bacterial species cultured from the wound infections did not differ in any way, which would have supported the fact that the numerical difference was a statistically \u201cmissed\u201d difference.<br><br>These results indicate that the use of face masks might be reconsidered. Masks may be used to protect the operating team from drops of infected blood and from airborne infections, but have not been proven to protect the patient operated by a healthy operating team.<br><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736\">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01658736</a>", "comment_date": "2020-09-18T18:41:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Claire Wheeler", "comment_text": "Colleen Huber NMD looks at the studies in this analysis and states: <br><br>Surgical mask wearers had significantly increased dyspnea after a 6-minute walk than non-mask wearers.

There have been extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles. Furthermore, the relevant known physics and biology, which I review, are such that masks and respirators should not work. It would be a paradox if masks and respirators worked, given what we know about viral respiratory diseases: The main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles (&lt; 2.5 \u03bcm), which are too fine to be blocked, and the minimum-infective-dose is smaller than one aerosol particle.

As soon as your mask is on treat it as potentially contaminated. Dispose of disposable masks right away. Put your cloth masks in the washing machine as soon as you get home. 2. The majority of transmissions (atleast in the Netherlands)  Take place in familial or friendly gatherings in which people tend to be lacks with the rules and not wear a mask. Be careful with these still. Don&#39;t shake hands, don&#39;t share food, don&#39;t sit closer than 6 ft to eachother.

You have to either A clean it every single day or b have a clean mask every single day. Kn95 masks are a cheap Chinese knock off, that does not provide anywhere near the level of protection needed for this sorta thing. Any design with ear loops can&#39;t get a good seal around your face.

So far in my county (which does contact tracing), the spread through the at-large population is 2:1 close contact versus community transmission. In the prisons and nursing homes (counted separately from the at-large community) 100% of the cases are being ascribed to close contact. Yet we know that mask wearers are most likely to let their guard down and remove their masks when among close contacts. In the early days of the pandemic before masks were mandated it was even more dramatic that most transmissions were occurring in close contact situations. If we were to go by the data collected by my county we&#39;d have to say that mandated mask wearing is correlated with higher incidence of community transmission versus close contact transmission.

Yes, masks actually make the virus take longer to spread and increase the shutdown time, that&#39;s their entire purpose.

Masks only prevent straight line spread, and will most likely spread viral particles, sideways, or up down, to some degree, and in the case of what must come up, must come down. And in the case of what comes down, will either be upswept when someone passes by and then they will get it in their facial cavities, oh and if the viral particles hit the ground, then people&#39;s shoes will get the viral particles stuck to them, and then when they take their shoes off, well oops the particles got on their hands.

We know that it takes x amount of covid mass to overwhelm the immune system and start reproducing ie. spreading. That x is different for every single person. The rule of thumb that the CDC put out last was 10 mins of contact within 6ft transmits enough of the virus to be contagious. Using the math used here that means it would take 20min of contact within 6ft to transmit to a masked person.<br>Next point: what if you are 12 feet apart? Mathematically distance should decrease your risk exponentially, based soley on the fact that gravity is pulling molecules down at an exponential rate. In our experiment we discovered what is know as a super spreader. This man managed to get about 7 out of 35 total people sick. Why is covid coming out of our mouths? To spread and our body is kicking the virus out of your lungs where it is. So wearing a mask 24/7 could double the time you are sick thus nullifying a lot of that mask bonus. So my conclusion is that it is best to only use a mask when outside of the home and in a crowded area indoors.<br>Conclusion: The key appears to be airflow, we want to minimize the amount of covid we are inhaling by spacing out, being outdoors, and wearing a mask. But back to the beginning if we have a weak immune system and take in 25% because of masks you still get sick. So take care of yourself and stay healthy. Personally I will be freely exposing myself to covid because with a super low death rate I eat danger like that for breakfast, life is to short to live in fear.

If you have a leaking pipe, do you put the patch on the leaking pipe?

The video assumes the placement of the mask doesnt matter if theres only 1, but it actually makes a huge difference. In a sick / healthy contact where only one person is wearing a mask, theres a lower chance of transmission if the sick person is wearing the mask than if the healthy person is. This is because if the sick person is the one not wearing the mask, they&#39;re  still spraying infections microdroplets of saliva on you (the healthy person) when they speak. Then, when you later inadvertently touch your face or go to eat or something afterwards, you end up ingesting those microdroplets anyway and the mask has done nothing to protect you.<br><br>However, if the sick person is wearing the mask, a majority of those microdroplets will get caught in their mask and not end up on you.

This should be a bipartisan issue that we can all work together on and help each other out. It&#39;s a shame our leadership has not set the example and helped make this whole thing go better. <br><br>I don&#39;t want to turn this into a political argument, again, it&#39;s insane to me that it even IS a political argument, we should be able to speak the facts, and institute policy that protects public health, without even disclosing our political affiliation. But since it has become a political argument I have valid criticisms of both sides and how they have handled this. First, the president hasn&#39;t been an effective leader in this crisis. And if he had been then I think it wouldn&#39;t even be all that political. He would always have his critics of coarse, but I think it wouldn&#39;t be nearly as polarizing as it has been if he had just advised people to wear masks, wash hands, and social distance from the beginning, and listened to his experts in his own administration to handle it properly. That said, and I&#39;m trying to be delicate here, and give as much of the benefit of the doubt (I could be much harsher in my criticisms, but I don&#39;t want to feed into that). On the other hand, I&#39;ve seen incredibly hyperbolic criticisms of the president from the other side, saying he&#39;s personally responsible for EVERY death. I think that is pretty unfair to make those accusations. Covid-19 would have come to the US anyway. It would have infected people. And people would have still died. And that&#39;s even if the president had done everything right from the outset. EVERY nation on Earth has had to deal with this virus. EVERY country on the planet has been impacted in one way or another. Placing blame solely on the president is very irresponsible, and acting in a purely partisan way during and election year.<br><br>I don&#39;t have a side in this conflict. I&#39;m not pro any politician. I&#39;m not saying who to vote for. And I&#39;ve tried to refrain from saying who I intend to vote for, or not vote for. I think both sides have not handled things well, though perhaps in different ways. I think both sides have things they have said, or done, that has not helped us at all.  And that includes blaming the other side, as well as whatever actions have been taken, or not taken. Maybe you disagree with that statement, but if we are being honest with ourselves, then we know this deep down. <br><br>So let&#39;s first, set politics aside, and beat Covid together. We have the power to eliminate the virus and return to some kind of normalcy. Perhaps not completely, the world has changed in some ways that we can&#39;t go back on. And perhaps this thing will make us more mindful of other infectious diseases, such as the seasonal flu, which also claims many lives every year. But perhaps we can make Covid a thing of the past.<br><br>Second, let&#39;s admit that no side is completely right. If anyone is trying to spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, doubt) we should not listen to them. If they are speaking sane and logical facts, and they are encouraging us to work together beyond political boundaries, then we should listen to that. <br><br>And above all of that, even if you can&#39;t get behind the idealism, even if you have disagreed with the majority of what I&#39;ve said; if a business or a city or an organization has asked people to wear masks, we should wear them. We shouldn&#39;t be trying to find ways to get out of it. We shouldn&#39;t try to push back on it. We shouldn&#39;t assume they are part of some political agenda. We should just comply and wear masks to help protect the other people, the workers, and public officials we are interacting with. We should try to keep ourselves healthy, and protect our own families. Even if you don&#39;t think you will get sick, or you think you won&#39;t show any symptoms, how would you feel if you unwittingly passed it on to a loved one? A friend? A co-worker? Someone at the grocery store? What if that person had to go to the hospital? What if they had to be intubated (it&#39;s not pleasant, and can cause lasting damage)? What if they ended up dying from it? Let&#39;s not turn each other into enemies. Let&#39;s not spite each other. Let&#39;s instead think of those who could be impacted and hurt by our carelessness. Or even we ourselves could be impacted by it. <br><br>And let&#39;s not assign blame to others. Either getting mad that people are wearing masks, or that people aren&#39;t wearing masks. These people are not our enemies. They are our neighbors. Our community. Our friends. Our family. They are our fellow countrymen and women. We are all in this together. Let&#39;s be kind to each other. Let&#39;s be respectful of each other. And let&#39;s help each other out.\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\udca7\ud83d\udc4f", "comment_date": "2020-09-11T01:05:48Z", "likes_count": 94}, {"comment_by": "David Barnett", "comment_text": "This hoax will be over if Trump is re-elected.

Damage sense of smell. The olfactory nerve is the first cranial nerve and conveys special sensory information related to smell. It is the shortest of the cranial nerves and passes from its receptors in the nasal mucosa to the forebrain. It enters the skull through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone.                                                                            Prolonged use of N-95 masks in patients with preexisting lung disease could cause some build-up of carbon dioxide levels in the body. People with preexisting lung problems should discuss mask wearing concerns with their health care providers. So is it possible that wearing a face mask as part of social distancing can cause someone to build up so much carbon dioxide and get so little oxygen that they pass out, or worse? Carbon dioxide is a natural by-product of the body\u2019s respiration process, something we all breathe in and out every day. How harmful can it be? In rare cases, it can actually be pretty dangerous, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). They say that inhaling high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) may be life-threatening. Hypercapnia (carbon dioxide toxicity) can also cause headache, vertigo, double vision, inability to concentrate, tinnitus (hearing a noise, like a ringing or buzzing, that\u2019s not caused by an outside source), seizures, or suffocation due to displacement of air. \r<br>CHATTANOOGA, June 2020 Tenn (WDEF) \u2013 People across the United States are wearing cloth face masks in an effort to curb transmission of the coronavirus.

The second generation will transmit to 50% of their contacts, and so forth.

The general purpose of a Mask is to stop droplets. The mask can do it. When I wear a mask, my exit holes where droplets can leave, are covered. I can sneeze in my Mask and it stops a lot. It doesn&#39;t protect me as good, because not all entry points are coverd. When someone sneezed without a mask in my face, my eyes are open and everything is on my mask, right at my face.

Used poorly, masks can increase spread, what happens to the maths in this video if a majority of people use masks poorly... There are still many unknowns about how masks actually affects spread in society, it might and it might not.

Don\u2019t be misled.\r<br>\r<br>Every real world clinical study shows much lower percentages for the kind of masks that the public wears \u2013 with a 6% reduction in risk being the consensus figure from many clinical studies if less than a meter separates the two mask wearers for more than fifteen minutes.  And 100% risk reduction occurs if there is more than two meters separating the parties or they spend less than fifteen minutes together (by the way, these are the two conditions monitored by government authorized COVID-19 tracking apps, and they are the present medical consensus about transmission of the relevant virus).  Two meters is probably being extra safe since much of the world uses a one-meter rule.\r<br>\r<br>Even clinical studies using expensive N95 masks show little improvement over the cheaper masks worn by the public (see below).  The WHO complained at their media conference last week that residents of nations where the wearing of masks has been made mandatory are actually contributing to increased spread of COVID-19 in those nations due to complacency and too much trust in masks.  Stay apart or stay home to be safe.\r<br>\r<br>The best case found in any study is around 20% when just the infected person is wearing a mask, and about 5% when the just uninfected person is wearing a mask.  20% plus 5% won\u2019t get you close to 75% (they get you to 24%).  These were more intensive residential studies of people who were caring for a sick person rather than studies of casual public encounters where risk reduction is less or negligible.\r<br>\r<br>The 20% figure above comes from the few largest droplets being blocked directly or from slowing down the velocity of the average passed-through droplet so that it falls to the floor in much less than a meter.  The 5% figure comes from a few droplets getting tangled up in the fibers of the second mask.  But if the tangled droplet then dries out, the virus particle that was riding on the droplet might just continue its journey into the lungs anyway.  Don\u2019t count on the second benefit since no studies actually support the guessed at 5% figure, most experts say to assume 0% benefit.  A virus is an incredibly tiny thing that can often just pass freely through the fibers of any ordinary mask material (hence the need to use non-woven fabric masks).

What if there is a threshold that says a person will get covid 90% of the time if only 50% of the air is transmitted.

But nope, since only 2% (outside of China et al) know how to wear masks, the effective reduction would be 1.5% at that point.<br>Except we haven&#39;t even touched on the other parameter of just airborne spread... The virus actually has to become airborne for it to infect others.<br>Thus, wearing masks outside while maintaining 10 meters (30 feet) distance to others is not going to change a thing because the likeliness of you getting infected by airborne Covid-19 is practically non-existent.<br>It is only when you are in an enclosed space, especially with poor ventilation, that masks actually make a difference. And even worse are places where the virus can become aerosolized and thus linger in the air for much longer than a regular droplet of virus can.<br>Either way, that&#39;s why wearing masks in hospitals is a great idea... Because infected people are more likely to be there and even with good ventilation, there&#39;s a much higher concentration of airborne Covid-19 there.<br>The same goes for schools, child care etc. These tend to be really central points of disease transmission, Covid or no Covid.<br><br>The other major and ever present transmission method is that of contact. Which mask wearers really fail at in 98% of cases.<br>Usually, mask wearers wear gloves as well. But they touch the mask with their gloves, and they take off their gloves with their bare hands.<br>And when they administer hand spirits to clean their hands, they are touching the bottle with unclean hands and then put the bottle back in their bag with their cleaned hands... But now they&#39;ve re-contaminated their hands via the bottle.<br>Then they touch their clothes that they&#39;ve also contaminated with the virus without wearing their gloves so they are constantly moving the virus around all their personal items, including said mask.<br><br>Now then... Finally... Let&#39;s consider how deadly the virus actually is...<br>If you are under the age of 60 you may as well not even bother. The chance of you dying is abysmally small. You&#39;d be better off getting infected and get a temporary (or permanent, the jury is still out on this one) immunity to the virus.<br>Learn to recognize when you are actually infected and do your damndest to not spread your infection to others. It&#39;s much easier to maintain a strict &quot;no transmission&quot; routine for 2-3 weeks than it is to try and do it for 6 months or more. Especially considering you have no idea how to actually wear that mask and gloves properly anyways.<br>And if you are infected, don&#39;t go anywhere near anyone above the age of 60 because they, unlike you, are QUITE likely to die from the disease and they really should consider taking a full course in how to prevent cross contamination in every aspect.", "comment_date": "2020-09-08T16:25:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pat Wicker", "comment_text": "Contagion is binary not a percentage, a 50%  mask still contaminates you 100%.

Even good observational studies are not completely trusted unless they are backed up by clinical studies.  Laboratory studies are not accepted as proof of anything at all, and computer models are the hack journalism of medical science.<br><br>Fact:  There are no epidemiological or clinical studies that show mask-wearing by the general public is an effective measure against infectious viral diseases.  Not a few.  Not one.  Zero.<br><br>Fact:  There are a few decent observational studies out there (not hard to find, including a recent one for Covid-19) on mask-wearing by health-care workers.  The studies usually address infection rates for different types of PPE or as compared with the general public.  Not surprisingly, healthcare workers get infected at a much higher rate than the general public and, also not surprisingly, the type of PPE doesn&#39;t seem to make much difference.<br><br>So let&#39;s talk tropical medicine, in particular infectious diseases, my specialty (besides war-wound surgery) before I retired 17 years ago.<br><br>Lesson:  Viral infectious diseases are spread by three means; vectors, direct contact, and inhalation.  Vectors are unimportant in the spread of Covid-19, so we won&#39;t discuss that route of transmission.<br>Direct contact can be broken down into two subcategories:  The orofecal route and self-contamination after contact with a fomite.  A fomite is any object that has been contaminated by a pathogen.  Door handles, money, pens, phones, and keyboards are all classic examples of fomites.  The mask is a super-fomite.  Additionally, as far as the orofecal route goes, the Covid-19 virus is shed in feces for much longer than by the respiratory tract.<br>Inhalation can also be divided into two subcategories:  Inhalation of macroscopic particles and inhalation of aerosolised particles.  Macroscopic particles quickly settle (creating fomites) and their inhalation has never been considered the most important means of transmission of respiratory infections.  Obviously, if one is unlucky enough to be in the immediate presence of someone who coughs or sneezes, one can become infected by that route.  But a person (also obviously) who is coughing or sneezing should not be in public at all; they are NOT protecting anybody else by wearing a mask.  <br>As an aside, infectious respiratory diseases are called that because of the organs they affect, not because of their route of transmission.  <br>As far as aerosolised particles go, they are NOT stopped by masks or respirators.  Once again, observational studies point to this being true, and there are no epidemiological or clinical studies that show otherwise.  There&#39;s an obvious reason for this in healthcare, office, and school settings: a sedentary human being breathes about 400 litres of air per hour.  Not to burst anyone&#39;s bubble, but no mask created, whether it be cloth, surgical, or N95, can handle that debit.  And walking can raise that debit more than fourfold.  In an office setting, even with everyone wearing masks, one infected person can easily infect the rest of the staff simply by breathing.  And don&#39;t forget that her mask is an incredibly efficient fomite.  The microbes are not magically neutralised by the cloth.  This is the probable reason why healthcare workers, in spite of being trained and having good PPE, get infected at higher rates than the general public.<br><br>Fact:  Nobody in the general public knows how to wear a mask.  In surgery we wear a mask for a very specific purpose: to keep from contaminating the patient&#39;s open wound with unsterile macroscopic droplets.  There is no other reason.  We put the mask on just before the procedure, we NEVER touch it (a surgeon who touches his mask must immediately back away from the patient and allow a nurse to slip a pair of sterile gloves over his contaminated pair), and we throw it away immediately after the procedure.<br><br>I&#39;m going to cut this off here because it&#39;s getting too long, but would love to continue the conversation with anyone willing to discuss the facts and statistics of Covid-19.", "comment_date": "2020-09-08T15:08:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Phlegethon", "comment_text": "&quot;Authorities were trying to convince the public not to buy them&quot; is a bit of an understatement when said authorities in the US from the President, CDC Director, Surgeon General, Fauci, told people masks don&#39;t work.", "comment_date": "2020-09-08T15:08:39Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Yllka E", "comment_text": "Hold on.

You would immediately assume that this can only work to improve safety and you would never look at the possibility that it makes things more dangerous.
