This is a mathematical model that describes a way to model atoms. Sheesh. I wouldn&#39;t say it is better either... it&#39;s just a different way to think about models. All of science is a model based on a set up axioms which may or may not be true and which there is no way to prove them because PROOF only a mathematical/logical concept and is only meaningful in a logical system. Everything we do intellectually as humans is based on models we create of the universe.... those models are not real. The only thing that is real is the universe. But as we learn more about the universe using our models we learn our models are not perfect so look for better models... but almost inevitably always think our current model is the actual universe. In fact, it is likely that our models become counterproductive.<br><br>I mean, all you are doing is representing points of orbitals with spheres... nothing special and really adds zero to any intellectual understanding and ultimately is just a discretization of space which is quite common to do. After all, every point plot is the same idea. I don&#39;t see any real benefit from doing this except that it&#39;s cool to see. In fact, I&#39;ve seen this in papers 50 years old except they were just 2D static black and white plots which almost are likely due to not having sophisticated plotting capabilities.<br><br>The point I&#39;m making here is that it isn&#39;t a better way... it&#39;s the same way. It&#39;s like saying a point plot of a line plot is a better way to visualize a line plot and pretend it&#39;s some great new discovery. Oh sure, it will bring in the ad revenue so that everyone has to pay more at the store and people that really have no idea of science will thing it is unlocking some secret to the universe but it&#39;s really nothing special. Now if they somehow actually offered some insight in to how the internals of atoms really worked(such as if they revealed something new such as how atoms interacted with each other at the sub-atomic level then it might be something useful).

If you could zoom in and see light reflecting off an atom, which isn&#39;t possible in the traditional sense, then what you would see is a weird semi-reflective semi translucent cloud. What that cloud looks like would be reflective of its environment and it&#39;s structure. How reflective in translucent it would be would be reflective of how many electrons are in those particular orbitals. So in other words, it would be like a fuzzy mirror scattered in a weird cloud. Even in black and white light it would look quite psychedelic. The intensity of the reflected light would be proportional to the probability of an electron being at that location in the cloud. This is something that could actually be rendered by a program. If you had an intense enough laser source, and enough atoms and you were able to correlate the measurements, you could actually generate a probabilistic image of what this would look like.

That&#39;s because these &quot;visual models&quot; fail to represent 3 important aspects of electrons:<br><br>o Physical representation.  As you know, so-called &quot;electrons&quot; are not actually particles in a quantum sense. They&#39;re simply a maximum average point of energy in a field of energy that forms the various &quot;cloud&quot; shapes around the nucleus of atoms. So it&#39;s a bit like looking at sunlight reflecting off of a surface and asking &quot;where are the particles located?&quot; Or looking at a field pattern of magnetism and asking &quot;where are the particles located?&quot;  It&#39;s just too abstract. We may be better off asking: &quot;which point of a reflected surface is measurably the brightest&quot;. Or, which spot in a given magnetic field is yields the highest magnetic strength?&quot;  Those questions get a lot closer to what these &quot;electrons&quot; actually represents in their orbital field clouds. So seeing them represented as a moving mass of small particles is not much different than seeing water in an ocean wave represented as a moving mass of individual particles.  Helpful? Maybe.<br><br>o Speed.  The speed of a so-called &quot;electron&quot; in its orbital shell or &quot;wave cloud&quot; is not really depicted, other than as a slow moving mass of individual particles. (I believe electron speed was one of the items on your wish list). In reality, the speed of electrons in their orbital shells is close to the speed of light (depending on the medium). Thus, the movement of a so-called &quot;electron&quot; (remember, its just a maximal value in an energy field) is so fast to human perception as to be considered statically &quot;everywhere at once&quot; (much like sunlight). So if you could visualize a beam of sunlight, made up of photons, but shaped like one of these electron cloud formations, then you would be much closer to reality.<br><br>o Size.  There is also no sense of proper size or scale of the electron in relation to the &#39;wave cloud&#39; in which it is shown or the nucleus upon which it orbits. In reality, the size of an electron (average maximal point of energy) is so infinitesimally small in relation to the immense distance between it and the nucleus in the quantum scale. For example, a hydrogen atom consists of a single proton and a single electron. If this single proton was the size of a ping pong ball at the center of the atom, then we the farthest we would expect to find the electron would be about 4,040 ft away (about 13-1/2 football fields away) in its orbital shell.  And since the diameter of an electron is about 1/1000 of a proton, when compare with the scale of the ping pong ball, the size of the electron would be about 1/1000th of 1.5 inches, which is far less than the thickness of a human hair in relation to the ping pong-sized proton to which it orbits.<br><br>And look, I get it. You&#39;re animated 3D models were shooting for a different way to visualize the standard orbital clouds by bringing them to life.  So its a difficult problem to tackle. But I do applaud your efforts to try to represent something that is mostly conceptual to our human scale macro sensibilities to give it more of a &#39;tactile feel&#39;.<br><br>This video has good simplification of a way to visualize electron orbital clouds:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPkcDWLBsrI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPkcDWLBsrI</a><br><br>And I think one of the best representations of atoms, as a group, that I&#39;ve ever seen was in a 3D visualization of an actual atomic lattice structure. And while that did not attempt to depict the <i>inner</i> structure of an individual atom as you are doing, it did give a very real sense of the way in which atoms bind together to form the basic elements as a 3D rotating lattice stitched together from many images taken from an electron scanning microscope:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqLlgIaz1L0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqLlgIaz1L0</a>", "comment_date": "2022-05-10T13:23:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Last Chance", "comment_text": "At this level, quantum fuzziness dominates the shape of things.

As an engineer, Atsyukovsky in his work encountered a number of inconsistencies between electromagnetic calculations and actual measurement results, and, not satisfied with the assumption of errors that turned out to be too large with fairly accurate and thorough experiments, he began to study the initial work of Maxwell, and then his predecessors and followers. In the process of this study, he came to the conclusion that the rejection of the universal world medium was, at the very least, premature, and the return to it led to the creation of a simple mechanistic model, similar to the one that Madelung got mathematically. At the same time, the application of this model allowed to obtain error-free results in the original work and led to several special experiments showing its validity.", "comment_date": "2022-05-09T15:04:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blue Hobbit", "comment_text": "In the same vein, a depiction of our solar system would more accurately appear like a DNA strand as it moves through the galaxy.", "comment_date": "2022-05-09T12:28:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gibbyjibby0", "comment_text": "biblically accurate atom:", "comment_date": "2022-05-09T12:18:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ASDLI", "comment_text": "I do not have a physics background whatsoever, so these may seem like silly questions...<br>Can you explain why we cannot know the exact position of the electron?

While I agree a model of some scientific process is just that, a general model that does not capture the full nature of the phenomena and is innately incomplete, I would (subjectively) argue that a model still needs to capture some basic information, and valence/ electron count are I would say more important in that respect (3D model). I will agree though, this model is incredibly useful for 99.8% of things outside a higher level undergrad physics course and supplementing it with your diagram takes the cake.

Dont forget that despite the struggles and madness in this world today, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be<br>destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot; - if we break one in thought/word/deed it&#39;s as if we&#39;re guilty of all of them. Quite simply, living by the law (which is doing everything perfectly) is impossible for sinful humans <br><br>. The law shows us that 1. We will die in Hell if we fail to follow it and 2. We cannot save ourselves BUT, 3. God&#39;s perfect, immovable law points us to Christ, who followed and fulfilled the law in thought, word and deed perfectly in our place. He did what we couldn&#39;t and did it on our behalf. He was then sentenced to death on a cross, and took our personal punishment for our sin, paying our penalty (like paying our fine) completely FOR us, and has given us freedom. <br><br>If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life. He will help us through the struggle, the stress, and anything we experience in the world. It&#39;s about letting Christ in to guide and teach you and obeying Him through His power (not ourselves, we need Him to help us as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). <br><br>He is our substitute in His life, death and resurrection. He essentially rewrote history in our place so that, if you believe in Him, it will be as if you had never sinned if you accept Christ&#39;s death as our own in our place. <br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it. <br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. Hes giving EVERYONE a chance, He wants everyone to take the free gift of salvation from Hell. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through His power and abiding (staying) with Him. So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to follow His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and let Him lead in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the ultimate victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, pray for Jesus to come in and He will do what we can&#39;t. Give us The Holy Spirit who will guide us in the right way. <br><br>Christ says in John 16:33: I have told you these things, so that in Me you may have\u00a0[perfect]\u00a0peace.

I prefer the last one... what if... the electron is just appearing and disappearing at a rate given by its energetic value, that could explain why there is an oscillation in the formulas, and why when some measurement is done, it always found just one valid position (collapse and never a superposition). Vibration is the plausible way to understand all this, even how can electrons overcome the orbital nodes, how it can appear in a new orbital energy level on an interaction (trajectory problem), and many questions that our classical mind visualize; QM is not so weird if this plausible fluctuation is considered.

In some respect it is probably better to imagine the electrons randomly popping from location to location within the orbital without crossing the distance via something like tunneling. They may not do that either, but it is better than having orbits in my opinion. <br><br>If I were to rewrite the animation I would have one (or two, if it is a filled orbital) solid electron moving location according to the probabilities of the orbital, and it would have a fading &quot;tail&quot; for previous locations.

If they did they would slowly lose energy and collapse into the nucleus.  I know you mention Bohmian Trajectories so you know the jury is still out. What we perceive as electrons only exist when the wave function collapses to a point in 3 dimensions. And it&#39;s still debatable whether the location of the 3d electron is dependent upon the viewer not the electron. In other words an electron is a standing wave and it&#39;s area extends off to infinity. That&#39;s how just one particle can interfere with itself in the double slit experiment. Just one &quot;electron&quot; is big enough to span the gap between the slits. You could argue depicting an electron in 3D is to misrepresent what an electron actually is. We as humans simply can&#39;t perceive what they truly are. I guess what I&#39;m driving at is restricting an electron to 3 dimensions is hiding the fact quantum entangled particles occupying some higher dimension can extend far beyond even a 3D orbital &quot;cloud&quot;. It&#39;s entirely possible you would need a computer screen the width of the universe to truly represent what an electron really is.

If you can show the image without imposing your classic view of space and time then you will approach understanding. For example, you show your system of coordinates as fixed around a point.

The orbital layers are frequency amplitude rings with varying degrees of energy density (which are shaped by the signature of cymatic frequencies) <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23knowwhatimean\">#knowwhatimean</a>? <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23orisitjustscientificgarble\">#orisitjustscientificgarble</a>", "comment_date": "2021-05-23T07:36:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DanTheMan225", "comment_text": "&gt;since they are indeed real things<br>Oh no, they&#39;ve fallen for scientific realism :-(", "comment_date": "2021-05-23T07:34:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ultiminati", "comment_text": "We would love to see molecule models!

The rendition gives off two false notions: those blobs aren&#39;t electrons (even though it was mentioned in the video) and the spatial scale is out of proportion. I&#39;d like to think of it as a cloudy grayish transparent round portion of space, which can deform and expand, based on different electron configurations taking up different metric of space. A cloudy ball? For reference I also recommend molecule isodensity images. An atom is (probably) not like this very spotty and patterned thing. These models are based on hydrogen, who has 1 electron. Literally 1. Is it really correct to depict 1 electron atoms like this? With hundred spots similar to electrons, but not really being them. It&#39;s kinda ironical to promote a better/simpler visualization of atoms and then use wave function in the video to clarify the depiction and not really showing atom as an real unit itself, but a 3D model of probability density. For most people who have not studied chemistry in at least undergrad, this is already too complex to fully grasp.

I mean, out of context they both don&#39;t really explain what they are so it&#39;s neccessary to give some sort of explanation along side it either way. It doesn&#39;t really help me personally visualize an atom any more or than the common diagrams, but I already had a (very) basic understanding of how to look at them so maybe to someone who&#39;s just learning about atoms and wave functions, this model could be helpful, but no matter what model you use, there&#39;s no way it won&#39;t be somewhat misleading, like how it looks like each sphere is an actual electron. I just don&#39;t think there&#39;s an easy way to visualize atomic/quantum physics because it&#39;s just so far outside the realm of our intuition. You have to understand that what you&#39;re looking at isn&#39;t going to adequately represent exactly what&#39;s going on inside an atom. Honestly even the models we used before Schr\u00f6dinger are like, useful enough of a visualization if you understand that it doesn&#39;t literally look and act like a solar system.

By the very nature of a model, it is a simplification of what it is portraying. A good model needs to find the balance between being accurate and being simply/easy to use. A globe is more accurate than a map, because it is in 3D, but that very same aspect often makes maps easier to use and therefore they become preferred models, because the inaccuracies doesn&#39;t matter or affect us, when we use them for their intended purpose.<br><br>Imagine if you made a video saying that a globe is a better way to picture earth, while technically true, people would probably say that you missed the point about maps. Especially if you gave a Minutephysics approved version of a map.

That looks like it was a lot of work, and you did a great job with it!  I really feel that we need more philosophy of science in the realm of quantum mechanics.  We need to look QM in the eye and ask, <b><i>&#39;What does this really mean?&#39;</i></b>  I do think it would help if we stopped treating it like the old wave / particle duality idea, and started treated as a true quantum: a standing-wave packet that can (under certain conditions) behave like a single, independent thing.  As a wave, it can spread out or it can contract, depending on circumstances.  Clearly, this is where probability enters the picture.  But it is also a self-contained unit, which is subject to the forces of nature - the fields - and can interact with them, as well as interacting with other wave quanta.  Some phenomenon, such as tunneling, are not so mysterious if seen in this light.  Of course, other ideas, such as non-locality, must still be dealt with.  But let&#39;s chose this purely standing-wave quanta idea as a starting point, and go from there.

We often hear that atoms are made of vaccum. but this vaccum is full of EM potential. and I think this field should be considered as much a part of the atom as it&#39;s particle. it also define all the chemical bonds is can make.", "comment_date": "2021-05-19T13:43:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cobb m", "comment_text": "Plzz make a visualization of minkowski space time/Tessaract", "comment_date": "2021-05-19T13:43:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "UnderHamster", "comment_text": "Him saying that I must be interested in rainbow donuts since I stayed till the end<br>Me, just vibing with the music: Yeah.. obviously", "comment_date": "2021-05-19T13:43:06Z", "likes_count": 97}, {"comment_by": "ann/drew g", "comment_text": "Woa!
