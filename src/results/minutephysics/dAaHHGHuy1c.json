Its not like this idea hasn&#39;t existed before within our species past, but just within different subjects. For example, Theseus Paradox (or the ship of Theseus) purposes a similar idea. In summary its about some dude that has a boat but decides to  reconstruct the boat, taking the boats older pieces and then making another boat out of that. the question this paradox proposes  is which boat is the original boat. Now this is were I get pretty intrigued  because when you replace this paradox boat meaning teleportation and the wood metaphorically being a human body. This becomes a different problem because human beings have this thing called sentience. The fact remains that are cells atoms and everything about are body changes through are life time. See what I&#39;m saying is we had a completely different set of  lungs when we were a kid to when we are an adult. almost all of are cells are replaced as time goes on and we get older that means that new atoms are being replaced in are bodies every single day but its the fact that we are sentient which makes humans original and derived of purpose. Hear me out but what if its possible that it specifically takes sentient&#39;s and the will to test are understanding of the laws of this galaxy to reach things we think that are impossible like teleportation. When the likely reality of the situation is that it is very possible. We are just constrained to the materials we have on this planet and aren&#39;t able to advance because we know so very little about what is really out there in space.", "comment_date": "2020-05-05T11:26:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ricky Smith", "comment_text": "It takes Alot of Speed till you can slow down time to confuse time and it sends you to a different time", "comment_date": "2020-05-01T02:58:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Nobre", "comment_text": "so basically, &quot;teleportation&quot; means making a clone of yourself and then dying", "comment_date": "2020-04-30T23:36:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hui xue", "comment_text": "I\u2019ve watched two videos but I still don\u2019t get the tele-transporter", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T13:32:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wandering Genius", "comment_text": "So, that means i will be able to download food from internet?", "comment_date": "2020-04-23T03:17:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wandering Genius", "comment_text": "So, that means i will be able to download food from internet?", "comment_date": "2020-04-23T03:17:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ZaySensationalVibes", "comment_text": "Hi people from year 2136 hope you enjoy the past", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T09:36:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "AHF \u2022 7 years ago", "comment_text": "Its basically me but not me<br><br>A different person with the same memories of you.<br><br>What if sleeping is the same?<br>What if yesterday was the 9999998th version of you and today was the 9999999th of you and you will die tonight and another you the same memory will live your life tommorow..<br><br>What if everytime we blink we die..<br>What if every sec-", "comment_date": "2020-04-07T18:49:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrSaltyAuthor", "comment_text": "mate you just fixed a hole I dug my science fiction writing into, the writing is still in that hole but the hole has couches now and can watch Netflix", "comment_date": "2020-03-16T03:11:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Saj sultan", "comment_text": "A bit like star gate Atlantis ; where ancient human civilisation reaches a type 3 civilisation.

I don&#39;t know if the quantum properties are enough to preserve things like personality and memories so for the sake of the argument I&#39;ll assume they are. In this way I see quantum teleportation as being analogous to when the cut &amp; paste say a sound file. What you&#39;re deleting, remembering and  rebuilding in another place are the bits (for non computer nerds &quot;bits&quot; are the smallest units of data that computers understand) of which they&#39;re made. You could define that particular file as being the physical location on the hard disk on which the bits are stored and therefore the copy would simply be a cloned file i.e. not the original. I believe that most people (even if they don&#39;t, I still do) would say this isn&#39;t true because both the clone and the cloned are made up of the same bits, they sound the same etc so why should they be distinct from one another (i&#39;d be interested if anyone could give me a good reason why they should be, both when talking about sound files and about people).

Thus memories that you don&#39;t remember. the memories are only taken from one sense. say sound or sight, maybe even thought. but your brain fills in your other senses which could be why some memories are incorrect because the memory you remember is just a signal that was created by your brain not what actually happened. in regards to memory being signals of each other if we did deconstruct our bodies to &quot;teleport&quot; somewhere else we can&#39;t recreate memories and even if we could we couldn&#39;t place these signals where they would need to be to keep us.. well us. I say this because psychologically speaking, we act the way we do because of memories. So even if we had the proper memories if our thoughts were misplaced then we wouldn&#39;t be our selfs. we would have our memories but not in the right order. This is where it gets really hard to explain so try to work with me here. If a memory is made as a baby that ends up becoming a root memory that defines who we are, how we act. say you grew up with a parent who acted a specific way. Such as they wanted everything clean. So as a baby you see this and grow to think this as normal.(this becomes memory 1) but as you get older you go into school and you make friends, they come over and they tell you how much of a &quot;neat freak&quot; your mom is. (becoming memory 2) you start to question if that is normal. (memory 3) So now let&#39;s go over memory or the signals. if we lost those signals completely, as an adult we may no longer clean as much (because of memory 1), question anything (because of memory 2) and no longer think for yourself (as a result of memory 3). now let&#39;s just put all those signals back into the brain, but out of order, say backwards. you would have nothing to question from memory 3.you would question your friends them now for &quot;making fun&quot; of your parent, then you would trust only your parent because of the mistrust of your so called friends. the memories you have make you who you are, messing with these signals will change you from being YOU. if we break down atoms to teleport us we can&#39;t replace the memory signals that make us us. how do we replicate our electrical charges that are our signals, our memories. unless we can shock our brain is the specific way after reaching point B. but even so how would be find all of these signals that we make even faster than every second every day. <br><br>reply if you got this far. thank you.", "comment_date": "2016-03-16T03:37:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "WOWCRITS", "comment_text": "It&#39;s is only you....if your memories still exist.
