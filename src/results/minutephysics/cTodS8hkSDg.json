We may not know the exact kinetic energy of the particle, but it may be enough to get over the barrier. Nothing mysterious.\r<br>(I am use to electrons in semiconductors) and in a real system there are 3 dimensions for the electrons etc. to be moving and bouncing around in. So, you would expect electrons to be bouncing around in 3 dimensions, banging against the sides of the material and each other, so it should not be surprising if the kinetic energy of some of the electrons is more than the barrier. So seems nothing strange.\r<br>The quantum mechanics people may be thinking in terms of average energy, but electrons etc. don\u2019t move in \u2018average energy\u2019 in the real world.\r<br>\r<br>You could probably do similar with billiard balls. You could put a hump on your billiard table, and set it so the average energy of the interacting billiard balls is below the energy of that hump. But billiard balls don\u2019t go by averages. As the balls bang into each other, some of the balls will get enough kinetic energy to get over the hump.\r<br>Are there any experimental papers investigating this?\r<br>We should remember that quantum mechanics has been driven by theoretical physicists and mathematicians, who may not be looking at the real world in real materials.", "comment_date": "2022-05-25T05:03:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Harrington", "comment_text": "I guess I should have asked, why is quantum tunneling?", "comment_date": "2022-02-26T04:21:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Arney", "comment_text": "One of the most useless YouTube videos I think I&#39;ve ever seen", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T22:48:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Murshida Najnin", "comment_text": "Vgggg", "comment_date": "2022-02-02T12:44:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonth Grutz", "comment_text": "Basically anime super speed .", "comment_date": "2022-01-25T03:37:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Umur Karag\u00f6z", "comment_text": "Classically, you should be working, not going through &quot;MinutePhysics (chronological order)&quot; playlist.", "comment_date": "2022-01-11T09:39:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Meliokrates", "comment_text": "Wake up from the coma!\u00a0<br>The new physics knocks at the door!<br>The constructor theory results in two EXPERIMENTALLY PROVED SEVERE violations of the law of conservation of energy, which are described in the two links below:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\u00a0</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAydFMDKj2Y%C2%A0%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAydFMDKj2Y\u00a0\u00a0</a><br>Let us popularize the two links above as much as possible!\u00a0<br>Let us popularize the two links above\u00a0in any possible way!<br>Let us push forward together the technology progress and end poverty around the world!", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T12:38:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammad ALObaedy", "comment_text": "Anyone on YouTube with a pen is supposed to be smart and you have just broke that rule", "comment_date": "2021-08-06T04:59:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "vamosabv", "comment_text": "I was looking for a really short video on the topic.

We have to square the probability of the wave-function \u03a8 because the area of the sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere multiplied by 4\u03c0.

The Uncertainty Principle places a non-zero , lower bound on the product of the uncertainties in the position and the momentum of a particle, or, in other words, prevents us from knowing exactly the position and the momentum of the particle at the same time. Mathematically, it can be expressed as \u0394x.\u0394p\u2265h/4\u03c0. Let us assume that the electron is present in the nucleus. Let the diameter of the nucleus be d, the mass of the electron be m, and the uncertainty in its velocity be \u0394v.<br>Now, since the electron is inside the nucleus, the maximum uncertainty in its position would be the diameter of the nucleus. Hence \u0394x=d.Also, \u0394p=m\u0394v. Plugging these values in the Uncertainty Principle,<br>\u0394x.\u0394p\u2265h/4\u03c0<br>d.m\u0394v\u2265h/4\u03c0<br>\u0394v\u2265h/(4\u03c0d.m)<br>Now, d lies between (10^-15)m and (10^-14)m. For \u0394v to be minimum, choose d=(10^-14)m. Putting in the values of the constants in the above equation, we get:<br>\u0394v\u2265(6.626e-34)/(4*3.14*1e-14*9.1e-31)=5.77e9 m/s.<br>Hence for an electron to be inside the nucleus, the minimum uncertainty in its velocity, and hence its minimum velocity would have to be 5.77e9 m/s, which is not possible since it is much greater than the cosmic speed limit, the speed of light(\u2248 3e8m/s). Hence the electron cannot be inside the nucleus.

A ball rolling down a mountain? Are you joking? QT cannot be compared to a ball of matter rolling downhill.<br><br>Quantum tunneling occurs when energy is fired at a barrier, usually a lead wall at a defined thickness. And every so often the energy can be measured on the other side of the barrier. The distance from the electron producing device to the detector is known. The speed of light is also known so physicists are able to calculate the speed of the energy. They discovered that the energy does not slow down when it passes through the barrier. Instead it passes through the barrier like the barrier is not there. Meaning the energy instantly passes through the barrier and continues on it&#39;s journey. This is quantum tunneling. Energy passing through a barrier as if the barrier was not there. This has nothing to do with balls of matter.<br><br>I surmise, because of wave particle duality of light, the single particle that is fired out the device is not truly a particle but an energy wave of potential particles, plural! When the energy wave strikes the barrier, because it is a wave like sound, every so often, will reverberate instantly being transferred to the other side. That wave then continues on until it is measured. The moment the wave is measured is when it becomes a particle. In reality the particle doesn&#39;t even travel through the barrier at all, it was the wave. <br><br>Quantum tunneling of energy has nothing to do with balls of matter rolling down a mountain.", "comment_date": "2016-03-27T15:23:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kevin muhanji", "comment_text": "how does this explain how the flash moves through walls?", "comment_date": "2016-03-19T23:11:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cwf007", "comment_text": "Tunneling effect happens because of the mathematical solution of Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s equation of a particle blocked by a potential barrier.

But in Quantum Mechanics things don&#39;t really have a fixed position. In fact, things can get to places without reaching the places in between. That is quantum tunneling, and yes, this seems counter intuitive, and it is, but experiments show that the effect is there, in fact, if it wasn&#39;t, the sun could never fuse enough hydrogen to support life (which it clearly does).", "comment_date": "2012-11-17T11:10:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gresus", "comment_text": "I get the metaphor.
