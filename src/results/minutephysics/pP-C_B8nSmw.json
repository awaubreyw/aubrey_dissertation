How can you simulate an infinite universe that you only know 4% about? We have no unifying theory, we barely discovered the Higgs Boson, and we dont even understand the properties of dark matter/dark energy, or damn near 70% of the universe, yet these retards run a stupid simulation with a finite set of variables with a finite understanding of an infinite model?\n\nSounds like junk to me.
