The measurement problem is that we can only measure between 2 points in one dimension of space and one of time time in any single act of measurement, so we cannot measure the total value of the energy we can only deduce it. What we must do is use our understanding to apply the result from one dimension and extrapolate what the total energy generated within the system must be. We must also apply the very fundamental law of physics (and karma) cause and effect (for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction) and combine it with the reality of what the inequality that solves the double slit experiment proves, that energy is CREATED and propagates out in waves. This shows that it is not in fact that energy is conserved but that the initial value of energy detected along one dimension is conserved. It is always propagated with the same value in all directions but detected along one dimension which for total E (TE) is TE=E.\u039b^2t the \u039b is 13 also the number of dimension (13 like a rubik&#39;s cube) 13 to the power of time by 2 gives us the wave propagating out in all possible directions in positive and negative time. To twice the power of time because the energy detected is also propagated back into negative (antimatter) time from the initial source of the wave (and again backwards from every point/particle that is passed in the field but this propagates inwards so is immediately cancelled out). In summary: The fundamental building block of spacetime has 13 spacial dimensions (like a rubik&#39;s cube) so with every increment in conscious time the oscillation emanating from the centre of that block is propagated out in 13 directions to the power of twice the measured time. <br>This is also consistent with the proof of the Reimann hypothesis s=-tx.+tx=0 the total value of energy E at any point x is always the total energy arriving then propagated in positive time and negative time. <br>At the quantum point 0 the spherical field particle is the source of the wave and every propagation out from that point in dimensionless numbers has time as 1 which is the radius. That is until another force acts upon some part of the wave, in the field that force is \u03c0^p otherwise known as curvature and p being the total pressure caused by the angle at which energy hits curvature.<br> In metaphysical terms symbolised by 0 the spherical curvy, flexible, quiet, unseen, female physical Universe (dark matter lattice). Unseen until it is acted upon by the push of 1 the male conscious power exerting conscious energy (willpower) along one dimension, l and O the universal symbols of on/off, positive/negative, male female and the notation of binary. The resulting wave of the interaction of both emanates out in all directions detected/experienced as light and where that light meets more curvature matter is created and the conscious experience of physicality is possible as described in Eulers identity i=e^i\u03c0 (i in dimensionless numbers is -1 multiplied by -1 multiplied by negative time -t so -1=+1 dependent on your viewpoint...it&#39;s Relativity dudes). Energy creating more energy and physicality as it goes. From the initial force of consciousness causing the initial stretch in the flexible, beautiful, soft, but infinitely strong, curvy, female sphere as proven by the mathematics of Grigori Perelman&#39;s team&#39;s work on the Poincare Conjecture which I describe as a pulse propagating in 26 directions (\u039b^2t) from the initial inception of the universe and growing exponentially ever since. <br><br>Perhaps now physicists can start to embrace the new physics revealed by the double slit experiment and understand the urgency. The first law of thermodynamics is wrong, it is a mistake made due to the measurement problem (we can only measure between 2 points in one dimension of space and time)  Einstein&#39;s Relativity predicted white holes that generate their own energy and matter, yet 100 years later after almost every other prediction of Relativity has been verified physicists are still using an old model of stars as using up a finite supply of energy, models that do not add up (multiple anomalies). <br>New mathematics and evidence show OUR SUN IS A WHITE HOLE generating it&#39;s own energy as heat/light and matter (ejected as solar winds). The inequality that solves the double slit experiment proves what the interference pattern suggested, that energy is created all the time, the 1st law of thermodynamics and the measurement problem has blinded physicists from the reality. The full Genuine Theory of Everything has been solved but it is facing a wall of silence and/or misunderstanding. It is backed with the highest quality peer reviewed experiment data and robust mathematics. <br>Elsewhere, Scientists have found evidence that the sun goes nova (mini supernova) every 12,000 years usually causing mass extinctions, the evidence indicates the last one that happened 12,000 years ago wiped out the woolly mammoths and Neanderthals. All the signs are that the build up has started and it is about to happen again very soon (links provided).<br> We can&#39;t stop it but if people listen in time we may be able to minimise the damage <br><a href=\"https://youtu.be/88ReqQvDGdM\">https://youtu.be/88ReqQvDGdM</a><br>Full Theory of Everything that works <br>doubleslitsolution dot weebly dot com/springtimetheory dot html", "comment_date": "2021-05-23T07:45:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Plastic Sword", "comment_text": "this is confuisng", "comment_date": "2021-02-10T18:26:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hari Shankar Karthik", "comment_text": "In this video, you counted only gravitational potential energy...

So you know that conservation of energy exists, right? There&#39;s no new energy created or old energy consumed. It always goes somewhere. If you punch, you can lose energy but it just goes into the air.<br><br>To put energy conservation into slightly more simple terms, it just means that there is a constant amount of energy. How much? We don&#39;t know, but there is a constant amount of energy. If you compare the energy between two different periods in time, you&#39;ll just have the same amount (E1 = E2)<br><br>Let&#39;s break down energy. It&#39;s just the motional energy (kinetic energy) and the positional energy (potential energy). It seems that it is easier to just compare the kinetic and potential energies. We can break up |E2 - E1| into (|KE2 - KE1|) + (|PE2 - PE1|) (the sum of the positive differences of the kinetic and potential energies.)<br><br>A helpful physics equation for this proof is that the kinetic energy is 1/2 of the mass times the velocity squared (or 1/2*m*v^2).<br><br>If the velocity we are using is the difference in kinetic energy&#39;s velocities (it&#39;ll take a while to think of it), we can substitute it for 1/2 * m * (V2^2 - V1^2). We can use the algebraic Difference of Two Squares factoring tool to get 1/2 * m * (V2 - V1) * (V2 + V1). Some moving around brings us to (V2 + V1)/2 * m * (V2 - V1). That&#39;s the average velocity ((V2 + V1)/2) times the mass (m) times the change in velocity (V2 - V1).<br><br>But wait! Isn&#39;t the change in velocity also known as acceleration? Apparently so! Now, it&#39;s the average velocity times the mass times the acceleration. And mass times acceleration is force. That means that the change in kinetic energy is the velocity times the force. (vF.)<br><br>Now let&#39;s calculate the change in potential energy. Potential energy is the negative the amount of work (yes, that&#39;s the term) taken to move the object in question up to the current position. That&#39;s the negative force times the change in position. (-F * (X2 - X1))<br><br>The change in position is.... you guessed it! Velocity! So the change in potential energy is -vF.<br><br>Going back to our original equation, we can sort things out.<br>|vF + (-vF)| is the change in energy.<br>And vF - vF = 0.<br>So energy is conserved.<br><br>Calculus version:<br>Just take the derivatives of kinetic and potential energy with respect to time.<br><br>For a more rigorous version of this proof, check out Noether&#39;s Theorem.", "comment_date": "2015-01-11T22:32:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lewis Barton", "comment_text": "Why is it so hard to understand why some people will struggle to understand a video like this?

Thus you apply a force to the ball so it goes up until it&#39;s on the shelf. For the sake of making the model easier to understand, let&#39;s say put all the energy into the ball at once, say by kicking it.

When you take the ball off the shelf, it will fall back down because of gravity, and all the force of gravity you resisted when kicking the ball up goes back into the ball, making it have the same speed when it hits the ground as you accelerated to when you applied that force to that ball. All potential energy is is saying that when the ball is on the shelf, it&#39;s going to fall down fast because it&#39;s high off the ground so gravity has lots of time to put energy into as it falls. You don&#39;t even need the shelf, you kick the ball, and it falls back down so it has the same kinetic energy at any given height when going up or going down. The reason energy is conserved is because the forces on the ball only depend on it&#39;s position, not time or voodoo magic, so all the same forces act on the ball when it goes in the other direction, and it&#39;s speed will end up being the same. This might be easier to see when you make it so the ball falls through the earth and slings out the otherside, then falls again back through the earth until it&#39;s back where it began. The ball will always make the same oscillation, always turn around at the same point, because it moves at the same speed at any given point as the same forces always act on the ball at said point, time doesn&#39;t factor in, the balls motion just depends on it&#39;s velocity and the forces acting on it. Conservation of energy is just saying the ball isn&#39;t going to spazz out and change it&#39;s oscillations unless an external force enters the system. Of course, this assumes newton&#39;s second law holds and force only depends on position, so it&#39;s only a proof with those assumptions.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-09T09:03:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard", "comment_text": "so glad you are still making these frequently", "comment_date": "2015-01-09T08:31:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ganondorfchampin", "comment_text": "Would it be possible to create a system with potentially infinite energy by flooding another system with negative energy?\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-01-09T03:05:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JDPorter180", "comment_text": "this went so far over my head that when i looked up, i saw nothing.", "comment_date": "2015-01-09T03:01:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cajagato", "comment_text": "It&#39;s potential energy that always gets me.

The force is independent of time but there is no obvious conserved quantity here.. or at least there is definitely no position dependent thing you can add to the kinetic energy to get a conserved quantity. So it seems to be a counter-example. You can prove this too. Imagine two particles starting at ground level with the same speed, and so the same kinetic energy, but one moving horizontally and one directed slightly vertically. The horizontally moving particle has no force acting on it and so moves along at constant speed. The other particle starts moving upwards and is accelerated horizontally by the horizontal force, so that when it returns to ground level under gravity it has been accelerated. At the point where it meets the ground again it has a greater kinetic energy than the horizontally moving particle did when it was at the same point. There cannot therefore be a conserved quantity of the form Kinetic Energy + Position dependent thing.<br><br>In the Lagrangian formulation of mechanics I know it is true that symmetry under time translation implies a conserved quantity, but it&#39;s not necessarily true that every force you can think of in the Newtonian formulation necessarily has a Lagrangian formulation is it?

There&#39;s no measurable difference in an object based on how high up it is.<br>What happens to objects in space? Or at the Earth&#39;s centre?
