Here&#39;s the proof. This also explains why objects (including WHAT IS THE FALLING MAN) fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS E=MC2 IS CLEARLY F=MA ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that E=MC2 IS clearly and necessarily F=ma ON BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE.<br><br><br>ON THE CLEAR, EXTENSIVE, SENSIBLE, BALANCED, THEORETICAL, AND UNIVERSAL PROOF THAT ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 IS clearly PROVEN TO BE F=MA ON BALANCE:<br><br><br>Balanced inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Indeed, A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course); AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light (c); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE; AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma IN BALANCE !!! Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE, AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma IN BALANCE. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE; AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Accordingly, ON BALANCE, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Accordingly, ON BALANCE, it makes perfect sense that THE PLANETS (including WHAT IS THE EARTH) will move away very, very, very slightly in relation to what is THE SUN !!! ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. Inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY, as this balances gravity AND inertia; AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. GREAT. I have explained the cosmological redshift AND the supergiant stars. Stellar clustering ALSO proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma IN BALANCE !!!\u00a0<br><br><br>By Frank DiMeglio", "comment_date": "2022-01-03T04:09:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Luo", "comment_text": "um...", "comment_date": "2021-04-05T23:38:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uac15\ub3d9\uc11d", "comment_text": "\ubbf8\uce5c\uc0c8\ud0bc\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b\u314b", "comment_date": "2020-08-06T07:31:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nuoipter termer", "comment_text": "Actually, the video would be 7 point something seconds long.

Well I like them, anyway. Sorry that a lot of people don&#39;t, but no accounting for taste, I suppose.<br><br>For those of you confused about the concept of time dilation, maybe I can help clear it up with a bit of a thought experiment.<br><br>Say I were to build a Giant flashlight in the middle of space, and set it so that it would emit a beam of light every ten minutes.<br><br>I then get into my spaceship and travel away from it so that the time it takes for light to overtake me is about 20 minutes. Meaning I&#39;m traveling at such a speed away from it, that light takes twice the time to reach me (Seeing as I can&#39;t move faster than light, it will EVENTUALLY overtake me.) I do this until I see 5 flashes of light. So at this point I have traveled how ever far it has taken me to travel at such a speed, such that I saw 5 flashes at twenty minute intervals. So at this point it has been 100 minutes. (5x20=100)<br><br>At the fifth flash I then turn around immediately (Let&#39;s pretend for sake of argument I have infinite velocity, as that&#39;s the only way I could turn around immediately at that speed) and fly back toward my giant flashlight. Does it then make sense since light took twice as long to reach me flying away from it, that it should take half as long to reach me flying toward it? This would mean I would see a flash of light every 5 minutes. ) Than traveling the same amount of time seeing the flashes of light every five minutes, that would mean in my 100 minute drive, I would see 20 flashes of light, correct?<br><br>But wait a minute... If I traveled only 200 minutes in this round trip, than how could I have see 25 flashes of light? (5 on the outgoing, 20 on the incoming). I programmed that flashlight to flash every 10 minutes, meaning that the 25 times it took to flash is 250 minutes from the perspective of the giant flashlight. The only possible explanation is that while approaching the speed of light, time must have slowed down for me, from the perspective of an outsider, so that my 200 minutes is to the giant flashlight 250.<br><br>Say I took this to another extreme, an decided to fly away from it so that light would only over take me every 100 minutes. I were to then turn around immediately, and travel the same speed back, meaning I would see a flash of light every minute. In this example my 200 minute journey, I have seen 101 flashes of light.

When you&#39;re dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, relativity comes into play and you get time dilation- time appears to run slower on a moving clock. Therefore the 5 seconds for the moving computer would seem like 10 seconds to you. The factor by which time is dilated is called the Lorentz factor, and is calculated as 1/sqrt(1-((v^2)/(c^2)). Putting in v as 0.87c (87% the speed of light), you get a factor of 2. Because this video is 5 seconds long, if the computer was moving at 0.87c relative to you it would appear 5x2=10 seconds long.

Really. Can you go back to posting minute long videos or even longer. How hard could it be to put 50 more seconds into your video. I\u00a0loved this channel for the interesting facts about physics but this is too short for me to care about.
