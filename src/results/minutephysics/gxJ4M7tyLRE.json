This doesn&#39;t really explain why the stars near us do not light up the sky by night. The stars in our galaxy are not far enough to be shifted in the infrared, however we still don&#39;t see a lot of light when looking at the milky way. My explanation would be that it is because each star emits a finite amount of photons, and with the distance and the solid angle associated to earth surface, the number of photon, reaching the earth atmosphere and then being scattered, turns out to be pretty low, and so is the intensity of the light. In other words, we receive far more photon being close to one star than far away from billions of stars.
