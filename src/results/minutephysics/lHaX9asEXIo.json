A better example (in my opinion) would be the Netwonian, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations of classical mechanics. Each works with a different quantity: Force, Action and Energy respectively, but all provably give the same results. Three ways to think about the same problem that are all as good as each other. Sometimes we use one because it allows us to find the answer more easily, but we can use any and will always arrive at the same answer. I loved the video, and the main message is something I can definitely get behind: Our current models are provably broken and we should accept that they are flawed.
