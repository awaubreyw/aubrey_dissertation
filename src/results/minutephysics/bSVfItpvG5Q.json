Contacts are treated as external forces, which means you need to be able to solve both the magnitude and the direction of the force, which is not a trivial task when the shape of the object is complex. Also, for contacts to be actually any useful, you need to model the friction forces at the contact points, which is not exactly trivial either, since, among other reasons, many models fail to create any force at zero velocity. In total, this means any contact can need, depending on the models used, 4-8 individually tuned parameters to work. <br><br>Of course, if you are making a video game, things can get a lot simpler since accuracy doesn&#39;t really matter.
