Literally every point is rotating and orbiting around a denser point.  This is how the universe WORKS.  This is why the Milky Way is a thing.  The only time loop you can achieve is when you fly around the planet faster than the rate by which the sun reaches time zones, thus remaining either in the same hour or even going back further, but even that has you coming out the other end because of when your time zone concluded it stopped being yesterday, and it has moved on to today according to the agreed-upon rules of time zoning.  Basically, that one only goes so far, and requires something like an SR-71 or faster to accomplish.  Incidentally, you have effectively argued against time dilation theory in my favor with this video.  By proving that moving around faster than anyone else literally saves time, you have demonstrated that time doesn&#39;t work as the accepted theory.  To go back to the looping effect, if you left in a rocket ship to fly against Earth&#39;s orbital path, you would meet it far sooner than if you&#39;d left the Earth and waited for it to catch up to you, and certainly quicker than chasing it if your rocket doesn&#39;t have the power to outpace planets.  By flying towards bodies with either greater speed or by way of clever interception, you meet them ahead of any time in which that you didn&#39;t employ these actions.  If you were to travel faster than light, time dilation says that time moves slower for you and faster for them.  This looks backwards and you have explained why.  You are not running away from the planet and it isn&#39;t screaming away from you at a superior speed.  By this point, NO object is faster than you if you are running FTL, period.  The light from our sun takes about eight minutes to reach us.  If we hit it with a gravity lensing effect (It happens, sometimes, and causes some stars to seem brighter because more light information is reaching us more quickly.), we do not expect its acceleration beyond its normal speed to hit a small time dilation effect and take nine minutes.  The only way to make a fast-moving object take longer to move somewhere is if a force actively slows it down, but time dilation in theoretical FTL supposedly makes time slower for you so that it&#39;s a shorter distance when everything else supposedly accelerates, but that isn&#39;t how travel time works.  Things that move faster arrive quicker.  Time dilation only works in terms of HG Wells&#39; The Time Machine, whose forwards &#39;acceleration&#39; in time is slowing down his personal time to reach the future faster, and reverses to accelerate so swiftly to move backwards in time.  But that is not how movement in the normal physical dimensions works, as his mode of travel was strictly in the dimension that is the flow of action and reaction, duration and history.  It has no bearing upon stellar points in our galaxy.  They are mere locations, and they do not change time, only place.  The only question is whether we reach them in an absurdly-short amount of time (compensating for drift) or a very long time via sublight speeds.", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T04:24:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brostrod", "comment_text": "So living on a mountain and running a mile everyday can keep you younger?", "comment_date": "2020-02-11T23:45:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Askari Effect", "comment_text": "So the reason that people who exercise live longer is because they time travelled... further into the future?

Time is a concept human invented concerning ones&#39;  understanding of mortality and ones understanding of passage of moments or events and the changing of the environment around them. Basically, time is relative! For instance, how do we determine how old something is? by using an arbitrary system based on the Earth&#39;s revolution around the Sun meaning one year is equal to 1 solar cycle, but if we lived on a planet with a longer solar cycle shit would be all fucked up. 2. I believe &quot;time&quot; is a quantifiable variable and force that can be determined with a simple mathematical equations we just haven&#39;t figured out yet! Also, that &quot;time&quot; can be changed or manipulated. So, let&#39;s see, say you want to relive a moment of your life or want to stay in that moment forever, by manipulating &quot;time&quot;(the force) you can do that. Meaning &quot;time&quot; is a universal force/constant. I believe different parts of the universe   moves at different speeds. For instance, let&#39;s say we discover how to travel to different parts of the universe  and its takes 150 years(Earth time) to get there. If that part of the universe moves at different speed, which means &quot;time&quot; could be either faster or slower in different parts of the universe. One thing I hate about humans is our arrogance we take what we think we know about our known universe and determine that its a universal constant, when we gather our understanding of the universe  based on our seeable universe.", "comment_date": "2016-03-22T16:40:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rage Default Bush Camper", "comment_text": "TO COPMLICATED!

What would happen to you in that space ship in those scenarios? I&#39;ve always been annoyed by scifi tv shows in which you can travel very fast in the universe and everything is in regular time. For instance you could travel from one planet to another but relatively speaking it would pass a hundred years from the start of your journey till the end of it. But how would you age? Would you even exist if you go fast as light? Would you travel and age let say one year, and everything else in the universe one year times the speed of light? Would you even be counscious? Or for you would be one second, or one moment? I would really like to get an answer at that cause it has always been bugging me.

Note everything is relative, 2 am somewhere else is 3 am. You can set your initial velocity to any value and someone traveling in that initial velocity would appear stationary. A person in a car appears stationary to themselves and a person standing outside appears moving past you. This is the same concept. Its just that the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames which is not changeable so we base everything off that.", "comment_date": "2013-11-08T12:04:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Time", "comment_text": "Technically our brain takes 30 seconds to recognise things so we are living in the past", "comment_date": "2013-11-08T11:39:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "idkmybffjill258", "comment_text": "FOF: Frown On Face<br>The opposite of LOL<br>-created on the Engadget Popdcast 23/01/11<br>I&#39;m sad FOF :(<br>mark as favorite buy fof mugs &amp; shirts<br>fof frown on face engadget podcast lol<br>by amadeusz55 January 23, 2011 add a video<br>519 up, 63 down<br>Random Word<br>2.
