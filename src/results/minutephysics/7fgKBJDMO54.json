They change like all waves they oscillate in phases. The best way to detect neutrinos is to fire gazillions or to be technical %$#@loads of electrons in a concentrated stream directly forward and have neutrino detectors on all sides of the stream of electrons. The ripples will be detected coming out from the electrons, that is what they are, the ripples in the spacetime fabric as electrons pass. The guys down in Antarctica might be glad to hear they dont have to spend so much time away from their loved ones in order to study them. \ud83d\ude0a <br>What all particle physicists fail to understand is that particles are just constructs not separate particles and that we can only measure in one dimension of space and time in any discrete act of measurement. They are constructed of vortices moving through the spacetime fabric which is an actual physical transparent lattice (dark matter) and we can only measure the energy vortices that are moving in harmony with us. The energy is propagated in constant spherical waves out from every dark matter particle at the Planck acale and from every percieved &quot;particle&quot;. So Noethers Theorem only holds because it is limited to measurement in one dimension of space and one of time. The double slit experiment reveals that energy is propagated out in waves in every direction, the real measurement problem is not that the wave collapses but that we can only measure in one dimension so when we narrow the focus of the measurement parameters when detecting for which way we get twin band marks from single wave crests on the back screen not twin bands from particles. The inequality which proves this is correct is that ALL the waves get through the slits when we detect for which way but only a FEW get through when we don&#39;t detect and we get the interference pattern on the back screen. This is because the parameters of the focus on time have been narrowed from all waves that are detectable between the back screen and the particle gun (hence why some wave crests are hitting the front screen which is also within this range) to all waves that are detected passing through the slits.  This inequality is impossible and incompatible with the SMOPP and one dimensional time. They must be waves and time must be multidimensional at the quantum level. The 1st section in the Theory of Everything that solves, explains and Unifies Everything in physics explains the inequality and how it shows the SMOPP is the wrong interpretation, it should be the standard model of wave, vortex and manifold physics. (The fact this acronym spells SMOWVAMP which is much more melodic and funky than SMOPP should be evidence enough in itself that God the creator of the Universe is funky beyond belief \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude09 and therefore must be true, however luckily the maths and peer reviewed evidence is also there to sway anyone who doubts \ud83d\ude1d).<br>Doubleslitsolution dot weebly dot com/springtimetheory dot html <br>So where does all the excess energy go? It goes through us and through everything hence why the Earths core is so hot, it is very dense down there. Beyond a certain density the energy can no longer escape and a black body is formed, which then contonues to generate the energy and grow to eventually become a star and then a dark star (usually incorrectly referred to as a black hole which is the wrong interpretation)<br><br>All the energy that is not detected escapes in all directions at every moment. To understand why it is not detected imagine releasing a billion rats from a pit in the middle of a playing field and trying to shoot one from above in a helicopter, (I&#39;m fruitarian, the scenario is purely fictional, no rats are harmed in the writing of this comment)  getting locked onto one as they run away in all directions is difficult enough, when focusing on one the rest become a blur, in our consciousness they barely even register. Or in 3 dimensions imagine trying to film a single spark fly out as a firework explodes, the focus would have to be extremely precise and all other sparks would be a blur surrounding the spark that we focus on.

Therefore, we are waiting for experimental confirmation  :).\r<br>\r<br>Yes, the neutrino has a mass, and now we will try to predict it quite accurately.\r<br>For this we need to remember a little chemistry. For further explanation, we quote.\r<br>\u201cIt is more interesting to consider what happens to an electron in a region with linear dimensions smaller than the Compton wavelength of an electron. According to Heisenberg uncertainty in this area, we have a quantum mechanical uncertainty in the momentum of at least m*c and a quantum mechanical uncertainty in the energy of at least me*c^2 :\r<br>\r<br>\u0394p \u2265 m\u0435*c and \u0394E \u2265 me*c^2\r<br>\r<br>which is sufficient for the production of virtual electron-positron pairs. Therefore, in such a region the electron can no longer be regarded as a &quot;point object&quot;, since it (an electron) spends part of its time in the state &quot;electron + pair (positron + electron)&quot;. As a result of the\r<br>above, an electron at distances smaller than the Compton length is a system with an infinite number of degrees of freedom and its interaction should be described within the framework of quantum field theory. Most importantly, the transition to the intermediate state &quot;electron + pair (positron + electron)&quot; carried per time ~ \u03bbc.\u0435./c\r<br>\r<br>\u0394t = \u03bbc.\u0435./c = 2.4263*10^(-12)/(3*10^8) = 8.1*10^(-20) s\r<br>\r<br>Now we will try to use all the above-mentioned to describe the chemical bond using Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity and Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty principle.\r<br>\r<br>To do this, let&#39;s make one assumption: suppose that the wavelength of an electron on a Bohr orbit (the hydrogen atom) is the same Compton wavelength of an electron, but in another frame of reference, and as a result there is a 137-times greater Compton wavelength (due to the effects of relativity theory):\r<br>\r<br>\u03bbc.\u0435. = h/(me*c) = 2.4263*10^(-12) m\r<br>\r<br>\u03bbb. = h/(me*v) = 2*\u03c0*R = 3.324 \u212b\r<br>\r<br>\u03bbb./\u03bbc.\u0435. = 137\r<br>\r<br>where R = 0.529 \u212b, the Bohr radius.\r<br>\r<br>Since the De Broglie wavelength in a hydrogen atom (according to Bohr) is 137 times larger than the Compton wavelength of an electron, it is quite logical to assume that the energy interactions will be 137 times weaker (the longer the photon wavelength, the lower the frequency, and hence the energy). We note that 1/137.036 is a fine structure constant, the fundamental physical constant characterizing the force of electromagnetic interaction was introduced into science in 1916 year by the German physicist Arnold Sommerfeld as a measure of relativistic corrections in describing atomic spectra within the framework of the model of the N. Bohr atom (therefore it is also called the constant of Sommerfeld) [78, 79].\u201d See more pp. 99 - 103 <a href=\"http://vixra.org/pdf/1710.0326v4.pdf\">http://vixra.org/pdf/1710.0326v4.pdf</a> (Review. Benzene on the Basis of the Three-Electron Bond. (The Pauli Exclusion Principle, Heisenberg&#39;s Uncertainty Principle and Chemical Bond)).\r<br>\r<br>And now let us recall such a wonderful discovery as relic radiation. But suppose that the CMB is simply the spectrum of our Universe, and not the \u201cecho\u201d of the Big Bang. The fact that the CMB is the spectrum of our Universe strictly follows from the Interfering Model of the Universe, that is, the model in which each elementary particle fills the entire Universe in the literal sense. See pp. 51 - 52 <a href=\"http://vixra.org/pdf/1710.0326v4.pdf\">http://vixra.org/pdf/1710.0326v4.pdf</a> and Volodymyr Bezverkhniy&#39;s answer to What is quantum entanglement? ( <a href=\"https://qr.ae/TWpELi\">https://qr.ae/TWpELi</a> )\r<br>\r<br>Naturally, if we present the Universe as an interferential picture of all elementary particles, then such a Universe will have a certain spectrum. Moreover, in such a spectrum, the maximum will be determined by elementary particles, of which there will be more. It is clear that in our Universe most of all is neutrinos, let us recall the well-known fact that in a few seconds 10^14 neutrinos fly through our body without obstacles.\r<br>\r<br>The maximum of the CMB is 1.8725 * 10^(-3) meters. (\u201cThe CMB has a thermal black body spectrum at a temperature of 2.72548\u00b10.00057 K.[4] The spectral radiance dE\u03bd/d\u03bd peaks at 160.23 GHz, in the microwave range of frequencies, corresponding to a photon energy of about 6.626 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV\u201d, see Wikipedia Cosmic microwave background - Wikipedia (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background)</a> ).\r<br>\r<br>E = 6.626 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV. from this follows \u03bbmax = 1.8725 * 10^(-3) m.\r<br>\r<br>E = mc^2, \u03bb = h/(mc), h = 6,626 * 10^(\u221234) J*s\r<br>\r<br>Therefore, if we again assume that this is the Compton wavelength of the neutrino (since the maximum), but only 137 times more due to the effects of the theory of relativity, as in the case of the de Broglie wave in the N. Bohr model, see above. The determination of the neutrino mass is not difficult:\r<br>\r<br>\u03bbmax = \u03bbc.n. * 137 = (h*137)/(m*c)= 1.8725 * 10^(-3) m\r<br>\r<br>m(n) = (h * 137)/(\u03bbmax * c) = (h * 137)/(1.8725 * 10^(-3) * 3 * 10^8) = 1.616 * 10^(-37) kg.\r<br>\r<br>m(n) = 1.616 * 10^(-37) kg, or 9.065 * 10^(-2) eV\r<br>\r<br>where \u03bbc.n. - Compton wavelength neutrino,\r<br>\r<br>\u03bbmax - maximum cosmic microwave background wavelength,\r<br>\r<br>m(n) - neutrino mass, c - the speed of light.\r<br>\r<br>Thus, we obtained a theoretical neutrino mass value of 1.616 * 10^(-37) kg or 9.065 * 10^(-2) eV, which is consistent with the earlier made boundary predictions. But, our prediction is accurate. Therefore, we are waiting for experimental confirmation :).\r<br>\r<br>P.S. The question of why the Compton wave in both the electron and the neutrino in the \u201cworld of chemical bonds\u201d is 137 times larger than its normal value needs further research. But, now we can definitely say that this is due to the passage of time in various reference systems. More precisely, it can be said that this is due to the lack of time at the quantum level (in the Compton wavelength region), and with a certain dependence of the formation of the \u201carrow of time\u201d in the \u201cworld of chemical bonds\u201d and in our world.
