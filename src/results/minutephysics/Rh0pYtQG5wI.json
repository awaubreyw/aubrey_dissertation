So where is 2D and 3D?<br>Also if you squeeze the sheep into the different time stamp doesn&#39;t it mean that sheep is going back in time or going into the future? So cats speed can be constant but sheep is traveling through time without going with speed of light. What if you want to squeeze cat into different time stamp? Will cat&#39;s speed stay the same? <br><br>What if you are in a free fall with Ball in hand and there is a ball that is free  falling next to you too. Your max velocity and ball max velocity is the same. Now you try to throw the ball you have in hand down. What happens? Will the ball accelerates and goes away from you and ball next to you with speed from free fall plus speed you have thrown the ball all the way down to ground. Or will the trown ball accelerate for a split of a second and then slows down to its max velocity?!? Same will be if you were high up above the ground and  you would throw a ball ahead. Ball speed will depend on the kinetic energy putting into it. If the kinetic energy is small ball won&#39;t reach its max velocity. If the input energy is slightly greater to reach its max velocity then it will acceleratate to velocity greater than its max speed. Then it WILL slow down to its max velocity and due to resistance from air it will keep slowing down until gravity would pull it straight down. In the vacuum though ball would keep the speed that you have given it at start until some object with mass or some kinetic energy would be applied to it to change trajectory or to stop it. The point is what if light has max velocity in the vacuum only because something is holding it down? (dark matter?, dark energy?) also how can you measure the speed of light in the absence of reference points? If you don&#39;t know the exact time and point in space  it has traveled from to us how can you actually measure its speed? Saying that speed of light is constant on and around the earth might be just our local solar system speed of light. How do we know that light traveles at excact same speed in different galaxies? We know that no light can escape a black hole. So I can imagine there might be some light that could be in the orbit around the black hole. How cool that would be?!?

Anyway, Einstein had said he had never heard of MIchelson&#39;s experiments (but maybe they were somehow &quot;in the air&quot; at the time.)<br>The issue wasn&#39;t with direct measurements of the speed of light, but with the behavior of Maxwell&#39;s equations, which although relatively recent, had been enormously successful at describing electromagnetism.  They seemed to imply something paradoxical about the relation between space and time.  Many ideas were proposed to resolve the apparent paradox, nobody got very far.  It was a big problem among the top thinkers (Poincar\u00e9 and Lorentz, among others.)<br>Pretty much nobody would have accepted that the speed of light was a universal constant: it would have been regarded an absurd option -- until Einstein postulated it.", "comment_date": "2018-04-04T16:43:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Pulsar", "comment_text": "Movement and speed is relative, right? You can be in a state where you are moving for an observer in one frame of reference while you are standing still for an observer in another frame of reference.<br>But wouldn&#39;t that also mean that if light has a constant speed, regardless of the frame of reference from which it was emitted, there would have to be something like a genereal frame of reference of the whole universe and light is always moving with a constant speed relative to this frame of reference? (I&#39;m not claiming this general frame of reference actually exists)<br>And when I&#39;m not moving relative to this general frame of reference I could a emit light in two opposing directions and from my perspective both rays of light would move with the same speed. But as soon as I start moving in one of the two directions one ray of light (measured from my frame of reference) would speed up over the speed of light and the other one would slow down.<br><br>Is this so completely unintuitive due to time dilation? If yes, I hope it will be explained in the episode about time dilation.<br><br>There are also other problems I have with time dilation.<br>When I fly away from Earth really really fast and come back later I experienced less time than the poeple on Earth due to time dilation. But viewed from my frame of reference I was standing still all the time while the Earth was moving away from me and coming back. So why was I the one who is moving and experiencing time dilation and not the people on Earth? I read somewhere thart this is because I was the one who was accelerating and not the Earth, but acceleration is only the change of speed over time, so acceleration also should be relative and from my frame of reference the Earth was accelerating.<br>Different example. Two spaceships move away from Earth, each with 60% of the speed of light.

If motion is a series of probability checks as to how likely a particle is to move each time the &quot;cosmic d%&quot; is rolled, then light moving with a slope of one makes a lot of sense. Seeing as (from what I&#39;ve been told) the universe increments at absolute minimum on Planck Lengths of space and Planck Times of time, if we label our &quot;Time Globe&quot; on that scale (and if the speed of light is one Planck Length per Planck time, which I <b>think</b> its? Isn&#39;t that part of how one of the units was inferred/derived?) then that would mean that when the &quot;dice&quot; are rolled at each and every Planck Time interval, photons and other massless particles have a 100% chance of moving one Planck Length at any given interval. Anything with mass has some chance between 0%  and 100% (exclusive), giving it a sort of &quot;jittery&quot; path as it stays still at, say, 70% of the every-Planck-Time dice rolls, and moves one Planck Length on the remaining 30%. Zooming out to our scale, all of the &quot;jitter&quot; goes away and we see a particle moving at 30% the speed of light, or on a &quot;Time Globe,&quot; a line with a slope of 10/3. Quick note that my numbers might not line up - I reasoned through the math quickly - but I feel the idea comes across well enough.<br><br>Anyone out there with more knowledge, feel free to correct me if this is just wild nonsense, it&#39;s just a random intuition I had while watching this that just sort of clicked. It feels like it fits in nice with being unable to pass c though, as that would (on this model) require something nonsensical like a probability of movement each Planck Time that is over 100%, which is of course not possible and really just silly to even think about.", "comment_date": "2018-04-03T20:40:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MIXxer05", "comment_text": "I WANT THIS SERIES.

Simply amazing. I notice a few things and I have some questions. 1st at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh0pYtQG5wI&amp;t=7m21s\">7:21</a> I noticed the &quot;cats&quot; being spaced out differently before you mentioned it, and I though that this might also explain why light gets blue shifted when you (in this case the sheep) travel towards a light source (the cats on the right) and light gets red shifted when you are traveling away from it (the cats on the left). Is this correct? The second thing I noticed is how the &quot;time segments&quot; (horizontal grey lines) aren&#39;t horizontal (as you pointed out), although perhaps the sheep has its own time segments that are horizontal when it was put to the sheep perspective (but these aren&#39;t shown), correct me if I am wrong. There are some pretty weird implications about this that I can think of, the first thing is that this explains time dilation, as one second (represented by moving to the next figure) along the time axis is different from both the sheep and the human as 4 for sheep is about equal to 3 for human (the clock runs slower for the human). Although again, I might be wrong about this, but if this is right, I have a question about this. How do we know which one is actually experiencing time dilation? If we started with a diagram from the perspective of the sheep and there is another human, however the sheep itself is the one traveling 1/3 C (speed of light), but from its perspective the human is moving away at 1/3 C. So when we transform the diagram to the perspective of the human, according to this diagram, the human would experience time dilation, would it not? However, that&#39;s not how time dilation would work since the sheep is the one traveling at 1/3 the speed of light, so the sheep would be the one experiencing it. So what does explain the difference between one experiencing time dilation and the other not? The last thing I see is that these time segments represents the &quot;NOW&quot; moment of an object at a particular time, so when the sheep is traveling at 1/3 the light, the sheep&#39;s &quot;NOW&quot; segment appears to be equal to that of the the human&#39;s future. If so, could the sheep call the future version of the human and ask him what the weather will be? Does this mean that the past, present and future are all equally real and that the events of the future are predetermined? How do these &quot;now&quot; segments work or am I wrong about this interpretation?", "comment_date": "2018-04-03T19:48:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Orpheus", "comment_text": "Everything in and about this video is absolutely brilliant.", "comment_date": "2018-04-03T19:44:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frederic Conrotte", "comment_text": "BRILLIANT VIDEO !", "comment_date": "2018-04-03T19:44:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Kenny", "comment_text": "At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh0pYtQG5wI&amp;t=1m31s\">1:31</a> in the space diagram is the blue line &quot;moving&quot; relative to the red or just a fixed distance away and moving through time?

It is in essence the same religion that Allah (or \u201cGod\u201d) sent to all mankind through all His prophets at different times in history - the religion that had unfortunately been changed through human adulterations, theology and philosophy. That is why the Prophet Muhammad  came as the last and final prophet and messenger of Allah. He needed to come to remove all the riddles and confusion in the lives of people. He corrected matters of diversion in belief that were introduced by confusing human philosophy and theology. He restored the pure monotheistic belief of our Creator and brought the most perfect and most noble understanding of Allah (or \u201cGod\u201d).<br><br>The purpose of life is to know Allah, to believe in Him and to worship Him according to how He wants to be worshipped, this includes that we live our lives according to His commands. In the Quran, Allah tells us that since the messages of all prophets before the Prophet Muhammad have been distorted, none of these objectives could be achieved correctly except through His last and final message, and therefore He will judge people on the Day of Judgment based on whether they believed and followed Islam. Allah says:<br><br>  Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam.  (Quran, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh0pYtQG5wI&amp;t=3m19s\">3:19</a>)<br><br>In the same chapter Allah declares:<br><br>  And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers (in the Hellfire).  (Quran, 3:85)<br><br>Muslims believe that the present life is a trial in preparation for the next realm of existence.
