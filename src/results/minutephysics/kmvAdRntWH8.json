How&#39;s Ever doing right now?", "comment_date": "2020-08-11T01:57:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Raymond Mulholland", "comment_text": "&quot;At this point it isn&#39;t clear what any of us outside of Venezuela can do to help those inside the country - and this has been hard for me to stomach. Perhaps one of the best things I can do is to provide emotional support. Created by Henry Reich&quot;  Very interesting words.  The answer as to what can do for those inside the country is simple: pray.  It many not seem like a good answer for many, but I can argue the question was not a good one either.  Socialism only sounds good because it gives the people a secular messiah: someone who will fix the problems (real or imagined) if only the people give them unfettered control on doing so.  So the people give up all control over their lives and then act surprised when the problems the secular messiah creates is worse than the problems they had before, but that&#39;s not the difference that matters.  Since all law abiding people willingly gave up their power to the secular messiah, only the outlaws (which would include other nations intervening, as, by definition, they are outside the law of the nation in crisis) have the ability to challenge the secular messiah.  And since the secular messiah at least paid lip service to law and order, one should not be surprised that those challenging the corrupt regime are worse still.  Since law abiding people have given up the worldly means of making things better by electing a secular messiah, the only recourse they have left is the otherworldly.  So, however trite the answer I gave may seem, to those who voted in a secular messiah, prayer is the only weapon left.<br><br>A much better question, especially considering the state of crisis the Covid-19 has caused, is how to keep this disease afflicting Venezuela from spreading elsewhere?  Again, I would recommend prayer.  Christianity is the one and only institution that all socialist states in the history of the world have made a common enemy.  It doesn&#39;t matter if you think Christianity is relevant, socialists are only truly united in their belief that Christianity is relevant.  If they think prayer is a weapon they are vulnerable to, use it.<br><br>The other thing we can do is to stop pretending that &quot;kindness&quot; is the greatest virtue for man.  We don&#39;t think giving our kids a shot is &quot;evil&quot; even though it is unkind because we act on what is truly the greatest virtue man has (when coupled with the virtue courage): &quot;prudence&quot;.  It is prudent for a child to suffer a small shot than to suffer pain, become deformed and possibly die from a disease the shot will prevent.  There are things every government should do, and those that it should not do because the people should do it themselves.  In an age when it is characteristic for people to vote their own government in, the people have a moral obligation to be prudent on how much power the government should have.<br><br>I could talk all day on things that we should or should not do based on the virtue of prudence, but all short term answers will eventually become outdated.  Instead, I will end this with only one recommendation and pray that it becomes the spark that will light the fires of moral civic duty.  My recommendation is for parents to show this video to their kids and point out 1) that this was a socialist country that suffers so and 2) how remarkably scary that the early stages of this civil unrest are parallel to our own situation and 3) how the socialist sympathizing media is herding our country into a socialist state.  The suffering that will come from this &quot;shot&quot; of truth will be small compared to the &quot;pain, deformation and possible death (not to mention the author&#39;s idea of &quot;insanity&quot;)&quot; that a socialist state will bring.", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T06:47:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Astra Inclinant", "comment_text": "SOCIALISM DOESNT WORK", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T22:30:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Potato Man", "comment_text": "Imperial propaganda = unsubscribed", "comment_date": "2019-09-14T09:41:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vaasu", "comment_text": "I watched this 5 years ago when it came out, and I&#39;m watching it again now.

Maybe, thanks to your friend, you now have a better idea of what&#39;s going on here, but I know our case is one worthy of deep study, for it&#39;s a scenario the rest of the world is not used to, and this really goes back to at least the day after the fall of President Marcos Perez Jimenez (back in the 50&#39;s). <br><br>The thing with the getting used to that little bit of insanity is (in a very, very summed up way) because people here are &quot;waiting for a shepherd to herd the sheeps&quot; (a leader to guide the people in the streets so we can maintain a constant protest that will ultimately result in military power turning against all corrupt members of the actual government), but the only one who has showed capable of that (Leopoldo Lopez) is jailed in a military jail (Ramo Verde). The rest of the &quot;leaders of opposition&quot; are getting benefits from all of this mess, too, so they can&#39;t afford to get rid of the government until they at least have looted enough. This is something 70% of the people here actually know, and in other countries (maybe in yours), just 1/8 of the things happening here is enough for the people to rise against them and throw them out of the power. But because of the way politics handle things here, and the corruption, and the selfishness in general, no real leader after Lopez have had the guts to guide the people, or at least are trying to, but again, politics from both sides (government and opposition) are doing everything they can to stop the rising of new shepherds who can actually pose a real threat to their status quo.

They immediately blacklist the country, and this is what&#39;s caused the economic collapse of Venezuela. Driven primarily from without, not from within.<br>Now again, I&#39;m no huge fan of Chavez: he was pretty obviously undemocratic in many ways but simply look at the levels of inequality in the country under his rule.

Your video means a lot to us Venezuelans. Unfortunately our plight barely captures the world press\u2019 attention and it goes on unnoticed by most people. Venezuelans have simply had enough of 15 years of gross governmental incompetence, corruption, lies, hate rhetoric, steady decrease of live standards and squandering of the oil wealth. Back in 1999 Ch\u00e1vez was elected chiefly to tackle crime, corruption and inequality but it is precisely in these very 3 things that Chavismo has failed the most, despite having enjoyed relatively high popular support (at least to begin with) and unprecedented high oil revenues (for most of the last 15 years oil prices have hovered around the 90 US dollar mark). Some of the regime\u2019s defenders like to point out that extreme poverty has been reduced in Venezuela but the same is true in all commodity-dependent Latin American economies. During the last 10 years \u2018right-wing governments\u2019 in Colombia, M\u00e9xico, Per\u00fa, etc. have had more success reducing poverty compared to \u2018socialist\u2019 oil-rich Venezuela. Regardless what the statics say, I can assure you that 15 years ago shanty town dwellers lived in shacks built with bricks and corrugated roofing; nowadays one finds people living in shacks built with cardboard and plastic sheeting \u2013 something never seen in Venezuela before. Infrastructure has collapsed for lack of maintenance. The regular blackouts are due to broken generators in neglected old hydropower plants and the non-existing planning to increase electricity generation to match normal projected consumption growth. The oil industry, traditionally one of the few Venezuelan institutions free of corruption and run as a meritocracy, was politicised with government cronies. The resulting expulsion of highly-qualified Venezuelan petrochemical engineers has benefited oil companies worldwide from Luanda to Riyadh and from Houston to Perth. One by one the oil refineries have been closing down for lack of maintenance and investment. The Chavismo has exchanged profitable petrochemical income for mere crude oil exports - and a large proportion of this crude is sold at heavily subsided prices to buy half-hearted support for the \u2018Revolution\u2019 by a motley group of nations that offer little in return to Venezuelans in practical terms. The irony of this \u2018socialist\u2019 oil policy is that has hugely benefited the \u2018Capitalist and/or Empire\u2019 Western Oil Industries who are only happy to process Venezuelan crude oil. To make things worse, Venezuela\u2019s gas prices are amongst the cheapest in the world and the obliteration of the domestic refineries have forced the government to import gasoline at international prices\u2013 something it can ill afford. No wonder it has run out of cash despite the high oil prices. It baffles me how some people can still defend such regimen when facts speak for themselves\u00a0(and let\u2019s not get started on the obvious repression and suppression of civil liberties). Anyway, I&#39;ve got carried away\u2026I could go on and on.

However it is important to understand that the opposition in Venezuela is malicious and demands the overthrow of a democratically elected government, they are the ones who throw bombs &quot;binladins&quot; at the police, speculate with the goods by storing them in secret homes, burn tires on the streets, and many more criminal acts. Through out the past months the government has done nothing but arrange multitudes of peaceful negotiations in order to keep working to make Venezuela a more just country. If we ask why the opposition wants to overthrow the government, we have to understand the history of Venezuela. That for years a few wealthy percentage of the population have had control of all the industries including the most powerful one the oil industry. While the majority of the population had sunken in deep poverty and had been denied of the basic opportunities to live a life with dignity. The opposition which is heavily funded by the USA, wants to restore this old colonial world order at any cost. I urge minute physics to analyze the situation more carefully, and perhaps make a video to explain with clarity, the real situation in Venezuela.

Because we live in a country were all the government figures (Legislative, executive and  judicial) including almost all other state institutions and organizations like electoral, fiscal, economy, industrial, commercial authorities; mass media groups, radio, television and press;  state forces, military and police and the introduction of paramilitary forces (something without precedent in our history) are all subjugated to the government party. If anyone inside these groups raises his voice, they are automatically execrated. We live in fear, is really difficult to talk about what is wrong in our country if you form part of any of this groups, when the government is the mayor employer of the country and the unemployment rates and the cost of life are so high that losing your job is a serious risk to consider when you are a family man with kids to feed. All over the country people struggle to find all the basic goods for daily living. Only in the capital (Caracas) people found these goods, however, Caracas is beginning to suffer this situation too. The government in defense is deviating almost all the goods supplies from all over the country to Caracas. This with the intention of keeping the capital quiet as possible, because all the government is centralize in Caracas, and they can&#39;t manage a full scale strike in this city. The protest that have more than two moth occurring in our street are an expression of rebellion from the more brave and courageous of people. And every day more people sum to this cause. The government who have controls of everything and finance itself with the largest oil reserve in the world (which is from our Land) and use that money to buy goods, arms, peoples and minds.

Many Latin American people do not see in good eyes the US international policy, until today. Note that, I&#39;m talking about the US government, not the people. Sadly, we do not know if the crisis in Venezuela is because of revolutions policies or external interferences. In Chile, when Salvador Allende was elected, we too suffer from absent of some basic products. But now we know that it wasn&#39;t Allendes fault, the economic elite and media, with help from Nixon, help develop an environment to create a coup, and help install Pinochet. Chile was the first nation to fully make neoliberalism policies, and our &quot;democratic&quot; constitution is still base on and undemocratic install system, neoliberalism. :/ Latin America needs to deal with it self alone, as a subcontinent, and in peace, with no intefierence from the US goverments.

As a venezuelan who lives here since birth, and after seeing so much commie gibberish in the comments, I want to make things clear:<br>Aside from the sentimental soundtrack, none of the issues regarded in the video are distorted. There is a shortage of staple products, inflation doubles every year while the bolivar (national currency) devaluates, all forms of crime are rampant and take a weekly toll on hundreds of victims, and corruption is widespread in all areas of society, especially within the government as you can expect. This is the short overview of a situation that has gotten out of hand, which is the reason for the protests that have taken place nationwide during the last two months and a half. There is no such a thing as &quot;US influence&quot; on this whole matter, only incompetence from a demagogic regime (which, ironically enough, IS under Cuba&#39;s influence and that is an uncovered fact as opposed to unfounded conspiracy theories). The dissenters have no current leader since the former became a political prisoner; protests are now self-assembled either through internet social media (the only means of information that hasnt been censored by the socialist regime yet) or word of mouth.<br><br>Seeing all these paranoid, unpatriotic, self-hating, &quot;leftist&quot; morons in the comments baffles me to no end. I find it hard to believe that people who actually grew up in the first world and presumably had access to proper education could be this dense. Criticizing &quot;misinformation&quot; and &quot;political propaganda&quot; while disregarding the facts, throwing straw men and spewing out archetypal commie babble about CIA influence, fascism, zionism, etc., is an unmistakable sign of communist brainwashing propaganda per se. This is dangerous, since gullible people unfamiliar with this form of indoctrination might fall for their ludicrous misinformation and spread it anywhere else to enhance the commie circlejerk cycle. They disguise themselves as &quot;critical thinkers&quot; while condemning others for thinking critically. Their kind are known to support dictatorships in the Middle East and North Korea for no logical reason. Their ideals are untenable and their fallacious &quot;arguments&quot; deserve not even the slightest consideration or respect. Do not allow yourself to be manipulated by their bullshit.

We need to keep going for a long time and be strong so when there is not as much people in the streets as the day before or if we don&#39;t hear news of tear gas,arrested students etc... most of us feel like people are calming down and we fear that if they do, if we calm down at least a little bit.... we will lose our country. I don&#39;t think that when people refer to &quot;quiet&quot; they mean that is normal but rather that there hasn&#39;t been a strong protest for some time (even though it could be hours of &quot;peace&quot;), well at least here in Caracas thats how I see it and the reason I say it....

It has actually gotten so bad already that we are starting to lose our culture and more and more people are learning and speaking Spanish more often then our own native language (Papiamento). with all these things happening while i was growing up in Aruba it really left me with a sour taste for anyone Spanish.

I could list all the evil and bad things that the government has done, but let&#39;s just leave it at recent events: pacific protests have escalated only because the government doesn&#39;t want to hear us complain.\u00a0<br><br>They bomb us with EXPIRED teargas bombs (which by the way, can be lethal in long exposures), they have killed with rubber bullets (one of our first victims, Geraldine Moreno, was shot up close with rubber bullets; wanna know what the autopsy said? There were some bullets - among the 10 or so that they extracted from the brain - that were impossible to extract, her face was a canvas of rubber bullets).\u00a0<br><br>I live in the Capital, right next to Chacao and Altamira (two municipalities), which becomes a warzone every night. Right by my house I see whenever the national guards pass by - not just one or two either, although by now I&#39;ve given up on trying to count them. We use twitter to warn, and since I can&#39;t go protest I take it upon myself to try and be of help in that way. I&#39;ve tried documenting when they go past, and among one of those times I wasn&#39;t discrete enough and was shot at by the guards that were passing by (I wasn&#39;t hurt, thank god, but my little sister of 7 is traumatized - it felt surreal, like a scene out of a war movie).\u00a0<br><br>For good measure, I feel I should also say that the government is very obviously corrupt: hospitals are totally run-down and are missing vital supplies - like the picture shows, only worse: Cancer patients have no way to getting Chemotherapy, there are no major surgeries because of damaged equipment, some surgeries have had to be done in the middle of a power outtage, and having to use cellphone lighting instead of the necessary lights to finish whichever surgery had begun.\u00a0<br><br>It&#39;s a sad, infuriating, situation. \u00a0Thank you for enlighting people on this subject.<br><br>Also, for anyone that would like to know, this didn&#39;t just start out of the blue: Recently (cuz it happens very often), an ULA university student was shot and killed in a street robbery, then not very long after there was an attempted rape at a University in Tachira. In that city, students made pacific protests to get justice for the girl and those who tried to rape her. Since the court wouldn&#39;t take the case, things escalated to what they are now: University students unite to protest for all that&#39;s wrong in this country (shortage of foods, supplies, the insane amount of crime that goes unpunished, corruption, etc).\u00a0<br><br>Isabel, 19yo, American (but way more Venezuelian since I&#39;ve lived about 16 years of my life here).\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-04-10T17:57:59Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "LauraBundin", "comment_text": "I live in Trinidad, which is the large island to the north east of Venezuela.

Their is a way to truly combat these atrocities, but it is not a way of comfort. No this way, is full of treachery, and all can take it, but few do.

This is admitted on CIA&#39;s own website.<br>And USA started the second Iraq war based on obvious lies, killing a million people. UN Hans Blix inspected all the sites in Iraq prior to the war, even asked CIA for the sites where they claimed there were WMDs and there was nothing. Yet the nitwit americans still chant USA USA USA.
