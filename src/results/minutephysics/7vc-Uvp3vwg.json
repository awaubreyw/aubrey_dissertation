The simple explanation of a short pulse wave which is hard to measure because it is a wave, not a particle, make so much sense. The pilot wave which explain the double slit result as the photon interfering only with itself can also be explained better by this short pulse model of the photon.<br><br>The confusion of so many is to keep calling photons &quot;particles&quot;.<br>Once we realize that photons are short packets of vibrating energy and understand the implication of fourier analysis which tells us how a short pulse like a square wave is actually the result of a large number of sinusoidal wave, each oscillating at a frequency set to an integer multiple of the fundamental, then many mysterious phenomena suddenly become clear.<br><br>A particle can differ from another by it&#39;s size or mass. Photons are mass less.  Photons distinguish from each other by their frequency which historically could only be perceived thru the wavelength. The laser based clock (recent nobel price of physics) which improve the precision of ceasium clock by many order of magnitude uses the beating created from frequency difference, so they are effectively equivalent to counting each oscillation. The precision then reach the level of femtosecond, which is the time elapsed between each crest of each pulse of the sinusoidal wave that constitute light.<br><br>That beating frequency idea predate these high precision clock by decades... see the superheterodyne radio for 100 year old invention. The radar used by police also use the difference in frequency to detect car speed. A car running at 65 mph will reflect the radar pulses at a frequency approximatively 1000 hz higher (Dopler effect) which is easy to measure directly with low cost microcontrollers.<br><br>Contrary to the myth often propagated with the double slit experiment, photons can not be measured by any sensor located on either slit. Any measurement would imply extracting a small amount of energy which violate the conservation of energy inherent with the fixed frequency of each photon. In the case of fluorescence, a photon is absorbed by some atom/molecule, some energy is lost (converted to thermal energy, physical vibration) and some random time later, a new photon is emitted at a lower frequency.<br><br>That is the only possible case for photon detectors : absorb a given percentage of them using a beam splitter and let go unmolested the majority or absorb all of them and re-emit new photons at lower frequency with random timing, random direction and random polarization (but often fixed frequency depending only on the natural resonant frequency of the fluorescent material).", "comment_date": "2017-12-09T06:48:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dumais", "comment_text": "Thank you very much for explaining so well!", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T00:47:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dennis R.

Uncertainty principle of location and speed is not perceived in the everyday classical world. Only in quantum mechanics.

For example: &quot;Energy and time&quot; or &quot;location and momentum&quot;. Anyway it is not location and velocity. Moreover - the uncertainty principle is much simpler than what you describe. It says that 2 properties has uncertainty - means that when you try to measure one property you change the other one. For example, in order to exactly measure the location, you need to pinpoint the particle (&quot;grab it&quot;, or put it into a temporary tiny cage). But when you do it, you inevitably affect its momentum (velocity), because by &quot;grabbing&quot; it in a specific point, you don&#39;t allow it to move with its current velocity. In classical world there is no such principle because you can measure a location of something without interfering with its speed. For example take a picture of a &quot;car&quot; in a specific place while it drives. Taking a picture is a passive measurement action which does not affect the cars momentum. But in quantum mechanic realm this action is not passive.
