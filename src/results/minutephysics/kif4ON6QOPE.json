Would one of them be unable to move? <br>The only way I could patch up this paradox was to guess (again, very basic example) that for every foot of matter, there is a spectrum of 1-10J, 1J being the minimum amount of work, and 10J being the most amount of work.

I think it can be extended into another detail: it&#39;s easier to determine the stages of growth (kids to adults, gas to stars) than it is to determine how long each stage lasts. The aliens quickly see that there are adults and children and babies and the elderly. With a little more work, they can probably arrange the order in which humans move from one stage to the other, but how can they tell how long each stage lasts? Does a baby takes one year or 10 or 100 or even 1000 years to become a child? Imagine that you&#39;re an alien with a fuzzy snapshot of all the people on Earth at a given moment -- how could you determine how long we live? Now imagine that one of the aliens notices all the cases of humans with candles on a cake at what looks like a celebration. Smaller humans tend to have fewer candles on the cake, and larger humans usually have more. What if the candles on the cake correspond to the age of the human? Could that age be in Earth years? If confirmed, the alien scientist just hit the jackpot: a sample of humans who have a precise known age. Unfortunately, each of these individual clues are rare, and the &quot;birthday cake theory&quot; is hard to prove. How can they be sure that the candles corresponded to earth years instead of, say, the weight of the human? What about the exceptions in the data, like adult-sized humans that have only two candles (which, unknown to the aliens, are in the shape of numbers)? These individual clues and theories only become convincing after they are combined with many, many other clues, and it becomes clear that there&#39;s no good alternative explanation. Similarly, astronomers try to establish timing and distance using a rare type of supernova, but when the theory was first proposed, there was plenty of room for doubt. Many other small clues and competing ideas had to be considered before the type 1A supernova was accepted as a &quot;standard candle&quot; for determining times and distances in the universe.", "comment_date": "2016-07-03T18:50:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hans5958", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kif4ON6QOPE&amp;t=2m40s\">2:40</a><br>Text : <b>&quot;How Long To Fall Through The Earth&quot;</b><br>Video : <b>&quot;The Grandfather Paradox&quot;</b><br><br>duh", "comment_date": "2016-07-03T11:11:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GAME OVER \"WE HAVE EVERY PIXEL COVERED\"", "comment_text": "Uranus? no but seriously they come from the sun, the hole between us and the antiverse, and our black holes go to the antiverse to their Suns, cool cool. sex between universes.", "comment_date": "2016-07-03T09:10:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pemburu Bayangan", "comment_text": "Even not fully understand with your explanation though, always love with your artwork and quality of your vid and other vids  too..Nice job Henry", "comment_date": "2016-07-02T17:07:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pranav Mahadikar", "comment_text": "At the end<br>Minutephysics:- big gassy babies", "comment_date": "2016-07-02T16:35:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "schitlipz", "comment_text": "Damn distracting bass.", "comment_date": "2016-07-02T16:24:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "redline tuluks", "comment_text": "What if dark matter didn&#39;t exist??", "comment_date": "2016-07-02T15:01:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jigxaw", "comment_text": "if you want an easy answer to your question..try religion", "comment_date": "2016-07-02T14:28:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Braxon DiMAGGIO", "comment_text": "Is God real?", "comment_date": "2016-07-02T04:35:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Manzano", "comment_text": "El dibujo de la portada del video me pareci\u00f3 la forma de Mexico. <br>The coverage of the video  like Mexico shape.", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T23:16:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JustAnotherPleb", "comment_text": "@minutephysics how did giant balls of gas overcome Boyle&#39;s Gas Law?", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T23:02:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YawnGod", "comment_text": "I said once that &quot;The Big Stretch&quot; was a far better and more accurate name than the Big Bang.<br><br>Everywhere Stretch is also good.", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T22:04:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucas", "comment_text": "Good explained\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "comment_date": "2016-07-01T19:05:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jeffrey", "comment_text": "They uploaded a video.

I have a question, you said that if you look at a object 3 million light years away, you will see that object how it looked 3 million years ago since thats how long light took to travel. We know the universe is 14 billion years old, but many people say that the big bang (start of the universe) occurred at a central point. But if I apply  your logic, hypothetically if I look 14 billion light years away in any direction wouldnt i see the big bang occuring, and if so, wouldnt that mean that there are a infinite number of big bangs, since I can look 14 billion light years away in any direction.

Say for instance you don&#39;t get to look at all people in the world for 10 minutes, but just a sample of people. You need to pick a location from where to observe people to get the most information. So say we pick a very crowded mall. We might see people in most stages of life, such as infant, child, teen, adult, and old person. There is even a good chance we would see a pregnant woman.<br><br>But then the chances of seeing a pregnant woman go into labor at this crowded mall is fairly slim, and even if one did it&#39;s unlikely you would see an entire birth in that time. Furthermore, it&#39;s unlikely we would see the act of copulation at the mall. And even if we witnessed someone die, we wouldn&#39;t witness anything really about what happens to a dead person. I&#39;m not talking afterlife with that one, I&#39;m talking the whole funeral thing and putting a dead body in the ground.<br><br>I point this all out, because while we can observe the universe in various stages thanks to it taking light so long to reach us, we at best are making educated guesses as to how specifics happen and in what order. It seems logical that an infant becomes a child and that child becomes a teen and so on, but how exactly did that woman get pregnant? We might make some educated guesses that it has something to do with an exchange of DNA between two people and that&#39;s why children often look like their parents that we observe elsewhere in the mall. Of course these guesses might not happen if we happen in this 10 minute window observe adopted children. The fact that they are adopted isn&#39;t likely to come up at all, so to us we would just see &#39;This kid that looks totally different than the parents is still their child&#39; thus making us not realize the whole biological exchange thing that needed to happen.<br><br>Likewise, you talk about clumps of matter and dark matter pre-universe, but again we only have educated guesses. But where did these clumps originally come from? It&#39;s like we&#39;ve noticed a pregnant woman and said &#39;Oh that&#39;s where babies come from&#39; but we have no clue on how she got pregnant in the first place.", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T18:35:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jean leconqu\u00e9rant", "comment_text": "babies galaxies eat babies galaxies :(", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T18:34:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ankith Udupa", "comment_text": "Can I get 100 likes for no reason?", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T18:32:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "twn5858", "comment_text": "Do the\u00a0people in government have\u00a0the right to rule over\u00a0 you?", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T18:30:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "manasser99", "comment_text": "Big gassy babies XD", "comment_date": "2016-06-28T18:26:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yagyaansh Khaneja", "comment_text": "finally a video... from you and <br><br><br>..... from veritasium also.

I mean, matter only interacting by gravity looks like an extremely contrived entity only\u00a0serving as a cover up for\u00a0our complete misunderstanding of cosmology. If it&#39;s everywhere and there is a lot of it, wouldn&#39;t it be present on our planet as well? Does it phase through the normal matter if gravity if the only way it&#39;s interacting? Wouldn&#39;t it orbit gravity wells like stars and planets and eventually collapse to form a star within a star? If it&#39;s not affected by anything other then gravity solar wind would not keep it away, and even then we have plenty of hydrogen on earth. Not even mentioning it should be there before star even ignites. And as such, wouldn&#39;t it already affect our calculations, just making us think celestial bodies are denser then they are and thus making the whole thing useless at explaining more or less constant rotational\u00a0velocities\u00a0of galaxies? But why does it even need explaining? Wouldn&#39;t falling through (and so orbit)\u00a0the sphere (or disk) with the same density take the same amount of time regardless of the radius as was said in one of the previous videos? Why do we assume luminosity=density? It may just happen because outer parts of galaxies have formed earlier and so have less active stars and more neutron ones and other garbage that we can&#39;t see because it&#39;s literally dark.
