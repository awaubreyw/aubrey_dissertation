(Later edit: the more I revisited the text that follows, the more I am convinced it is off track. I leave it here to illustrate careful but wrong thinking on my part. In the meantime I am trying something new that I will post when ready) I took the time to review all this in a fair amount of detail.  Like some commenters pointed out I felt something essential about the paradox was not been captured and highlighted sufficiently.  Here is my attempt to sharpen, clarify, extend the many things  common to both twins leading to the apparent paradox . Then really narrow down and isolate the one difference that resolves the paradox.<br><br>&lt;Both twins while on earth experience gravity, the earth&#39;s orbit on its own axis and around the sun. Both twins experience the same passage of time until they start to separate.<br><br>It is physically impossible for one twin to go instantly from stationary beside her twin on earth to one third the speed of light for the full six seconds outgoing then six seconds incoming. There must be a period of acceleration followed by deceleration then acceleration in the opposite direction and a second deceleration to end up again beside the other twin. Each twin can measure the acceleration/deceleration of the other while claiming not to have moved at all in her own reference frame.<br><br>In other words, each twin can claim she has remained stationary in a single reference frame for the full duration of the trip by the other. For each twin, it is the other twin who appears to be doing the traveling involving two reference frames (one going, another coming back). <br><br>So both twins can measure six seconds outcoming and six seconds incoming from within their own single reference frame. Both twins will observer the other twin as taking 5.66 sec outgoing and 5.66 incoming.<br><br>The paradox is that when they meet each will claim the other is younger but this is impossible. The resolution to the paradox is that only one of the two twins will feel the additional acceleration tied to the movement of the rocket. It is this feeling alone ( and nothing in the mathematics nor in the reference frames of each) that identifies which twin is indeed younger.<br><br>Had the full return trip been possible with no new accleration/deceleration component beyond what both already had before separating, both would have felt exactly the same while measuring the outgoing/incoming times of the other twin. In this case both would claim the other is younger and no resolution to the paradox would be available.&gt;<br><br>Comments welcome!", "comment_date": "2018-10-20T22:51:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "thinkmoxon", "comment_text": "These are seriously phenomenal demonstrations, well explained, great length.

Brian said that to apply the special theory of relativity between two objects movement, the velocity between them has to be constant: dV/dt=constant which means that there absent acceleration da=0 which is correct in Einstein relativity. But that is the first weak point: if the acceleration between the two objects is equal to zero, then whether these two object exist each other or don\u2019t? And if the answer is don\u2019t, then how we can measure this velocity between two don\u2019t exist each other objects? Obviously this is the problem of special relativity, because to exist each other the two objects have to dynamically interact, for example if we are one of the objects, to see another the light ray has to reach this object which is field (light) interaction. More over according to USM <a href=\"http://www.kanevuniverse.com/\">www.kanevuniverse.com</a> in the spaces there is no empty space, which means that always exist dynamically interaction between all objects to be possible to exist each other.<br>The second weak point is connected with the velocity equality of special relativity and how correctly pointed out Brian, when in equation: u_x=(W_x+V)/(1+(W_x V_x)/C^2 )  the two velocities of two objects are equal between and equal to the velocity of light, then we obtain that u_x is equal to the velocity of light C as well, which means that there no matter whether the coordinate is movable or not (see page 48 USM). But is it possible the two objects to possess velocity of light even they are light rays themselves and by this way to become indistinguishable each other? The answer is no, because the light velocity is different in different mediums (different object have to have different velocities) and that is why we need this: <br>The problem of photon comes from this: The empty or absolute space doesn\u2019t exist according to USM <a href=\"http://www.kanevuniverse.com/\">http://www.kanevuniverse.com</a> because of the essence of creating the fields (all gravitation, electrostatic-magnetic and nuclear) and their interconnection regarding their quality essence and quantity sizes. So in the general relativity any where the velocity of light in vacuum must to replace with the velocity of light in empty space and because such empty space doesn\u2019t exist, that is the main reason that such velocity can\u2019t be reached. So obviously the photon can has mass in repose equal to zero only in empty space, which doesn\u2019t exist in reality, then all real photons in fact are virtual photons (relativistic photons) which in low velocities, their masses inclined to zero, but they have some masses through interaction with the surrounding matter (the surrounding matter carry partially light ray \u2013 experiment of Fizau). This interaction is realizes by the electromagnetic field in accordance with the equations of Maxwell Lorentz and in accordance with the essence of the light ray shown in USM.<br>What is the time nature on the universe? We physically define the time as a quantity of movement, for example one year is the movement of Earth around the Sun in full orbital cycle. But what exactly is this movement? To clarify this let return to the relativistic quantum mechanics where we choose such measurement units that the constants of Plank, divided by 2\u03c0 and velocity of light to be equal to 1, i.e. h/2\u03c0=c=1 (see page 345 USM <a href=\"http://www.kanevuniverse.com/\">www.kanevuniverse.com</a> ). So according to the known equation: E=h.\u03b3 where \u03b3 is the frequency of the wave and E is the energy, we can write that the relativistic \u201ccycle\u201d energy: E=\u03c9, where \u03c9=2\u03c0.\u03b3 is the angular velocity (frequency). But \u03c9 has dimension:  [s^(-1) ], which means that the time is converse proportionally to the cycle energy. But what about the next equation: E=N.t where N is the power of some process, it seems like the energy is proportionally to the time, but it isn\u2019t so because if we replace the power: dE/dt=N, we see that the time is again converse proportionally to the \u201ccycle\u201d energy, but the \u201clinear\u201d energy is equal to the work made up in some process:  E=A=F.s where (s) is the road which passes the force (F) and in this case it is the length of wave equal to: s=c/\u03c9  where c=1, so we can see that actually the time is proportionally to the distances (inside the cycle) as well and that is only about relativistic presentation of the examined functions. That is exactly how it is written here: What is the essence of the energy in the universe itself and from where it comes from and what is its value? From page 96, 97, 98 USM <a href=\"http://www.kanevuniverse.com/\">www.kanevuniverse.com</a> follows that in the beginning of springing up of Our space the full energy is equal to zero for us. Then with thickening of the micro cosmos and expanding of macro cosmos due to the asymmetry of these coefficients, which depends by our position of observation in this case our living position, we have the illusion that the energy for us is increases, because we are close to the nuclei of the atoms rather than the stars and galaxy. But the macro cosmos expands more rapidly by the same reason, so full energy in our space is again equal to zero. So it is seen that the energy is \u201cone reality in the illusion\u201d, as well as the world itself! See USM <a href=\"http://www.kanevuniverse.com/\">www.kanevuniverse.com</a>  So by this very elegant way (haw has liking to said Einstein himself) is determinates one of the most mysterious physical phenomenon in the universe!<br>So let return to the equation of time connection in the special relativity, (see page 47 USM): t^&#39;=t/\u03b2; <br>t=t^&#39;/\u03b2  As we can see the two times in movable and in immovable coordinates is fully replicable, then the time interval is equal to: \u2206t=(t^&#39;-t)=(t-t^&#39; )  (which means that the time can\u2019t has vector - representation, or some direction in the space). And the relativistic energy is equal to: E=1/\u2206t So what will happen if the time interval is equal to zero? The energy will be infinity! But such event is impossible to exist physically, so obviously the time interval cannot be equal to zero!? It means that the velocities of the two coordinates cannot be equal between and equal to the velocity of light, i.e. if that are two light rays. So to avoid this contradiction in the special relativity we need again shown above new definition of light velocity in accordance with the absence of absolutely space. From here appears new question: \u201cwhether the simultaneously is really existing in real, but not absolutely space\u201d? The answer is no, exactly because the absolute space doesn\u2019t exist, which means that we always have interacting accelerations between all existing objects in the universe. So how we can synchronize two clocks to begin simultaneously? The answer is that in real, not absolutely space it is impossible! So obviously we can see that the special relativity equations are always approximately, which is physically orderly if we can always estimate the error!<br>Of course again follows that the so called \u201cbig bang\u201d conception is impossible to occur, because the time cannot be equal to zero in real space and therefore the time cannot begin in this phantasmagoria \u201cbig bang\u201d point!<br>Finally several words about the well known formula of full energy: E=m.c^2, which again is exact only in absolutely space (where we haven\u2019t accelerations), but not in real space, where the exact formula is: E_m=0,98024mc^2 (see page 50, 51 formula 17, fig.13) USM <a href=\"http://www.kanevuniverse.com/\">www.kanevuniverse.com</a> where appears the energy of connection in any orbital system, which is: 9,38 [Mev] related to the mass of proton and without the inertia of the revolving mass, which is compare well with the fig.12 page 51.

The values of some quantities change depending on your perspective; such as the velocity of an object, the time interval/the distance that is measured between a pair of events, the energy/momentum associated with a physical system, the frequency/wavelength of light, etc. Transformation laws describe how the values change from the perspective of one observer (Alice) to another (Bob) depending on how the first observer (Alice) is moving wrt the second (Bob).<br><br>There is a transformation law for every quantity that is relative (i.e changes depending on your perspective). These transformation laws can be deduced from two experimentally verifiable starting points: <br>a) The laws of physics have the same mathematical form in all inertial frames of reference. <br>b) The speed of light in a vacuum is measured to be the same by all observers. <br>The laws of physics describe the patterns among the quantities that can be measured by any observer in a particular frame of reference. Transformation laws describe how those quantities change from the perspectives of observers in different frames of reference. An inertial frame of reference is any perspective from which no fictitious forces need to be introduced to account for any accelerating bodies. <br><br>An event is something that can be ascribed a particular set of space and time coordinates wrt some coordinate system associated with an observer. The space and time coordinates of an event are determined by measuring the distance and time intervals between the event in question and some reference event that has been chosen as the origin for the spacetime coordinates. Events that have the same time coordinate are said to be simultaneous wrt that observer. Events that have the same space coordinates are said to occur at the same location wrt that observer. Transformation laws allow spacetime coordinates of events measured by one observer to be transformed into the coordinates that would be measured by another observer for the same events. <br><br>The time interval between a pair of events (A,B) that occur at the same location wrt one observer will be measured to be longer by another observer who is moving relative to the first observer. The two events (A,B) will also occur at different space coordinates wrt the second observer. The time interval between another pair of events (C,D) that occur at the same location wrt the second observer will also be measured to be longer by the first observer who is moving relative to the second observer. This is time dilation. <br>The distance between a pair of events (E,F) that occur at the same time wrt one observer will be measured to be longer by another observer who is moving relative to the first observer. The two events (E,F) will also occur at different time coordinates wrt the second observer. The distance between another pair of events (G,H) that occur at the same time wrt the second observer will also be measured to be longer by the first observer. This is distance dilation. <br><br>We define the length of a moving object based on the positions of the endpoints of the object as they are measured to be at the same time coordinate. Simultaneous events (I,J) such as the endpoints of the object at a particular time coordinate, wrt an observer for whom the object is stationary, occur at different time coordinates for an observer for whom the object is moving. So by comparing the distance between the endpoints at the same time wrt one observer (I,J) with the distance between the endpoints at the same time wrt the other observer (I,K); we are no longer comparing distances between the same pair of events. This results in the length of moving objects being measured to be shorter along the direction in which it is moving.
