Let&#39;s say you started with 1492-1099 (I think that was the number he used in the video). 2-9=-7 then you subtract that from 10. Then you write a 3 under the first column. Then, you carry a 1 to the top of the next column (like you do in addition!) but you subtract the 1 from the top number. 9-1=8, 8-1=-1, 10-1=9. You put a 9 down, carry the 1. Next, 4-1=3. 3-0= 3. Because you didn&#39;t go negative, you keep the three instead of subtracting from 10. Also, you don&#39;t carry the 1, because it is not a negative answer. 1-1 is 0, and you have your final answer written out. 393. <br><br>In hind sight, this is very similar you the method you used, which I hadn&#39;t realized until I explained it. The first number is subtracted by 10, and the others end up being subtracted by 9, because you carry the -1. I hope this made sense!

Standard mathematics education pushes back important concepts such as Modular Arithmetic(Overflow in CS) or Abstract Algebra to the later part of the education. It&#39;s not arranged well. Some people think in base 10, but some people think better in Computer Science terms.
