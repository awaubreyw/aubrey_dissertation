A resonance is when a system with an intrinsic mode of oscillation is driven by an external source of energy with a matching frequency, such as when one tunes a radio to match the frequency of a particular radio transmitter.<br><br>But there is something called \u201cvortex shedding frequency\u201d which seems to be related to inducing the initial oscillatory mode.  What there isn\u2019t is a good explanation for the layman illustrating how the frequency is determined how the vorteces create lift forces.  <br><br>I think the wind just has to put enough energy into the bridge to exceed the loss of energy to damping.  It\u2019s like a simple musical instrument, like a recorder.  It has an inherent fundamental frequency for a particular hole configuration.  If you blow into the mouthpiece very gently, you won\u2019t hear a note.  When you increase the force of the wind, you will reach a point where the energy input is sufficient to sustain the vibration we perceive as a note.  Blowing harder doesn\u2019t change the frequency, it just provides more energy and more volume.  Is that properly called \u201cresonance\u201d?<br><br>What interests me is that the bridge deck first oscillated in an undulating mode.

Well, yes and no. More yes than no. The correct statement is that aeroelastic flutter excited a torsional resonant mode in the structure of the bridge.<br><br>The oscillations of the bridge grew because of lift forces first on top of the bridge and then on the bottom of the bridge. Those forces ~were~ driving the bridge at resonance, in exactly the same way that someone pushing on a swing at just the right time over and over causes the oscillations of the swing to grow. Had the bridge not had a resonant mode, nothing would have happened. Granted, the forces that excited the resonant torsional mode were dependent on the position of the bridge itself. But then again, someone pushing their kid on a swing only pushes when the swing is in the right position, too.<br><br>Granted, the situation is more complicated than a guitar string humming along to sound at a resonant frequency. But the resonant behavior of the bridge is central to events. The way that you build bridges that don&#39;t do this is by designing out strong resonant modes.

You are saying the bridge collapsed due to &quot;flutter&quot;, which is a kind of positive feedback loop in which more deflection of a surface in a wind leads to more force leads to more deflection and so on. That&#39;s a great insight. But you are also saying the bridge did NOT collapse due to resonance, which is at best misleading. The flutter runs away because there is not enough damping to take the vibrational energy imparted by the wind back out of the system. And THAT&#39;S largely because the bridge begins vibrating at a resonant natural frequency. You can see this with your own eyes in the video: the bridge settles into a vivid standing wave pattern. The key characteristic of such a resonance--just as you say--is that it allows more and more vibrational energy to be added to the system--by the wind, in this case. So &#39;flutter yes, resonance no&#39; is a bad way to think about it.

In fact what caused the bridge to oscillate in first place was vortex shedding. This happened for several days and during this lapse of time the bridge would oscillate in a vertical (not torsional) mode. It was only during the last 45 minutes of its life that the bridge started to vibrate in a torsional+flexural mode due to flutter.<br><br>But had not the bridge been oscillating due to vortex shedding in first place, the aeroelastic phenomena probably would not have happened neither.

What caused this amplification is not well known and there is some debate around it and several theories.

Vortex Induced Vibrations due to vortex shedding (vertical oscillations). This goes on during days.<br>2.Something goes down and flutter start kicking the last 45 minutes (flexural+torsional mode, no resonance involved)<br>3.Shit happens.

Torsional flutter does not require the periodic input of energy from the wind that vortex shedding does but it appears that the vortex shedding was involved in the transition from the vertical motion to the twisting motion. One can claim then that resonance did not destroy the bridge. However, if there was no resonance the cable band would not have slipped and the torsional flutter would never have started.
