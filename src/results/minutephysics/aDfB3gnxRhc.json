Imagine in the muon example above if they just forgot to account for the 5 GeV per muon power consumption and advertised massive &quot;theoretical&quot; power gains, but also forgot to say they were theoretical.

X-ray pulses every 40 picoseconds would allow the muon to catalyse close to 150 fusion reactions before getting ionised by the x-rays, freeing it from any nucleus it may be stuck to and allowing it to continue catalysing fusion reactions. This can be repeated about 500,000 times until the muon decays, giving about 75 million fusion reactions per muon, or 1.3PeV output per muon. Assuming 99.9% of x-rays fail to ionise the muon, this is still 1.3TeV output per 5GeV input to produce a muon.

So, what I want to do with this message is to simply show what the Gospel is. I am not trying to force my belief down people&#39;s throats. It&#39;s your choice whether you want to accept it. So, a question: Do you think you are a good person? If so, have you ever stolen anything, lied, looked lustfully, or used God\u2019s name in vain? (Oh God, Jesus Christ, etc.) You, I and most( most because babies don&#39;t sin, and maybe specifically mentally I&#39;ll people) purely human beings have violated God&#39;s moral law. So, if God gave you justice right away, would you be innocent or guilty? Obviously guilty. Heaven or hell? Obviously hell because you are a criminal in God\u2019s eyes. Don\u2019t try asking for forgiveness, what if you tried that in court: &quot;Judge, I raped a woman and killed her, but I\u2019m so sorry and I won\u2019t do it again&quot;?You would still go to jail because you shouldn\u2019t do it again and you should be sorry. So is there any hope? Yes, there is! Out of love and mercy, God became a human being, Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a sinless life and finally died on the cross to bear the punishment we deserve, we deserve to be punished because we have sinned. The reason why blood must be spilled for remission of sins is because the life of the flesh is in the blood, in the Old Testament Jews sacrificed animals for sins but the sacrifice of animals was enough for remission of some sins, not all. It wasn&#39;t infinite, unlike Jesus&#39;s. Jesus is the Lamb of God, the ultimate sacrifice for sins which is enough for all sins that have been done, are done and will be done. The Old Testament sacrifice of animals, the spilled blood of those animals could cleanse people from some sins but not ALL, unlike Jesus&#39;s.  He was buried and rose again. His resurrection proved that His death was enough to pay our penalty, the penalty for our sins. When someone pays your fine, the judge can leave you, dismiss your case, it\u2019s the same with God. Jesus paid our penalty and in order to accept the free gift of salvation from God, we must trust in Jesus&#39;s spilled Blood, His finished work on the Cross for our Salvation. And then your sins will be forgiven because of what Christ did, you will be saved!

What if I accelerated say, a nitrogen nucleus at a solid hydrogen target across a voltage drop, say in an inertial electrostatic confinement scheme. When the nitrogen nucleus hits a hydrogen, the impact produces 2 pions, which decay into a negative and positive muon. The positive muon strips an electron from the hydrogen, and the negative muon &quot;sticks&quot; to the nitrogen. The nitrogen, with a single muon in the 1s1 subshell, enters into a weird bond with the hydrogen, and the two fuse via muon catalysis, yielding a high energy helium nucleus which spits out of the solid target, and a carbon nucleus with a stuck muon. Because the confinement sceme is electrostatic, the 11+ charged muonic carbon goes on to capture another proton, to be become carbon 13,then another, to become nitrogen 14, then another, to become oxygen 15, which decays to regenerate the initial nitrogen catalyst (the CNO cycle). This elimates the sticking problem, as the muon will stick to the heavier CNO catalyst, and the generation problem, as the reaction is aneutronic and power could be directly generated from the momentum of the alpha particles across the electrostatic field. Would it be possible to generate the muons needed directly at the surface of the fusion target from a focused beam of CNO catalyst?
