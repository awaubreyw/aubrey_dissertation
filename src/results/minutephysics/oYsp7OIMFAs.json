The better idea would be to interrupt the signal by opening up the circuit rather than shorting it. <br><br>Also depending on the design, the input channel&#39;s initial amp circuit can be damaged by a short. It would be rare, but possible on some boards. Most of today&#39;s boards have resistors inline to inputs of one or more opamps so a short wouldn&#39;t be fatal. Still, you have to be careful building a shorting device that will get plugged into an unknown input. <br><br>Also, what if the cable doesn&#39;t get plugged into a board directly, but into some other device like a balun for the pickup or some outboard gear. Pickups are typically high impedance and need to be plugged into a balun on the stage to change the impedance. These are usually a transformer which can be shorted but some are active devices. You could find that one day the device shorts out something expensive.<br><br>If you don&#39;t use the pickup and the mic at the same time, you can use the same switch pole for the hot side of the mic and the pickup.

(experienced performing guitarists actually use treble boost pedals to increase this effect even further).<br><br>Bass guitars have all their top end cut, so they lose pretty much all their tone and sound more like a deep sine wave. <br><br>Vocals have bottom cut, are heavily compressed and usually have delay added.<br><br>So for fiddle, the best option would probably be to have a separate instrument for stage. One you can install electronics into without care, possibly even active electronics. And engineer it to sound as good as possible in the final mix through PA.

About the pickup, the entire thing has very little power output so shortcurting won&#39;t do much harm. The microphone is a different story. Be it a battery powered one (especially if it has symmetrical output) chances are it has pre-amplifier right after the actual microphone output. The output you shortcut is a pre-amplifier, which leads to overloading it, potentially damagimg the microphone as a whole. Now maybe I&#39;m wrong about pre-amplifier being in your microphone, but there for sure are pre-amplifiers in different ones, so even with the pickup, it&#39;s best to break the circuit instead of shorting it. Please note, that if you do so, chances are your output device will become noisy, because the broken input circuit now started picking up electrical noise from your surrounding, with good example being radio transmitters that you probably use to fiddle without being restricted by cables. In order to stop this noise, you must connect the input to the ground. Some may argue that you have still shorted the circuit, but keep in mind that the output from microphone pre-amp isn&#39;t being connected to anything, so there&#39;s no way it could overload. The part about LED was good tho. It&#39;s worth mentioning right resistance for an LED could be roughly around 1k ohms (but even 330 ohms is fine).", "comment_date": "2019-06-04T15:32:22Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "Tony McCallie", "comment_text": "Building your own pedals is SO satisfying.

The only thing I would have changed would have been to break the signal lines with the switch, rather than connect them to ground, thought it really won&#39;t make much of a difference, given the strength of the signals you&#39;re working with. If something were to happen and a power surge came through the line while you were muted (highly unlikely scenario, like literally being struck by lightning while you are on stage inside a building) having the signal tied directly to ground through the switch might burn out your switch/most of the wires inside. Good job on the soldering for a first timer though (at least the clips you showed us), and I agree wholeheartedly, heat shrink tubing is very satisfying.", "comment_date": "2019-06-04T15:20:00Z", "likes_count": 15}, {"comment_by": "PiaNoONE", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYsp7OIMFAs&amp;t=2m15s\">2:15</a> <br>Can you make a video about how the cancellation helps reduce surrounding noise?", "comment_date": "2019-06-04T15:17:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "electronicsNmore", "comment_text": "When you were describing the issue, I immediately had the same idea in mind.
