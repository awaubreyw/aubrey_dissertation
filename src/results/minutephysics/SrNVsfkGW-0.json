I suspect a lot of people are going to misunderstand an important part of what&#39;s going on here, and conflate the concept of light propagation delays for what the Lorentz transform really means.

If two supernova go boom, and I&#39;m in the middle, it <i>seems</i> simultaneous for me, but obviously if you&#39;re closer to one of the big badda-booms, that one <i>seems</i> to come first. I think you need to make it a little more clear that spatial distance is irrelevant... if the 2nd observer is whooshing past you at significant speed and barely grazes your elbow (so you&#39;re both basically at the same position, but with a different velocity) they will STILL see the ka-booms happen at different times.

If action is suddenly slowed, time consequently follows via relativity. The duration of time remains the same due to the relativity between divisions being directly correlated. I&#39;ll quote Mach and proceed from there. &quot;It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes of things by time. Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction, at which we arrive by means of the change of things.&quot; ~Mach<br><br>This statement means that time is derived from action. The statement also claims that time cannot determine action. Therefor, action and time are correlated (spacetime, as it&#39;s currently referred to). So, any instance where &quot;time&quot; was slowed must consequently mean that action was slowed. Essentially, time is just abstractions achieved by dividing relative action. These abstractions are events, chronological order, beginning, end and duration. Without relative action, crudely described as movement in space, the abstractions known as time aren&#39;t available. <br><br>Also, please note that time dilation, incongruous simultaneity for different observers, etc. is demonstrated in the theory of relativity by showing how the abstractions of time can be altered by operations which influence relative action. For example, you aging slower near light speeds would demonstrate slower actions relative to stationary people. Time didn&#39;t &quot;slow&quot; down for you or &quot;speed&quot; up for them. Someone wouldn&#39;t suddenly accomplish less per minute at near light speeds, and someone wouldn&#39;t accomplish more per minute while stationary. This is because the relative action between observers has been altered.<br><br>Let&#39;s look at our Earth year (a single revolution around our star). We can refer to it without referencing time, although we do have a name for it. We call it a year. However, let&#39;s call it a revolution, just for simplicity.<br><br>Roughly how many revolutions could fit between my conception and the present? 29.<br><br>Roughly how many revolutions could fit between the observable universe&#39;s big bang and the present? 13.8 billion.<br><br>Roughly how many Earth rotations can fit within a revolution? 365.<br><br>So, a revolution can be divided into roughly 365 rotations? Yes, that&#39;s it!<br><br>You see, time is the abstractions resulting from divisions of relative action (rotation, revolution, etc.). You can build up on this as intricately as you wish with things like quartz watches and atomic clocks. These layers of divisions result in things like events, chronological order, beginning, end and duration. My duration is 29 revolutions. My conception was on revolution 1987 of our widely used revolution tracking method.<br><br>Because my duration is greater in revolutions than my 18 revolution brother but lesser in revolutions than my 31 revolution brother, we can establish chronological order of our conceptions; my 31 revolution brother, my 29 revolution self, and then my 18 revolution brother.<br><br>We can use the same method to establish events such as the moment my 31 revolution brother hit me in the mouth with a rock, which was roughly 21 revolutions ago. my bleeding lip scarred over roughly 15 rotations.<br><br>The more consistent a divided action is, the more accurately we can derive abstractions of time from it. Therefor, we tend to gravitate toward actions such as atomic clocks with very little variation within their divisions. An Earth revolution is roughly 365 rotations or 1/13.8 billionth of a big bang-present. It&#39;s also some number of neutron star rotations or a fraction of Pluto revolutions. Every duration is just relative to something else. <br><br>There is no absolute time which exists absent of action. Time can be manipulated where rates of divided action are manipulated, but time is always limited to being a result of the correlation between the relativity of action.", "comment_date": "2018-04-27T15:18:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Petts", "comment_text": "One might sensibly conclude that all science is, ultimately, computer science (for a sufficiently broad definition of &quot;computer&quot;).", "comment_date": "2018-04-27T13:47:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Radar O\u2019Reilly", "comment_text": "Could you make a 3D printable version of the space/time globe?", "comment_date": "2018-04-27T13:32:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Smith", "comment_text": "Is this applicable to plotting the relative and true vectors of targets on a ship&#39;s radar from a moving ship?", "comment_date": "2018-04-27T13:16:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vini, Vidi, Vici", "comment_text": "You are amazing guys.\u262f\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2018-04-27T13:04:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christos", "comment_text": "Cool", "comment_date": "2018-04-27T12:52:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "L.Petrov", "comment_text": "From 1 to 10 how wrong is the theory of &quot;Speacial Relativity&quot;?", "comment_date": "2018-04-27T12:50:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "iTeerRex", "comment_text": "I know this topic.. but for those who are new the speed of narration maybe a bit fast.
