Once she gave her a little riding head thing cover of red things, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else; so she was always called &#39;Little Red Riding Red Thing.&#39;<br><br>     One day her mother said to her: &#39;Come, Little Red Riding Red Thing, here is a piece of food full of stuff and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is sick and not able to do things, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk good and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don&#39;t forget to say, &quot;Good morning&quot;, and don&#39;t look into every corner before you do it.&#39;<br><br>     &#39;I will take great care,&#39; said Little Red Riding Red Thing to her mother, and gave her hand on it.<br><br>     The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a 5 ten hundred things that help you tell how far you get from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Red Thing entered the wood, a wild dog met her. Red Riding Red Thing did not know what a bad creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.<br><br>     &#39;Good day, Little Red Riding Red Thing,&#39; said he.<br><br>     &#39;Thank you nice, wild dog.&#39;<br><br>     &#39;Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Red Thing?&#39;<br><br>     &#39;To my grandmother&#39;s.&#39;<br><br>     &#39;What have you got in your thing you put on?&#39;<br><br>     &#39;food full of stuff and wine; the day before today was making-food-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.&#39;<br><br>     &#39;Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Red Thing?&#39;<br><br>     &#39;A good half half of a 5 ten hundred things that help you tell how far you get farther on in the wood; her house stands under the three large trees, the other trees are just below; you must know it,&#39; replied Little Red Riding Red Thing.<br><br>&lt;  2  &gt;<br>     The wild dog thought to himself: &#39;What a nice young creature! what a nice big food stuff - she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act as if I was nice, so as to catch both.&#39;<br><br>     So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Red Thing, and then he said: &#39;See, Little Red Riding Red Thing, how pretty the flowers are about here - why do you not look round? I believe, too, that you do not hear how nice the little birds are singing; you walk along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is nice.&#39;<br><br>     Little Red Riding Red Thing raised her eyes, and when she saw the parts of the sun dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought: &#39;Suppose I take grandmother a fresh flower; that would please her too. It is so early in the day that I will still get there in good time.&#39;<br><br>     So she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And after she had picked one, she thought that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.<br><br>     While that was happening, the wild dog ran straight to the grandmother&#39;s house and knocked at the door.<br><br>     &#39;Who is there?&#39;<br><br>     &#39;Little Red Riding Red Thing,&#39; replied the wild dog. &#39;She is bringing food full of stuff and wine; open the door.&#39;<br><br>     &#39;Lift the thing that helps you open the door,&#39; called out the grandmother, &#39;I am too not able to do things, and cannot get up.&#39;<br><br>     The wild dog lifted the thing that helps you open the door, the door sprang open, and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmother&#39;s bed, and ate her. Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her clothes, laid himself in bed and drew the window hiding things.<br><br>     Little Red Riding Red Thing, however, had been running about picking flowers, and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.<br><br>&lt;  3  &gt;<br>     She was surprised to find the house-door standing open, and when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself: &#39;Oh my! how scared I feel today, and at other times I like being with grandmother so much.&#39; She called out: &#39;Good morning,&#39; but received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the window hiding things. There lay her grandmother with her clothes pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.<br><br>     &#39;Oh! grandmother,&#39; she said, &#39;what big ears you have!&#39;<br><br>     &#39;All the better to hear you with, my child,&#39; was the reply.<br><br>     &#39;But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!&#39; she said.<br><br>     &#39;All the better to see you with, my love.&#39;<br><br>     &#39;But, grandmother, what large hands you have!&#39;<br><br>     &#39;All the better to love you with.&#39;<br><br>     &#39;Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!&#39;<br><br>     &#39;All the better to eat you with!&#39;<br><br>     And quickly had the wild dog said this, than with one jump he was out of bed and ate up Red Riding Red Thing.<br><br>     When the wild dog had calmed his food feeling, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to make noises that were very loud.<br><br>     The man who kills things but is not in the country service was just passing the house, and thought to himself: &#39;How the old woman is making noises! I must just see if she wants anything.&#39; So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw that the wild dog was lying in it.<br><br>     &#39;Do I find you here, you old bad thing!&#39; said he. &#39;I have long tried to find you!&#39; But just as he was going to fire at him, it came to him that the wild dog might have ate the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did not fire, but took a pair of cutters, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wild dog.<br><br>&lt;  4  &gt;<br>     When he had made two cut marks, he saw the little red riding Red Thing making sun light, and then he made two cut marks more, and the little girl sprang out, crying: &#39;Ah, how scared I have been! How dark it was inside the wild dog.&#39;<br><br>     After that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but quickly able to breathe. Red Riding Red Thing, however, quickly took great stones with which they filled the wild dog&#39;s food thing, and when he became not asleep, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he fell at once, and fell dead.<br><br>     Then all three were happy. The man who kills things but is not in the country service drew off the wild dog&#39;s skin and went home with it; the grandmother ate the food full of stuff and drank the wine which Red Riding Red Thing had brought, and was better. But Red Riding Red Thing thought to herself: &#39;As long as I live, I will never leave the path by myself to run into the wood, when my mother has not made me to do so.&#39;<br><br> <br><br>It is also some story that once, when Red Riding Red Thing was again taking food full of stuffs to the old grandmother, another wild dog spoke to her, and tried to take her away her from the path. Red Riding Red Thing, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wild dog, and that he had said &#39;good morning&#39; to her, but with such a bad look in his eyes, that if they had not been on the people&#39;s road she was certain he would have eaten her up.<br><br>     &#39;Well,&#39; said the grandmother, &#39;we will shut the door, so that he can not come in.&#39;<br><br>     Soon after the wild dog knocked, and cried: &#39;Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red Riding Red Thing, and am bringing you some food full of stuffs.&#39;<br><br>     But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-hair stole twice or three times round the house, and at last jumped on the roof, wanting to wait until Red Riding Red Thing went home in the almost night, and then to steal after her and eat her in the darkness. But the grandmother saw what was in his thoughts.<br><br>&lt;  5  &gt;<br>     In front of the house was a great stone thing that carries things, so she said to the child: &#39;Take the thing that is metal and carries things, Red Riding Red Thing; I made some animal sticks the day before today, so carry the water in which I put them in water them to the thing that carries things.&#39;<br><br>     Red Riding Red Thing carried until the great thing that carries things was quite full. Then the smell of the animal sticks reached the wild dog, and he made his nose sense things and looked down, and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight into the great thing that carries things, and was put into water.

Obviously some of the wording was intentionally dumbed down to fit the word requirement (sky boat), but some of the sentences were legitimately dumbly worded, like you were talking to a child, and that takes away from the credibility of the video. Some of the video started to sound like it was written by a young child trying to make a poem, rather than an educated, adult, native english speaker-- speaking through a lexical funnel. Making a serious didactic video using only common words would make very good videos for classrooms and facebook sharing and whatnot. Also, I&#39;d recommend, although it can be funny, that trying to make up a word to replace what you can&#39;t say (upgoer&gt;rocket), is missing the point, and again, dumbing the video down in the bad way. Instead, use a full sentence(&quot;a thing, which we use to go up&quot;), or clause, to describe the object, and either directly repeat that sentence to refer to the object, or just use some pronouns. Effective use of pronouns is key here, for both describing and re-referring.
