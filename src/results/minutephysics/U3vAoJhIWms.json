In the 18th century, a horrible disease called smallpox was very common and many people died from it. If people survived, they were left with awful scans on their body. People also suffered from milder disease called cowpox which they caught from cows, Edward Jenner was an English doctor who noticed that people who had had cowpox rarely suffered from smallpox Jenner was convinced that cowpox infection had protected these people in some way. In 1796, Jenner did an experiment on a young called James Phipps, He introduced the cowpox infection into a cut on the boy&#39;s arm Phipps became ill with cowpox for a while and then recovered Later, Jenner infected Phipps with smallpox and waited. Phipps never caught smallpox because the cowpox had protected him This was the first example of vaccination Jenners discovery has made an enormous difference to the health of the world Nowadays, people are vaccinated against many illnesses After a worldwide vaccination programme by the World Health Organization, smallpox was finally eradicated in 1980.

I studied in with retired members of Circe Du Soleil, and when you&#39;re balancing things, objects that are top heavy are the MOST stable. At least for active balancing. This is because it requires a longer time for the force of gravity to act on it to pull it over (compared to a lighter object). This gives the balancer enough time to judge which way the object is tipping and compensate for that.

A sufficiently tiny change \u00a0in the initial position of the pencil will cause an arbitrarily small change in the position at an arbitrary time. That tiny change may have to get exponentially smaller as the time increases, but there&#39;s still some value, even if it&#39;s orders of magnitude smaller than an atom.<br><br>Let&#39;s assume that the pencil is guaranteed to fall over eventually. If the pencil could stay up arbitrarily long, but would fall over eventually, we could look at a position where it would take one second to fall, then two, etc. Long story short, we could use this sequence to find a position where it would have to stay up forever. So that&#39;s not true. The pencil must be guaranteed to fall over within time N.<br><br>The set of ways we can tilt the pencil can be thought of as a disk. Just look at the horizontal component of the position of the eraser or something like that. The set of ways the pencil can land can be thought of as a circle. Just look at the position of the eraser while it lands.<br><br>If the pencil really does fall over within time N, we can take the function from the initial position of the pencil to the position at time N, which is a function from a disk to a circle. Since the laws of physics are continuous, it&#39;s a continuous function from a disk to a circle.<br><br>It&#39;s possible that there&#39;s a gust of wind at some point strong enough that, even if the pencil is pointing such that it will neither roll left nor right (which is a possible position, for similar reasons as this entire proof), the wind will be strong enough to lift the pencil into the air and land the other way. There&#39;s obviously no way to balance a pencil to resist that, but that&#39;s just cheating. Assume that doesn&#39;t happen.<br><br>If you start with the pencil on its side, it still will probably move a little bit. For complicated reasons, it&#39;s not enough to matter. That last assumption is good enough.<br><br>You now have a continuous deformation retraction from the disk to the circle. That is to say, you have a continuous function from the disk to the circle such that the boundary of the disk (which is a circle) is mapped to itself.<br><br>This is impossible. There&#39;s a theorem about it that I can&#39;t remember the name of, but is related to the\u00a0Brouwer fixed-point theorem.<br><br>This is a contradiction. The air molecules and such will make it hard to figure out how to tilt the pencil just so so that the collisions, instead of knocking the pencil down, lift it back up. Even if you did know where all of the air molecules were, the proofs here are non-constructive. There&#39;s no general way to actually calculate the position the pencil has to be in. We just know it has to exist.<br><br>If you take quantum physics into account, then this doesn&#39;t work. The pencil can just fall in every direction. Or if you prefer the Copenhagen interpretation, it&#39;s not continuous, so the whole thing falls apart.
