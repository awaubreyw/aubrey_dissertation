I&#39;ll try my best to explain from a mathematical standpoint.<br><br>We can think of a collection of elements as a set (though this is a loose definition). The number of elements in the set is called its cardinality. When we say that the set of integers from 1 to 6 has 6 elements means that the set containing {1,2,3,4,5,6} has a cardinality of 6. As sets get bigger in size it becomes more difficult to count--by hand--its cardinality, and infinite sets pose such a challenge, because infinite counting goes on forever. Also, infinity is not a number; it is a behavior or a tendency to increase without bound. So mathematicians needed a way to describe the cardinality of sets without having to manually count the number of elements. So if we have two large--possibly infinite--sets, A and B, how do mathematicians know that they are of the same cardinality?<br><br>The best way to do this is through using functions that map one element of set A to exactly one in B and that every element in B has a precursor in A. Such functions are called bijective functions. Through the use of these functions, we are able to prove that there are equally as many counting numbers {1,2,3,...} as there are even counting numbers {2,4,6,...}. The mapping function in this case is just the linear function b = 2a for every a in set A and b in set B. Similarly, it is possible to show that there equally as many positive and negative integers as there are with the entire set of counting numbers. Finally, it can also be shown that every fraction can be counted as well. To describe this type of infinity, mathematicians use the symbol, \u2135_0, read as aleph null, as aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet.<br><br>It is different with the real numbers though. As shown in the video no such bijective function exists between the elements of the set of counting numbers and the elements of the set of real numbers between 0 and 1. There is at least one number that cannot be accounted for (we know that there are infinite numbers that cannot be mapped bijectively). Thus, this type of infinity is bigger in cardinality than the infinitude of the counting numbers. It is also important to note that the set of real numbers from 0 to 1 has the same cardinality as the set of all real numbers.<br><br>There are bigger infinities than the infinitude of the real numbers. One great mathematical question dubbed as the continuum hypothesis is this: there is no &quot;infinity&quot; between the infinitude of counting numbers and the set of real numbers.", "comment_date": "2020-05-07T23:16:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahmad M", "comment_text": "This argument is the equivalent of building a house on quicksand- No matter how much you try, you will sink and die.

Since the composition of bijections is also a bijection, there exists a bijection from (0, 1) to the real numbers. So (0,1) and the real numbers have the same cardinality.

Natural numbers, that is all integers, are countably infinite which seems contradictory because you can&#39;t count to infinity. However, you can begin to count the natural numbers and you&#39;ll never reach infinity but you could try. Real numbers (any number including decimals, fractions, surds and irrational numbers such as pi) are uncountably infinite. This means that you could not even begin to count them because there is an infinite amount of numbers just between 0 and 1 so you will miss a number out as soon as you attempt to count the real numbers. If two sets have the same cardinality(are the same size) then every number in one set could be matched to another number in the other set without any numbers left over in either set. For example, if you had 10 chairs and 10 people then every person could sit on a chair without any chairs or people being left over. If you had an infinite collection of chairs and people then every person could be matched to a chair without any chairs or people left over. This is because they have the same cardinality and are countably infinite because you can&#39;t have half a chair or a third of a person and therefore the collections have the same cardinality as the natural numbers. The real numbers could not be paired to the natural numbers like the people and chairs. For natural numbers from 0 to 10 there are 11 numbers but for real numbers from 0 to 10 there are an infinite amount of numbers.

That reason is at the bottom.<br><br>The notion of one infinity being larger than another infinity is based on adding rules to one that don&#39;t apply to the other. Both sets of numbers, AKA the indexed set (1 - &gt;) and the contained set (&gt;0 - &lt;1), both have the same rules, if you&#39;re going by the meaning of infinite. You can ALWAYS add one more to each of them. There are exactly the same number of indexed articles as there are contained articles because of that. I could add rules to them too. The contained set, having a defined place to start and a defined place to finish, based on decimals, means that the indexed set is larger, because there is no defined end. See?<br><br>While a wonderful exercise for the mind, it&#39;s the issue that different sets of rules are being applied to infinities that makes this logic true. <br><br>It&#39;s like proving something is impossible. At an eyeball level, if you place three quarters, two heads down, one heads up, can you make them all be tails up? Yeah, sure, flip the heads up coin tails down.

It&#39;s either: we don&#39;t have enough data, or simply &#39;no&#39;, because I applied a rule to a system.<br><br>Infinities are the same, so long as you aren&#39;t assigning different rules to comparisons.<br><br>And the reason I hate the discussion?

So, it could be that we define for s1: 1 the number in s2: 0.1 and further: s1: 2 s2: 0.101 ; s1: 3 s2: 0.01...<br>Here the order is wrong, so we cannot define in this order:<br>S1: 1&lt;2&lt;3&lt;4...<br>S2: N1&lt;N2&lt;N3&lt;N4...<br>when we have no order in the numbers we define with, there&#39;s no sense in saying that there are more Numbers in S1 than in S2.<br>But when we have an order to, so that this is right:<br>S1: 1&lt;2&lt;3&lt;4...<br>S2: N1&lt;N2&lt;N3&lt;N4...<br>we then can say, if we pick for example for system 1 {1,2,3,4} and the numbers of system 2 defined to the of system 1, so: {N1;N2;N3;N4} | 0&lt;N&lt;1 | as example {0.1;0.2;0.3;0.4}, that according to the rules of system 2, there are more possible numbers to choose in the range of the allready chosen numbers, whereas in system 1 there aren&#39;t according to its rules any Numbers more to choose in the range of the allready chosen numbers.<br>So when we have borders, the infinity which doesn&#39;t depend on at least one border to be open to go on, is the bigger one<br>so when its like this:<br>S1{1;2;3;4...;n} n as a number we define<br>S2{0...1}<br>then the infinity of system 2 is bigger than the of system 1<br><br>We anyway cannot imagine infinite numbers, but only a limited range emoungst which we calculate, it does make sense to say that when we work with the infinity of system 1, we find less numbers in our chosen range, than in system 2.<br>In a way we can say that the infinity of system 2 is bigger than the of system 1, but we aren&#39;t able to actually calculate with infinity as a number, because any number we define as infinity is not infinity, because infinity consists of all numbers emoungst its system, not just one. allthough: \u00a0to me infinity depends on many other factors, because wherever one uses infinity in calculations, one either defines the Number N emoungst the system of that infinity as proportional to something or not, for example N~t, as by counting. But when we talk of infinity as being all numbers emoungst its system at once, we cannot speak of size, because size makes no sense anymore in this case, its as infinite as the infinity of the system itself.<br><br>However, I hope I got your point - I agree to you, but only when we so to say have these borders when looking at our infinity.<br><br>This is a difficult subject, and for shure when studying maths and physics one will have a better overview on these things, but maybe I as an Abitur student, don&#39;t think about these things totally wrong.\u00a0<br><br>So thanks for the video, I actually never before got to think about this way of regarding infinity in maths.", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T21:29:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Walsh", "comment_text": "Sorry about my bad grammar\u2b07\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2015-06-28T17:09:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Walsh", "comment_text": "From an opposite POV, the &#39;standard&#39; number system&#39;s (1 2 3 4...) infinity is bigger than all the numbers between any two numbers, or at least equal to it.

There really is only one infinity and what I feel this is referring to is actually rate of growth. Let me explain:<br>We can agree that the function f(x) = x tends to infinity as x tends to infinity.<br>Of course, g(x) = e^x grows faster than does f(x). However, at a particular value of x for g(x), f(x) reaches the same value but at a great value of x. For example, g(4) = e^4. f(x) reaches the same value but at x = e^4 (around 60). As x gets larger, the x value for f(x) must get significantly bigger than g(x) but always reaches it. Thus, at large values (infinity), f(x) reaches every value that does g(x) since x is infinity.<br>Now, considering the logic that the video provides. The video compares an irrational decimal and associates each one with a whole number. For an irrational number, there are an infinite number of digits. For each of those digits, there are 10 options (your single digit numbers). Thus, you create a new function h(x) = 10^x. To prove this function accurately describes the example shown, let&#39;s take a few values. h(2) = 100. With a two digit number, you have 100 possibilities (.00 to .99). That is true. Similarly, h(3) = 1000. There are 1000 possibilities with three digit numbers (.000 to .999). Now, you have another exponential function 10^x which grows even faster than does e^x (you can graph it or determine the relative rate of growth using limits as x approaches infinity of 10^x over e^x). Still, using the same logic, there is always going to be a value.<br>Perhaps creating an analogy will work. We have determined that e^x and x both approach infinity but at different rates (again remembering that x will always need to be greater to achieve the same y value, but since x is infinity, it always reaches that value). Let&#39;s compare the relationship between e^x and 10^x (the latter growing faster) to 10^x and 100^x (again, the latter grows faster. In fact, the relative growth rate is even greater in this example and therefore is a valid comparison). Now, 100^x = 10^(2x). Comparing 10^x to 10^(2x), we again see that for every y value for the latter function, we achieve the same value for the former function - for twice the x value. For example, 10^(2*4) = 10^8. The x value for the latter is 8 and the former&#39;s is 4. As the video states, the numbers between 0 and 1 vs 0 and 2 are the same - meaning that you can double the numbers and still have the same value. This again makes sense because multiplying infinity by a constant does not change its value.<br>Thus, 100^x and 10^x reach the same infinity. 10^x and e^x reach the same infinity. e^x and x reach the same infinity (all these being functions as x approaches infinity). And x = 1, 2, 3, 4... - the whole numbers to infinity as used in the video<br>And 10^x = 10, 100, 1000, etc. - the number of options for the decimals as presented in the video.<br>Hence, all these functions reach the same value of infinity but at different rates. Infinity is not a number, and as used in calculus only a limit to infinity is possible. Thus, the limits must be used and infinity cannot be treated simply as a finite number (which is by definition, it&#39;s opposite).

One would say &quot;if we continue like this, we might get all integers to get connected to the decimals between 0 and 1, but we would still have no place to write decimals with infinite integers, e.g. 0.3333333, sqrt(2)-1, pi/10 etc.....&quot; Right? so we&#39;re done with integers, right? we have no more, right? NOPE!<br>As i begun, infinity is always infinity, and one can never get to the end, it&#39;s just the same as saying &quot;0 x infinity = 0&quot;, why? one would say &quot;0+0+0+0......... =0&quot; since addition with zero always gives out the same number we started with and thus changes nothing. You cannot say so! here! as you can never make it to the finish line and find the final result! even if you, Let&#39;s say, Group every billion or so zeros together and tag them as &quot;zero&quot;, you&#39;ll still end up with the same number of zeros you started with; infinity!<br>Let&#39;s go back the line drawing thing, 4=/=3 as you said right? how did we find out? we drew lines from 4 to 3, and a line was still missing an end to it, thus they aren&#39;t equal and the number of lines left without an end is the difference between the two numbers, thus 4-3 = number of lines left = 1, in your case with decimals (between 0 and 1) and integers, they are both infinite, thus the number of lines left is Infinity - Infinity = indeterminate! the number of lines left might be 3, might be a billion, might be -1, might be 0 and might be infinity, too! in All cases, these infinities are equal, as Infinity x 2 = infinity, and that may mean infinity is half infinity, but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s less! as we can conclude from that that infinity/infinity = 2, but not really, as infinity/infinity can equal any number and any number is valid as a result. Let&#39;s say you have an infinite amount of beer, i.e. beer that Never ever ever ends, and you have an infinite line of people waiting to come by and drink some beer, does that necessarily mean that everyone can only have one bottle of beer? nope, as the beer never ends, one can take as much beer as he wishes to take and there will still be some left, the amount of beer that can be taken by each person is [ Quantity of beer/number of people] and which is infinity/infinity, thus your beer can never end and people waiting can never end .<br>Thus minute physics, Hazel grace is wrong.<br><br>I might be the one wrong here, you might be too, and we might be both at the same time!
