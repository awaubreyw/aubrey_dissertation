These atoms will never decay, they will only gain complexity.<br><br>3) you can say the &quot;expanding universe&quot; will spread these atoms so thin they will cease to be atoms, and yet there is no evidence this spread is occurring at the quantum level. the planck length is always identical, the speed of light is always measured the same, so the expansion, if it is occuring, is happening between matter, not within matter, the case for it occurring within matter has been observationally disproven already. also, the red shift is the only evidence for &quot;an expanding universe&quot; we don&#39;t understand &quot;dark&quot; matter or energy, at all, which may totally account for the red shift in some other way <br><br>4) since matter isn&#39;t expanding inside itself (it&#39;s never been observed, even though we can measure diameters of atoms and strength of forces), the worst that can happen is &quot;heat death&quot; (in fact, this heat death is Sean Carol&#39;s interpretation), yet, an atom frozen is technically more order, not less. heat death confuses order (entropy) with energy (not entropy, but associated with it, since more energy equals more disorder, since it vibrates atoms). Paradoxically, and missed in the heat death argument for entropy and applying the 2nd thermodynamic law across the universe, is the fact that a frozen, or &quot;heat death&quot; universe is all a solid, as in, more order, not less.<br><br>5) and yet, it is claimed that &quot;this is not a solid&quot;, because the atoms will be spread across the whole universe, however, the order is increased because of the lack of temperature; the atom behavior is that of a solid, regardless of what you call it, and defies the 2nd law, regardless of what you call it.<br><br>6) the Earth itself generates it&#39;s own energy from the compression of mater from gravity alone. geologists explain friction alone generates massive amounts of energy and heat within the Earth and is responsible for the molten core, and that even if the sun stopped shining, &quot;the Earth&#39;s core would remain molten because of compression and friction&quot;. and even cosmology explains europa and Io are the way they are from energy generated from gravity. and even Pluto, which has a surface temperature of almost absolute zero, has surface activity signs and a molten core, even though it recieves not nearly enough energy from the sun to account for this.<br><br>The laws of thermodynamics have been rewritten already to account for quantum chromodynamics.
