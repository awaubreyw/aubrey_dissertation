Very neat way of introducing Z-F Set Theory and venting your frustrations in a logical and mature manner at the same time. I recently resigned from an ISP/Multimedia Conglomerate, not the one you flash displayed here, but just as ponderous and illogical as the one you are describing. After I left, I had to down grade my services as they were no longer being provided at a greatly reduced price.  Ironically, I went through a hassle similar to what you described here. At one point in the &quot;conversation&quot; I wanted to set my hair on fire and run out of the room screaming and flailing my arms. Fortunately, I am bald, otherwise the the smell of burning hair would be a great distraction to my wife. One of the axioms my former company held firmly to is the one you pointed out on number 5. The Axiom of Unity ... that is, never mess with the sacred bundle. However, all is not lost, one of the things that my former team  was working on, before I left, would put choice back in the hands of the consumer. We would still be bundling products and services, but you can pick and choose the products and services you wanted to add or remove from the bundle. Thus the customer could choose a single element from the set or go with the power set and of course everything in between. Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel sets at this ISP/Multimedia Conglomerate will begin to resemble true ZFC with Axioms of Choice included ... Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel will be rejoicing somewhere  in the Eternal Mathematics Hall of Fame ...The ISP/Multimedia Conglomerate is calling the new stylized bundle S &amp; E for Simple and Easy ... Maybe someone pointed out to management that they were violating most of the Axioms contained in ZFC ... (doubtful) ... all I know is they were &quot;set&quot; to launch S &amp; E before I left ... &quot;theoretically&quot; speaking ...

And then that same day I noticed they charged me the $170 monthly fee when I had their internet for 3 days only which I was fooled into getting, and now they do not want to give me my money back even though they falsely advertised a fake service and got me to accept them under false and misleading information. To top it off, they made me go on top of my roof where is super dangerously on an incline and very high on the second floor, with wrong instructions how to disconnect a piece of hardware they wanted back or they would charge me another $300+ so I had to get back down and get the correct tools to remove it and get back up and risk my life getting their stupid equipment off their stupid satellite.

And a tiny thanks to &quot;manager&quot;, for at least being honest about it when asked.<br><br>I was looking into getting a fiber hookup to my basement apartment. Sales personnel told me I need to pay for passing fiber into the apartment because this was not done when fiber infrastructure was buiot out, and I need my own fiber intake central hub, as my apartment and my landlords segment of the house are fully registered separate housings. They gave exuberant prices when mentioning I don&#39;t want TV package, just internet (government mandates they must provide that, but don&#39;t say anything about price). <br><br>I asked too many questions and were passed on to actual tech support. They told me the requirements put forth by sales were true. Same with price. But then they asked me if the old coaxial cable between the dwellings, that were there before the fiber hookup, were still physically there. I told them yes. The tech then proceeded to explain to me that my 75 year old landlord had a 250mbit full duplex internet connection, but traffic history suggested he was using the legacy wifi access point for all his connectivity - as they could not see any bandwith use history above ~for 38mbit and the legacy wifi AP was a 54g one. But the router built into the fiber central hub, was gigabit. He explained to me how MOCA adapters work, where to find info on crimping the right connectors on the now dormant coaxal cable, and how to hook them up, so that I could share glorious fiber with my landlord, and not pay sh*t.<br><br>I do co-pay with my landlord though. I now pay him, about 1/3 of what the ISP wanted me to pay for 30/5(mbit), without TV package. And while I did set up a nice AC router in his housing, he&#39;s still using the legacy AP.

If I understand this correctly, then regularity says that every non-empty set has at least one element that it doesn&#39;t share any elements with, so like if A is a non-empty set, then A has an element x such that for all elements y in x, y is not in A. I don&#39;t exactly see why  this precludes the possibility of including the set within itself, especially since the axiom just requires that one such element exists. What if A = {x,y,A} and x = {tom,jerry}. Then neither tom nor jerry, which are the elements of x, are found in A, which contains {tom,jerry} even though it still contains A.

This is funny to me because the way our service is structured this type of thing would never happen. We offer 4 speeds up to gigabit and all of them automatically include a WiFi modem. Our lowest speed 100Mbps and our highest speed both automatically include unlimited data and our 2 middle speeds include a 1TB data plan with an OPTIONAL unlimited data upgrade. When you sign up for service we will offer our promotional prices and have options both with and without a service agreement, If you choose a service agreement you get a longer promotion and a guaranteed price for the duration of the promo/agreement (ie not subject to rate changes). If you choose a plan without an agreement the promo is usually much shorter and could be subject to change as our rates change. Any rate change is noted on your statement a month prior to it going into effect. If you choose to bundle other services with internet the same rules apply with one major difference, In a bundle unlimited data is ALWAYS included in the service. We are very transparent about the service we offer and our prices are clearly advertised on our website in simple easy to read format. Prior to install you will also receive an email confirming the services on your order as well as promotion price and agreement details. We keep all of our customer support teams in country with exception to an overflow tech support team for redundancy. Because of the way we do business and treat our customers we are ranked among the best companies in my country and honestly I&#39;m proud to work where I do. It is a real shame that a lot of service providers have in my opinion poor business practices and as a result their customers suffer and they developed a poor reputation. As consumers we all have a right to quality service at a fair price and we have a responsibility to keep businesses in check.

Turns out they charged me a station-to-station rate of over $5 a minute for the calls to Canada even though I had an unlimited calling package because the operator was used to place the call. They reasoned that even though it&#39;s their responsibility to ensure that I&#39;m capable of making long distance calls, if I use a operator service, albeit compulsory, then I responsible for rate neither agreed on nor disclosed. In response to this I refuse to pay anything on that bill, since the first month should have been free and all of the original paperwork was filed with the FTC. when this inevitably went to bill collectors I refuse to pay anything, then they tried calling my relatives and when someone stupidly paid them something I challenge that and claimed they owed me money now. To this day I still won&#39;t pay that several hundred dollar bill and it doesn&#39;t matter because it was kept off the credit report. that company was MCI, and I believe they got into trouble for what&#39;s commonly referred to as slamming, which is similar to but distinct from when I experienced.

If you want to use mathematical language to needlessly formalize this, which is what you seem to be doing, then here&#39;s what the company is doing: They have a set of services, and they then take the power set of the set of services. They then choose a subset S of the power set of the set of services, and count the number of elements in that subset, suppose there are n. They then create a set C= {option1, option2, ... , option_n}, and map this set onto their set S. They let you choose any element from C and you get whatever that element maps to, as your set of services.

They just miss the mark on so many points, and it&#39;s not even worth correcting them on those, because they&#39;re not seriously studying math, and the differences are minute yet meaningful to a serious study of math.  I&#39;m going to point a few out, because I just can&#39;t help myself.<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3IPVWN-1ks&amp;t=0m34s\">0:34</a>  ZF doesn&#39;t form the foundation of modern mathematics.  It&#39;s just a basic system of axioms that primarily serves to help study amounts or different ways to quantify sets of things and the structures of some order(ing)s that we can impose on those things.  Obviously, that&#39;s a lot since we&#39;re playing with general things and any order between them, so we can and have used set theory to find parallels with other fields of study in math and/or to answer questions in those fields.  That doesn&#39;t make this the foundation of math.  In fact, Goedel showed that it doesn&#39;t even make sense to have an axiomatic foundation for math.<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3IPVWN-1ks&amp;t=0m44s\">0:44</a>  The number 2 is not written like that.  The &quot;number&quot; 2 doesn&#39;t even exist in ZF.  In ZF, we create ideas known as ordinals and cardinals, and each of which has a number that we call 2 and they correspond with each other, but neither is the same thing as 2 in the normal sense.  Even if we say that that&#39;s just a pedantic point and we let all of those 2s be the same thing without any objections, 2 still wouldn&#39;t be that set.  Even if we say that there is our normal 2 separate from ordinals and cardinals, 2 still wouldn&#39;t be that set.  That set is part of a structure of sets that is isomorphic to the peano axioms formulation of natural numbers and is primarily used to explain the axiom of infinity.  Why do we use it?  Well the axiom of infinity basically just says &quot;there is an infinite set&quot;.  From that the obvious question is: what do you mean by infinity?  It&#39;s not entirely obvious, and it would be really tiresome to have to define numbers through the peano axioms before we could even start to talk about infinite sets.  Instead, we create and say that a set exists that contains sets of that form (the same form that &quot;2&quot; is in the video) in a specific way so that we get the peano axioms for that set for free.  That set isn&#39;t 2, but it corresponds to 2 under the isomorphism between our set and the peano axioms.  We can actually create any amount of isomorphisms between any structure of sets and the peano axioms( taking this sentence too literally might require choice).  Then, we don&#39;t talk about that specific set again for the most part, because we&#39;re interested in saying more general things about all or at least more general types of sets that just that one set alone, though we do bring up sets that use that same structure in general.<br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3IPVWN-1ks&amp;t=0m58s\">0:58</a>  Don&#39;t call them laws.

What they did offer is also a set of options( that needs to be a subset of what they could offer).  It is completely reasonable to say that at some point, the sets are equal.  In short, you&#39;re doing what 1st years do and conflating subset with element.  In what you wrote, you are trying to say that what they could offer is comprised at least by the CONCEPT of what they did offer.  Also, the theory of non-well-founded sets (set theory that doesn&#39;t use regularity) is a rich field of study.", "comment_date": "2019-03-01T11:08:47Z", "likes_count": 39}, {"comment_by": "ML Guy", "comment_text": "Adding ZFT to my collection of valid arguments for purchasing (I won\u2019t add that last part in the video though - our little secret)", "comment_date": "2019-03-01T11:07:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean K", "comment_text": "Ahhhhh Comcast.

I decided that most of the offerings of Cable TV are complete\ud83d\udca9 and that most of my viewing is from the internet anyway so I called to cancel the Cable TV part and just pay for an internet connection.  The agent on the phone tried every permutation (with exception of what I wanted\u2014 only internet ) to get me not to do this.  The real \u201ekicker\u201c of my story is when she ran out of options and conceded to my request for \u201ainternet only\u2018, she happily announced: \u201eWell, good news!  Now you will be getting a much faster internet!\u201c.   I replied that I was supposed to already have been getting the fastest internet available in my area as it was bundled with my original package.  She went silent and did not respond to my puzzlement or any attempt of mine to elicit an explanation for the discrepancy.  Low and behold, when my service was changed to \u201ainternet only\u2018 the speed was suddenly three to four times faster!  WTF!  I felt (and had been) cheated for years.  The internet that came with the package was fraudulently represented as their \u201eHigh Speed\u201c internet.  When I had earlier complained that it was \u201epretty slow\u201c for \u201ehigh speed\u201c it was explained to me by a previous agent that that was the highest speed for my area and \u201enormal\u201c.  Apparently \u201ehigh speed\u201c is an utterly subjective description and therefore contractually meaningless\u2014 it is just hype and scam.<br>These telecom corporations are not only obscenely greedy but they also trick and cheat their customers regularly.  Spectrum is the only \u201aGame in town\u2018 for me otherwise I would seek out another provider.  Instead I have to swallow their \ud83d\udca9and go on with my life.  In Europe the government protects the customers from fraud, scams and excessive fees.  My friends and family in Europe pay much less for internet, cell phone and Cable TV than we do here in the U.S.  Friends in Germany are paying $40/mo. for Cable TV, phone and internet, as well as paying $14/mo. for cell phone service (with no roaming charges throughout Europe).<br>Our government is now owned and controlled by oligarchs.
