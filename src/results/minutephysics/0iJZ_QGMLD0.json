Is this a coincidence or did Einstein plagiarize yet another phenomenon to fit the math of relativity? Electromagnetic waves in space can neither slow down or speed up, this is consistent with the law of conservation of energy. If light slowed down, its energy would decrease, thereby violating the law of conservation of energy so the speed of light is instantaneous and cannot travel slower than it does. If Einstein&#39;s projectile light (particle photon) had mass it&#39;s light and images would be distorted and could not travel across the universe. The Hubble and James Webb telescope mirrors would only magnify these distortions, but most likely the high-speed particles would break the mirrors before we received the first distorted images, debunking the speed of light, Big Bang, Einstein&#39;s relativity and any science that uses relativity in their theories. Einstein&#39;s relativity is wrong light has no limitation of speed; it cannot be slowed down because it isn&#39;t moving. From every vantage point in the universe light is omnidirectional-instantaneously traveling in both directions. You have now left the Einstein Zone.\r<br>\r<br>Everyone knows cell phone electromagnetic radio waves travel both ways, yet Einstein&#39;s disciples believe time energy, mass and light can only travel one way back in time. If you simply run the Big Bang theory in reverse you reveal the insanity of Einstein&#39;s relativity and Big Bang theory. If the expansion of the Big Bang were true, time, energy, mass and light would be in the future from the vantage point of an expanding singularity-Big Bang and planet Earth would now reside in a past dimension of Einstein&#39;s time dilation (moving clocks run slow) space-time 13.8 billion years ago :-). Disciples, remember thy 1st commandment, thou shalt not question thy lawgiver of relativity for blasphemers are the devil&#39;s pawn. Let thee not dwell in dissension of our Lord, shun them, drive them back to their jungle lair amen. \r<br>\r<br>Will the James Webb Telescope view the birth of the first galaxies? Nope, the universe goes on to infinity. Neither time, the atom, energy nor mass can create itself into nothing, reside in nothing or expand into nothing simply because nothing has no properties. The James Webb Space Telescope is not a time machine, you can\u2019t travel back in time to view the beginning of the universe with telescopes that were made in the future :-). Light and electromagnetic waves are independent of each other. If science uses Einstein&#39;s wrongly theorized speed of light like an odometer to calculate past dimensions of distance and time, then using that same method to calculate forward dimensions of distance and time would mean the Big Bang was created and expanded in the future before time existed. Unlike a television or computer monitor the images we are viewing in the universe are in real time, not a series of still image frames that hypothetical Einstein projectile light particles photons create to give us the appearance of a moving image :-). \r<br>\r<br>It&#39;s truly amazing how the science and politics of the left are able to keep people denying reality, there are no DCU digital convergence circuits in space, yet Einstein&#39;s disciples believe the light and moving images they see in the universe aren&#39;t really there, they&#39;re just recorded images of the past 13.8 billion years. Pretending not to notice the gross contradictions-pseudoscience in Relativity is typical of Einstein&#39;s disciples, devaluing the source of any information that&#39;s in contradiction with their beliefs-theories. You could lead a cult to water, but you can&#39;t make them think. If the light from the universe travels to past dimensions of time then it&#39;s light is also traveling into future dimensions of time (instantaneously). \u201cAnd God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\u201d a state of superposition where time and gravity run inwardly, outwardly, in all directions in the same time frame, similar to the electromagnetic field having no beginning and no end. &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End&quot; Revelation 22:13. \r<br>\r<br>If black holes reside is a region of Einstein&#39;s theorized space-time where gravity and mass are so dense that nothing, neither mass-particles nor electromagnetic radiation such as light can escape then how could it be possible for the entire mass of our universe to escape the unimaginable density of the proposed Big Bang? According to general relativity sufficient compact mass-density will deform space-time to form a black hole which obviously debunks both Big Bang theory and relativity! Big Bang theorists rely on red shift to support the hypothesis that the universe is expanding, the very phenomena that supports the hypothesis of a (non-expanding static universe). \r<br>\r<br>Gravitational lensing occurs in all wavelengths of light including (red shift-microwave background radiation). Gravity from huge celestial objects of galaxies bend, curve and expand light giving the appearance of what Einstein wrongly theorized as time dilation-space-time-debunking the big bang. Mass from galaxies, planets and black hole electromagnet fields bend, curve and expand light giving the appearance of what Einstein wrongly theorized as time dilation-space-time dimensions. Light like all electromagnetic radiation and electricity is the result of moving electrons, as moving electrons of charged electromagnetic waves-light travel through the plasma of the universe each lump (or &quot;quanta&quot;) of energy in the electromagnetic waves are charged then discharged to the next lump, eventually the energy dissipates creating the appearance of time dilation - the appearance of longer wavelengths in red shift much like sound waves. \r<br>\r<br>Light waves unlike a particle can stretch, bend-curve and occupy a state of superposition so the hypothetical Einstein projectile light particle (photon), a particle that has never been observed cannot be both a particle and a wave. There are no space-time fantasy unions or gravity waves that can join a particle, wave and time together then bend, curve and stretch them like a rubber band. Neither time nor mass can create itself into nothing, reside in nothing or expand into nothing simply because nothing has no properties. Time and space are independent of each other, not material bodies or fantasy unions that magically stretch time like a rubber band into space-time dimensions. The James Webb Space Telescope is not a time machine, you can\u2019t travel back in time to view the beginning of the universe with telescopes that were made in the future. Great Scott Marty, astronauts on the moon experience the same communication delays to earth but logic tells us they are not time traveling back from the future! :-) \r<br>\r<br>If gravity is the result of mass then before the universe came into being gravity couldn&#39;t have existed simply because mass was not yet created! Galaxies with massive gravity from the early Big Bang would have been gravitationally bound like the Andromeda galaxy is to the Milky Way galaxy, the sun, moon and planets in all solar systems in the universe yet these early galaxies were able to somehow escape these massive gravitational forces continuing to expand at an increasingly faster rate. Into what, nothing? Nothing has no properties! Neither the atom, universe nor time can be created or destroyed. Albert Einstein an autistic violinist patent clerk that had access to more papers than Suzanne Somers litter box yet creates theories with more bugs than Terminix. \u201cAnd God said, Let there be light: and there was light.\u201d a state of superposition where time, and gravity run inwardly, outwardly, in all directions in the same time frame, similar to the electromagnetic field having no beginning and no end. - Magnetron", "comment_date": "2022-05-18T20:03:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "joseph lake", "comment_text": "but can you prove that the motion itself not spacetime isn&#39;t effecting the clock? like if you change gravity or change motion speeds the time may still be the same but the algorithm for computing the time may change? or did all the experiments completely not consider this possibility? moving faster may not move time faster at all. it may only have to do with spacetime not motion", "comment_date": "2022-05-08T07:07:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom\u00e1s Enrique", "comment_text": "These are great!", "comment_date": "2022-04-11T23:14:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dude d", "comment_text": "this explanation is much better than most, but it misses a really crucial point. <br><br>ALL of the earth signals are received on the space ship. Thus the earth twin ages according to ALL those signals. But it should be noted that the rate of receiving those signals on the space ship is not constant. They are received slowly on the outward journey, quickly on the inward journey .... + the signals during the acceleration. Those signals during the acceleration could be received even faster depending upon how long the acceleration is required to reverse the velocity.<br><br>ALL of the space ship signals are also received by the earth twin..... but there are less of them because there are 3 frames of reference. The outward journey, the acceleration and the return journey. It is the accelerations that reduce the number of signals sent from the space ship in the other 2 frames of reference. Why? <br><br>Because the space ship travels less distance than the earth twin reckons. The distance to the star is immediately reduced when the space ship accelerates to leave earth. So the outward journey is much shorter for the space twin. The same is true for the return journey. As soon as the velocity is reached to make the return, the distance to earth shrinks again. Thus less signals are sent from the space ship on the return journey.<br><br>For the outward journey again the earth receives signals slowly ..... and faster for the return. But there are less of them for the above reason. AND there are hardly any signals sent during the acceleration from the space ship. This compares to the sudden increase that the space ship recieves from earth during that acceleration.<br><br>So.... less signals sent from the space ship on the outward journey and the inward journey, because the distance to the star (outward) and the distance back to earth (inward) shrinks.

The effect of time can be shown only through these status changes, and there is no pure time keeper in the world which does not need a physical process. Any physical clock records the number of cycles of a periodical process and use this number to calculate the elapsed time. The number of cycles is the product of time and frequency. In special relativity, when observed from a stationary frame, time of a moving frame becomes shorter but the frequency of a clock on the moving frame becomes faster to make the product of time and frequency unchanged compared with that of the stationary clock. That is, relativistic kinetic time dilation won&#39;t be found on any physical clock or any other physical process.

As you used \u0394t in the Lorentz contractions to indicate interval and \u0394t&#39; is shorter than \u0394t in those equations I assume some minor error.  The equation t&#39;=t/\u221a(1-v\u00b2) but that indicates the difference in tick rate, so to speak, the gap between ticks is longer in the t&#39; frame.  \u0394t is t2-t1 (final minus initial time on the clock) and so represents an interval.<br><br>Same for length.  l&#39; is always shorter than l so l&#39;=l*\u221a(1-v\u00b2) which gives length contraction as \u221a(1-v\u00b2) is always less than one.<br><br>On the Lorentz equation there is another error but that could just be a smudged mark on the screen?

If you think that the Earth can not be at rest with the distance then consider a long rod extending all the way along the path and at rest with the Earth.  Would that change the calculation?  No, it shouldn&#39;t make any difference, but that distance IS length contracted by \u0394x&#39;=1/\u221a(1-v\u00b2)*(\u0394x-v\u0394t) for the rocket observer but not the Earth observer.

It is simpler than you suppose it would be. Suppose the rocket travels at almost the speed of light. Say the planetary target is a star called Zeta Century (GRIN) 5 ly distant. Zeta is stopped related to Earth (same inertial frame). Certainly the cosmonaut arrives 5 years later in the Earth/Zeta frame clocks. The wrist watch of the cosmonaut at arrival time in Zets is (say) much less than one second more from his time departure (almost zero time elapsed to him). That fact occurred when the radio signal with Earth&#39;s clocks picture is sent to Zeta (5 years after departure, Earth/Zeta Time). Then less than one second plus 5 years later after arrival in Zeta the cosmonaut who is resting on Zeta&#39;s space center (GRIN) watchs on the picture and immediately deduces the fact that he is the youngest twin. Similarly, if the cosmonaut exactly on arrival on Zeta sends the picture of his wrist watch by radio signal to the Earth, then 5 years later his twin on Earth (10 years after departure)  finds out the fact the he is the oldest twin. Immediately the twin paradox is solved using this gedanken. Why my explanation is better than other explanations in the YouTube? Because it is simpler. Why? Just because it splits the travel without need to make the cosmonaut return to home in order to explain all the situation of restrict relativity of Einstein. Moreover it put it explicitly that fact that the source and target planets are in the same inertial frames and ergo (like two Docs, Don and Ron of Fermi Lab said previously on the best YouTube v\u00eddeo clip about this subject, you know, Math is almost everything!! GRIN) the cosmonaut is the different guy because he travelled in TWO inertial frames on the contrary of his stationary twin on Earth (or Zeta). Regards from the Brazilian jungle. Sorry for English.

Whether the change of velocity (hence acceleration present)  is instantaneous or gradual, the question that still remains is that whose perspective is true? The man on the spaceship would think the man on the earth as the one really travelling &amp; thus changing his velocity during the turn. So imagine the minkowski diagram for the man on earth according to the perspective of man on the spaceship. Its tilted or curved at the point of turn being basically indistinguishable from the graph for the man on the spaceship according to the perspective of man on earth! And whats the graph for the man on spaceship according to himself.Its a straight line! This is what this video omits. You cant never know whether you are accelerating or not! Its true that according to the man on earth the man on the spaceship travelled into space, made a turn &amp; returned on earth &amp; thus returned to the frame of earth. But the same can be argued by the man on the space ship. According to the man on the spaceship, earth travelled into the space, made a turn &amp; returned on the spaceship &amp; thus returning to the frame of spaceship! So what&#39;s the critical point of distinction where lies the answer? Is it acceleration? I don&#39;t think. Acceleration is not absolute just as velocity, if you think deeply. If the reality infact, is that the man on earth aged more as from the atomic clock experiment then it would force me to conclude that we have to abandon the notion that motion is relative &amp; that there might exist a preferred universal reference frame. But again this happens if special relativity alone was true. But general relativity is closer to the truth than special relativity. Now if u were to see this in the light of general relativity, this explanation of what the video suggests as the reason for why the man on earth is the real one who gets older works. In general relativity the fabric of spacetime itself is not regular or constant. Its dynamic. Earth being heavier than the spaceship has more time dilation. So at first the man on the spaceship feel time slowing on the earth. During the turn, decceleration happens &amp; his time axis changes by rapidly rotating &amp; during this it seems to the man on the spaceship that time on earth is speeding. When velocity becomes zero, time on spaceship equals to that on earth. And when acceleration starts, time again speeds up. (So why acceleration here causes this speeding of time? Because it causes the geodesic of the spaceship to change ie it affects the coordinate system). After the turn &amp; during the return trip, time on earth again appears slow to the man on spaceship. Finally the crucial point is that man on the spaceship returns to the frame of earth. So why here frame of earth matters? Couldn&#39;t the man on the spaceship argue that its the earth that returned to the frame of spaceship? No he cant. Because the spacetime vicinity of where both earth &amp; spaceship are touching or resting on each other is predominantly curved by the earth rather than the spaceship . So preferred frame becomes the earth. So u see things on earth to be affected by the pace of time in turn affected by the curvature earth causes; the curvature caused by the spaceship is feeble &amp; doesn&#39;t decide the final outcome predominantly. In special relativity or Newtonian mechanics the fabric of spacetime (or the coordinate system) was not disturbed. But that isn&#39;t reality. And when u add up the total time elapsed for the man on the earth according to the man on the spaceship, its more than what it passes for the man on the spaceship himself. Thus the man on earth appears older. So u have to invoke a bit of general relativity too to resolve the paradox. This explanation also hints that in general relativity whatever that has more mass becomes the preferred frame of reference. So one could suspect masses with infinite mass aka blackholes could act as preferred reference frames.", "comment_date": "2020-01-15T18:50:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jacek Go\u0142dyka", "comment_text": "Acceleration doesn&#39;t matter! There is nothing about acceleration in Lorenz&#39;s equations. Lorenz&#39;s equations are enough to show time dilation, but do they explain where the asymmetry of reference systems comes from? In my opinion, the asymmetry of reference systems is hidden deeper. It occurs at the interface of Special and General Relativity and quantum mechanics.<br>So, where does the asymmetry of reference systems come from? 1) The speed of light is constant. 2) The laws of physics are the same everywhere. 3) The speed of light is more than the speed of electromagnetic propagation - the speed of light is the speed of causality / information. 4) Each elementary particle &quot;feels&quot; the speed at which it moves and the bending of space in which it is located, i.e. gravity. 5) Each elementary particle is a kind of moving &quot;einstein clock&quot; (and not just the entire complex object). 6) As the speed or gravity increases, the path between the cause and the effect gets longer (on an elemental scale), so the photon does not &quot;feel&quot; the passage of time at all. In the case of a photon, we could say that the cause cannot reach its effect. Easier to measure it only after exceeding certain limits: speed close to the speed of light or mass of a black hole.<br>The twins paradox is easier to think when elementary particles will be twins.

This explanation is simply incorrect. To understand the solution you have to look at the length of each traveller&#39;s World Line (path through Minkowski spacetime). The world line of the twin that doesn&#39;t move is <b>longer</b> and thus more intervals are measured (e.g. 10 units). The world line of the travelling twin is counter-intuitively <b>shorter</b> (e.g. 8 units; your diagram is 2D Euclidean, so it seems longer. But in Minkowski spacetime the triangle inequality doesn&#39;t hold, so when you go through the maths the path come out to be shorter. This is because time in the Minkowski metric has the <b>opposite</b> sign to the spacial dimensions). That means that the two twins age exactly the same way along their own world lines, but if their world lines separate and then later recombine, the twin that has a longer world line is older. End of story. It makes not sense to talk about time &quot;rotating&quot; other than in a purely mathematical sense. I really urge you to read the Philosophy of Spacetime by Tim Maudlin (p79).

Earth seems to be close to perfect inertial drag with the universe. This would explain that time is slowing down for the moving twin (and not the twin on earth), because he is moving with respect to the universe. Earth is also moving with great speed, but the difference is that it is moving in perfect alignment with the universe. This can be observed by anyone looking at the sky at night time. Why can we navigate according to the stars? The  universe seem to be rotating when we look at a fast moving video of the sky, but still the image of the sky does not seem to change significantly over time. The simple explanation would be that earth is not actually moving through space, but earth is moving with the space.<br><br>A  famous experiment is the Foucault Pendulum, which proved that the earth is rotating. The pendulum rotates as the earth spins around its own axis. However, according to the theory of relativity we should be able to say that it is the earth who is standing still and the universe which is rotating. Then why is the pendulum rotating when the earth is at rest? It seem to be only one plausible explanation, the inertial drag effect of the universe. It pulls on the pendulum in the same way you would expect water in a bucket to start rotating after a while, if you start rotating the bucket. After some time the water would get up to speed with the rotating bucket and perfect inertial drag is achieved.<br><br>Comments?", "comment_date": "2019-01-19T10:58:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vahan Yeranosyan", "comment_text": "\u0412ut whait this is also true for the man on the rocket.

Let us using two atomic clocks, one is on the earth and the other one is on the spaceship traveling at half speed of light. From my perspective, the clock on the spaceship runs slowly, r = 1.15. So at the noon of the first day on spaceship, the clock on spaceship shows the time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a> and the one on the earth shows the time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a>. Now from the astronauts perspective, the clock on the earth runs slowly with the same value of time dilation. So when the clock on spaceship shows the time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a>, the one on earth shows the time <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a>. So how can a clock show two different times at the same spaceship time?<br><br>To solve this time dilation paradox, I think we have to use Einstein&#39;s relativity of simultaneity. By using the spaceship space-time frame, the two events, the clock on the space showing12:00 and the clock on earth showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a>, happened at the same time. However, by using the earth space-time frame, these two events no long happened at the same time. Because of the spaceship is travlling away from the earth, so the clock on earth showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a> happened earlier. So when the clock on space shows <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a>, the clock on earth shows a time later than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a>, that is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a>. Likewise for the two events happend at the time by using the earth space-time frame, the clock on the space showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a> and the clock on earth showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a>, also no long happened at the same time by using the spaceship space-time frame. Since the spaceship is travelling away from the earth, the clock on earth showing <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a> happened later. So when the clock on spaceship shows12:00, the clock on earth shows the time earlier than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a>, that is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iJZ_QGMLD0&amp;t=10m26s\">10:26</a>.

So to you, time is going at a normal speed, but Earth appears to have slowed down because it is moving away from you so fast.<br><br>But then you turn around and accelerate toward Earth, you have to un-blue-shift each frame, but now they are coming in at a rate much faster than normal, because you are rushing toward Earth and all the frames of the movie that haven&#39;t caught up with you yet are suddenly coming at you all at once, and time Earth appears to in fast-forward.<br><br>So when you get back, you have caught all the frames that hadn&#39;t arrived at your rocket ship on your way out, and the total amount of time passed when you finally get back home is no longer than the amount of time that you were on the rocket ship. So you don&#39;t end up much younger than your twin.<br><br>This doesn&#39;t work if you travel too close to a black hole, however, because you have to accelerate constantly to keep from falling into the black hole, that acceleration keeps time moving very slowly for you.

Time doesn&#39;t exist.  The universe is based on vibrations.  Fast-moving objects experience gravitational wavelengths in a misshapen manner, like the Doppler effect when an ambulance passes you on the street.  You think the pitch of the ambulance siren goes down when the ambulance drives by, but the sound never changes for the driver.  You think time passes more slowly for people in motion, but they are just experiencing less gravitational waves when they approach the escape velocity for a given celestial body.  High velocity causes vibrations/clocks/the mind/the body to all slow down.  More specifically, gravitational waves cause a buildup of pressure that increases vibrations of mass relative to the distance from the gravitational source.  Escaping said gravity minimizes its effects, and the faster you go, the weaker that gravity&#39;s effects becomes.  Proximity to gravity over time ages us, not time itself.  Time is a figment of our imagination, and we think clocks measure it.  Yet clocks only count vibrations/cycles.  The atomic clock is just a charged crystal sending vibrations to a computer.  Take a charged crystal into orbit, let it experience weightlessness, and its frequency will lower, depending on its velocity relative to surrounding gravitational waves.  If you were out in space, traveling with that crystal, your own biological electron flow would lower in frequency too, so the slowed clock would appear normal to you, since you would process thought more slowly.  When you come home, the atomic clock would comparatively say your watch didn&#39;t tick enough times.  It is not proof of time dilation.  It is proof that escaping gravity via high velocity, among many other things, affects how quickly the body ages and how quickly clocks tick.  The person who rockets away from Earth and comes back?  They&#39;re gone ten Earth seconds.  End of story.  They <b>feel</b> like they were gone only eight, and their clock <b>says</b> they were gone only eight, but both are simply inaccurate.  Neither their clock nor their mind/body experience Earth&#39;s gravitational vibrations the same while at escape velocity.  Time, as humans know it, is defined by the resonating frequency of crystals under the influence of Earth&#39;s gravity.  There is no other &quot;time&quot;.  Time itself is not relative to velocity, rather the vibrations that cause clocks to tick and our bodies to age is relative to velocity, in respect to surrounding gravity.  You never slow down, you never grow old.  It is a vastly misunderstood shortcut to use the term &quot;spacetime&quot;, as if traveling through space is, in effect, traveling through time.  There is no paradox.  Clocks and all matter (living or not) are simply affected by gravity or lack thereof.  Getting away from the Earth and staying away from other celestial bodies will make you think slower, but you will remain alive longer, although you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell.  That is, unless you tried to visit your friends after a few years (or what you <b>thought</b> was a few years) of traveling near the speed of light.

Then you&#39;ve reached your twin without having to turn around; there was no deceleration to cause the time rotation. <br>As it happens, this has already been investigated. &quot;they will agree on their respective ages and avoid the paradox.<br>The resolution relies on the selection of a preferred frame singled out by the topology of the space.&quot; The source is brief but technical (requires basic understanding of metrics): <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0101014.pdf\">http://arxiv.org/pdf/gr-qc/0101014.pdf</a><br><br>I&#39;m not sure if I follow the arguments well enough to be convinced.

We have an amazing magic telescope tech allowing the traveling ship to clearly see earth orbiting the sun during the whole trip, and lets say the earth sibling got an iphone with a calendar allowing &quot;it&quot; to know time pasing on earth (or simply counting sunrises doesn&#39;t really matter). Redshift this and blueshift that... Isn&#39;t the sun a constant clock in this mind experiement? When during the trip would the earth circling the sun speed up / slow down, during acceleration from/to, deccelleration, turning or when???. and for real.. how many revolutions around the sun 80/100 or something in between do each participant actually see/experience?

Once we use our head for more than covering holes in false and popularised theories, where precisely, when starting from the basic equations, you immediately can spot the beggining of the whole problem, especially in Relativity, we will bring science back to its &quot;mortal&quot; place.<br><br>Not to mention that by the theory of Relativity itself, the clock experiment with one flying around the globe and one staying on the surface, neither of those can measure any time difference (at least not through relativistic effects), should the theory be consistent, because the clock is made out of minimally two parts. The light (photon) source and a reciever. During the whole process, they make a static referential system, no matter the motion of the system itself (basic principle upon which Relativity itself is built). And between such parts of the system, no change can be measured. Why? Even if supposed relativistic lenght contraction took place and therefore the frequency would change (increase), so would (decease) the supposed passage of time and it would do so in such a manner, that the relative frequency would remain the same (meaning the ratio of frequency to time and length), because that&#39;s how they&#39;ve even been defined. The relativistic Doppler Effect cannot be used here, because as mentioned before, no part &quot;in&quot; the system is moving in relation to the other (of course excluding the photons), only the system as a whole does. So in actuality, this experiment is completely independent of any relativistic effect, as defined by the theory and on the contrary can be used against it.<br><br>Gravity &quot;bending&quot; light can be explained through elementary optics (it is observed, to my knowledge, only around plasmatic bodies and plasma is dense, therefore it has different density than the surrounding &quot;vacuum&quot; and so the light naturally bends in it and due to gravity the density increases, the closer we get to the surface, so it bends even more).<br><br>Once we stop relying on the &quot;if it doesn&#39;t have any other explanation yet, therefore it must be true&quot; notion, even though it&#39;s not true either (in physics for example, the Electric Universe can explain much more and much more consistently than Relativity, including actual explanation of gravity, without the perpetual use of cyrcular logic the relativists like to apply), we can finally make a noticable progress in science. Because if it is trully scientific idea, it can never be excused of repeated testing, verification and reexamination. It can never be simply true, without a prove. And yes, it would be about time to realize, that when theory seems impossible to understand, it might not be because of it&#39;s &quot;genius&quot; structure, but sometimes, just sometimes, it is such, because it is simply full of crap.<br><br>Nothing personal againts anybody who believes in the theory of Relativity, but it it simply tiring to see so many &quot;experts&quot; in the field and others bashing so many people, who are just using common sense and try to find at least a reasonable amount of consistency in it (myself used to be included), and the reason why it&#39;s so popular is not due to any scientific value, but because of, funding, unreliable and unscientific publishing practices, baseless ridicule and so on.", "comment_date": "2016-08-26T16:14:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Up and Atom", "comment_text": "I remember those minkowski diagrams... <b>shudder</b>", "comment_date": "2016-08-26T16:13:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bella1995", "comment_text": "Dude the music is way too loud in this one", "comment_date": "2016-08-26T16:13:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thiago Rodrigues", "comment_text": "Guys, if you feel bad that you&#39;re in highschool and you didn&#39;t understand the video, remember that there is me here, a 23yo graduated engineer that didnt understand the whole thing as well :(", "comment_date": "2016-08-26T16:11:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Linus Ng", "comment_text": "but wouldnt also be possible to day that the earth&#39;s velocity rotated with respect to the rocket since the movement of both the earth and the rocket are reletive? then wouldnt it also be possible for the earth twin to be younger?", "comment_date": "2016-08-26T16:11:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emmy Blumenthal", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23MinkowskiSpace\">#MinkowskiSpace</a> <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23Tensors\">#Tensors</a>", "comment_date": "2016-08-26T16:11:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henrik Larsen", "comment_text": "So what if the twins fly off in each their own spaceship, in opposite directions, and return?
