Instead, radar pulse pairs are sent out from the radar antenna, and the differential of the phase shift between the received pulses determines the velocity. If the time interval between pulse pair transmissions is too long and the radar target is moving too fast, the phase differential will exceed 180 degrees, and the velocity will become &quot;aliased.&quot; That means the radar thinks a target&#39;s velocity is inbound when it&#39;s actually outbound, and vice versa. We see velocity aliasing happen quite often in meteorology when we scan a tornado circulation, for instance, and we have developed algorithms which are usually able to correct that error.", "comment_date": "2013-11-28T04:47:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Free", "comment_text": "I hate the 10 sec videos...", "comment_date": "2013-11-28T04:47:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Makdavian", "comment_text": "RAdar and LIght?", "comment_date": "2013-11-28T04:46:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "8bitslime", "comment_text": "Was the A in &quot;RAdio&quot; capital for a reason, or just a typo?", "comment_date": "2013-11-28T04:46:19Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Linuxdirk", "comment_text": "Hey @MinutePhysics Could you PLEASE keep that short clips to thensecondsphysics or so? :)", "comment_date": "2013-11-28T04:45:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thehero0ftime", "comment_text": "Can you make longer videos?
