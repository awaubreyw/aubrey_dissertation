ALL modal scales contain 7 notes with 8 being a complete octave, this correlates with why we say octo.

wrong. Human eyes do see violet at the end of any spectrum, regardless of any rainbow duplication taking place. The human eye detects color through 3 types of cone cells, each sensitive to deferent wavelengths. The cone cell that is sensitive to the wavelength we call red, is actually sensitive to both the long wavelengths just above inferred, and to the short wavelengths just bellow ultraviolet. This is why we see a light tint of violet at the end of the spectrum. It\u2019s because the cone cells in our eyes that actually detect red light, are also a little bit sensitive to the blue light at the end of the spectrum.

I have seen the emission spoectruzm of potassium trough a prism spectrometer and I have seen a violett line in the 400-420 nm area. Some of my costudents were not able to see it.

There is \u201c\u0441\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439\u201d and it describes this deep blue ocean color or these geniuses t-shirts, something like royal blue.

We have three types of cone in our eye - red, green, and blue and they are sensitive to light of roughly long, medium, and short wavelength respectively. S cones appear far LESS frequently than M or L cones, meaning we have less ability to perceive color in the shorter wavelengths and thus the purple color looks washed out or overwhelmed by the other colors. Depending on the exact distribution in an individual&#39;s eye, the purple may be more or less apparent. In fact, roughly 95% of all cones are M or L, leaving just 5% of space for S cones. Additionally, the concentration changes at the fovea, where most of our detail vision is concentrated, with the ratio of S cones dropping even further.", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T14:40:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "schi", "comment_text": "Do re mi fa sol la si (A)<br>Do re mi fa so la ti (B)<br>Which one do you use?
