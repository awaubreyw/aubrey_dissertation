Accounting for the moisture that&#39;s produced from breathing and other movements that produce sweat, wouldn&#39;t those virus molecules get the chance to travel right through the mask?

It does not take into account other uncontrollable factors which contribute to the result. For instance: the covid-19 Corona virus utilizes the CD26 receptor,  also known as the ACEr2 which is a cell receptor the virus utilizes to enter host cells, similar to the CD4 or CCR5 receptor for HIV. The number of this receptor varies with age, race and other epidemiologic factors accounting for variances in its pathogenicity. For instance,  children, especially infants have very low receptor numbers, which then increase with age. This explains the low rates of infection and disease severity in this age group.  Less #&#39;s of host receptors = less viral load = less severe  infection and disease symptoms.  <br>For blm to blame &#39;systemic racial inequality &#39; of covid-19 is ungrounded, spurious and unscientific.  It only results in inciting divisiveness which fails everyone.  <br>If you wound any human being, they all bleed the same red blood.

I usually watch science videos to stay away from politics. Also being a scientist you should know that there&#39;s probably multiple causes for more deaths other than &quot; systemic racism&quot;.<br> While Black Americans make up ~13% of the population but account for ~34% of  Covid-19 deaths I don&#39;t believe that this is racial inequality but rather our healthcare system. As of 2010 20% of Black Americans were uninsured, 34% had Medicaid, and 46% had Employer or Privet insurance. While 13% of White Americans were uninsured, 15% were on Medicaid, and 72% had Employer or Private insurance. 33% of Hispanic Americans were uninsured (50% being non US citizens), 29% were on Medicaid, and 39% Employer. Could it be that people with better insurance receive better treatment? Blacks Americans also tend to have diabetes, hypertension, and asthma that could contribute to the death rate being higher. They are likely to live in densely populated areas. There is no way to tell how much they practiced social distancing or any other precautions.  There&#39;s a lot of other factors other than systemic racial inequalities. It&#39;s sad for all who lost their lives due to Covid-19.

The way I understand their workings is you inhale basically from the front of the mask due to the sucking motion of breathing in general, as when you exhale it is more widely spread as kind of a whoosh, and as you explained the seal&#39;s importance I know you get it. Depending on the N95 you are wearing you may have a little filter you exhale through, or maybe the top and bottom are of different quality filter like the duck bill style.

The research also shows that those deficient in Vitamin D are more likely to encounter severe complications related to COVID-19 and higher rates of death.

Most of it&#39;s &quot;evidence&quot; is talking about previous injustices involving the Black community, and whilst they are important for broader context they also need to be supported by <b>actual</b> evidence of racism during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "comment_date": "2020-06-24T15:08:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gavin Green", "comment_text": "They said black lives matter at the beginning like black people are being targeted \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-06-24T14:00:51Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Sorren Averia", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAdanPfQdCA&amp;t=0m50s\">0:50</a>", "comment_date": "2020-06-24T13:41:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kie 7077", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll reiterate, people with vitamin D deficiency are 20 times more likely to end up in intensive care if they get the coronavirus, source is the British medical journal.", "comment_date": "2020-06-24T13:37:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kie 7077", "comment_text": "Re Black lives matter.

The article shows historical links of this issue with the polio virus in the 1950&#39;s and its effect on the black community and the simile it plays with the systemic racial inequalities of COVID-19.  The big picture is that many black Americans and minorities who live in a impoverished, economic difficult, or other racial prohibit state, should NOT be having the difficulties of obtaining vaccines and medical treatment we ALL deserve a shot at easily obtaining.

Without adequate data, you may have a a case of the third variable fallacy. Finding the correlations of race and age to virus fatalities is just as important as finding data on prior conditions relative to said race and age group. This is paramount to treating patients effectively as well as showing specific ways in which discrimination is caused. For all we know, bliod type may play a far greater role than race, but the data is insufficient. It may also be true that black communities at tested at different rates, or that Without said data, you have no way to know where the racial and or medical care problems are, which laws are causing them, and how to treat them. only half truths from media and empty false promises by politicians. <br><br>If you want to properly discuss race, you need to show which policies are the problem and back it with data, not just a blanket statement and vague statistic. Tomas Sowell (a famous black economist) has an excellent speech on disparity vs discrimination.

For those who want to check them:<br>1) <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/racial-data-transarency\">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/racial-data-transarency</a> - but it&#39;s 404 for me. :/ I tried to get to the source using citation in 2), but couldn&#39;t do it.<br>2) <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934320304125\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934320304125</a><br><br>\u00a0Now, about the article 2). Besides problematic source 1), I have two issues:<br><br>\u00a01. You cite the article to support the claim that higher mortality is a <b>result</b> of systemic racism. This article didn&#39;t convince me of that. The only thing it did was comparing current situation to older similar cases, but even if I grant that thhose past cases were indeed cause by systemic racism, this doesn&#39;t prove yet that COVID-19 case was. What causes uneven death distribution during one pandemic doesn&#39;t carry over to another pandemic; this has to be proven with specific evidence, not just comparisons.<br><br>\u00a0The article also contains the sentence that &quot;Quantitatively, it is plausible that this large mag-nitude of increase of COVID-19 is an overestimate. Qualita-tively, however, based on the existing totality of evidence,4-11the observation is real...&quot; - but citations 4-11 also make comparisons to other cases.<br><br>\u00a02. The article doesn&#39;t mention the ratio of COVID-19 cases in blacks compared to whites. If blacks for some reason were getting COVID-19 3 times as frequently as whites, then we would indeed expect 3x mortality rate. That would of course still be a problem, but a <i>slightly</i> different one.<br><br>\u00a0Now some clarifications about my position. I don&#39;t live in US, and therefore, I don&#39;t know if there is systemic racism in US. In this comment, I don&#39;t claim that mortality disproportion, if real, is <b>not</b> caused by systemic racism - I don&#39;t know that.

While we are at it, we can ignore the fact that blacks have a higher COVID-19 rate outside the US as well, even in places like the UK, where there is universal healthcare for all.<br>It has been shown the possible role of Vitamin D deficiency in COVID-19 cases.  Dark skinned races, in general, have extremely high rates of Vitamin D deficiencies.  Excluding region and lifestyle choices, they are at a disadvantage due to melanin blocking UVB and in turn Vitamin D production.  Dark skinned ethnic subgroups have a much higher (3 to 71 fold) prevalence of serum 25(OH)D &lt;30 nmol/L than the white populations.

If it&#39;s more likely to meet a physical worker among black people than among white people (per capita of course) then it&#39;s not surprising that there&#39;s more infections among black people. In my country I can see these differences and the skin colour isn&#39;t any factor as they&#39;re all white, for example a man in a suit is very careful, covering his face, using antibacterial liquids etc, and meanwhile people in the Adidas tracksuits drink beer in a group, not giving a f. Of course it&#39;s not any rule, there&#39;s just a higher probability of such idiotic actions occuring among uneducated part or the society.

The article says that we need to do further research to understand the cause of over-representation of black victims and suggests that it MIGHT be caused by racial inequalities, then provides several historical examples of racial inequalities (hepatocellular cancer mortality was improved by a prohibitively expensive drug, and a treatment for syphilis was intentionally withheld back in 1932). But never once do they provide concrete evidence that the current over-representation is due to systemic inequality.<br>I think it&#39;s very important not to stoke racial fires (which are already swelling across the nation) without hard proof that there&#39;s actually a causal link between systemic racism and the problems you&#39;re addressing. Riling people into protests and riots over racism when racism isn&#39;t at fault will only breed civil distrust and prevent us from finding and solving the REAL underlying cause. It&#39;s possible that there are genetic factors at play. For instance: <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001706X15000820?via%3Dihub\">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001706X15000820?via%3Dihub</a> some ethnic groups are less susceptible to Malaria than others. There could also be cultural factors at play. Jews are also disproportionately affected by COVID-19 (in New York alone 700 Jews have died from COVID-19 out of 2 million, a total of 0.00035% of the Jewish population -- TEN TIMES the average death rate in America). When you consider that the mayor of New York issued a formal statement to Jewish citizens to stop congregating, it seems potentially relevant. Perhaps black communities are less likely to obey stay-at-home orders or self-quarantine. It&#39;s also possible the issue isn&#39;t a RACIAL one, but one of INCOME INEQUALITY.
