In a random generation, there would be roughly equal occurrences for each microstate, give or take because of the small sample size, but in the above sequence there was no semblance of uniformity between microstates, especially when analyzing the larger sequence fragments the apparent randomness faded away as three or four of the 16 microstates (2^4) were used most of the time. It&#39;s still amazing, though, because even if the sequence were made by &quot;randomly&quot; pressing one and zero on a keyboard, it&#39;s not a truly random sequence, and I think that says something about the human mind and it&#39;s tendencies towards patterns, to the point that it inadvertently can create them, because all that science really is (at a very basic level) is the search for patterns in the world around us.

An oblate spheroid is just an older term for an ellipsoid of revolution, where the revolution is around the minor axis. Since an ellipsoid (not a triaxial ellipsoid) has only two principal axes, if they are the same, it&#39;s a sphere. When they differ and the ellipsoid has been developed by revolving it around the minor axis, then it&#39;s an oblate ellipsoid. If the rotation was around the major axis, it would be a prolate ellipsoid.<br>Conventionally, we use an oblate ellipsoid of revolution in geodesy to represent the model of the Earth, and it has just two principal axes. Therefore sections parallel to the equatorial plane are circles, while sections parallel to the axis of rotation are ellipses. A triaxial ellipsoid does give a slightly better fit, but it&#39;s a pig to do the computations!<br>The model of the global geoid (what is colloquially termed Mean Sea Level, but actually isn&#39;t, really) is based on a spherical harmonics modeling of the overall shape. While it&#39;s tied to WGS 84, it&#39;s not part of it as such. To correct for the geoid-elipsoid separation globally, a positioning system needs to include the appropriate model if the geoid.<br>Within the confines of time and space, this video is a good explanation.

The probability of observing this given that the sequence is random is approximately 0.057958 (obtained using a binomial distribution).<br><br>The probability of observing 46 0&#39;s and 54 1&#39;s in all cases is the probability of observing it if the sequence is random (times the probability the sequence is random), plus the probability of observing it if it isn&#39;t random (times the probability the sequence isn&#39;t random).<br><br>If the sequence isn&#39;t random, lets assume all occurrences are equally likely. I.E. - 46 0&#39;s and 54 1&#39;s is as equally likely as 2 0&#39;s and 98 1&#39;s. This is actually equivalent to 54 0&#39;s and 46 1&#39;s, so there is symmetry and we&#39;re looking for 2x, where x is the probability of a single outcome. We see that there are clearly only 100 of these, so 2 * 1/100 = 0.02. So the probability of observing 46 0&#39;s and 54 1&#39;s in all cases is 0.057958*0.5 + 0.02*0.5 = 0.038979.<br><br>Given all this information, we can use Bayes&#39; theorem to work out that the updated (posterior) probability of the sequence being random given the observation of single digit occurrence is about 0.74345.<br><br>We can do this with all the other digit sequences of specified length. I.E. - We should expect 00 and 10 to occur with the same frequency. Same thing for 01 and 11. Continue this method for all groupings up to N digits using the posterior probability of randomness from the previous calculation for the new prior probability of randomness for the next calculation, and you will have a maximally informed estimate of the randomness of the sequence.<br><br>I did this method by hand up to N = 3.
