You will notice 2 things:<br>1. The train is passing you more slowly.<br>2. The time between boxcars has increased to 2 minutes.<br><br>Look up:  RASC Calgary Centre - Minima of Algol<br><br>&quot;In May and November, the Earth is moving at &quot;right angles&quot; to the line to Algol. During this time we see minima happening regularly at their 2.867321 day intervals. However, during August, the Earth is rapidly moving towards Algol at about 107,229 km/hr as explained on my How Fast Are We Moving? page. (The Earth moves approximately 202 times its own size in one day.) So in 2.867321 days the Earth moves about 7,379,039 km closer to Algol. But the varying light from Algol doesn&#39;t know this - its light waves left Algol 93 years ago and are travelling at a constant speed. The result - we &quot;catch a bunch of minima early&quot; during August as shown on Chart 2. Exactly the opposite happens during February - the Earth is moving away from Algol that fast and it takes longer for the group of minima to reach us so we see them taking longer between events. How long? 7,379,039 km divided by the speed of light 299,792.458 km/sec is 24.61382 seconds - this rough calculation explains the deviations we see in Graph 2. So in May and November when we are not moving towards or away from Algol - the period seems constant. It is our rapid movement towards or away from the events in August and February that causes the timing differences.&quot;<br><br>In February, when the earth is moving away from Algol there is an increase in time between eclipses and the light is passing the earth at a slower speed.  This is just like when you increase your speed in the same direction that the train is traveling.

The energy of the standing waves is the sum of the upstream and downstream waves (over the contracted length of the object) and it comes out to EXACTLY the rest mass multiplied by the Lorentz factor! Coincidence? I think not...

in 300 years ago the Newtonian mechanics was born<br>during the modern industry germination times, basically the gravity, explosive<br>force or trajectory force was primarily studied. The industrial science<br>develops up today, as the kinetic foundation the Newtonian mechanics should be<br>developed followed by dynamic, have a complete theory system to face all<br>dynamical phenomenon (including personal force). Such as\uff1aelectromechanical dynamics, hot dynamics or<br>hydrodynamics and so on , it is the most important part in all personal living<br>environments. There will have some questions if they are interpreted by the<br>Newtonian mechanics. The most basic reason is that the Newtonian mechanics<br>takes the disposable use of force as the object of research but the modern<br>mechanics mostly needs to face the situation of the long-enduring use of force,<br>and photo-electrical and the Big Bang Theory", "comment_date": "2021-03-09T20:28:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alexander Hugestrand", "comment_text": "Special relativity is dumb, because it makes invalid assumptions about the nature of time, and hides the problems under the carpet.<br><br>All we can say about time is that we experience it as a sequence of events. We measure time by counting periodical events in some system (a clock, the solar system etcetera). And that&#39;s it. We cannot say anything more than that. It can be interesting to note that no events can ever occur without having two frames of reference involved. Things need to keep moving. Motion is the essence to our experience of time.<br><br>What special relativity says is that time in a moving frame of reference, like the international space station to a person on earth, runs slower. Time on earth also runs slower to an observer stationary with respect to the sun. That would imply that the ISS would orbit the earth slower according to that observer. Once a year has passed, earthlings and the observer would disagree on the number of revolutions the ISS has made. But that can&#39;t happen.<br><br>To get away from this obvious contradiction one can probably involve the theory of general relativity and make up a logically coherent explanation. But in order to do so, we need to change the meaning of the word &quot;time&quot;. It&#39;s no longer about the experienced sequence of events. It&#39;s no longer about the rate at which the ISS orbits the earth, and likewise, the speed of the hands on a clock. That notion - the &quot;old&quot; (and only valid) meaning of the word - is no longer subject to time dilation. The time that dilates is something more abstract, something unreal. And as such, time dilation itself is not real.<br><br>Hence, the theory of relativity is missing something essential. It&#39;s wrong but still useful, since it can be used to predict orbits with great precision.

In order to understand the natural laws of the universe, it is necessary to use science and depend less on our common sense. Common sense is useful for living in society and solving our daily problems, but it is not useful for understanding what we cannot see, hear, smell, taste or feel. Trying to understand the macrocosm just by looking at 1% is an impossible task and we can only decorate the theories with philosophy and mathematical equations. The only tool we have to understand the universe is the law of universal gravitation, which seems to be, it continues to work even in the environment of a black hole, but inside, nobody knows what happens to matter, time or space. The microcosm is something we understand much less, everything smaller than the wavelength will never be seen. Albert Einstein relied on the impact force equation to deduce the energy equation F = 1 / 2mv2. If we eliminate 1/2 and assume that force is energy and substitute the speed of an object for the speed of light, the equation is as follows: E = mc2. This formula has several problems. In empirical since it cannot be deduced theoretically and also it cannot be proved that it is true. If the photon has no matter, then it should not be attracted by the gravitational field of a planet, much less by a black hole, it can be concluded that the photon is matter since before a gravitational field of a planet or a black hole it behaves as matter, therefore, matter itself can move at the speed of light and Albert Einstein&#39;s theories are all false.", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:06:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lizard King", "comment_text": "I think relativity clicked when someone pointed out that without it, a charge moving in a magnetic field wouldn&#39;t give consistent trajectories depending on which frame you took to be at rest.. which is clearly a huge problem :O I look forward to this series!", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T01:04:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sarika mishra", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rLWVZVWfdY&amp;t=3m00s\">3:00</a> and that is what flat earthers lack, and end up in the flat Earth society", "comment_date": "2020-07-23T17:01:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PHYSICS INN", "comment_text": "Good", "comment_date": "2020-07-15T09:46:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Du\u0161an Ren\u00e1t", "comment_text": "When people say &quot;relativity is hard&quot;, they almost always mean general relativity.

E=MC2 for example, produces a large number which correlates to nothing useful, probably just there for sophistry (artificial credibility) . Time dilation, is science fiction and faulty thinking.

The answer is that Einstein&#39;s theories aren&#39;t about the way things are.  They are about the way things appear to be.  The accelerating astronaut experiences a Doppler effect that causes a frequency shift that makes time-like events happen more slowly.  Note that this does not actually affect time itself.

I want to say, Henry, I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re doing a longer-form series. I know it moves away from your roots of doing minute-long videos, but a few minutes really isn&#39;t enough time to truly understand complex concepts. I love many educational channels, but I think 3blue1brown has become my favorite (sorry! :c) because his 20, even 30-minute long delves into a topic with enough detail so that you walk away truly understanding the concepts. Plus, they actively encourage you to think deeper about the concepts as you&#39;re watching, rather than simply passively consuming content. Many channels pretty much just throw facts at you without much explanation or thought.
