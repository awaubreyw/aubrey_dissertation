None of the rest mass of the object is converted to energy, assuming it doesn&#39;t undergo nuclear reactions in the process (which would not add much to it anyway, as said in the video) or get into an environment that is extreme enough to violate particle conservation laws. Hawking radiation violates particle conservation, for example.<br><br>Another pretty efficient energy source involving black holes is to extract rotational energy from it. That can be achieved by sending stuff close to it, but not so close that it cannot escape anymore on its own, which can lead to that stuff ending up with a higher sum of kinetic plus potential energy than before... or perhaps it just works wirh photons which can end up witha higher frequency (aka more energy) than before, I&#39;m not sure (there is a video about it somewhere on Youtube). That would be an almost limitless source of energy, as black holes can have stupendously huge amounts of it. For example, the supermassive black hole at M87 (the one we have a picture of)  has a rotational energy of about the equivalent of 10 trillion supernova explosions IIRC... and a few people here might know about how huge just a single supernova is, from the following cite from <a href=\"http://what-if.xkcd.com/73/\">what-if.xkcd.com/73/</a><br><br>&quot;However big you think supernovae are, they&#39;re bigger than that.<br>Here&#39;s a question to give you a sense of scale: Which of the following would be brighter, in terms of the amount of energy delivered to your retina:<br>- A supernova, seen from as far away as the Sun is from the Earth, or<br>- The detonation of a hydrogen bomb pressed against your eyeball?<br>Applying the physicist rule of thumb suggests that the supernova is brighter.

In that case, everything is technically  all sides of the same coin, energy is kinetic, it is stored when it can&#39;t escape a force and moves when another force acts upon it causing it to be converted into a different state in the process when you lift an object up, you apply a force, giving it a potential moving energy into the system, when you release it, it falls back to it&#39;s base state and the energy moves again, when you apply heat to a material, it&#39;s particles store that energy and it is released as they bump into each other or radiate photons away transferring energy into different states or systems, in a chemical reaction, the particles store energy in their bonds and it is released when they fall into more favourable configurations or absorbed to force less favourable outcomes, in nuclear reactions it is the greater strength forces in the atoms nucleus that is overcome and  the energy stored in those bonds is released, in annihilation the fundamental particles have all (or close to all) of the energy they have stored in strong nuclear force released into a free state, the more force applied to the object the more of it&#39;s mass is forced to move apart, if the gravity is strong enough not only will the forces break the nuclear bonds apart but the force of any collision will cause the energy to become free and either reconfigure itself into it&#39;s most stable state until it is forced to change again, perhaps as it is absorbed into another mass, like the black hole. Arguably black holes should be near 100% efficient at freeing energy from it&#39;s current state but will capture any of that energy that moves into it&#39;s influence and convert it back into another state, but due to quantum effects, it will radiate all of it&#39;s stored energy away, either as photons, mass or some other exotic material over countless eons energy is the fluctuation of quantum particles and forces are interactions between that energy and at some level it is trying to find a state where  is uniform and flows from one place to another until it is in a totally balanced system where either it is so spread out interactions are no longer balanced or until everything is even such that all opposing interactions totally cancel out.

Let&#39;s say how much energy do you expect to get from planet Earth falling into the Sun? Lots and lots right? Wrong! Earth rotating around the Sun can be quite accurately viewed as Earth falling towards the Sun but continuously missing it because of its tangent speed component - so you get zero energy out! In fact the opposite is correct: you would have to expend an absolutely enormous amount of energy to make Earth to &quot;fall&quot; on the Sun (by stopping the rotation) and then having a very remote chance of gaining any energy back as Earth would simply accelerate towards Sun transferring its potential energy into kinetic energy with 100% efficiency (i.e. not releasing any energy but simply transforming one kind into another)! Also consider that in the view of E=MC2 and relativist theory in general that means that an object accelerating towards a black hole would be gaining the mass, as it grows with the speed, not losing it! Here you go: your logic is totally backwards from the very start! And I will not even bother to comment on that weird &quot;friction while falling and thus heating and radiating&quot; thing!

Just tossing 2 and half cats into a lone blackhole would just see the cats vanish without a trace....<br><br>Unless the &quot;spegettification&quot; process of the cats is what generates a large enough accretion disk to generate the energy you are looking for?

Eventually they should convert all of their mass to energy, it would just take billions of years depending on its mass. As for the harvesting of the energy that it radiates away, I don&#39;t think that it would be feasible to create a power plant out of a black hole by dropping objects into it. Putting aside all of the gravitational problems that putting one in our solar system would cause, all of the light that was radiated away would be red shifted, changing the wavelength of the light and stretching the wavelength. Since the energy of light is directly proportional to its wavelength, the light emitted would lose a great amount of its energy to the black hole changing the 42% mass conversion into a much smaller number. The light would most likely be red shifted all the way down to radio waves which have much less energy than infrared light. although there are ways to harvest radio waves and convert them to energy, the structure that would need to be build around the black hole is just not feasible and would need an array of many satellites just to be able to harvest the energy back. Even then there is no guarantee that the satellites would be able to withstand the harsh gravitational tides that the black hole puts out since the orbital radius is so small. 42 percent of the mass would be converted to energy but virtually none of it would be acquirable. You would be better harvesting the hawking radiation which is almost nothing for larger black holes.

Sure, given two otherwise identical particle pairs of matter and anti-matter colliding sufficiently slowly may produce solely photons, and thus be maximally efficient at producing energy. But that is almost never the actual example used - as with the cats. If colliding individual particles, doing so slowly is never going to produce enough energy to run your spaceship/nation/etc; while colliding particles quickly produces non-photon particles whose total quantum numbers are zero. If you were colliding larger objects, such as cats, then the anti-particles coming into contact would tend to be the positrons and electrons, and the gamma rays they gave off would then either escape (yay, energy!) or, by interacting with the electric field of the nucleus, be converted back into a positron/electron pair and excess kinetic energy. At some point, you&#39;d start to see nuclear interactions, where you&#39;d have an anti-carbon nucleus interacting with a helium nucleus, or a hydrogen interacting with anti-oxygen. Wouldn&#39;t these imbalanced interactions produce more in the way of random particles, along the lines of the particle spew in an accelerator, than just pure energy?<br><br>After all, the effect of the gamma rays released by the first few perfect &#39;slow&#39; collisions, the ones that don&#39;t escape fully, would be to increase the overall kinetic energy, i.e. the aggregate heat of the object, increasing the speed of the particles, and directly increasing the likelihood that subsequent collisions would reach the higher energy realm where non-photon particle production begins, and all the &#39;perfect efficiency&#39; of your annihilation has flown out the window. <br><br>What would it take to actually achieve this perfect efficiency in a usable quantity in a controlled way?

I appreciate the good analogies which explain clearly how much of an object&#39;s mass is lost in a typical reaction. Unfortunately, the rest is almost completely wrong.

The main mistake being made here is to ignore the black hole itself as a component in the reaction: there is indeed some conversion of &quot;mass into energy&quot;, but it&#39;s not the mass of the cat, but the mass of the <i>combined black hole and cat system.</i> For a rotating black hole, you&#39;re actually extracting energy from the black hole&#39;s rotation (see: Penrose process).<br><br>I at first thought that this video would make the case that black holes convert mass to energy completely because they eventually evaporate if you wait a <i>really</i> long time.
