Dent and Sons, Ltd., 1967), p. 10.<br><br>10 Laws of Nature Regarding Information, which prove evolution false and prove creation is true:<br><br>1. Anything material, such as physical/chemical processes, cannot create something non-material<br>2. Information is a non-material fundamental entity and not a property of matter<br>3. Information requires a material medium for storage and transmission<br>4. Information cannot arise from statistical processes<br>5. There can be no information without a code -- no thought or idea can be shared without a code<br>6. All codes result from an intentional choice and agreement between sender and recipient<br>7. The determination of meaning for and from a set of symbols is a mental process that requires intelligence<br>8. There can be no new information without an intelligent, purposeful sender<br>9.  Any given chain of information can be traced back to an intelligent source<br>10. Information comprises the non-material foundation for all:<br>    a. technological systems<br>    b. works of art<br>    c. biological systems<br><br>Therefore:<br>1. Since the DNA code of all life is clearly within the definition domain of information, we conclude that there must be a sender<br>2. Since the density and complexity of the DNA encoded information is billions of times greater than man&#39;s present technology, we conclude that the sender must be supremely intelligent<br>3. Since the sender must have<br>    a. encoded (stored) the information into the DNA molecules,<br>    b. constructed the molecular biomachines required for the encoding, decoding, and synthesizing process and,<br>    c. designed all the features for the original life forms,<br><br>We conclude the sender must be purposeful and supremely powerful.<br>4. Since information is a non-material fundamental entity and cannot originate from material quantities, we conclude that the sender must have a non-material component<br>5. Since information is a non-material fundamental entity and cannot originate from material quantities, and since information also originates from man, we conclude man&#39;s nature must have a non-material component (spirit)<br>6. Since information is a non-material entity, we conclude that the assumption &quot;the universe is comprised solely of mass and energy&quot; is false.<br>7. Since:<br>    1) biological information originates only from an intelligent sender and,<br>    2) all theories of chemical and biological evolution require that information must originate solely from mass and energy alone (without a sender), we conclude that all theories or concepts of biological evolution are false.<br><br>Anyone who disagrees with these laws and conclusions must falsify them by demonstrating the initial origin of information from purely material sources. Therefore, the laws of nature about information have:  1. refuted the assumption of scientific materialism and the theories of chemical and biological evolution  2. all philosophies or theories based on the assumption of scientific materialism including chemical and biological evolution are falsified by the laws of nature about information.<br><br>For more information: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLb_VYomZkQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLb_VYomZkQ</a>", "comment_date": "2018-11-14T16:53:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Credits unknown", "comment_text": "WHAT!? stegosaurus is evolvin to!: SkyScraper", "comment_date": "2018-08-05T23:07:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "J G", "comment_text": "Even though I agree with you, there was a certain unnecessary hostility in your presentation.

First of we observed the change happening with the rocket and we and our knowledge were there to find out what happened right there and then. Yet they still can&#39;t be sure that that was the problem. Also we are talking about something artificial that got destroyed by us (enginering fault). In nature there are no enginering faults since everything has a purpose. The rings that supposedly caused the mallfunction must have been placed wrong according to the design or the design was faulty. I think you have to agree that that does not mirror nature.<br><br>Having to go back and trying to figure out what happened on earth without having been there makes it all speculative. Seeing as it&#39;s very hard to even find out what happens in the present. And even so we have made leaps in science and technology yet the evidence for evolution is still subjective. There is absolutely nothing that supports it to be true the way that it is presented today. <br><br>Natural selection and evolution are the exact opposites.<br><br>Natural selection is observable, consists of rapid changes in the genome which are there for a particular reason, i.e. changes in enviroment, and species remain original species. The original information within the genome is lost once it mutates. <br><br>Evolution is non observable, consists of random mutations which take a very long time to be completed, yet they result in one species changing to another... The original genome supposedly gains information, it does not already contain it. The last would be a logical assumption.<br><br>Why would it not be observable? If there are fossils that prove the current evolution theorie to be real than there would have to be evidence of these random mutations being vissible in the fossils.. Why would it takes so much time for a mutation to be completed or result in something benificial for the organism? Especially since that&#39;s not what we observe every day. If a locust needs to grow wings because it&#39;s getting to crowded it does so within a day. Why? Because it needs to to survive. The information was already there. It didn&#39;t have to be created out of nothing. <br><br>Lastly, how can random mutations ever result in something benificial or even change an organism into a completely new form without having a purpose??? How can it be random?? If there was any proof for evolution to be like it is stated it would mean that genes mutate with a clear purpose and that it would happen within a short period of time.

I don&#39;t BELIEVE in it in the same way that I might BELIEVE in Santa Claus or believe in miracles.. a great scientist neither believes nor disbelieves a theory.. they simply use the best theory until it is proven not to be supported by new evidence or becomes obsolete with a better theory.. for example the central dogma of biology says that information only flows in one direction.. from DNA to RNA to proteins.. so when scientists found that sometimes RNA can turn into DNA.. it was quite shocking.. because when scientists begin to believe in a theory in the same way we believe in One thing.. we fail to see any other possibilities.. and thus we create a rigid paradigm of thinking that would make it difficult for any future scientist to develop an improved theory..\u00a0even things stronger than theories.. like a law..

about the DNA of algae VS the DNA of shellfish, other than one has more genes than the other.\u00a0 The DNA works the same, the RNA works the same, the ribosomes, the proteins, the basic cellular structures, etc.<br><br>The other conundrum is that no scientific evidence (laboratory or otherwise) has proven that mutations ADD any material to DNA.\u00a0 Mutations always, always, in every scientific investigation or experiment to date either take away DNA, or shut off/turn on genes that should or shouldn&#39;t be on - but the fact remains that the DNA was already present.\u00a0 Take the Sickle Cell Anemia supposed &quot;evolution&quot;.\u00a0 The DNA of these individuals is identical to anyone else.\u00a0 The only change is that certain genes are deactivated or &quot;shut off&quot;

It favors organisms with traits that best enable them to cope with pressures exerted by the environment. At the end of this struggle, the strongest ones, the ones most suited to natural conditions, survive. For example, in a herd of deer under threat from predators, those individuals that can run fastest will naturally survive. As a consequence, the herd of deer will eventually consist of only fast-running individuals.<br><br>However, no matter how long this process goes on, it will not transform those deer into another species. The weak deer are eliminated, the strong survive, but, since no alteration in their genetic data takes place, no transformation of a species occurs. Despite the continuous processes of selection, deer continue to exist as deer.<br><br>The deer example is true for all species. In any population, natural selection only eliminates those weak, or unsuited individuals who are unable to adapt to the natural conditions in their habitat. It does not produce new species, new genetic information, or new organs. That is, it cannot cause anything to evolve. Darwin, too, accepted this fact, stating that &quot;Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations occur.&quot;7 That is why neo-Darwinism had to add the mutation mechanism as a factor altering genetic information to the concept of natural selection.<br><br>We will deal with mutations next. But before proceeding, we need to further examine the concept of natural selection in order to see the contradictions inherent in it.\u00a0<br><br>The essential assumption of the theory of natural selection holds that there is a fierce struggle for survival in nature, and every living thing cares only for itself. At the time Darwin proposed this theory, the ideas of Thomas Malthus, the British classical economist, were an important influence on him. Malthus maintained that human beings were inevitably in a constant struggle for survival, basing his views on the fact that population, and hence the need for food resources, increases geometrically, while food resources themselves increase only arithmetically. The result is that population size is inevitably checked by factors in the environment, such as hunger and disease. Darwin adapted Malthus&#39;s vision of a fierce struggle for survival among human beings to nature at large, and claimed that &quot;natural selection&quot; is a consequence of this struggle.<br><br>Further research, however, revealed that there was no struggle for life in nature as Darwin had postulated. As a result of extensive research into animal groups in the 1960s and 1970s, V. C. Wynne-Edwards, a British zoologist, concluded that living things balance their population in an interesting way, which prevents competition for food. Animal groups were simply managing their population on the basis of their food resources. Population was regulated not by elimination of the weak through factors like epidemics or starvation, but by instinctive control mechanisms. In other words, animals controlled their numbers not by fierce competition, as Darwin suggested, but by limiting reproduction.8<br><br>Even plants exhibited examples of population control, which invalidated Darwin&#39;s suggestion of selection by means of competition. The botanist A. D. Bradshaw&#39;s observations indicated that during reproduction, plants behaved according to the &quot;density&quot; of the planting, and limited their reproduction if the area was highly populated with plants.9 On the other hand, examples of sacrifice observed in animals such as ants and bees display a model completely opposed to the Darwinist struggle for survival.<br><br>In recent years, research has revealed findings regarding self-sacrifice even in bacteria. These living things without brains or nervous systems, totally devoid of any capacity for thought, kill themselves to save other bacteria when they are invaded by viruses.10<br><br>These examples surely invalidate the basic assumption of natural selection-the absolute struggle for survival. It is true that there is competition in nature; however, there are clear models of self-sacrifice and solidarity, as well.<br><br><br>Apart from the theoretical weaknesses mentioned above, the theory of evolution by natural selection comes up against a fundamental impasse when faced with concrete scientific findings. The scientific value of a theory must be assessed according to its success or failure in experiment and observation. Evolution by natural selection fails on both counts.<br><br><br>Mutations<br>Mutations are defined as breaks or replacements taking place in the DNA molecule, which is found in the nuclei of the cells of a living organism and which contains all its genetic information. These breaks or replacements are the result of external effects such as radiation or chemical action. Every mutation is an &quot;accident,&quot; and either damages the nucleotides making up the DNA or changes their locations. Most of the time, they cause so much damage and modification that the cell cannot repair them.<br><br>Mutation, which evolutionists frequently hide behind, is not a magic wand that transforms living organisms into a more advanced and perfect form. The direct effect of mutations is harmful. The changes effected by mutations can only be like those experienced by people in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl: that is, death, disability, and freaks of nature\u2026<br><br>The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only damage it. Biologist B. G. Ranganathan states:<br><br>First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building, which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.19<br><br>Not surprisingly, no useful mutation has been so far observed. All mutations have proved to be harmful. The evolutionist scientist Warren Weaver comments on the report prepared by the Committee on Genetic Effects of Atomic Radiation, which had been formed to investigate mutations that might have been caused by the nuclear weapons used in the Second World War:<br><br>Many will be puzzled about the statement that practically all known mutant genes are harmful. For mutations are a necessary part of the process of evolution. How can a good effect-evolution to higher forms of life-result from mutations practically all of which are harmful?20<br><br>Every effort put into &quot;generating a useful mutation&quot; has resulted in failure. For decades, evolutionists carried out many experiments to produce mutations in fruit flies, as these insects reproduce very rapidly and so mutations would show up quickly. Generation upon generation of these flies were mutated, yet no useful mutation was ever observed. The evolutionist geneticist Gordon Taylor writes thus:<br><br>It is a striking, but not much mentioned fact that, though geneticists have been breeding fruit-flies for sixty years or more in labs all round the world- flies which produce a new generation every eleven days-they have never yet seen the emergence of a new species or even a new enzyme.21<br><br>Another researcher, Michael Pitman, comments on the failure of the experiments carried out on fruit flies:<br><br>Morgan, Goldschmidt, Muller, and other geneticists have subjected generations of fruit flies to extreme conditions of heat, cold, light, dark, and treatment by chemicals and radiation. All sorts of mutations, practically all trivial or positively deleterious, have been produced. Man-made evolution? Not really: Few of the geneticists&#39; monsters could have survived outside the bottles they were bred in. In practice mutants die, are sterile, or tend to revert to the wild type.22<br><br>The same holds true for man. All mutations that have been observed in human beings have had deleterious results. All mutations that take place in humans result in physical deformities, in infirmities such as mongolism, Down syndrome, albinism, dwarfism or cancer. Needless to say, a process that leaves people disabled or sick cannot be &quot;an evolutionary mechanism&quot;-evolution is supposed to produce forms that are better fitted to survive.<br><br>The American pathologist David A. Demick notes the following in a scientific article about mutations:<br><br>Literally thousands of human diseases associated with genetic mutations have been catalogued in recent years, with more being described continually. A recent reference book of medical genetics listed some 4,500 different genetic diseases. Some of the inherited syndromes characterized clinically in the days before molecular genetic analysis (such as Marfan&#39;s syndrome) are now being shown to be heterogeneous; that is, associated with many different mutations... With this array of human diseases that are caused by mutations, what of positive effects? With thousands of examples of harmful mutations readily available, surely it should be possible to describe some positive mutations if macroevolution is true. These would be needed not only for evolution to greater complexity, but also to offset the downward pull of the many harmful mutations. But, when it comes to identifying positive mutations, evolutionary scientists are strangely silent.23<br><br>The only instance evolutionary biologists give of &quot;useful mutation&quot; is the disease known as sickle cell anemia. In this, the hemoglobin molecule, which serves to carry oxygen in the blood, is damaged as a result of mutation, and undergoes a structural change. As a result of this, the hemoglobin molecule&#39;s ability to carry oxygen is seriously impaired. People with sickle cell anemia suffer increasing respiratory difficulties for this reason. However, this example of mutation, which is discussed under blood disorders in medical textbooks, is strangely evaluated by some evolutionary biologists as a &quot;useful mutation.&quot;<br><br>They say that the partial immunity to malaria by those with the illness is a &quot;gift&quot; of evolution. Using the same logic, one could say that, since people born with genetic leg paralysis are unable to walk and so are saved from being killed in traffic accidents, therefore genetic leg paralysis is a &quot;useful genetic feature.&quot; This logic is clearly totally unfounded.<br><br>It is obvious that mutations are solely a destructive mechanism. Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, former president of the French Academy of Sciences, is quite clear on this point in a comment he made about mutations. Grass\u00e9 compared mutations to &quot;making mistakes in the letters when copying a written text.&quot; And as with mutations, letter mistakes cannot give rise to any information, but merely damage such information as already exists. Grass\u00e9 explained this fact in this way:<br><br>Mutations, in time, occur incoherently. They are not complementary to one another, nor are they cumulative in successive generations toward a given direction. They modify what preexists, but they do so in disorder, no matter how\u2026. As soon as some disorder, even slight, appears in an organized being, sickness, then death follow. There is no possible compromise between the phenomenon of life and anarchy.24<br>So for that reason, as Grass\u00e9 puts it, &quot;No matter how numerous they may be, mutations do not produce any kind of evolution.&quot;25<br><br><br><br>The Pleiotropic Effect<br>The most important proof that mutations lead only to damage, is the process of genetic coding. Almost all of the genes in a fully developed living thing carry more than one piece of information. For instance, one gene may control both the height and the eye color of that organism. Microbiologist Michael Denton explains this characteristic of genes in higher organisms such as human beings, in this way:<br><br>The effects of genes on development are often surprisingly diverse. In the house mouse, nearly every coat-colour gene has some effect on body size. Out of seventeen x-ray induced eye colour mutations in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, fourteen affected the shape of the sex organs of the female, a characteristic that one would have thought was quite unrelated to eye colour. Almost every gene that has been studied in higher organisms has been found to effect more than one organ system, a multiple effect which is known as pleiotropy. As Mayr argues in Population, Species and Evolution: &quot;It is doubtful whether any genes that are not pleiotropic exist in higher organisms.&quot;26<br><br>Because of this characteristic of the genetic structure of living things, any coincidental change because of a mutation, in any gene in the DNA, will affect more than one organ. Consequently, this mutation will not be restricted to one part of the body, but will reveal more of its destructive impact. Even if one of these impacts turns out to be beneficial, as a result of a very rare coincidence, the unavoidable effects of the other damage it causes will more than outweigh those benefits.<br><br>To summarize, there are three main reasons why mutations cannot make evolution possible:<br><br>l- The direct effect of mutations is harmful: Since they occur randomly, they almost always damage the living organism that undergoes them. Reason tells us that unconscious intervention in a perfect and complex structure will not improve that structure, but will rather impair it. Indeed, no &quot;useful mutation&quot; has ever been observed.<br><br>2- Mutations add no new information to an organism&#39;s DNA: The particles making up the genetic information are either torn from their places, destroyed, or carried off to different places. Mutations cannot make a living thing acquire a new organ or a new trait. They only cause abnormalities like a leg sticking out of the back, or an ear from the abdomen.<br><br>3- In order for a mutation to be transferred to the subsequent generation, it has to have taken place in the reproductive cells of the organism: A random change that occurs in a cell or organ of the body cannot be transferred to the next generation. For example, a human eye altered by the effects of radiation, or by other causes, will not be passed on to subsequent generations.<br><br>All the explanations provided above indicate that natural selection and mutation have no evolutionary effect at all. So far, no observable example of &quot;evolution&quot; has been obtained by this method. Sometimes, evolutionary biologists claim that &quot;they cannot observe the evolutionary effect of natural selection and mutation mechanisms since these mechanisms take place only over an extended period of time.&quot; However, this argument, which is just a way of making themselves feel better, is baseless, in the sense that it lacks any scientific foundation. During his lifetime, a scientist can observe thousands of generations of living things with short life spans such as fruit flies or bacteria, and still observe no &quot;evolution.&quot; Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9 states the following about the unchanging nature of bacteria, a fact which invalidates evolution:<br><br>Bacteria ...are the organisms which, because of their huge numbers, produce the most mutants. acteria ...exhibit a great fidelity to their species. The bacillus Escherichia coli, whose mutants have been studied very carefully, is the best example. The reader will agree that it is surprising, to say the least, to want to prove evolution and to discover its mechanisms and then to choose as a material for this study a being which practically stabilized a billion years ago! What is the use of their unceasing mutations, if they do not [produce evolutionary] change? In sum, the mutations of bacteria and viruses are merely hereditary fluctuations around a median position; a swing to the right, a swing to the left, but no final evolutionary effect. Cockroaches, which are one of the most venerable living insect groups, have remained more or less unchanged since the Permian, yet they have undergone as many mutations as Drosophila, a Tertiary insect. 27<br><br>Briefly, it is impossible for living beings to have evolved, because there exists no mechanism in nature that can cause evolution. Furthermore, this conclusion agrees with the evidence of the fossil record, which does not demonstrate the existence of a process of evolution, but rather just the contrary.<br>7 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, The Modern Library, New York, p. 127.

No one has ever got near it, and most of the current argument in neo-Darwinism is about this question.11<br><br>Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, a well-known French zoologist and critic of Darwinism, has these words to say in &quot;Evolution and Natural Selection,&quot; a chapter of his book The Evolution of Living Organisms.<br><br>The &quot;evolution in action&quot; of J. Huxley and other biologists is simply the observation of demographic facts, local fluctuations of genotypes, geographical distributions. Often the species concerned have remained practically unchanged for hundreds of centuries! Fluctuation as a result of circumstances, with prior modification of the genome, does not imply evolution, and we have tangible proof of this in many panchronic species [i.e. living fossils that remain unchanged for millions of years].12<br><br>A close look at a few &quot;observed examples of natural selection&quot; presented by biologists who advocate the theory of evolution, would reveal that, in reality, they do not provide any evidence for evolution.<br><br>The True Story Of The Industrial Melanism<br>When evolutionist sources are examined, one inevitably sees that the example of moths in England during the Industrial Revolution is cited as an example of evolution by natural selection. This is put forward as the most concrete example of evolution observed, in textbooks, magazines, and even academic sources. In actuality, though, that example has nothing to do with evolution at all.<br><br>Let us first recall what is actually said: According to this account, around the onset of the Industrial Revolution in England, the color of tree barks around Manchester was quite light. Because of this, dark-colored moths resting on those trees could easily be noticed by the birds that fed on them, and therefore they had very little chance of survival. Fifty years later, in woodlands where industrial pollution has killed the lichens, the bark of the trees had darkened, and now the light-colored moths became the most hunted, since they were the most easily noticed. As a result, the proportion of light-colored to dark-colored moths decreased. Evolutionists believe this to be a great piece of evidence for their theory. They take refuge and solace in window-dressing, showing how light-colored moths &quot;evolved&quot; into dark-colored ones.<br><br><br>However, although we believe these facts to be correct, it should be quite clear that they can in no way be used as evidence for the theory of evolution, since no new form arose that had not existed before. Dark colored moths had existed in the moth population before the Industrial Revolution. Only the relative proportions of the existing moth varieties in the population changed. The moths had not acquired a new trait or organ, which would cause &quot;speciation.&quot;13 In order for one moth species to turn into another living species, a bird for example, new additions would have had to be made to its genes. That is, an entirely separate genetic program would have had to be loaded so as to include information about the physical traits of the bird.<br><br>This is the answer to be given to the evolutionist story of Industrial Melanism. However, there is a more interesting side to the story: Not just its interpretation, but the story itself is flawed. As molecular biologist Jonathan Wells explains in his book Icons of Evolution, the story of the peppered moths, which is included in every evolutionary biology book and has therefore, become an &quot;icon&quot; in this sense, does not reflect the truth. Wells discusses in his book how Bernard Kettlewell&#39;s experiment, which is known as the &quot;experimental proof&quot; of the story, is actually a scientific scandal. Some basic elements of this scandal are:<br><br>- Many experiments conducted after Kettlewell&#39;s revealed that only one type of these moths rested on tree trunks, and all other types preferred to rest beneath small, horizontal branches. Since 1980 it has become clear that peppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks. In 25 years of fieldwork, many scientists such as Cyril Clarke and Rory Howlett, Michael Majerus, Tony Liebert, and Paul Brakefield concluded that in Kettlewell&#39;s experiment, moths were forced to act atypically, therefore, the test results could not be accepted as scientific.14<br><br>- Scientists who tested Kettlewell&#39;s conclusions came up with an even more interesting result: Although the number of light moths would be expected to be larger in the less polluted regions of England, the dark moths there numbered four times as many as the light ones. This meant that there was no correlation between the moth population and the tree trunks as claimed by Kettlewell and repeated by almost all evolutionist sources.<br><br>- As the research deepened, the scandal changed dimension: &quot;The moths on tree trunks&quot; photographed by Kettlewell, were actually dead moths. Kettlewell used dead specimens glued or pinned to tree trunks and then photographed them. In truth, there was little chance of taking such a picture as the moths rested not on tree trunks but underneath the leaves.15<br><br>These facts were uncovered by the scientific community only in the late 1990s. The collapse of the myth of Industrial Melanism, which had been one of the most treasured subjects in &quot;Introduction to Evolution&quot; courses in universities for decades, greatly disappointed evolutionists. One of them, Jerry Coyne, remarked:<br><br>My own reaction resembles the dismay attending my discovery, at the age of six, that it was my father and not Santa who brought the presents on Christmas Eve.16<br><br>Thus, &quot;the most famous example of natural selection&quot; was relegated to the trash-heap of history as a scientific scandal-which was inevitable, because natural selection is not an &quot;evolutionary mechanism,&quot; contrary to what evolutionists claim.<br><br>In short, natural selection is capable neither of adding a new organ to a living organism, nor of removing one, nor of changing an organism of one species into that of another. The &quot;greatest&quot; evidence put forward since Darwin has been able to go no further than the &quot;industrial melanism&quot; of moths in England.<br><br><br>Why Natural Selection Can Not Explain Complexity?<br><br>As we showed at the beginning, the greatest problem for the theory of evolution by natural selection, is that it cannot enable new organs or traits to emerge in living things. Natural selection cannot develop a species&#39; genetic data; therefore, it cannot be used to account for the emergence of new species. The greatest defender of the theory of punctuated equilibrium, Stephen Jay Gould, refers to this impasse of natural selection as follows;<br><br>The essence of Darwinism lies in a single phrase: natural selection is the creative force of evolutionary change. No one denies that selection will play a negative role in eliminating the unfit. Darwinian theories require that it create the fit as well.17<br><br>Another of the misleading methods that evolutionists employ on the issue of natural selection is their effort to present this mechanism as an intelligent designer. However,natural selection has no intelligence. It does not possess a will that can decide what is good and what is bad for living things. As a result, natural selection cannot explain biological systems and organs that possess the feature of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;. These systems and organs are composed of a great number of parts cooperating together, and are of no use if even one of these parts is missing or defective. (For example, the human eye does not function unless it exists with all its components intact).<br><br>Therefore, the will that brings all these parts together should be able to foresee the future and aim directly at the advantage that is to be acquired at the final stage. Since natural selection has no consciousness or will, it can do no such thing. This fact, which demolishes the foundations of the theory of evolution, also worried Darwin, who wrote: &quot;If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.&quot;18<br><br>Mutations<br>Mutations are defined as breaks or replacements taking place in the DNA molecule, which is found in the nuclei of the cells of a living organism and which contains all its genetic information. These breaks or replacements are the result of external effects such as radiation or chemical action. Every mutation is an &quot;accident,&quot; and either damages the nucleotides making up the DNA or changes their locations. Most of the time, they cause so much damage and modification that the cell cannot repair them.<br><br>Mutation, which evolutionists frequently hide behind, is not a magic wand that transforms living organisms into a more advanced and perfect form. The direct effect of mutations is harmful. The changes effected by mutations can only be like those experienced by people in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl: that is, death, disability, and freaks of nature\u2026<br><br>The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only damage it. Biologist B. G. Ranganathan states:<br><br>First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building, which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.19<br><br>Not surprisingly, no useful mutation has been so far observed. All mutations have proved to be harmful. The evolutionist scientist Warren Weaver comments on the report prepared by the Committee on Genetic Effects of Atomic Radiation, which had been formed to investigate mutations that might have been caused by the nuclear weapons used in the Second World War:<br><br>Many will be puzzled about the statement that practically all known mutant genes are harmful. For mutations are a necessary part of the process of evolution. How can a good effect-evolution to higher forms of life-result from mutations practically all of which are harmful?20<br><br>Every effort put into &quot;generating a useful mutation&quot; has resulted in failure. For decades, evolutionists carried out many experiments to produce mutations in fruit flies, as these insects reproduce very rapidly and so mutations would show up quickly. Generation upon generation of these flies were mutated, yet no useful mutation was ever observed. The evolutionist geneticist Gordon Taylor writes thus:<br><br>It is a striking, but not much mentioned fact that, though geneticists have been breeding fruit-flies for sixty years or more in labs all round the world- flies which produce a new generation every eleven days-they have never yet seen the emergence of a new species or even a new enzyme.21<br><br>Another researcher, Michael Pitman, comments on the failure of the experiments carried out on fruit flies:<br><br>Morgan, Goldschmidt, Muller, and other geneticists have subjected generations of fruit flies to extreme conditions of heat, cold, light, dark, and treatment by chemicals and radiation. All sorts of mutations, practically all trivial or positively deleterious, have been produced. Man-made evolution? Not really: Few of the geneticists&#39; monsters could have survived outside the bottles they were bred in. In practice mutants die, are sterile, or tend to revert to the wild type.22<br><br>The same holds true for man. All mutations that have been observed in human beings have had deleterious results. All mutations that take place in humans result in physical deformities, in infirmities such as mongolism, Down syndrome, albinism, dwarfism or cancer. Needless to say, a process that leaves people disabled or sick cannot be &quot;an evolutionary mechanism&quot;-evolution is supposed to produce forms that are better fitted to survive.<br><br>The American pathologist David A. Demick notes the following in a scientific article about mutations:<br><br>Literally thousands of human diseases associated with genetic mutations have been catalogued in recent years, with more being described continually. A recent reference book of medical genetics listed some 4,500 different genetic diseases. Some of the inherited syndromes characterized clinically in the days before molecular genetic analysis (such as Marfan&#39;s syndrome) are now being shown to be heterogeneous; that is, associated with many different mutations... With this array of human diseases that are caused by mutations, what of positive effects? With thousands of examples of harmful mutations readily available, surely it should be possible to describe some positive mutations if macroevolution is true. These would be needed not only for evolution to greater complexity, but also to offset the downward pull of the many harmful mutations. But, when it comes to identifying positive mutations, evolutionary scientists are strangely silent.23<br><br>The only instance evolutionary biologists give of &quot;useful mutation&quot; is the disease known as sickle cell anemia. In this, the hemoglobin molecule, which serves to carry oxygen in the blood, is damaged as a result of mutation, and undergoes a structural change. As a result of this, the hemoglobin molecule&#39;s ability to carry oxygen is seriously impaired. People with sickle cell anemia suffer increasing respiratory difficulties for this reason. However, this example of mutation, which is discussed under blood disorders in medical textbooks, is strangely evaluated by some evolutionary biologists as a &quot;useful mutation.&quot;<br><br>They say that the partial immunity to malaria by those with the illness is a &quot;gift&quot; of evolution. Using the same logic, one could say that, since people born with genetic leg paralysis are unable to walk and so are saved from being killed in traffic accidents, therefore genetic leg paralysis is a &quot;useful genetic feature.&quot; This logic is clearly totally unfounded.<br><br>It is obvious that mutations are solely a destructive mechanism. Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, former president of the French Academy of Sciences, is quite clear on this point in a comment he made about mutations. Grass\u00e9 compared mutations to &quot;making mistakes in the letters when copying a written text.&quot; And as with mutations, letter mistakes cannot give rise to any information, but merely damage such information as already exists. Grass\u00e9 explained this fact in this way:<br><br>Mutations, in time, occur incoherently. They are not complementary to one another, nor are they cumulative in successive generations toward a given direction. They modify what preexists, but they do so in disorder, no matter how\u2026. As soon as some disorder, even slight, appears in an organized being, sickness, then death follow. There is no possible compromise between the phenomenon of life and anarchy.24<br>So for that reason, as Grass\u00e9 puts it, &quot;No matter how numerous they may be, mutations do not produce any kind of evolution.&quot;25<br><br><br><br>The Pleiotropic Effect<br>The most important proof that mutations lead only to damage, is the process of genetic coding. Almost all of the genes in a fully developed living thing carry more than one piece of information. For instance, one gene may control both the height and the eye color of that organism. Microbiologist Michael Denton explains this characteristic of genes in higher organisms such as human beings, in this way:<br><br>The effects of genes on development are often surprisingly diverse. In the house mouse, nearly every coat-colour gene has some effect on body size. Out of seventeen x-ray induced eye colour mutations in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, fourteen affected the shape of the sex organs of the female, a characteristic that one would have thought was quite unrelated to eye colour. Almost every gene that has been studied in higher organisms has been found to effect more than one organ system, a multiple effect which is known as pleiotropy. As Mayr argues in Population, Species and Evolution: &quot;It is doubtful whether any genes that are not pleiotropic exist in higher organisms.&quot;26<br><br>Because of this characteristic of the genetic structure of living things, any coincidental change because of a mutation, in any gene in the DNA, will affect more than one organ. Consequently, this mutation will not be restricted to one part of the body, but will reveal more of its destructive impact. Even if one of these impacts turns out to be beneficial, as a result of a very rare coincidence, the unavoidable effects of the other damage it causes will more than outweigh those benefits.<br><br>To summarize, there are three main reasons why mutations cannot make evolution possible:<br><br>l- The direct effect of mutations is harmful: Since they occur randomly, they almost always damage the living organism that undergoes them. Reason tells us that unconscious intervention in a perfect and complex structure will not improve that structure, but will rather impair it. Indeed, no &quot;useful mutation&quot; has ever been observed.<br><br>2- Mutations add no new information to an organism&#39;s DNA: The particles making up the genetic information are either torn from their places, destroyed, or carried off to different places. Mutations cannot make a living thing acquire a new organ or a new trait. They only cause abnormalities like a leg sticking out of the back, or an ear from the abdomen.<br><br>3- In order for a mutation to be transferred to the subsequent generation, it has to have taken place in the reproductive cells of the organism: A random change that occurs in a cell or organ of the body cannot be transferred to the next generation. For example, a human eye altered by the effects of radiation, or by other causes, will not be passed on to subsequent generations.<br><br>All the explanations provided above indicate that natural selection and mutation have no evolutionary effect at all. So far, no observable example of &quot;evolution&quot; has been obtained by this method. Sometimes, evolutionary biologists claim that &quot;they cannot observe the evolutionary effect of natural selection and mutation mechanisms since these mechanisms take place only over an extended period of time.&quot; However, this argument, which is just a way of making themselves feel better, is baseless, in the sense that it lacks any scientific foundation. During his lifetime, a scientist can observe thousands of generations of living things with short life spans such as fruit flies or bacteria, and still observe no &quot;evolution.&quot; Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9 states the following about the unchanging nature of bacteria, a fact which invalidates evolution:<br><br>Bacteria ...are the organisms which, because of their huge numbers, produce the most mutants. acteria ...exhibit a great fidelity to their species. The bacillus Escherichia coli, whose mutants have been studied very carefully, is the best example. The reader will agree that it is surprising, to say the least, to want to prove evolution and to discover its mechanisms and then to choose as a material for this study a being which practically stabilized a billion years ago! What is the use of their unceasing mutations, if they do not [produce evolutionary] change? In sum, the mutations of bacteria and viruses are merely hereditary fluctuations around a median position; a swing to the right, a swing to the left, but no final evolutionary effect. Cockroaches, which are one of the most venerable living insect groups, have remained more or less unchanged since the Permian, yet they have undergone as many mutations as Drosophila, a Tertiary insect. 27<br><br>Briefly, it is impossible for living beings to have evolved, because there exists no mechanism in nature that can cause evolution. Furthermore, this conclusion agrees with the evidence of the fossil record, which does not demonstrate the existence of a process of evolution, but rather just the contrary.<br>7 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, The Modern Library, New York, p. 127.

It cannot be used to explain how creatures came into being from other creatures.<br><br>The concept of natural selection was the basis of Darwinism. This assertion is stressed even in the title of the book in which Darwin proposed his theory: The Origin of Species, by means of Natural Selection\u2026<br><br>Natural selection is based on the assumption that in nature there is a constant struggle for survival. It favors organisms with traits that best enable them to cope with pressures exerted by the environment. At the end of this struggle, the strongest ones, the ones most suited to natural conditions, survive. For example, in a herd of deer under threat from predators, those individuals that can run fastest will naturally survive. As a consequence, the herd of deer will eventually consist of only fast-running individuals.<br><br>However, no matter how long this process goes on, it will not transform those deer into another species. The weak deer are eliminated, the strong survive, but, since no alteration in their genetic data takes place, no transformation of a species occurs. Despite the continuous processes of selection, deer continue to exist as deer.<br><br>The deer example is true for all species. In any population, natural selection only eliminates those weak, or unsuited individuals who are unable to adapt to the natural conditions in their habitat. It does not produce new species, new genetic information, or new organs. That is, it cannot cause anything to evolve. Darwin, too, accepted this fact, stating that &quot;Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations occur.&quot;7 That is why neo-Darwinism had to add the mutation mechanism as a factor altering genetic information to the concept of natural selection.<br><br>We will deal with mutations next. But before proceeding, we need to further examine the concept of natural selection in order to see the contradictions inherent in it.<br><br><br>The essential assumption of the theory of natural selection holds that there is a fierce struggle for survival in nature, and every living thing cares only for itself. At the time Darwin proposed this theory, the ideas of Thomas Malthus, the British classical economist, were an important influence on him. Malthus maintained that human beings were inevitably in a constant struggle for survival, basing his views on the fact that population, and hence the need for food resources, increases geometrically, while food resources themselves increase only arithmetically. The result is that population size is inevitably checked by factors in the environment, such as hunger and disease. Darwin adapted Malthus&#39;s vision of a fierce struggle for survival among human beings to nature at large, and claimed that &quot;natural selection&quot; is a consequence of this struggle.<br><br>Further research, however, revealed that there was no struggle for life in nature as Darwin had postulated. As a result of extensive research into animal groups in the 1960s and 1970s, V. C. Wynne-Edwards, a British zoologist, concluded that living things balance their population in an interesting way, which prevents competition for food. Animal groups were simply managing their population on the basis of their food resources. Population was regulated not by elimination of the weak through factors like epidemics or starvation, but by instinctive control mechanisms. In other words, animals controlled their numbers not by fierce competition, as Darwin suggested, but by limiting reproduction.8<br><br>Even plants exhibited examples of population control, which invalidated Darwin&#39;s suggestion of selection by means of competition. The botanist A. D. Bradshaw&#39;s observations indicated that during reproduction, plants behaved according to the &quot;density&quot; of the planting, and limited their reproduction if the area was highly populated with plants.9 On the other hand, examples of sacrifice observed in animals such as ants and bees display a model completely opposed to the Darwinist struggle for survival.<br><br>In recent years, research has revealed findings regarding self-sacrifice even in bacteria. These living things without brains or nervous systems, totally devoid of any capacity for thought, kill themselves to save other bacteria when they are invaded by viruses.10<br><br>These examples surely invalidate the basic assumption of natural selection-the absolute struggle for survival. It is true that there is competition in nature; however, there are clear models of self-sacrifice and solidarity, as well.<br><br><br>Apart from the theoretical weaknesses mentioned above, the theory of evolution by natural selection comes up against a fundamental impasse when faced with concrete scientific findings. The scientific value of a theory must be assessed according to its success or failure in experiment and observation. Evolution by natural selection fails on both counts.<br><br>Since Darwin&#39;s time, there has not been a single shred of evidence put forward to show that natural selection causes living things to evolve. Colin Patterson, the senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History in London and a prominent evolutionist, stresses that natural selection has never been observed to have the ability to cause things to evolve:<br><br>No one has ever produced a species by the mechanisms of natural selection. No one has ever got near it, and most of the current argument in neo-Darwinism is about this question.11<br><br>Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, a well-known French zoologist and critic of Darwinism, has these words to say in &quot;Evolution and Natural Selection,&quot; a chapter of his book The Evolution of Living Organisms.<br><br>The &quot;evolution in action&quot; of J. Huxley and other biologists is simply the observation of demographic facts, local fluctuations of genotypes, geographical distributions. Often the species concerned have remained practically unchanged for hundreds of centuries! Fluctuation as a result of circumstances, with prior modification of the genome, does not imply evolution, and we have tangible proof of this in many panchronic species [i.e. living fossils that remain unchanged for millions of years].12<br><br>A close look at a few &quot;observed examples of natural selection&quot; presented by biologists who advocate the theory of evolution, would reveal that, in reality, they do not provide any evidence for evolution.<br><br><br><br>The True Story Of The Industrial Melanism<br><br>When evolutionist sources are examined, one inevitably sees that the example of moths in England during the Industrial Revolution is cited as an example of evolution by natural selection. This is put forward as the most concrete example of evolution observed, in textbooks, magazines, and even academic sources. In actuality, though, that example has nothing to do with evolution at all.<br><br>Let us first recall what is actually said: According to this account, around the onset of the Industrial Revolution in England, the color of tree barks around Manchester was quite light. Because of this, dark-colored moths resting on those trees could easily be noticed by the birds that fed on them, and therefore they had very little chance of survival. Fifty years later, in woodlands where industrial pollution has killed the lichens, the bark of the trees had darkened, and now the light-colored moths became the most hunted, since they were the most easily noticed. As a result, the proportion of light-colored to dark-colored moths decreased. Evolutionists believe this to be a great piece of evidence for their theory. They take refuge and solace in window-dressing, showing how light-colored moths &quot;evolved&quot; into dark-colored ones.<br><br><br>However, although we believe these facts to be correct, it should be quite clear that they can in no way be used as evidence for the theory of evolution, since no new form arose that had not existed before.

The changes effected by mutations can only be like those experienced by people in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl: that is, death, disability, and freaks of nature\u2026<br><br>The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only damage it. Biologist B. G. Ranganathan states:<br><br>First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature. Secondly, most mutations are harmful since they are random, rather than orderly changes in the structure of genes; any random change in a highly ordered system will be for the worse, not for the better. For example, if an earthquake were to shake a highly ordered structure such as a building, there would be a random change in the framework of the building, which, in all probability, would not be an improvement.19<br><br>Not surprisingly, no useful mutation has been so far observed. All mutations have proved to be harmful. The evolutionist scientist Warren Weaver comments on the report prepared by the Committee on Genetic Effects of Atomic Radiation, which had been formed to investigate mutations that might have been caused by the nuclear weapons used in the Second World War:<br><br>Many will be puzzled about the statement that practically all known mutant genes are harmful. For mutations are a necessary part of the process of evolution. How can a good effect-evolution to higher forms of life-result from mutations practically all of which are harmful?20<br><br>Every effort put into &quot;generating a useful mutation&quot; has resulted in failure. For decades, evolutionists carried out many experiments to produce mutations in fruit flies, as these insects reproduce very rapidly and so mutations would show up quickly. Generation upon generation of these flies were mutated, yet no useful mutation was ever observed. The evolutionist geneticist Gordon Taylor writes thus:<br><br>It is a striking, but not much mentioned fact that, though geneticists have been breeding fruit-flies for sixty years or more in labs all round the world- flies which produce a new generation every eleven days-they have never yet seen the emergence of a new species or even a new enzyme.21<br><br>Another researcher, Michael Pitman, comments on the failure of the experiments carried out on fruit flies:<br><br>Morgan, Goldschmidt, Muller, and other geneticists have subjected generations of fruit flies to extreme conditions of heat, cold, light, dark, and treatment by chemicals and radiation. All sorts of mutations, practically all trivial or positively deleterious, have been produced. Man-made evolution? Not really: Few of the geneticists&#39; monsters could have survived outside the bottles they were bred in. In practice mutants die, are sterile, or tend to revert to the wild type.22<br><br>The same holds true for man. All mutations that have been observed in human beings have had deleterious results. All mutations that take place in humans result in physical deformities, in infirmities such as mongolism, Down syndrome, albinism, dwarfism or cancer. Needless to say, a process that leaves people disabled or sick cannot be &quot;an evolutionary mechanism&quot;-evolution is supposed to produce forms that are better fitted to survive.<br><br>The American pathologist David A. Demick notes the following in a scientific article about mutations:<br><br>Literally thousands of human diseases associated with genetic mutations have been catalogued in recent years, with more being described continually. A recent reference book of medical genetics listed some 4,500 different genetic diseases. Some of the inherited syndromes characterized clinically in the days before molecular genetic analysis (such as Marfan&#39;s syndrome) are now being shown to be heterogeneous; that is, associated with many different mutations... With this array of human diseases that are caused by mutations, what of positive effects? With thousands of examples of harmful mutations readily available, surely it should be possible to describe some positive mutations if macroevolution is true. These would be needed not only for evolution to greater complexity, but also to offset the downward pull of the many harmful mutations. But, when it comes to identifying positive mutations, evolutionary scientists are strangely silent.23<br><br>The only instance evolutionary biologists give of &quot;useful mutation&quot; is the disease known as sickle cell anemia. In this, the hemoglobin molecule, which serves to carry oxygen in the blood, is damaged as a result of mutation, and undergoes a structural change. As a result of this, the hemoglobin molecule&#39;s ability to carry oxygen is seriously impaired. People with sickle cell anemia suffer increasing respiratory difficulties for this reason. However, this example of mutation, which is discussed under blood disorders in medical textbooks, is strangely evaluated by some evolutionary biologists as a &quot;useful mutation.&quot;<br><br>They say that the partial immunity to malaria by those with the illness is a &quot;gift&quot; of evolution. Using the same logic, one could say that, since people born with genetic leg paralysis are unable to walk and so are saved from being killed in traffic accidents, therefore genetic leg paralysis is a &quot;useful genetic feature.&quot; This logic is clearly totally unfounded.<br><br>It is obvious that mutations are solely a destructive mechanism. Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, former president of the French Academy of Sciences, is quite clear on this point in a comment he made about mutations. Grass\u00e9 compared mutations to &quot;making mistakes in the letters when copying a written text.&quot; And as with mutations, letter mistakes cannot give rise to any information, but merely damage such information as already exists. Grass\u00e9 explained this fact in this way:<br><br>Mutations, in time, occur incoherently. They are not complementary to one another, nor are they cumulative in successive generations toward a given direction. They modify what preexists, but they do so in disorder, no matter how\u2026. As soon as some disorder, even slight, appears in an organized being, sickness, then death follow. There is no possible compromise between the phenomenon of life and anarchy.24<br><br>So for that reason, as Grass\u00e9 puts it, &quot;No matter how numerous they may be, mutations do not produce any kind of evolution.&quot;25<br><br><br><br>The Pleiotropic Effect<br><br>The most important proof that mutations lead only to damage, is the process of genetic coding. Almost all of the genes in a fully developed living thing carry more than one piece of information. For instance, one gene may control both the height and the eye color of that organism. Microbiologist Michael Denton explains this characteristic of genes in higher organisms such as human beings, in this way:<br><br>The effects of genes on development are often surprisingly diverse. In the house mouse, nearly every coat-colour gene has some effect on body size. Out of seventeen x-ray induced eye colour mutations in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, fourteen affected the shape of the sex organs of the female, a characteristic that one would have thought was quite unrelated to eye colour. Almost every gene that has been studied in higher organisms has been found to effect more than one organ system, a multiple effect which is known as pleiotropy. As Mayr argues in Population, Species and Evolution: &quot;It is doubtful whether any genes that are not pleiotropic exist in higher organisms.&quot;26<br><br>Because of this characteristic of the genetic structure of living things, any coincidental change because of a mutation, in any gene in the DNA, will affect more than one organ. Consequently, this mutation will not be restricted to one part of the body, but will reveal more of its destructive impact. Even if one of these impacts turns out to be beneficial, as a result of a very rare coincidence, the unavoidable effects of the other damage it causes will more than outweigh those benefits.<br><br>To summarize, there are three main reasons why mutations cannot make evolution possible:<br><br>l- The direct effect of mutations is harmful: Since they occur randomly, they almost always damage the living organism that undergoes them. Reason tells us that unconscious intervention in a perfect and complex structure will not improve that structure, but will rather impair it. Indeed, no &quot;useful mutation&quot; has ever been observed.<br><br>2- Mutations add no new information to an organism&#39;s DNA: The particles making up the genetic information are either torn from their places, destroyed, or carried off to different places. Mutations cannot make a living thing acquire a new organ or a new trait. They only cause abnormalities like a leg sticking out of the back, or an ear from the abdomen.<br><br>3- In order for a mutation to be transferred to the subsequent generation, it has to have taken place in the reproductive cells of the organism: A random change that occurs in a cell or organ of the body cannot be transferred to the next generation. For example, a human eye altered by the effects of radiation, or by other causes, will not be passed on to subsequent generations.<br><br><br>All the explanations provided above indicate that natural selection and mutation have no evolutionary effect at all. So far, no observable example of &quot;evolution&quot; has been obtained by this method. Sometimes, evolutionary biologists claim that &quot;they cannot observe the evolutionary effect of natural selection and mutation mechanisms since these mechanisms take place only over an extended period of time.&quot; However, this argument, which is just a way of making themselves feel better, is baseless, in the sense that it lacks any scientific foundation. During his lifetime, a scientist can observe thousands of generations of living things with short life spans such as fruit flies or bacteria, and still observe no &quot;evolution.&quot; Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9 states the following about the unchanging nature of bacteria, a fact which invalidates evolution:<br><br>Bacteria ...are the organisms which, because of their huge numbers, produce the most mutants. acteria ...exhibit a great fidelity to their species. The bacillus Escherichia coli, whose mutants have been studied very carefully, is the best example. The reader will agree that it is surprising, to say the least, to want to prove evolution and to discover its mechanisms and then to choose as a material for this study a being which practically stabilized a billion years ago! What is the use of their unceasing mutations, if they do not [produce evolutionary] change? In sum, the mutations of bacteria and viruses are merely hereditary fluctuations around a median position; a swing to the right, a swing to the left, but no final evolutionary effect. Cockroaches, which are one of the most venerable living insect groups, have remained more or less unchanged since the Permian, yet they have undergone as many mutations as Drosophila, a Tertiary insect. 27<br><br>Briefly, it is impossible for living beings to have evolved, because there exists no mechanism in nature that can cause evolution. Furthermore, this conclusion agrees with the evidence of the fossil record, which does not demonstrate the existence of a process of evolution, but rather just the contrary.<br>7 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, The Modern Library, New York, p. 127.

It cannot be used to explain how creatures came into being from other creatures.<br><br>The concept of natural selection was the basis of Darwinism. This assertion is stressed even in the title of the book in which Darwin proposed his theory: The Origin of Species, by means of Natural Selection\u2026<br><br>Natural selection is based on the assumption that in nature there is a constant struggle for survival. It favors organisms with traits that best enable them to cope with pressures exerted by the environment. At the end of this struggle, the strongest ones, the ones most suited to natural conditions, survive. For example, in a herd of deer under threat from predators, those individuals that can run fastest will naturally survive. As a consequence, the herd of deer will eventually consist of only fast-running individuals.<br><br>However, no matter how long this process goes on, it will not transform those deer into another species. The weak deer are eliminated, the strong survive, but, since no alteration in their genetic data takes place, no transformation of a species occurs. Despite the continuous processes of selection, deer continue to exist as deer.<br><br>The deer example is true for all species. In any population, natural selection only eliminates those weak, or unsuited individuals who are unable to adapt to the natural conditions in their habitat. It does not produce new species, new genetic information, or new organs. That is, it cannot cause anything to evolve. Darwin, too, accepted this fact, stating that &quot;Natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations occur.&quot;7 That is why neo-Darwinism had to add the mutation mechanism as a factor altering genetic information to the concept of natural selection.<br><br>We will deal with mutations next. But before proceeding, we need to further examine the concept of natural selection in order to see the contradictions inherent in it.<br><br><br>The essential assumption of the theory of natural selection holds that there is a fierce struggle for survival in nature, and every living thing cares only for itself. At the time Darwin proposed this theory, the ideas of Thomas Malthus, the British classical economist, were an important influence on him. Malthus maintained that human beings were inevitably in a constant struggle for survival, basing his views on the fact that population, and hence the need for food resources, increases geometrically, while food resources themselves increase only arithmetically. The result is that population size is inevitably checked by factors in the environment, such as hunger and disease. Darwin adapted Malthus&#39;s vision of a fierce struggle for survival among human beings to nature at large, and claimed that &quot;natural selection&quot; is a consequence of this struggle.<br><br>Further research, however, revealed that there was no struggle for life in nature as Darwin had postulated. As a result of extensive research into animal groups in the 1960s and 1970s, V. C. Wynne-Edwards, a British zoologist, concluded that living things balance their population in an interesting way, which prevents competition for food. Animal groups were simply managing their population on the basis of their food resources. Population was regulated not by elimination of the weak through factors like epidemics or starvation, but by instinctive control mechanisms. In other words, animals controlled their numbers not by fierce competition, as Darwin suggested, but by limiting reproduction.8<br><br>Even plants exhibited examples of population control, which invalidated Darwin&#39;s suggestion of selection by means of competition. The botanist A. D. Bradshaw&#39;s observations indicated that during reproduction, plants behaved according to the &quot;density&quot; of the planting, and limited their reproduction if the area was highly populated with plants.9 On the other hand, examples of sacrifice observed in animals such as ants and bees display a model completely opposed to the Darwinist struggle for survival.<br><br>In recent years, research has revealed findings regarding self-sacrifice even in bacteria. These living things without brains or nervous systems, totally devoid of any capacity for thought, kill themselves to save other bacteria when they are invaded by viruses.10<br><br>These examples surely invalidate the basic assumption of natural selection-the absolute struggle for survival. It is true that there is competition in nature; however, there are clear models of self-sacrifice and solidarity, as well.<br><br><br>Apart from the theoretical weaknesses mentioned above, the theory of evolution by natural selection comes up against a fundamental impasse when faced with concrete scientific findings. The scientific value of a theory must be assessed according to its success or failure in experiment and observation. Evolution by natural selection fails on both counts.<br><br>Since Darwin&#39;s time, there has not been a single shred of evidence put forward to show that natural selection causes living things to evolve. Colin Patterson, the senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History in London and a prominent evolutionist, stresses that natural selection has never been observed to have the ability to cause things to evolve:<br><br>No one has ever produced a species by the mechanisms of natural selection. No one has ever got near it, and most of the current argument in neo-Darwinism is about this question.11<br><br>Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9, a well-known French zoologist and critic of Darwinism, has these words to say in &quot;Evolution and Natural Selection,&quot; a chapter of his book The Evolution of Living Organisms.<br><br>The &quot;evolution in action&quot; of J. Huxley and other biologists is simply the observation of demographic facts, local fluctuations of genotypes, geographical distributions. Often the species concerned have remained practically unchanged for hundreds of centuries! Fluctuation as a result of circumstances, with prior modification of the genome, does not imply evolution, and we have tangible proof of this in many panchronic species [i.e. living fossils that remain unchanged for millions of years].12<br><br>A close look at a few &quot;observed examples of natural selection&quot; presented by biologists who advocate the theory of evolution, would reveal that, in reality, they do not provide any evidence for evolution.<br><br><br><br>The True Story Of The Industrial Melanism<br><br>When evolutionist sources are examined, one inevitably sees that the example of moths in England during the Industrial Revolution is cited as an example of evolution by natural selection. This is put forward as the most concrete example of evolution observed, in textbooks, magazines, and even academic sources. In actuality, though, that example has nothing to do with evolution at all.<br><br>Let us first recall what is actually said: According to this account, around the onset of the Industrial Revolution in England, the color of tree barks around Manchester was quite light. Because of this, dark-colored moths resting on those trees could easily be noticed by the birds that fed on them, and therefore they had very little chance of survival. Fifty years later, in woodlands where industrial pollution has killed the lichens, the bark of the trees had darkened, and now the light-colored moths became the most hunted, since they were the most easily noticed. As a result, the proportion of light-colored to dark-colored moths decreased. Evolutionists believe this to be a great piece of evidence for their theory. They take refuge and solace in window-dressing, showing how light-colored moths &quot;evolved&quot; into dark-colored ones.<br><br><br>However, although we believe these facts to be correct, it should be quite clear that they can in no way be used as evidence for the theory of evolution, since no new form arose that had not existed before. Dark colored moths had existed in the moth population before the Industrial Revolution. Only the relative proportions of the existing moth varieties in the population changed. The moths had not acquired a new trait or organ, which would cause &quot;speciation.&quot;13 In order for one moth species to turn into another living species, a bird for example, new additions would have had to be made to its genes. That is, an entirely separate genetic program would have had to be loaded so as to include information about the physical traits of the bird.<br><br>This is the answer to be given to the evolutionist story of Industrial Melanism. However, there is a more interesting side to the story: Not just its interpretation, but the story itself is flawed. As molecular biologist Jonathan Wells explains in his book Icons of Evolution, the story of the peppered moths, which is included in every evolutionary biology book and has therefore, become an &quot;icon&quot; in this sense, does not reflect the truth. Wells discusses in his book how Bernard Kettlewell&#39;s experiment, which is known as the &quot;experimental proof&quot; of the story, is actually a scientific scandal. Some basic elements of this scandal are:<br><br>- Many experiments conducted after Kettlewell&#39;s revealed that only one type of these moths rested on tree trunks, and all other types preferred to rest beneath small, horizontal branches. Since 1980 it has become clear that peppered moths do not normally rest on tree trunks. In 25 years of fieldwork, many scientists such as Cyril Clarke and Rory Howlett, Michael Majerus, Tony Liebert, and Paul Brakefield concluded that in Kettlewell&#39;s experiment, moths were forced to act atypically, therefore, the test results could not be accepted as scientific.14<br><br>- Scientists who tested Kettlewell&#39;s conclusions came up with an even more interesting result: Although the number of light moths would be expected to be larger in the less polluted regions of England, the dark moths there numbered four times as many as the light ones. This meant that there was no correlation between the moth population and the tree trunks as claimed by Kettlewell and repeated by almost all evolutionist sources.<br><br>- As the research deepened, the scandal changed dimension: &quot;The moths on tree trunks&quot; photographed by Kettlewell, were actually dead moths. Kettlewell used dead specimens glued or pinned to tree trunks and then photographed them. In truth, there was little chance of taking such a picture as the moths rested not on tree trunks but underneath the leaves.15<br><br>These facts were uncovered by the scientific community only in the late 1990s. The collapse of the myth of Industrial Melanism, which had been one of the most treasured subjects in &quot;Introduction to Evolution&quot; courses in universities for decades, greatly disappointed evolutionists. One of them, Jerry Coyne, remarked:<br><br>My own reaction resembles the dismay attending my discovery, at the age of six, that it was my father and not Santa who brought the presents on Christmas Eve.16<br><br>Thus, &quot;the most famous example of natural selection&quot; was relegated to the trash-heap of history as a scientific scandal-which was inevitable, because natural selection is not an &quot;evolutionary mechanism,&quot; contrary to what evolutionists claim.<br><br>In short, natural selection is capable neither of adding a new organ to a living organism, nor of removing one, nor of changing an organism of one species into that of another. The &quot;greatest&quot; evidence put forward since Darwin has been able to go no further than the &quot;industrial melanism&quot; of moths in England.<br><br><br>Why Natural Selection Can Not Explain Complexity?<br><br>As we showed at the beginning, the greatest problem for the theory of evolution by natural selection, is that it cannot enable new organs or traits to emerge in living things. Natural selection cannot develop a species&#39; genetic data; therefore, it cannot be used to account for the emergence of new species. The greatest defender of the theory of punctuated equilibrium, Stephen Jay Gould, refers to this impasse of natural selection as follows;<br><br>The essence of Darwinism lies in a single phrase: natural selection is the creative force of evolutionary change. No one denies that selection will play a negative role in eliminating the unfit. Darwinian theories require that it create the fit as well.17<br><br>Another of the misleading methods that evolutionists employ on the issue of natural selection is their effort to present this mechanism as an intelligent designer. However,natural selection has no intelligence. It does not possess a will that can decide what is good and what is bad for living things. As a result, natural selection cannot explain biological systems and organs that possess the feature of &quot;irreducible complexity&quot;. These systems and organs are composed of a great number of parts cooperating together, and are of no use if even one of these parts is missing or defective. (For example, the human eye does not function unless it exists with all its components intact).<br><br>Therefore, the will that brings all these parts together should be able to foresee the future and aim directly at the advantage that is to be acquired at the final stage. Since natural selection has no consciousness or will, it can do no such thing. This fact, which demolishes the foundations of the theory of evolution, also worried Darwin, who wrote: &quot;If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.&quot;18<br><br><br>Mutations<br><br>Mutations are defined as breaks or replacements taking place in the DNA molecule, which is found in the nuclei of the cells of a living organism and which contains all its genetic information. These breaks or replacements are the result of external effects such as radiation or chemical action. Every mutation is an &quot;accident,&quot; and either damages the nucleotides making up the DNA or changes their locations. Most of the time, they cause so much damage and modification that the cell cannot repair them.<br><br>Mutation, which evolutionists frequently hide behind, is not a magic wand that transforms living organisms into a more advanced and perfect form. The direct effect of mutations is harmful. The changes effected by mutations can only be like those experienced by people in Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Chernobyl: that is, death, disability, and freaks of nature\u2026<br><br>The reason for this is very simple: DNA has a very complex structure, and random effects can only damage it. Biologist B. G. Ranganathan states:<br><br>First, genuine mutations are very rare in nature.

Out of seventeen x-ray induced eye colour mutations in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, fourteen affected the shape of the sex organs of the female, a characteristic that one would have thought was quite unrelated to eye colour. Almost every gene that has been studied in higher organisms has been found to effect more than one organ system, a multiple effect which is known as pleiotropy. As Mayr argues in Population, Species and Evolution: &quot;It is doubtful whether any genes that are not pleiotropic exist in higher organisms.&quot;26<br><br>Because of this characteristic of the genetic structure of living things, any coincidental change because of a mutation, in any gene in the DNA, will affect more than one organ. Consequently, this mutation will not be restricted to one part of the body, but will reveal more of its destructive impact. Even if one of these impacts turns out to be beneficial, as a result of a very rare coincidence, the unavoidable effects of the other damage it causes will more than outweigh those benefits.<br><br>To summarize, there are three main reasons why mutations cannot make evolution possible:<br><br>l- The direct effect of mutations is harmful: Since they occur randomly, they almost always damage the living organism that undergoes them. Reason tells us that unconscious intervention in a perfect and complex structure will not improve that structure, but will rather impair it. Indeed, no &quot;useful mutation&quot; has ever been observed.<br><br>2- Mutations add no new information to an organism&#39;s DNA: The particles making up the genetic information are either torn from their places, destroyed, or carried off to different places. Mutations cannot make a living thing acquire a new organ or a new trait. They only cause abnormalities like a leg sticking out of the back, or an ear from the abdomen.<br><br>3- In order for a mutation to be transferred to the subsequent generation, it has to have taken place in the reproductive cells of the organism: A random change that occurs in a cell or organ of the body cannot be transferred to the next generation. For example, a human eye altered by the effects of radiation, or by other causes, will not be passed on to subsequent generations.<br><br><br>All the explanations provided above indicate that natural selection and mutation have no evolutionary effect at all. So far, no observable example of &quot;evolution&quot; has been obtained by this method. Sometimes, evolutionary biologists claim that &quot;they cannot observe the evolutionary effect of natural selection and mutation mechanisms since these mechanisms take place only over an extended period of time.&quot; However, this argument, which is just a way of making themselves feel better, is baseless, in the sense that it lacks any scientific foundation. During his lifetime, a scientist can observe thousands of generations of living things with short life spans such as fruit flies or bacteria, and still observe no &quot;evolution.&quot; Pierre-Paul Grass\u00e9 states the following about the unchanging nature of bacteria, a fact which invalidates evolution:<br><br>Bacteria ...are the organisms which, because of their huge numbers, produce the most mutants. acteria ...exhibit a great fidelity to their species. The bacillus Escherichia coli, whose mutants have been studied very carefully, is the best example. The reader will agree that it is surprising, to say the least, to want to prove evolution and to discover its mechanisms and then to choose as a material for this study a being which practically stabilized a billion years ago! What is the use of their unceasing mutations, if they do not [produce evolutionary] change? In sum, the mutations of bacteria and viruses are merely hereditary fluctuations around a median position; a swing to the right, a swing to the left, but no final evolutionary effect. Cockroaches, which are one of the most venerable living insect groups, have remained more or less unchanged since the Permian, yet they have undergone as many mutations as Drosophila, a Tertiary insect. 27<br><br>Briefly, it is impossible for living beings to have evolved, because there exists no mechanism in nature that can cause evolution. Furthermore, this conclusion agrees with the evidence of the fossil record, which does not demonstrate the existence of a process of evolution, but rather just the contrary.<br>7 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, The Modern Library, New York, p. 127.

Theory isn&#39;t just an assumption. For your assumption to become a theory it must go through the process of falsification, where scientists try to falsify their assumption. You don&#39;t get a result that saying your guess is right, but you get a certainty of how much your assumption is wrong. Every theory that has been falsified will be replaced with a &#39;better&#39; theory, in which implies evolution is a very strong theory that scientists try to disprove it in the past but only failed to do so. There stand enourmous evidences that are supporting this theory.<br><br>What further amazes me in all these comments is how many people are still living in the spontaneous generation. Evolution has nothing to do with spontaneity, nothing can ever come out in a sudden. Every changes we talk about in evolution is very slow, unnoticeable in short time, but gradually become different. Just because you cannot see how it happens doesn&#39;t make it wrong, the fact our human history is only a second long if you put the whole process of our universe in a year scale only makes your opinion sounds even more ridiculous. It really tells us how little we&#39;ve seen about the world, we&#39;re seeing and we&#39;ll ever see.<br><br>Plus, evolution is nothing about opinion. Many took years, half of their lives, or even their whole lives to focus on a small part of evolution. If you know nothing about science, or you only come to this video for a hate, get over yourself. Your poorly stated opinion has no evidence to support but there will be plenty queuing to falsify it. But if you know about evolution well and you hold against the theory, I don&#39;t have a problem with you.

Somebody certainly got whacked, we just don&#39;t know for certain how or by whom.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>\u00a0In the case of evolution, we can go further than that. Not only is evolution certainly true, but natural selection also is certainly true. It is also a phenomenon which in turn is certainly part of the mechanism of the phenomenon evolution. There is very little doubt that natural selection is one of the factors that drives evolutionary change What Darwin proposed is three things 1) Evolution happens 2) Natural Selection happens 3) Natural selection is the EXCLUSIVE mechanism of evolution, it is not just one of the factors but the sole driving force of evolution. He showed how all three ideas are very plausible when one examines the evidence. The evidence was rather limited in his own time, but it has grown since then to the point that no-one who knows what he is talking about seriously doubts 1) or 2) above. 3) is more problematic. While most evolution can be explained as driven by natural evolution, that in certain eras may have been driven by other factors, sudden cataclysms like asteroid strikes and volcanoes, and even tendentious and cumulative(rather than random) genetic mutations in certain conditions. There is no real consensus here among scientists but wherever there is doubt there are very reasonable mechanistic theories which provide explanations, merely that they have not been clearly established to be true.

A doctrine is a belief held by a religious organization or political party. So he admits evolution, as in natural selection, is a belief, not a scientific fact. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called the THEORY of evolution. Richard Dawkins also said that we don&#39;t know how exactly life started on Earth, and that we could be the product of intelligent design. And these are the words of a devout atheist. What he is saying is that we were created by aliens, he just doesn&#39;t want to call the aliens God. <br><br>Also, the fossil record doesn&#39;t agree with the theory of evolution. Species just appear with no logical progression that agrees with the whole evolution thing. In fact, the fossil record agrees with the book of genesis. 1st there were plants, then fish and birds, then land animals, then humans. <br><br>And natural selection means the survival of the fittest, right? So that means we survived because we are superior to homo habilis and all the other homos, and homo habilis survived because he was superior to apes, right? Well then if apes are so inferior why didn&#39;t they die off? Why would gorillas and chimps survive, but all the homos after them die off(except us) when they are supposedly superior to them?<br><br>If natural selection was true, we would see it happening at least every 20 years. We would see bacteria change into a completely different bacteria. We don&#39;t see that. The most we see is adaptation. <br><br>People may say it requires faith to believe in God. Duh.

We DO NOT evolve during our lifespans. If food is only located in tall trees, we do NOT grow taller to get it. Instead, it is assumed that those who were already born taller as a result of a chance genetic mutation would subsequently be more healthy having better access to said food, and due to sexual selection, be more successful at mating and thus having more offspring who also exhibit the similar &quot;tall&quot; gene, and so on and so on until the new feature is so distinct and prominent that they can no longer be classified as belonging to that of the original species.

You have one side that is intransigently convinced of a lie, in this case that they can turn a book with a religious and spiritual objective into a science textbook either because they are too lazy to learn or because their faith is too weak to deal with truth they can&#39;t fit into their insanely narrow world view. The same thing happened in the time period of Jesus. The &quot;religious leaders&quot; of His day simply could not accept the truth he brought. It was an affront to their religious views and all the fake addenda they&#39;d forced on the scriptures. Then, they raged against Him, who had given Israel the Law in the first place, because of all the superstitions thay&#39;d built up around that Law, and they allowed that rage to carry them until Jesus hung on a Roman cross. Creation vs. Evolution is no different.<br><br>So-called &quot;Creationists&quot; have twisted the scriptures, forcing interpretations upon them that are unreasonable, disrespectful to sacred scripture, and very obviously not true (at least obvious to anyone with even a passing knowledge of Geology, Biology, or Genetics), and then insisted that their answer is the only possible truth. It&#39;s akin to a toddler screaming that their Dad made the new chair in his woodshop, and thus he didn&#39;t use any tools (hammer, saw, sandpaper, etc.). &quot;He couldn&#39;t have used any tools because then he didn&#39;t make it!&quot; They might scream as their mother insists it&#39;s time for their nap. That&#39;s our problem. The so-called &quot;creationists&quot; just need a nap and a significantly more adult attitude about the scriptures, but that would require thought and actually reading said scriptures and researching etymology to find out what the original words meant (spiritual toddlers remain unwilling to give that much effort while they scream and rant in their totally immature tantrums).<br><br>True it is that some scientists have not helped, largely by using the totally unscientific ascertion that science can disprove the existance of God. Science can certainly disprove the ridiculousness that is Creedal Christianity (and the flood of nonsence it has manufactured such as &quot;co-substantial&quot; and &quot;ex niliho&quot;), which my faith has been calling ridiculous for almost 200 years (no newsflash here), but to disprove the existance of God would require us to be able to search the entire known universe and all possible alternate forms of reality to ascertain whether or not God lives there. Since we cannot do this (and any scientist will tell you that it&#39;s exceptionally difficult to prove a negative, anyway), science cannot really speak to the presence or non-presence of a Divine Being (especially one who purportedly has command of the natural world, thus allowing Him to direct through natural laws, something that would essentially make Him invisible to our current level of scientific inquiry).<br><br>Besides, the obvious &quot;elephant in the room&quot; is the fact that, if we who are religious believe in a just God of law and order who made/ordered this universe by laws of His choosing, then what does it say of our belief in such a God who would then break his own laws and leave fossil evidence to lie to His children? What kind of God are the so-called &quot;creationists&quot; trying to present? Surely not the God of Heaven and Earth, for He is a God of order and justice, not a whimsical puppeteer who manipulates things to get what He wants right now but who then lies to the audience by leaving evidence that it took far longer than it did to complete His works.

It&#39;s nearly impossible to support the idea that the challenger &quot;evolved&quot; into particles: you&#39;ve eviscerated a key component of the idea by (mis)using the term like that.

Otherwise, you could just as well use the term &#39;devolve&#39; to mean the same thing as &#39;evolve&#39;, but they are precisely opposite.

However, there&#39;s a sense of the word that&#39;s more specific than that, yet more general than the evolution of life by natural selection. Essentially, &quot;change driven by competition over generations with variation&quot; is the descriptor for that definition. The thing is, that kind of evolution requires relatively vague circumstances to be all but guaranteed. Below, I&#39;m using this definition when I say &quot;evolution&quot;.<br><br>/beginLecture<br><br>Evolution requires three things: reproduction, mutation, and competition. In biological evolution, reproduction is, well, reproduction of DNA/RNA and the organisms they code for. But in general, reproduction just means &quot;copying&quot;. Something needs to be copied from one generation to the next; that can be DNA, or it can be a product&#39;s blueprints, or a program&#39;s code, or (more abstractly) an idea&#39;s foundations. Anything can be copied in any way to satisfy this requirement.<br><br>Secondly, you need mutation. In biology, this occurs when the genes are copied imperfectly, leading to changes in base pairs, be they substitutions, deletions, or duplications. This is usually random, but in general, it doesn&#39;t have to be. For example, with product design or technology, changes from one version to another are often intentionally made in one direction or another; these are still valid mutations. In genetic programming, Gaussian random mutations are usually used, but again, they may be guided. As long as the copies can change from their parents, mutation is achieved.<br><br>Lastly, you need competition. This is a VERY vague term, and all it means is that the chances of an individual reproducing depends upon the mutations it has. In biology, any mutation that allows an organism to reproduce more--often, but not exclusively, because it allows the organism to survive longer, giving it time to reproduce--will be beneficial and be selected for. Any mutations that reduce the chances of reproduction will be selected against. In product design, the competition is based on consumer demand: if a new version has a change that buyers don&#39;t want, it&#39;s less likely to be reproduced in the next version. Conversely, if a new version&#39;s change is favorable, it&#39;ll be more likely to stick around in the next version. With genetic programming, property values that get the solution closer to optimal carry over into the next generation, and those that don&#39;t get discarded and don&#39;t reproduce.<br><br>I&#39;ve gone into detail of each requirement, but overall, the process of evolution is quite simple and vague. Any time anything can (1) copy itself in any way, (2) change from one copy to the next, and (3) be more or less likely to copy itself depending on those changes, evolution of this type WILL happen. It&#39;s almost guaranteed. The thing that&#39;s evolving can be a population of living creatures, a computer program, a culture and its ideals, technology, or anything else with those three properties. As a tangential note, there&#39;s a hypothesis that certain types of black holes might contain entire universes inside them, with differing physical constants. If this is true, then even universes themselves would evolve towards optimal physical constants: each black hole can reproduce (since its contained universe also contains black holes), mutate (since the internal universes have different constants), and compete (since these differing constants would change the rate at which each internal universe produces newer black holes). Intriguing, isn&#39;t it? :D<br><br>/endLecture<br><br>TL;DR: If something, anything, can reproduce, mutate, and compete, then it will almost certainly evolve; whether it&#39;s alive, dead, inanimate, unconscious, or anything else doesn&#39;t matter.", "comment_date": "2014-01-22T22:12:16Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Javiera Klenner", "comment_text": "Haha.
