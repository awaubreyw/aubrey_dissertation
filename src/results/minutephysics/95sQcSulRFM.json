And the longest waves are generated by the ship as a whole (as if from the sides).  This makes for a more complex and subtle pattern from which lots of information may be extracted.  As the video illustrates, the best way to get this information is via images from above.  Which especially includes satellites.<br><br>A good image will captures the wake when the contrast is highest, which means the lighting must be ideal.  In this case, lighting from a 45 degree angle works best.  Also, the reflected light is polarized, so even a less-than-optimal image may be improved by placing a polarizer in front of the camera that is adjusted to the angle needed to accentuate the polarization.<br><br>So, let&#39;s say we have a fairly good image from above.  What can we learn from such images, even if the vessel itself isn&#39;t visible?  Here&#39;s a partial list:<br>- Speed<br>- Direction<br>- Rate of turn (or lack of turning)<br>- Hull length (for larger vessels)<br>- Approximate draft (depth in the water)<br>- Approximate hull shape (particularly the presence of a bulbous nose or a flat stern)<br>- Approximate displacement<br><br>All the above may be determined from a single image, without having to see the ship itself!  But it works best only for conventional &quot;wet hull&quot; ships: Hydrofoils and hovercraft have different wake signatures that are harder to interpret.  Multi-hull ships (catamarans, trimarans) aren&#39;t a problem.<br><br>But what about when multiple vessels are in close proximity, such as for military exercises?  Overlapping wakes are much more difficult to decode.  There are many tricks that may be intentionally used to limit the value of wake imaging, particularly to make two very different vessels appear similar from above.  But assuming no tricks, there are ways to determine much of the above information for every vessel in a fleet, and also do so at night.  But it requires filtering out most of the wave data, and focusing only on the elements that most easily provide the information we seek.  A great way to do this is by using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), where a satellite sweeps an area with radio waves of specific frequencies, and which also works when clouds obscure the view.<br><br>Military folks were only the first to do this.  Today, cameras and SAR on commercial satellites are used to complement the AIS (Automatic Identification Signal) sent by ships to share their location to avoid collisions.  Particular attention is paid to large ships not transmitting an AIS signal, or transmitting an incorrect signal, as it can indicate problems on the ship (electrical failure, piracy, fire, etc.) and trigger a Coast Guard response to investigate.  Commercial wake imaging is good enough that even military ships typically keep their AIS active at all times: It is very hard to hide a moving ship!", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T16:29:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Woodrell", "comment_text": "But is water woke?", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T16:27:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pls argue with me", "comment_text": "this is really helpful for animators and artists", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T16:25:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vimarsh", "comment_text": "This is coool", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T16:25:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Reid Fleming, World's Toughest Milkman", "comment_text": "Witty comment #14", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T16:24:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Star Wars Therapy", "comment_text": "Can you explain why objects create ripples instead of straight wakes like the shockwake of a supersonic projectile?", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T16:22:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Animation Space", "comment_text": "I appreciate you changing the thumbnail and title to make it more clear what you are explaining here", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T16:20:24Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "James Charles", "comment_text": "I&#39;m having problems about (crystalline and Amorphous) solids can you explain me in the next video?", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T16:14:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Charlery", "comment_text": "this right here is doing numbers", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T16:14:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DP", "comment_text": "I saw the title and thought &quot;I know why already&quot;. <br>Apparently I was wrong.
