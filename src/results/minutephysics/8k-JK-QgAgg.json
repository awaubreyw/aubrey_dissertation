You then proceed to use your hand to block the dog from being able to see the treat. And kind of like with Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s cat, you place something that has a 50% chance of destroying the treat. This experiment occurs and the dog is unable to see the outcome but you can. What would the superposition of the treat be.? Would it be destroyed and not destroyed or would it also be those along with the actual outcome? Or would there be no superposition because you can see the outcome and the result is certain? Essentially, does your POV and the dogs have a different definition of the superposition of the treat or does it eliminate the superposition altogether? Once again I apologize for the diction.

It is our nature that we are compelled to see what is beyond the horizon. To see the islands that cannot be seen from the shore. The early Man was restricted in their observations by the curvature of the Earth, and hence our ancestors went and explored, to see with their own eyes what lies beyond the horizon, by going there. And so, back in a time that is recorded today only in the form of fossils, long before Columbus and the Vikings ventured to North America, Human kind went and populated nearly the entire globe. The ingenuity that was required to do so, along with the fact that no local natural disaster or even climate change could reach all of us, meant that we would not go instinct.This curiosity, and the ingenuity it drove us to develop, is a key factor in why we never became extinct, and why we are now the dominant species on our planet.
