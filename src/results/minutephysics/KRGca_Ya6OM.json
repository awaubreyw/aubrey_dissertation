Lets look at proteine formation:<br>first some simple correct science facts:<br><br>-Urey miller showed us that nature is able to created amino acids for now maximum 40 of them. Fine. <br>-Its a fact that these come in both D&amp;L form so basically we have 80 different amino acids where natures randomness can pick from. <br>-We know for a fact that ALL living creatures have only 21 amino acids in them all in L form. <br>-a typical chemical reaction time is about 10^-9 seconds. <br>-proteins do not function properly when amino acids are on the wrong place, there is a unique spot in a proteine chain where it is seated. <br>-In nature there are about maximum 100.000 different proteins. <br>-These range all between a couple of 10&#39;s to a couple of 10000&#39;s of amino acids. <br>-Now natural randomness does not have a clue where to start and has no intelligence how to produce a fully functional proteine<br>-in some mechanisms several different proteins are cooperating to make things work as they work (photo systhesis &amp; our immune system are examples of that) <br>-each next amino acid has 2 choices where to connect to with another amino acid. <br><br>If we consider a proteine of 10 amino acids there are <br>for the 1st amino acid to start a small proteine; 80 options that nature can choose from. (40 AA in D&amp;L form)<br>the 2nd amino acid has 160 options (80 amino acids in D&amp;L form and 2 sides of the fisrt AA to choose from. So this delivers for nature 80*160 = 12800 options <br>10 amino acids has 5,5*10^21 options.<br><br>1 80 80<br>2 160 12800<br>3 160 2048000<br>4 160 327680000<br>5 160 52428800000<br>. <br>But nature does not know which one is the correct functional one. So it has to construct then all in order to find out. That means 5,5*10^21 * 10^-9 seconds = 5,5 *10^12 sec = 1,74*10^5 years or 174000 years<br><br>20 amino acids would require. 80*160^19 * 1*10^-9 sec = 6,04 *10^34 seconds or 1,92 *10^27 years.<br><br>Now the secular estimated age of the universe is ONLY about 14 *10^9 years old.... right ?<br><br>With 44 amino acids which represents the smalles of human proteins, nature has 4,789*10^96 options to choose from and to test them all nature would require: 1,52*10^80 years. <br><br>Now lets do an absurd thing and totaly out of science assumption; and crank the speed up to rediculous speeds.<br><br>Lets pretend that nature is able to catalyse this reaction where the reaction time would only require planck time to react, which is about 5,39^10^-44 seconds. Its redculous I know but for he sake of argument.<br><br>EVEN then nature would require thus for the formation of 1 single human proteine of only 44 amino acids:<br><br>80*160^43 (options) * 5,39*10^-44 sec = 2,58*10^53 sec = 8,19*10^45 years.  <br>now as science accepts plancktime is the lowest possible time a proces could require at least that is he idea. this means that there is NO amount of speeding up by catalysis possible to reduce the formation time of proteines since there is nothing faster than plancktime right ? that creates a problem....<br><br>a 100 amino acids proteine to form has 80*160^99 = 1,29 *10^220 options leading to a time required 4,09*10^203 years and in panck time reaction speed 2,21*10^169 years<br><br>Now I did NOT yet mention the other problems with the formation of proteines... the dilutedness, 10^-9 sec is ONLY when the 2 active components are in  close proximity to each other as in a lab bottle. The mixture of other organic molecules which amino acids could pick from to react with (like sugars, fatty acids, phosphor groups etc etc etc.) <br><br>So abiogenesis ????? NAAAHH ... impossible....so how in the universe could OTHER life possibly int existance if it is even impossible for randomness to make us ????<br><br>Now if there was nothing to begin with ..... then the idea of evolution would be equal impossible since evolution requires something to evolve...... if abiogenesis is NOT able to produce a single living cell then evolution has nothing to get its hands on....next to the fact that even evolution has got its own impossibilities to develope creatures into he comlexity scale ....<br><br>yet we are HERE Right......so where do we come from... I mean our earth system is prefectlky fit for sustainng life .... as if it was designed for it... well and THAT is exactly what it is.. we are here by design..... by deliberate design.... you see random nees is NOT able to produce us.... and we are pretty high sophisticated organised right ..... well that requires a super high intelligence to construct us..... <br><br>so there is only 1 option left: <br>In the beginning God created heaven and the earth and all that in them is. <br>God bless", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T03:42:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chasington", "comment_text": "What is strange is how avatar almost totally follows this.

Surely gas giants. Earth is one of the smallest planets that can have an atmosphere and more gas gives more chances to make the type of life that we know can exist.<br><br>So we should be looking at big planets. Why did we come up with such different conclusions? Because we each assumed things about what defines our set. To use your analogy, you have assumed as a football fan that has never met any other football fans that you ARE all of the fans of a big team. I have assumed that I am part of a group of fans defined by some of our required elements (gases).<br><br>But there&#39;s quite a few other ways to define what set we should expect to be part of. We could just as well group sets of life types by ability to withstand cold and assume that we are part of a group of proficient cold adapted life that makes us exceptionally well suited to handle life in what is mostly cold empty space.<br><br>Then we should look at life on planets that are hotter right?<br><br>To use the blood analogy, it would be like taking a sample of our blood and looking at the cells and assuming that our blood must be part of the most exceptional blood, but not knowing anything about other blood types we would not assume that bigger equals better and therefor we have larger than average blood cells.<br><br>I think the big alien theory fails because we have yet to define what makes an alien exceptional compared to other aliens. Because we don&#39;t have other aliens.

While I like the idea of thinking in a power law as a good way to figure it out, I prefer using it to search for life to understand it better before using the Bayesian inference on cases that seem hopeless.<br><br>And surely non-intelligent life should be more common (intelligent life is - likely - a very small subset of what lifeforms offer, based on what we know of the history of our planet we know only one species of intelligent sentient life). And if you put that into your power law, that is what you should use to search for life. We are likely the black swan of the curve. Intelligence seems to demand time to spawn and seems to be very much not typical in biology and has lasted less time than other lifeforms.<br><br>I think the idea of using a power law is good, interesting, and well thought, but I&#39;d stick to searching for life (not intelligent life) in easy to find things rather than thinking the wild card should be what we look for. We should try the wild card like we try lotteries: small amounts of resources.

Life has to start. And odds are, just like on Earth, it will start on a molecular level, then grow into cellular, then multicellular. Although cells on alien planets could be larger, than ours, molecules will not be. And because of this, it is likely that they will need similar conditions ~ aka a similar planet. Not only this, but life around a small star would be incredibly difficult to sustain. The smaller the star, the more likely it is to have wild fluctuations of conditions - Ranging from extremely hot bursts of solar flares, or random, very large sun-spots that could potentially cool the nearby planet with life on it down to the point where most life would simply die. Not to mention, small stars are likely to have planets that don&#39;t spin on their own. Instead, planets are likely to always face the sun on one side, meaning one side is very hot, while the other stays cold. I don&#39;t think this specific factor could prevent life from forming, but it would certainly be an issue for intelligent life, or, heck, just larger lifeforms in general as they would either be confined to very hot places, very cold places, or a small sliver in the middle - And since that sliver is where intelligent life would most likely form (Add any life at all to that, as for all we know life can only start in moderate to moderately hot conditions), it&#39;s likely they won&#39;t actually ever be intelligent given the small area of land they have, unless they learn to terraform (Which isn&#39;t likely given we can hardly do it and we&#39;ve had the whole planet to work on.)<br><br>Tl;Dr Because we only know of one way life could actually begin, it actually is more likely they be on an Earth-like planet near an Sun-like star. Your argument ignores the fact that life has to begin - And as far as we know, there&#39;s only one small range of conditions that can happen in.

It considers a human being as a random lifeform in the universe, and concludes that it probably falls in the largest group of lifeforms (life on earth), and concludes that most groups of lifeforms (life on planet X) are probably much, much smaller? (So if you were to look at a random planet that inhabits life, you would find that it&#39;s inhabited by only a really small amount of life). Seems like an odd way to intepreted the statistics and data to me, and it ignores a lot of factors that fuck up the probabilities a bit.<br><br>Like the fact that a human considers this, taking himself as the random lifeform. Consider earth. Using this rethoric, humans would be one of the biggest groups of lifeforms on earth. However, we aren&#39;t. If you were to take a random lifeform, you would get some random bacteria, which does make up the biggest group of lifeforms. Obviously, a bacteria doesn&#39;t really have a good enough grip on mathematics to use this to find out what life on earth is made up of, only humans are. So this rethoric would always lead to the wrong conclusions on what life on earth is made up out of.<br><br>The point of my incoherent rambling is this: we aren&#39;t a truly random lifeform. We are a lifeform that managed to evolve advanced intelligence. The biggest group of extraterrestial lifeforms probably are kinda like bacteria also, not intelligent enough to consider this at all. We are a truly random intelligent lifeform though, so this rethoric will be useful in determining the size of a random intelligent (alien) species. But the conclusion that there is only a small amount of them doesn&#39;t lead to them inhabiting smaller planets and being larger at all. They could also profit from only a small ecological niche, which renders them unable to spread out throughout the world like the human species did, for example.", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T19:46:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M", "comment_text": "the statistics were all based on earth, so why would it apply to the universe?", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T18:52:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vitamin", "comment_text": "I Always thought and still think that that in alien movies it was stupid that all creatures seemed to be very humanoid this makes a very good point", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T18:46:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "maximuscesar", "comment_text": "But what if WE are the &quot;AFC Wimbledon&quot;?", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T18:04:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ImJCyo", "comment_text": "human trailmix?!", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T17:55:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Drizdel", "comment_text": "There should be a second video on why not to expect aliens with horizontal symmetry with 2 legs, 2 arms and 1 head...", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T15:10:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrAlterior", "comment_text": "&quot;The enormity of this number means it&#39;s probably safe to assume there are many other planets with life.&quot; Seeing as we&#39;ve never found even one other planet with life, why is it probably safe to assume there are many?", "comment_date": "2016-03-28T14:53:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lamar Ethington", "comment_text": "Finding the afc Wimbledon of aliens would be fascinating, but the most dangerous aliens would be the other Manchester United analogies out there.

I would go so far as to speculate that no biologist was consulted for this study. Look up the Rare Earth Hypothesis. <br><br>Also, I feel like this is as well a distortion of the premise of the statistical test. If earth is part of the larger group, then earth is analogous to a peraon with O+ blood type or a manchester united fan. That means this group is in the majority. This means that the majority of planets with life should look like earth; rocky bodies in the habitable zone with large satelites with a Jupiter. sure, small amounts of life could exist in a wide variety of situations, but these are less common by the way you laid out your principle. The majority should be earth like, just like you are probably one of two blood types. <br><br>The cojecture that earth has a large population is fundamentally wrong. While we can estimate the size of a planet, we have no way of knowing if we are large in size for a species of small in size. your principle would say that we would fall within the largest group. However, size, i would argue, is better represented by a bell curve; the 95 percent of species should fall within three standard deviations of the mean. because we have literally no way of gaging an average size for a species that is both intelligent and capable of creating civilization, we dont know how to gage average size.

So our species is likely to be part of a larger group of species that lives in worlds like ours, but our species population has no bearing on anything else. That we have 7 billion individual humans has no bearing on us being 1 specie. So how can we infer other species will have lower populations simply because we have a higher population? <br><br>This argument suggests that our population size is a characteristic that would likely fall in a large group of simular species with simular population densities, so that most other species will have simular population sizes. Mixing statistics related to individual humans with statistics related to individual species is completely wrong-headed.<br><br>When we talk about what percent of planets are simular to ours, that&#39;s a different question, because our sun is actually quantifiably fairly rare. The star the planet orbits is the biggest factor of what conditions you could expect. Our sun is bigger <b>and younger</b> than most stars, and most stars are part of binary systems. Stars larger than ours are relatively rare, but very short lived. In a billion years our sun will start to grow into a red giant, and kill all life on earth, yet it took 4.5 billion years for Earth to evolve us. If our sun had been any bigger, our planet wouldn&#39;t have had enough time to evolve multicellular life. If our world&#39;s evolutionary rate is indicative of any sort of average, any star bigger than ours would burn out too quick to evolve complex life like us. So, likely, we&#39;re close to the upper limit of star size (which is inversely related to lifespan rather dramatically), for life to evolve on.  <br><br>So yes, by that logic, most life would evolve on systems with red dwarfs binaries, because that&#39;s a lot more common. <br><br>But there is a fair amount of evidence that suggests that life on land is a lot rarer than life in water. Life originates in water, and then has to evolve to go on land. This must be incredibly hard, based on the various factors that make life possible on land here on Earth. Here&#39;s some things we think we know =<br><br>1) Red stars tend to be older, because they last longer and have a much wider age distribution, and contain less heavy elements. Fewer heavy elements would mean gas giants instead of rocky worlds, and rocky worlds with smaller metal cores which would lead to an absence of van allen radiation belts. Life on land would be very difficult if our planet had no shield against radiation, though water based life would still be ok. The van allan radiation belts are only possible because our planet has a spinning metal core, that would only be possible in younger stars formed from supernova dust like ours.<br><br>2) Also red dwarf stars are very variable in radiation output (by as much as 40%). Life in water would survive that, because water can store heat and remain liquid under ice sheets (though how would it retain enough oxygen or recieve enough sunlight?) and remain liquid near the poles if rest of planet dries up, but life on land would be much harder.<br><br>3) Red dwarves have smaller goldilocks zones, and a tendency for planets in that goldilocks zones to be tidally locked, which is highy disadvantagous for life as only a small ring of a planet&#39;s surface would be at the right temperture for liquid water and constant super fast wind due to temperature differences would kill any organisms that tried to live on land. <br><br>4) Binary systems are also highly problematic for life on land, as the amount of energy a world recieves would vary wildly as it orbits multiple stars, since orbits around the center of mass of two stars would place any planet dangerously close to one or the other star at any given point in its orbit, and when one star eclipses the other, you&#39;d get sudden super-winters. In the water, you might be ok, but on land, you would be toast or frozen.<br><br>5) Also, it is likely that the amount of atmosphere and water a planet has is closely tied to its size. Super-earth sized planets are likely completely covered by water, and smaller than earth sized planets probably all end up like mars with little atmosphere at all. Every planet gradually loses water and air to space which gets replenished to maintain an equilibrium. Bigger the world, the more water and air it can hold on to. Earth is just the right size, small so it doesn&#39;t have enough water to cover the highest 30% of it&#39;s surface, but big enough to hold onto an atmosphere thick enough that life can breathe on land. That ideal size is probably a fairly narrow range.<br><br>For these reasons, aquatic life is probably much much more common  in the universe than land based organisms. But even if intelligent life did evolve on a world that can&#39;t support life on land, how would it develop technology? Aquatic intelligences, like say dolphins, likely never evolve hands... and if they did, without fire, how would they progress past stone age technology? I won&#39;t say technologically advanced aquatic intelligent life is impossible, but it would surely be much much harder.

You have all heard of the small grey with big black eyes, which is both real and not a single species but a class of species from more distant twilight planets. Another example is the little red devil looking biped with clump feet from the Varginha case, suggesting a planet with higher gravity than ours, maybe 1.5-2g. A few credible cases actually involve ETs that look exactly human, specifically beautiful blonde caucasians and there is reason to believe they are not merely deceptions. I believe the roswell ETs were child size as well. And pale child looking. Another is described as smallish with asian looking eyes. Slightly mongoloid but clearly not a local. Although the number of species from credible cases is very small, there seems to be a clear span from about our size as the tallest down to about 1 meter, yet all with about the same head size, presumably to accommodate the technological brain to build the fancy vehicles. There are tentative cases of species even smaller. I vaguely recall a russian case seen by many villagers with ETs that were quite tall. Well over 2 meter.<br>Another thing to factor in is that we only see those that we see, meaning there could be species that are much taller that don&#39;t come here for whatever reason. We only witness by opportunity but so far the range is clear with us at the tallest end.<br>Some of the ETs smell really bad, perhaps ammonia. Some of the grey species, perhaps all, defecate through the skin and have no anus, which is pretty embarrassing and can give rise to bad hygiene :) Although they seem to be on a very pure plant based diet and their bodies are designed to process nearly all of the food. If a plant is built purely from water and CO2 it makes sense that you could expel it as such as well...  bad breath so to speak :)  witnesses speak of a compost like smell onboard some grey ships.<br>You can learn a hell of a lot if you actually follow the evidence.

If you start to use proven facts as a basis to extrapolate the most likely places to find alien life instead of pure statistics, the whole picture changes. The one environment that we have prove of that life can develop are the conditions we find with our own planet. That&#39;s it. There is not one shred of additional data, but this one bit of data we do have is irrefutably proven to be correct. Based on this alone, the highest probability of finding life should be with planets that offer similar conditions to Earth. Of course this doesn&#39;t rule out the possibility of life in other conditions, in theory even silicon-based life is a possibility, but based on the data we have, looking for life on Earth-like planets should be our best bet.<br><br>The other problem I have with this thought experiment is that it is solely based on the assumption that we are part of the biggest group, simply because statistics says it is the most likely. Again, statistics tells us that we are most likely part of the biggest group based on pure theory, not on any available data of actually existing life. And for this, one data point is simply insufficient for anything else but a nifty thought experiment. We might statistically be less likely to be a part of a small group, but there is simply no way of determining this with just one data point. An insanely dedicated fan of AFC Wimbledon (and I&#39;m sure you made John Green&#39;s day with this reference) who is otherwise for whatever reason oblivious to other soccer teams might just as well think that he is part of the biggest, most dedicated group of football fans there is. He simply has to, because he doesn&#39;t know better. And the same goes for us when we assume to be part of the biggest statistical group, simply because is is the statistically most likely.<br><br>I think it comes down to this: If you want to prove that live can arise in environments different to Earth&#39;s, you will likely succeed by looking at places other than Earth-like planets. (Well, duh!) If you want to prove that ANY alien life exists, however, your safest bet (and the most economical method considering our limited resources for this search) is to start at places where the data we have irrefutably suggest that life can exist in the first place.<br><br>It&#39;s a nice thought experiment, though, and a beautiful way to visualize the concept of statistical probability.", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T17:38:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "schoolbus", "comment_text": "statistics are made up shit", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T17:37:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PiLambdaOd", "comment_text": "An interesting point to consider is how many individuals does it take to build a civilization.
