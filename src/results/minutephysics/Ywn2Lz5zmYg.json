On the other hand, if we do not make any measurements, the predictions of the non-collapsed wave function are correct. This is one of the unsolved problems of the parallel universe interpretation, which in fact assumes the Schrodinger equation as its fundamental law, but then implicitly assumes its violation (since the collapse of the wave function is a violation of the Schrodinger equation ) without providing any rational justification. As often happens, to hide these inconsistencies, the supporters of this interpretation always remain vague as regards the so-called \u201cbranching\u201d, that is the generation of infinite universes.

The Lobster is expensive, therefore the rest of your night involves spending less money, perhaps a Netflix night at home, this is the Universe you have actively chosen to follow, so it is the one you observe.  However, there are the other two Universes that have not been visited, but still exist.  The Steak, while also expensive, could have been bad and made you sick, thus the rest of the night for this Universe would land you in the bathroom or the hospital for the night.  While choosing the Chicken option would be cheaper and thus allowing you and your date to go out to a theater movie instead of one at home.  Also, your choices, while interacting with another Universe (Person) will have an effect on their choices and Universes as well.  This creates an infinite number of Universes that may intertwine, reconnect or separate completely in the future.  The possibilities are literally endless.", "comment_date": "2021-07-27T23:56:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sunflower", "comment_text": "Seriously tho sometimes I think I crashed my work trunk and I&#39;m in a coma.

It said it had nuts in it and it was in a different shape than the Hearsy bars. But we had that bar before. So I took the chocolate bar with nuts in it. Just so you know, Hearst bars are like really tiny bars stuck together forming one big bar. But the one I got, wasn&#39;t like that. It was just one bar. Judging by the wrapper image and my memory. We bought the stuff and drove home. I put the sodas in the fridge and the chocolates in the freezer. And then later, I took it. Cause I wanted to eat it. So I got on my phone to watch YouTube and was about to unwrap my chocolate bar... Except I realized something strange... It was a Hearsy bar! Without nuts! (dont take that out of context) I told everyone in my family about it, and asked my dad if he replaced the bars. He didn&#39;t. In fact he saw me get Hearsys, not that other bar.

Another possibility is that every few million years everything on earth is destroyed- including earth itself, and then it rebuilds itself over another billion something years, and the human timeline repeats itself over and over again. there would be no proof of life before that current human timeline, so we would just expect that it is the first time humans have existed. that&#39;s where deja vu comes in. you could have done something in a past life- or another universe, that for some unexplainable reason you vaguely remember doing.

Evolution never happened,,, and it never had the time, so it could have happened,,,, because we have only been here on this earth for about 6000 years. Think about the odds of us on an earth that is constantly gaining mass from space dust and meteors, revolving around a sun that is always losing mass from burning fuel=mass. If mankind has evolved over billions of years, then why is there only about 6000 years worth of space dust on the moon = see the moon landings, there is only a few cm of space dust. If evolution ever happened, then it needed the moon to keep the oceans from becoming stagnant water\r<br>-\r<br>WHERE ARE THE THE BILLIONS OF YEARS WORTH OF DUST DEPOSIT. Surely that would have produce meters of dust, as would not the dust have been even thicker way back then + Don&#39;t try to tell me that something or someone removed the dust every so many thousand years\r<br>-\r<br>DO THE MATH FOR YOUR SELF = the amount of dust deposit is known,,, + the amount deposited per year is known too. I did the math in the early 90&#39;s, and it worked out to be about 6000 years worth of dust that is on the moon now. I don&#39;t know if they use the same figures now or not. But even so, it should be obvious that after even one billion years,,,, the dust should be many meters thick\r<br>-\r<br>Perpetual Geometrical Electricity Multiplication can power all things. TESLA was right + free AC electricity multiplication is easily done using PULLEYS =(wheels). This simple technology is even, Found in the Bible @ (Ezekiel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywn2Lz5zmYg&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>), as the inner workings of a UFO motor. &quot;a wheel in the middle of a wheel&quot; or, a small wheel running around the inside of a large wheel. Or a small cog in the middle of a large cog, with two medium size cogs of the same tread in between the large outer cog and the small inner cog. Do you see why I chose to use pulleys + belt/elastic/rope/or a piece of tied rope or string, instead of cogs with both size of cogs + threads having to be meshed correctly\r<br>-\r<br>This GEM-(free energy technology) is so simple that it should be obvious-(but it has been hidden by evil spirits). Just think of this small amount of logic,,, it only takes an input of a few sparks,(short bursts of current) to rotate a large 33 cm circumference pulley,(about 10 cm diameter) once, giving you 33 cm of moving belt. Then, if you run this length of belt past 1 to 3 mini-pulleys of 1 cm circumference, with AC or DC motors/generators attached, the this would give you an output of 33 or 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity. NOW TRY + TELL ME YOU CANNOT FREELY MULTIPLY ELECTRICITY with pulleys, when you can gain 99 cycles of AC or DC electricity, from a few sparks,(short bursts) of DC current, which is the amount to rotate a DC motor with a large 33 cm circumference pulley once\r<br>-\r<br>+ Don&#39;t you listen to these evil spirits, whispering that torque is a problem, as this is a blatant lie. This is because more torque occurs when you need to produce more power, and the only power that you need to produce, is the minute amount of current that it takes to crank over your single DC motor one single time. So you gain these 33 to 99 rotations=cycles of AC or DC electricity, from this 1 to 3 motors or generators, to generate the small amount of power that it takes to rotate a DC motor once, making this GEM device a self powered free energy system, These many rotations of these few motors or generators only need to generate a few short bursts of current, which equals practically nothing, when it comes to current. \r<br>- \r<br>This costs such a minimum amount of cash = 2 DC motors of the same voltage, 1 large + 1 small pulley, a belt, strap, elastic or tied piece of rope or string, possibly 4 diodes for a rough full wave bridge rectifier, a capacitor and a few wires to connect these components together. This is so simple to assemble that we could start making a GEM=(Geometrical Electricity Multiplier) for almost every voltage that we might need or want. Please remember that a lot of these supplies might be laying around our homes, or you could easily and cheaply pick them up in a junk yard. And if you choose to use AC motors/generators, then you have to add a full wave bridge rectifier, (4 diodes) in between your AC generator(s) and DC drive motor\r<br>-\r<br>THIS GEM TECHNOLOGY IS SIMPLE LOGIC, THAT EVIL FORCES ARE HIDING.

I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of over charging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000&#39;s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology\r<br>-\r<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF.

This website <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> is almost identical to the idea that I was shown in the early 2000&#39;s as a Vision of a 10 speed bicycle going uphill in 10th gear + then back downhill in 1st gear + I soon put this GEM free energy technology on the web @ <a href=\"http://free-energy.yolasite.com/\">http://free-energy.yolasite.com/</a> Free energy can be generated using pulleys, because pulleys can be used to freely multiply the # of rotations + since AC electricity is generated by rotations, then we can use pulleys to freely multiply AC electricity. \r<br>- \r<br>This is a diagram <a href=\"https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php\">https://free-energy.yolasite.com/picture-gallery.php</a> that looks a lot like the wiring of this former \u201cscience experiment\u201d YouTube video, if you replace the battery with a capacitor + if you only attach one side of the capacitor. I used a battery instead of a capacitor to use any extra power to charge the battery, + also added a warning of how this could be a fire hazard, because of over charging the battery. This free-energy website of mine was started in the early 2000&#39;s, so it was around for a long while, to inspire others of this ancient Ezekiel GEM technology, \r<br>- \r<br>PLEASE,,,,,, JUST TAKE THE FEW MINUTES + BUILD THIS SUPER SIMPLE MECHANISM FOR YOURSELF. Just go to this website. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxpoiCFKmPg/</a> + see how truly simple this works, and is to build. Now please, go out and build as many of these super simple, and cheap to build, GEM free energy machines as you can, of all sizes and voltages. Or even better, convince the government to start generating it for us, getting rid of the pollution that we put into the air, and the radioactive stuff completely \r<br>- \r<br>Have you ever heard of the MANDELA Effect?

There are so many perhaps an infinite number of them. There are alpha worlds such as earth and omega such as to be the end time where everything is far more technologically advanced and much farther along of development has been made on the planet where the parallel world is. Jesus called them the alpha and omega beginning and end. Omega by definition means the final development. The worlds stay parallel though a process I call \u202a2015\u202c witch is where one world merges many in from a main world. Then they all become the same. The master world as I call it or main world makes every other world parallel to it. So our world becomes there&#39;s, the master world. I call it 2015 because I believe this process took place in 2015 in October or November of that year. As I remember seeing visions of this other person who was myself in another world at least 5 times while I was in jail in 2015. from October some time to \u202aJanuary 5th.\u202c Witch was the last time I seen one of the visions. This person shares all my same markings and looks and is like a twin of myself. And all of the items from the master world and when 2015 happens then becomes the items in this world, your items. They duplicate and transfer to here as I have seen this happen and take place right in front of my eyes. His belongings became mine. You can also be born by 2015 as I became him. I believe spy&#39;s from another omega more developed planet initiate this to happen to our worlds. I herd them speak before inside my mind at multiple times in my life. 2015 doesn&#39;t leave this galaxy. We are all hooked to something in the mind and possibly in the body. That&#39;s sorta how 2015 works because you are hooked to something and are also hooked to your parallel self. I call this thing the filter. As it is in control of life on earth and keeps things parallel and I believe a filter can allow certain events to take place on Earth. Like if you needed to meet someone or get a job ect. It is also is as if mind control but is self automated and possibly controlled by people as well. Who can potentially alter it. But it is attached to the mind. I believe there could be other versions of earth where they have machines to view worlds and maybe even take action with these machines to even travel to other worlds to go to new and different worlds, but it is still a alpha world. And the time is similar to ours. Time I believe is important because it is a factor to a parallel world. Omega worlds may have no water. I believe the future of earth will have no water as to make room for my humans to live here. Water takes up a lot of space and if removed we will have a lot more room for a larger population witch is why I believe they remove the water. They use medications to live forever. They do not die by nature as we do today. The medical advances are so great they cannot die. So population as you can imagine becomes very very large! I believe they will have to do something to stop breeding. As some kind of mandated birth control. They are probably larger in size to us. Weight and height. I believe there body&#39;s to have more muscle definition. And are probably stronger. I believe they will not eat or drink but for pleasure they don&#39;t require food and water as we do. I believe they attach things to there body&#39;s. Devices such as our cellphones and apple watches they have devices hooked to them all the time as we do. They do not need sleep as there is no night there thiey are awake all the time. They have no need for the sun. They can rest but don&#39;t require it. They also control the climate and temperature. Climate and temperature will be different then our current planet and life. They are so technologically advanced they can spy and see the parallel other worlds as well as different worlds past and present. They can also travel to other worlds as well. Many come to alpha earth because there are so many parallel earths that you are likely to come here with an infinite number of them. But probably majority will go to a omega planet as there population could be in the high billions to low trillions for a planet similar to this one and planets like it. But potential much higher. Into the mid trillions And what if they increased the planets size. They can meet there parallel self&#39;s and there family and friends. They can even see and meet there past family members or friends. They can even see where they will live in the future like if they come to earth or other places like it. The worlds I believe will be wiped out so god can start a new and that&#39;s potentially how some get to alpha earth. But they can see themselves here as to look into there lives into the future. So I could be watching myself write this right now. Or where I will even be in the next life who my family will be where I will live what I will do for a living and such. They have no paper money. Money will be attached to the person at some point. They have no crime or jail. No or few wars with physical combat. Its a more perfect place. With no disease or suffering. There will be no wild animals. They no longer use electricity but new power sources.", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T14:52:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gaint Xander", "comment_text": "But first, we need to talk about Parallel Universes", "comment_date": "2020-03-05T13:16:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Curious Observer", "comment_text": "Philosophy is physics without mathematics :D", "comment_date": "2020-03-03T15:23:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alien Mon", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/5fAv8I2SXXU\">https://youtu.be/5fAv8I2SXXU</a>", "comment_date": "2020-03-03T01:48:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Moagamer", "comment_text": "N", "comment_date": "2020-03-02T23:21:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jofph", "comment_text": "a parallel universe to sum up (to me atleast) is multiple universe and time lines that have differ ed or some what same outcomes.

Furthermore, they know nothing about how these laws, energy, forces and all that were actually created. For some reason, these physicists never question about how these things actually came into place. And if we\u2019re being logical here, none of this could have come into place without a proper cause.<br><br>All these laws and these matter, energy, these forces and everything shouldn\u2019t have been created. Just think about it. Let\u2019s say absolutely no scientific laws or any form of matter or energy or anything exists at all. There is no system, just absolutely nothing.

And something that transcends the physical world created the physical world, as well as us. If that\u2019s so, then whatever created us definitely should also have a mind or consciousness. Just think about it. We couldn\u2019t have been created by something, if that something does not have a property of what we have. It just goes to show that there definitely must be a being with consciousness, who created us all.<br><br>Furthermore, think about how science has no explanation as to what consciousness is. They can explain matter, energy, forces etc. But the masterminds and expert scientists have never explained human consciousness. For some reason, us humans have this very unusual and amazing thing that cannot be explained. We have this thing that sticks out from this world, and it gives us awareness, the ability to think about complex and unnecessary things, it gives us a chance to recognize that we were somehow created. It lets us properly feel emotions, and use them to the full extent. The fact that we have this, and the fact that you and I are able to think about this really just points toward a God who wanted to let us, his creations, experience what he also experiences, which is consciousness.<br><br>One thing you could say to me is \u201coh, but how was god created\u201d. My answer is I don\u2019t know. But we don\u2019t have to know. We have already established that God transcends the physical world. And we have established that there absolutely must be a god for the universe to exist. Since we know nothing of this other world, we cannot say that it is impossible for God not to have been created. Furthermore, what if God was created by something that transcends further? But regardless of the reason, we know that it is impossible for us to exist, if it weren\u2019t the case of a transcending being.<br><br>So we have no choice but to believe so. <br><br>This took me quite a long time of thinking to figure out. Atheists, I have proven to you that a being that transcends us and this physical world must exist. I have not proven to you of a religious God. <br><br>I am religious, and I believe in the God of my religion also due to reasoning and evidence, but that will be far too much to explain. <br><br>That part is far more complicating than what I just said now.<br><br>If you did not think this made sense, or think that what I said is nonsense, you just don\u2019t understand. It makes complete sense.

A while ago scientists did an experiment and found something strange.  Galaxies didn\u2019t have enough matter to hold themselves together.  They ran the numbers over and over and kept hunting for errors in their measurements but they found none.  Eventually they realized that there was something else, something that they couldn\u2019t observe but they knew was there, and they called it dark matter.  Somehow(I\u2019m feeling too lazy to say how, I\u2019ll probably edit it later), dark energy was discovered.  My theory goes that when the universe was young, there were star clusters but no galaxies.  The galaxies came when another universe collided with ours and gave us dark matter.  Once again, It\u2019s there, just we can only interact with it because of gravity as it came from another universe that had the same gravity, but different laws of nature for everything else.  Going back to the star clusters, the bigger ones were made of gas under bigger pressure and so had more momentum.  When dark matter came, suddenly the stars would have a lot of rotational energy because of the increased gravity and the bigger clusters chose the directions in which they spun.  As for the supermassive black holes in the center, they were formed because the stars were denser in the middle and there would always be a really high chance of a massive star becoming a black hole and suck up everything until nothing was left in the middle.<br><br>This may seem like I\u2019m saying what everything is, but this is just a theory.

For all the realities in which that person decides yes, they must have the resources to build such a device. Due to the fact that the choices we make affect our current lifestyle, in an infinite number of realities there will be versions of that person who have the resources to build such a device, while having deciding yes, and staying with that decision, with pure ambition.

The electron has a 50% to be in a first state, and 50% chance to be in second one. When you pull the trigger, the detector scans the electron for its state. If the electron is on the first state, the gun will fire, but if the electron is in the second state, the gun will just make a <b>click</b> noise.<br>In this context, let&#39;s say you pull the trigger 10 times in a row in the direction of a bag of potatoes (or whatever that&#39;s not you). You will hear around 50/50 <b>click</b> and <b>bang</b> , something like <b>bang</b> <b>bang</b> <b>click</b> <b>bang</b> <b>click</b> <b>click</b> <b>click</b> <b>bang</b> <b>click</b> <b>bang</b><br>That happens because of the probability of the electron&#39;s state.

When saving and loading files of video game realities, we see that the many worlds theorem may not have been &quot;true&quot; 30 years ago, but it is &quot;true&quot; today, because worlds have been CREATED in this way. For example, a world where you can try sneaking past an alien invader, die, and then load your game and try a different path, like setting a boobie trap for him, after you have learned enough about the alien&#39;s behaviors, intelligence, pathing, responses to stimuli, and so on. With many worlds TOOLS (not just theories) it is a lot easier to survive these CREATED worlds. <br>It may not necessarily be true that the time is rewound to an earlier point and the conditions are explored again; perhaps it might be that the elements of the worlds are mass-produced, allowing the same experiment to run again. In any event, our perceptions cannot see the difference between the two methods of achieving this effect.<br>Mirrors of mirrors, or videotapes of videotapes, are other ways in which we can see that mass production for many worlds, and parallel universes might be true. Perhaps very deep in the mirror, the subject of reproduction might diverge from the original subject and exhibit freedom as a result of interactions with elements of the mirror that are not present in the outside world. The biggest obstacle in mirror science and video science is physical density and lack of powers of observation; it can get very crowded with all that subject matter, and shrinking the matter smaller so it fits only makes it harder to see. I see that you didn&#39;t get into microcosms, which are another explanation similar to bubble/black hole universes in that they can&#39;t be fully observed, but that is one very major condition of mass production required to sustain all these possible &quot;Uni&quot;verse(s) (read: multiverses).

The &quot;multiverse&quot; model was that each and every one of these arrangements exists in a &quot;freeze frame&quot; or timeless &quot;cell&quot;. All of these cells are arranged in a kind of honeycomb structure. Each cell being surrounded by every other cell representing every way the stuff in it could move in a single Planck Time. A person&#39;s conscious life is essentially a journey, a hopping from cell to cell in a straight line.  But every consciousness in the universe follows a different line, meaning that every individual person experiences the universe in a unique way. It may seem that every one else shares your same reality, but in actual fact, no one else does. The issue (and the paradox) was down to two individuals, they are the same physical person, but two separate consciousnesses following different time lines. But at some point, those time lines intersect meaning two very different lives meet at the same point. All the history of each up to that point was totally different, but ultimately led to the exact same universal configuration.

They are unable to satisfy their craving, symbolised by their depiction with huge bellies and tiny mouths<br><br>The animal realm: this is undesirable because animals are exploited by human beings, and do not have the necessary self-awareness to achieve liberation<br><br>Hell realms: people here are horribly tortured in many creative ways, but not for ever - only until their bad karma is worked off<br><br>(Early sources listed five realms, excluding the Titans.)<br>The first two levels are good places to be born.

There is no fourth apple, it does not exist. You could theoretically extrapolate a 4th type of apple based on the principals of the first, but thats all it is, theoretical extrapolation. The orchard does not have 4 kinds of apples, nor does it have only 1 or 2, it has 3 types of apples in reality.

This allows us to create the wildest thoughts.<br><br>Imagine that the multiverse is composed of infinite universes, where laws of physics can find other forms. But we must always remember that within an infinite, other infinities fit. This was well remembered by Cantor. Something like the set of real numbers, which is infinite, contains the set of natural numbers, which is also infinite.<br><br>In this sense, our infinite multiverse will certainly contain many universes that are very similar to ours and that meet the same laws of physics we already know so well. More than this, there is nothing to prevent infinite universes similar to ours in this infinite multiverse (note that we are talking about trans-infinitical numbers)<br><br>Good. Now let&#39;s talk a little about probabilities:<br><br>If I raffle a die, the probability of getting a six will be 16.67%. If I repeat this tie twice, the probability of getting the &quot;six&quot; at least once will be 30.56%. For ten times this probability will already be 83.85%. Hundred times will result in 99.9999987925%. If we cast the dice endless times, the probability of getting at least a &quot;six&quot; will tend to be 100%. That is, it is possible to be sure that in infinite launches I will get at least once the &quot;six&quot;. But it happens that in infinite releases the probability of occurring an event of any unit probability tends to 100%. In endless attempts, even the most unlikely things will always be a certainty.<br><br>Let&#39;s go back to the multiverse.<br><br>We already know that our multiverse contains infinite universes, and we also know that any occurrence (however improbable) is 100% likely to occur at least once in one of these universes. That is to say: It is certain that in some of these universes there is a mutant apple tree that, instead of apples, produces purple pears with yellow polka dots or even less probable things.<br><br>We can still think the following. All matter that exists is formed by a set of interconnected atoms and in this way, nothing prevents any possible structure from the chemical and physical point of view to be reproduced identically elsewhere. For example: four hydrogen atoms and one carbon atom bind to form methane. This process can be repeated to form another molecule of methane. The same thing happens with all matter formed, but when we look at a rock, we are contemplating sextile of interconnected atoms and in this situation; it is unlikely that different atoms will interconnect so often to the point of producing two atomically identical rocks. But in our case, the infinite multiverse can reproduce this process endless times and in this way, the probability of having two identical rocks in the multiverse tends to 100%. No matter how small this probability is, in infinite repetitions coincidence is a certainty.<br><br>Now we begin to understand what happens to the universe of probabilities when we reproduce a process infinitely many times. Let&#39;s look at the most controversial case:<br><br>Imagine that John Smith died run over on September 23, 1965. At this time, his body was formed by the binding of many sextilions of atoms in specific positions. In addition, each of its atoms had a definite nuclear and electron configuration, its electron spins, even every quantum of energy that formed its body possessed a state that was unique in all its life and these atomic and electronic configurations defined not only the physical form of John Smith, also defined his thoughts, memories, warts, etc. Everything in him was defined by this unique quantum state throughout his life. The repetition of this microstructural state is so rare that it hurts, but it is not null, after all, we have physical evidence that such a condition occurred at least once on September 23, 1965.<br><br>Since this probability is not zero, it is certain that in infinite repetitions of combinations of atoms it will repeat itself in the multiverse, that is, at a given moment, somewhere in the multiverse, a set of atoms will be configured in such a way that everything that which is John Smith (his body, his thoughts, memories, all in order) is perfectly reproduced, and since we know that the multiverse is infinite, we also know that this repetition of the same agglomerate of quanta is a certainty.<br><br>In other words, in another universe, atoms united to give rise to another John Smith identical in body and thought to all that he was on September 23, 1965. But since the multiverse is infinite we can be sure that probabilities may occur. It is certain that in some of these universes, John Smith will survive the run over and will continue to live until his death on January 18, 2013.<br><br>But this is not the end of John Smith. There is certainly another universe in which it will survive beyond 2013, in the same way that it survived beyond 1965. There is another universe in which thermodynamic conditions will allow for unlimited survival.<br><br>Lastly. If you believe, like myself, that everything in a human being is due to the laws of chemistry and physics. That our memories, thoughts, emotions, etc. are bites stored in the atoms that compose us, and also believes that infinite universes (multiverse) are possible such as Stephen Hawking, Brian Greene, Max Tegmark, Alan Guth, Andrei Linde , Michio Kaku, David Deutsch, Leonard Susskind, Alexander Vilenkin, Yasunori Nomura, Raj Pathria, Laura Mersini-Houghton, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Sean Carroll, etc. I have to inform you. You believe in the afterlife. After all, for all intents and purposes. A reproduction of you that has all your memories, thoughts and emotions is yourself, regardless of the universe in which you are living.<br><br>As for my belief in the multiverse? I know that there is mathematical coherence in the theories that propose such a solution, but coherence is insufficient to define what &quot;truth&quot; is. Truth is what can be experimentally verified and / or falsified, and this is not the case with the theory of the mutiverse. I believe in genuine random phenomena (Copenhagen interpretation) and that the laws of probabilities apply to our universe, so the day someone convinces me of the reality of the multiverses, there will be no alternative left but to believe in the afterlife.

And the allegorical way to portray this idea, is to state that both the Heavens and the Earth (representing dimensions and matter) were created by God&#39;s word (where \u201cGod&#39;s word\u201d, or \u201cBreath\u201d represents a primordial non physical universe). <br>But, since articulated words are the natural expression of a conscious mind, what Scripture really means to say is that our seemingly infinite universe is in fact the physical manifestation of an apparently infinite [and higher] non physical consciousness; that time, space, matter, energy, and dimensions are all the manifestation of active thoughts; In fact, that the whole Universe is no more than living thoughts. <br>Thus, it makes perfect sense that the Hebrew Scriptures state that, after we die [and thus leave our physical universe], we will experience a sort of \u201cpersonalized heaven\u201d (or personalized hell); an automatically built universe, created by our own consciousness. If we have had a just and merciful mind, we will experience a universe where justice and mercy will be meted to us [this will be our &quot;heaven&quot; or &quot;paradise&quot;]. But, if we were stern and evil, we will experience a universe where stern evil will be meted to us [and this will be our &quot;Gehinnom&quot;, or &quot;Hellfire&quot;].

And why ever would such &quot;bubbles&quot; have different physical laws?   There&#39;s absolutely no reason for that to occur, and reality does not tend to spend energy &quot;just because&quot;.   (Also the idea of &quot;inside black holes&quot; is 99% laughable and of the &quot;oh wow wouldn&#39;t it be cool if&quot; sort of ideas.)<br><br>It&#39;s effectively just an extension of the geocentric worldview to the next level of knowledge.   Also, why assume such are &quot;bubbles&quot; treated like they are distinct and have a clear &quot;cutoff&quot;?   It&#39;s perfectly possible that there are uncountable additional &quot;results of big bangs&quot; around us, that we simply cannot notice because they are so far away that even the light from a whole &quot;universe&quot; is like trying to see an earthlike planet in galaxy &gt;10 billion ly away.   I once did a calculation to attain a probable scale based on the difference in each level of scale within the observable universe, size of planetary systems compared to star clusters, galaxies, galaxy clusters and superclusters, and while the result was very vague, we still need to improve our best telescopes at least 2-3 orders of magnitude minimum to even have a chance to detect such &quot;bubbles&quot;.<br><br>Type #2 is just lazy physicists.   If a model doesn&#39;t work, just break the glass and add as many extra dimensions as needed to fix.<br>We can move in dimensions.   For this to be real, there is a requirement for something to prevent us from sensing or moving through those additional dimensions.   This again runs into the limitation that reality does not spend energy just for fun.   There then needs to be a natural &quot;default&quot; reason for reality to end up with 3 dimensions separated out from the other 6 dimensions.<br><br>Type #3, the &quot;every possibility is real&quot; simply does not work at all.   For it to work, it requires perfect coordination between all &quot;universes&quot;, as otherwise there would be clustering towards the more likely possibilities while the unlikely wouldn&#39;t happen at all.   It also requires that you have a constant influx of matter and energy equal to that present in the universe, every subparticle and waveform etc included, times the number of states they could theoretically be in, times the number of new positions they could potentially end up in the next moment(as in the time it takes for any particle to move enough that it is no longer where it was the previous moment).   This essentially requires infinite mass and energy.<br><br>Going back to the coordination part, the really troublesome thing with this is that this means that communication of SOME kind needs to be possible between &quot;universes&quot;, yet this in effect means the individual universes are not in fact separate entities but instead just a more complex variation on type #2, with not quite infinite number of membranes.

No time space distance weight waves light gravity density resistence and especially matter all do not exist..   Who decided that the &quot;Observer&quot; needed a cattle prod shoved up it&#39;s ass when it clearly demonstrated it&#39;s virgin simplicity. I see, I imagine and it is.....What math? What are you measuring, it&#39;s creation.. it&#39;s existence...When did it ever tell you that it does not exist unless it falls under your laws.... your the ones that discovered it, finally, proving it is way smarter than you... Who&#39;s the ones lacking and lagging here now your gonna tell it what it is....what it consists of in your zoo of caged theories and malnutritioned discoveries that need to be locked in a cages and prodded... Did you do a DNA ... How many decades are people going to spend dissecting that one...<br>....<br>  Been to a real lot of parallels are there are a shit load of &quot;You&#39;s&quot; running around .... We all posses the same time and space and everything simultaneously and that&#39;s not out of a book...  If you want to see it and not study it then that is your guide and nothing more is needed The laws in your dreams are your guide, there are none.... If you really wanna get weird I can summon any of my &quot;freinds&quot; and make physical portals anywhere in the universe I have previously visited and by the time the thought crosses my mind there they are in less than the blink of an eye... But I&#39;m crazy and parallels and conscience observations altering &quot;matter&quot;  are so plausible.. We create matter...We own it, not vise versa... The laws are not for us to comply to as your the one that made them... All men are created in Gods image  He invented everything out of a vision and so do you...  This entire universe is your creation but there are webs woven into each others universal fabric of existence. I am married to my same wife now after we both died in a car accident in another universe and from litteraly opposite sides of the planet sought each other out in days time and re-married...  It&#39;s a cool story OK  35 years now... As far I am concerned I have this thing mastered and was in the military BTW hint  There&#39;s your fast lane...", "comment_date": "2017-09-24T16:16:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asra", "comment_text": "In a parallel universe Phones Don&#39;t Exist \ud83d\ude41 \ud83d\udcf1", "comment_date": "2017-09-23T17:52:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bb2fiddler", "comment_text": "Dislike for the SW prequel hate<br><br><br><br><br><br>Just kidding :)", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T22:14:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adekunle Adekayero", "comment_text": "Atheist are really funny for not believing there is a God..", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T17:41:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HyLion", "comment_text": "But first we need to talk about parallel universes!", "comment_date": "2017-09-20T17:16:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MARBLE STUDIOS", "comment_text": "Islam has proved parellel universe 1400 years ago there is hadith ( prophet&#39;s saying ) <br>In the book al musnadibne haaqim (hadith book )<br>That &quot;there are 7 skies and every has its earth and every earth has its muhammad , it&#39;s own Abraham it&#39;s own adam it&#39;s , <br>Own moses and jesus &quot; <br>This has proved parallel time", "comment_date": "2017-09-20T11:45:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "john's banana choked me. help", "comment_text": "The Flash brought me here.", "comment_date": "2017-09-18T12:33:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nihilist The God", "comment_text": "You said their was no scientific evidence for any of these.

Couldn&#39;t you completely rule out the third type of multiverse due to simple cause and effect? The reason our universe is the way it is, is because of cause and effect. Even decisions we make at random are caused by the way our neurons fired. So lets say that there is a point in the timeline where a man dies of a heart attack. The theory would suggest that there is an alternate timeline that branches off at that point of existence in which the man does not die of a heart attack. But, there&#39;s a reason that this happened? The elements in play up to the man dying would still be written in history the exact same way in the other universe as the one we know to be true. And if they are written the exact same way, then the exact same outcome would occur would it not? There is no variation allowed here by the very rules of this theory as the theory states that up until the point of difference, everything is the same. The only possible solution to this would be a 3rd party being superimposed into ALL realities that simply chooses to adjust things outside of space-time. Yes, this would be a God. And this wouldn&#39;t be any normal God, this would be the God of all Gods, because he is God of every reality. (Unless his superimposed reality on our infinte realities is also only a single reality of multiple realities in which every one of THOSE realities would be a different version of this God super imposed on his own set of infinite realities. <br><br>It would look exactly like how the illustration in the video showed, except there would be an infinite number of infinitely branching universes that are all super imposed onto one realty in which there is a meddling force.", "comment_date": "2017-07-02T07:39:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Francis Lawrence", "comment_text": "Is this going to be a video where we act like human decisions are somehow special, aphysical, turning points ?", "comment_date": "2017-07-01T21:35:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lul Eren", "comment_text": "Want to hear something more mindfucking?

If Universe A uses ours but has a different history than us, along with B, C, F, and Q, then it&#39;s a parallel one. <b><i>However</i></b> if universe G, Z, X, and E don&#39;t operate by our laws of physics then they are part of a separate set of parallels. We just need to repeat the process until we&#39;ve counted all of the 3 dimensional sets, thus coming up with the finite amount of 3 dimensional universes. Of course, there will always be more as we&#39;ll never be able to perceive any sets that would exists on higher levels, like 4th and 5th dimensional sets of parallels.<br><br>So what do you think?", "comment_date": "2016-12-23T05:53:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "naresu", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywn2Lz5zmYg&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a> I saw that meaning of life \ud83d\ude0f", "comment_date": "2016-12-21T00:52:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cate Benedict", "comment_text": "dc and marvel comics coming to life. yay", "comment_date": "2016-12-18T19:13:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Palmquist", "comment_text": "the multiverse theory is proof that people will believe any sort of made up nonsense they can come up with so long as in their minds it takes God out of the picture.<br>Absolutely pathetic", "comment_date": "2016-12-16T07:37:55Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Rohan Karkra", "comment_text": "Please answer a question.

All of the same conditions - choices throughout history - have to be met for you to exist at all. So of all possible realities, you yourself can only exist in so many worlds. There are also deeper ramifications - that much of your life is predetermined. As the ancient saying goes, &quot;You cannot change the winds, but you can adjust your sails.&quot; So in most of your realities there are predetermined events, because the same is true for everyone else in your timelines. However, in each reality, you respond a little differently to the winds of change. As Rick said, for most of Jerry&#39;s timelines, he&#39;s a loser, but in at least one reality he&#39;s a movie star. Finally, there&#39;s an idea that upon dying in this timeline you don&#39;t go to heaven or nothingness or whatever, but you continue in the next life, the next timeline. Because you cannot be aware of anything before or after your life. In effect, you are immortal, because you are part of a story the multiverse is telling and retelling. &quot;In stranger eons, even death may die.&quot; Gives new meaning to the phrase &quot;they live on in our memories.&quot; Because yeah, they exist now in another timeline, actually living out the days you remember. In some other timeline, you are not here, and the deceased are. So what does this mean? That nothing you do matters? No - it&#39;s the same as ordinary life. If you fail to thrive, others will take your place. If you thrive, others may fail. You&#39;re damned if you do and you&#39;re damned if you don&#39;t. Perhaps there is a resonance along timelines - the better you do in this timeline, the better you do across all. Speculation, of course.

They&#39;re in our observable universe. Just because we don&#39;t yet perceive what&#39;s &quot;Inside&quot; a black hole doesn&#39;t mean the laws &quot;inside&quot; are <i>different</i>. It only means we don&#39;t yet understand all the laws of physics, here specific to black holes.

I don&#39;t think so. That just puts it in the context of observable-or-not, the same as original &quot;boring&quot; (observable <i>and</i> unobserveable) non-multiverse concept. While we have no evidence for or against a &quot;boring&quot; universe where the natural laws change at some point beyond our observable universe, I&#39;d have to say this comes across as unlikely. This would infer that somewhere outside of our observable universe but within our own space-time continuum (pick a 3-D direction and go...), it&#39;s possible that magic exists, along the lines of Terry Pratchett&#39;s <i>Disc World</i> fiction series (or pick your own fantasy genre), just not within our own observable universe. If natural laws exist in a particular &quot;boring&quot; universe, they must exist for the entire &quot;boring&quot; universe, observable or otherwise, or it would collapse. So again, this particular consideration for bubble universes is specious.<br><br>Hence other bubble universes must be outside our own &quot;boring&quot; universe&#39;s bubble.<br><br>I like that you&#39;ve suggested that none of these three concepts are mutually exclusive.

Universes and dimensions are the same, from the point of view of matter.&quot;<br><br><br>This is my opinion &quot;The True Science of Parallel Universes&quot;.<br><br>To understand the concept of the universe, we must first understand the basis of how we have throughout our history, a well-established form of like seeing the universe, which is almost generally, it is reasoned, thought out and explained, almost entirely based on geometric concepts, and although they are a good way to understand empirical, heuristic and scientific way, this type of observation, explanation and description, is only partial to properly explain the universe in which we live, so, I propose a new way of understanding our universe.<br><br>It is not a new mathematical or physical way of trying to describe our dimension, but, for me, is the right way we should describe our universe, and how they are made: of matter.<br><br>If we begin to see first our dimensional universe as it is, matter, we can begin to really discover new concepts of how to understand the most general way to more completely, in its observation, explanation and description, so let this Geometer universe of our dreams, and we stand mentally in what we are, and that we ourselves are part of this universe, matter.<br><br>(Here I have to clarify that while I use the word dimension, do not use in geometric terms, which is the normal way using the concept, but I mean the physical dimension or matter.)<br><br>Which every day is evolving towards a certain point of its transformation process.<br><br>Clarifying that, subsequent to its understanding as a subject, not making less current descriptions are correct from the standpoint of which were developed in if you are good tools to explain as we have done, but the use of the description first subject will give new concepts to existing ones, which complement and eventually respond to concepts and incomplete answers already described, which were never had sufficient livelihoods to be right, and answer these contradictions, and paradoxes in quantum mechanics.<br>\u00a0<br>And thinking about the concept of &quot;Wave Function Collapse&quot; and that, as you see, this response will give a more acceptable reasoning, if we begin to understand the universe from the point of view that is a matter first before geometry.<br><br>So the first thing we do is locate our observations based on the description of the universe of matter, then we can better use any concept already established as the third example that is mentioned in the video, because it is the one closest to the Actually, of how to perceive the universe, because it uses quantum mechanics to it, and in fact that&#39;s the best way to describe it, but in the video ends by reusing geometry, which ends up not explain again what it seeks, if there really is multi-universes. (Multiverse)<br><br>The explanation of our universe, starting in the subatomic universe, is the best way to begin to describe and discover how the environment in which we evolved as human beings really works, and you start to understand how we can really deduce heuristically, but with bases of data already known previously tested and used by scientists to try to get a reasonable understanding of that concept, just giving a different concept in understanding and conjunction.<br><br>For example, if we start to see the universe as matter rather than geometry, automatically we eliminate the concept that can not be answered from a current standpoint, why matter has a behavior superposition of states, as bases which are used, although it has concepts of using the material in its reasoning, end up using geometry to try to complete their understanding, but rather than use anytime geometry, we use exclusively the concept of matter, even to know why not leave the calculations regarding the paradox of &quot;wave function collapse&quot; and the information of the new understanding and the inclusion of matter can be completed so that there is no collapse of wave, simply by determining, based on the reasoning of the universe of matter, and using the particular concept of the apparent behavior of the same, in the superposition of states, we find that overlap not because the matter is these two states, but that that matter, is not giving two face their composition, but mainly overlapping parallel universes, and I mean the third and fourth dimension, both of matter, but of opposite characteristics, or what is the same:<br><br>UNIVERSE OF THIRD DIMENSION = MATTER, CORPUSCULAR BEHAVIOR.<br>UNIVERSE OF FOURTH DIMENSION = ANTIMATTER, UNDULATORY BEHAVIOR.<br><br>By integrating antimatter established concepts in general, it begins to have a better understanding and description of why there should be no collapse of wave or superposition of states of matter, but this gives an explanation for the apparent behavior of matter, when just what was deduced and explained mathematically, was a concept halfway, because it is used only for parts of our universe and dimension, but when the whole universe is installed on this concept, besides antimatter, it achieves more complete understanding of overlapping states of matter, being, in my description of this best: Overlay of matter and antimatter.<br><br>In addition, quantum entanglement, would be better integrated into the concept of overlapping and how matter behaves in one place and another at the same time, no matter how distant they interact their same or similar particles, because where would correlate It would be in that parallel universe of antimatter.<br><br>By using the concept of matter and antimatter for each universe, these are just a few passes to the full understanding of the concept, but mainly responds if there is or there he or parallel universes, and the answer, however great it may seem to them is : YES.<br><br>Following and lack of describing these concepts, it is more surprising still, but I think this left a basis of understanding more or less easy to understand, but the record, and made it clear, I&#39;m not including something new, or It has not been confirmed in any way scientifically.

So that must mean that there is infinite amount of possibilities and logically there is never a wrong or right answer. Now how this links to parallel universes is interesting. Its mind boggling to even try and think of how many infinite is ! How i think is that for an example say you are driving down a street and to the left is a pole. If you picture a scenario in your head of you hitting that pole but keep driving forward, in a parallel universe, life would be the exact same up to that exact point of time where you hit that pole and that is the slight change that would trigger a parallel universe. So what i think triggers a parallel universe is your mind. If you can picture a scenario or you have 2 choices the parallel universe will play that scenario you thought of or it will pick the opposite choice of what you picked in this life, &amp; that would be the only change. So then what is more mind boggling is that if you think of every living creature, every human being that has been able to have a choice or play out scenarios in there head over the existence of time. Each one of those triggers parallel universes. How this gets me as well but is if the universe is infinite which i believe it is &amp; if something is endless it means the chance of something being real is always greater the 0. Even if its a 0.000000000000000000001 chance its still possible of happening and yet it can happen. So doesn&#39;t that mean god is real, evolution is real, anything and everything we have ever thought of or come up with is technically real in one way or another it makes logical sense.

It means that what you perceive is nothing. Or everything is in a state of infinite potential energy just existing. Now the question becomes what is perceiving all this randomness?

The only people that would call that a valid and accepted scientific theory are idiots and people whose closest connection to cosmology is a cousin they haven&#39;t heard from since grade school.\u00a0 What you are taking about in your first theory is called the anthropic principal, which answers the question, why does the universe look the way it does? The answer is that if it didn&#39;t, we wouldn&#39;t be here to ask the question. The anthropic principal is a philosophical notion and not a mathematical model.<br>The third theory you talk about is also not a mathematical theory but the philosophical musings of science fiction writers on the implications of the collapsing waveform model in observational quantum mechanics.\u00a0 There is no mathematical basis for the notion of branching realities from quantum decision points.\u00a0 That idea comes straight from Stargate SG-1 and other contemporary sci-fi creations.<br>As far as the second model of the multiverse you are close but blow it big time.

Oh, i first have to inform you that most of the tings i will now say are from other theories, and that i have just modified those to avoid &quot;errors&quot;. So, first, ill rename the theory to &quot;Multiple time line theory&quot; where we live in one time line which was defined by the choices we made. Lets say that, currently, we are located in time line 0, or, source. When we build a time machine in the future (im quite sure we will), and attempt to travel back in time, we would actually &quot;leave&quot; time line 0, and enter time line 1. The only difference between those 2 (for now) is that we &quot;exist&quot; in a place we do not belong. Why did i say we moved to another time line instead of just traveling back in past? - in order to avoid paradoxes. First of all, if we built a time machine in the future, why didnt we see time travelers up to this point? Simple, because all time travelers left our time line and entered another, we will never be able to see them. Now, the good old grandfather paradox. Since we moved to another world line and are no longer in the source, our actions do not influence the events of the source. Killing our grandfather in world line 1 just means that we will not be born in that world line, but we were born and have lived in the source. Oh, i forgot to mention how the &quot;switching&quot; world lines works in this theory. Take two strings (which represent the time lines), tie a knot on both of them and align them (that would represent the same moment in both time lines). Now, when we &quot;time travel&quot; we simply adjust the other time line and &quot;hop&quot; over to it. Therefore, we can never travel backwards in OUR time line, we just jump over to the other one. Why did i note this, well, simply to destroy your hopes of fixing things in your past, or saving someone. You can never change your past, im sorry, all you can do is alter another time line and help your other self. You can go on and change the world, stop Hitler, but, what does it matter. You just ran away from the reality of your time line. Yes, you might feel better if you see someone you love again, but, that doesnt change the fact that you have seen them die. Time travel is just a selfish concept, a way to escape reality and find fake salvation. Stop thinking about stupid concepts and deal with the present situation. Do you really have to throw away tons of cash when you could have used that money to rebuild a country and help its people", "comment_date": "2013-11-20T23:03:19Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Emma Crismon", "comment_text": "Freaking duck don&#39;t be a idiot u r just being negative at least this youtuber is being helpfulmp I bet u did not even learn one thing about this in fact if u hate it so much why were u watching??hmmm...

Be more appreciative of the miracle that is your existence, and don&#39;t try to tell the universe how it should be. Your body is ridiculous.
