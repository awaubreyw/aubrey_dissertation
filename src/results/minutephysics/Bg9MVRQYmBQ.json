The fast-moving twin moves away for some period of time, then has to change their velocity to turn around and come back, while the other twin remains in a single inertial reference frame the whole time. This breaks the symmetry and allows there to be a period where both twins agree on who time is moving faster for.

In Einstein&#39;s special relativity, everything moves through both space and time at a combined speed equal to the speed of light. In this way, if you could manage to move through space at the speed of light (in a vacuum/microgravity), you necessarily do not move through time; as nothing is faster than the speed of light, and your combined speed through space and time equals the speed of light. Conversely if you could not move through space at all, you would only be moving through time. With the twin experiment, the one who travels away from Earth in a supersonic jet is moving faster through space than the twin on Earth is. And this means that the twin travelling faster, is travelling more through space than they are through time; and are therefore aging slower. Whereas the twin on Earth is moving less through space and more through time than the twin on the rocket ship; and is therefore, relative to the travelling twin, aging faster while travelling less through space. The effect of this, when the twins reunite, is that the twin in the rocket ship is markedly younger than the twin at home (depending on the total amount of spacetime traveled). And this is simply because the twin in the rocket ship has traveled far less through time than the twin on Earth has.

The Paradox is true if we are talking about Special Relativity, which only holds true in inertial reference frames. If the twin had never accelerated, then there would be a Paradox. Since the twin accelerated while turning, we have to consider General Relativity, which deals with non-inertial reference frames.

I would venture to guess, though, that if the travelling twin stopped at say, 1 light year away after travelling at super speeds, and then sent a picture of his clock to his brother then once the brother who stayed received the picture, he would see that time passed more slowly for his brother than him, relative to his clock.  But if the brother that left came back at the same speed, then their clocks would once again be matched up, due to countering the initial dilation.<br><br>I would guess this would require the brother who left to travel at exactly the same speed both away and to his brother who stayed, so that the dilation would be affected equally in both directions.", "comment_date": "2016-08-19T17:46:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muzla", "comment_text": "Time doesnt exist! :D", "comment_date": "2016-08-19T17:45:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerome Lester V.", "comment_text": "I have a theory why the Twins Paradox is not a Paradox!
