In general relativity space-like has an advantage (comment 3) and a disadvantage (comment 2). In this case I can&#39;t decide which is better. And this is why:<br><br>Comment 2: Given a world line. Then the proper time between two points makes sense (integral of proper time of the derivative). This is the time which was measured by an observer following the world line. Space-like world lines represent tachyons, which travel faster then light and they are physically irrelevant. Hence the time-like version has more physical meaning for world lines.<br><br>Comment 3: In general relativity world lines are &quot;free falling&quot; if they are geodesic (local metric minimizers) in the space-like metric. This is analogous to the Riemann manifold version of geodesics. Hence &quot;free falling&quot; means longest local proper time. One last remark about this: This is in harmony with time dilation. Time travel to future is easy. But no one can travel slower in time or even travel back in time locally with respect to a free falling observer. To do this one has to take a GLOBAL shortcut. <br><br>Question 1: Given two points on two different world lines. Is there always a nice interpretation of the relativistic metric difference like this (some kind of proper length)?
