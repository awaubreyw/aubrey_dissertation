Now u dont need a person when u put force on it because the bike is good on its own without the force of a human but good with just force on its own. When u put force on it to move it forward it needs the right amount of force considering if u have wind or u push it slightly to the left or right. In order to make it go straight u need the right amount of balance and force. So in all conclusion the answer is why the bike stays up right is a combination of; force, gravity and entropy. U put force on an balanced vehicle to make it go forward considering u push it the right way, the gravity makes it stop itself cuz gravity makes us fall down and considering how hard the force of the moving bike is the entropy.

The traction friction of the tire on the ground, as the bicycle is steering while moving forward, acts in the opposite direction as when the bicycle is leaning over and stationary.  It is gravity that makes the wheel steer left if you tilt a stationary bicycle left, because the weight is supported by a part of the tire that is behind the steering axis...  but while a bicycle is moving forward, inertia opposes any steering acceleration, and would cause a centripetal force that would try to steer the wheel in the opposite direction as gravity tries to make it turn (so if it was steering left, the friction on the ground would try to turn the wheel to the right, which would cause the bike to fall over).

That is why it is more stable to go faster. The falling front area of the tire seems to become heavier.

Resonant systems have a characteristic 90 lag, and the blade will flap up 90 degrees after the max cyclic input and down 90 degrees after the min cyclic input.

In this explanation you point out that the surface force acts outward. Isn&#39;t this wrong??

It uses about 300W for a 70+20kg (biker+bike) in 25km/h, its about 12Wh/km for 90kg. That\u00b4s about 135Wh/km for 1 ton.<br><br>Compare that to a car that uses about 150Wh/km for the total vehicle and its about 1.5ton, that is only 100Wh/km. So a car is actually more efficient than a bike, kg for kg, And that in much higher speeds.<br><br>Also, can compare with Shell super-miler competition they are 10 times more efficient then bikes, about the same wight and still run faster.<br><br>Also, a moving bike with locked handle bars will not fall as quick as a stationary one. The reason for this is gyroscopic force. At sleepwalking this effect is mineskule, but already at biking speed, about 25km/h is already quite high.<br><br>&quot;The gryoscopic force dont make the bike stand up&quot;<br>This is partial wrong. Its true that  it don\u00b4t make the bike stand up, but it slow down the fall.<br>That the gyroscopic force change the angle 90 degree is only true for the front wheel.. The back wheel that is locked in place it will make it harder for the wheel to tip over.<br><br>&quot;Sicentist dont know&quot;<br>This is just stupid: The science is quite clear. Is rather a mater of math how much amount of what you need for different combination. By &quot;dont know, that we have not precalculated every possible scenario, well that is true. But we can pre calculate.<br><br>Then also, in real life, there is always a margin of error. If you are to close to the margine of error you can\u00b4t be sure if it works or not, but is not the same as we don\u00b4t know... Rather, we actually do know that there is a specific margin of error.", "comment_date": "2015-06-30T16:43:29Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Nuoska", "comment_text": "What about friction?

I can try and guess what you mean based on what I see but I don&#39;t understand it as a whole. Maybe it would have been easier if you showed us the center of mass of the whole bike.<br>  The other problem appears when you talk about the inclined angle of the front wheel axis. You compare the inclined axis of the wheel with a line that would be at 90\u00b0. The problem is that you don&#39;t really explain what that line is. At first I thought it was what the axis would look like if it wasn&#39;t inclined, but the line doesn&#39;t even pass through the center of the wheel. It is just a chord of the circle that is the wheel. Then I thought that it could have been misplaced, but then the axis would not touch the ground behind that line at a right angle.
