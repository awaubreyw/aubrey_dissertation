falling into space because there&#39;s no grounding there&#39;s a girl he came from the inner sun and the outer son as well so when you&#39;re inside the Earth sounds good people will pull you to the inside crust ground of the inner earth or you won&#39;t fall into the inner Sun and innocence smaller than in the outer Sun so it&#39;s gravity pool is it&#39;s not as strong as the outer Sun you&#39;re strong enough to keep people on the outer part of the planet from sliding to space but not strong enough to pull the inner people into the sun of the inner earth because the other Earth is a lot stronger son and it pulls you to the surface of the inner earth so you won&#39;t be floating around like your weightlessly like you would be in space no matter how hard you jump inside or outside the plant you won&#39;t fall off the planet and the float away into the sun of the inner earth are the outer Earth by floating into space which would be a destiny off itself this is no air it&#39;s just vacuum of space you got it before you burn up in the Suns raise but I imagine the inner earth don&#39;t have no night time cuz every portion of the inner earth is regressing night from the inner Sun 24 hours day and night that&#39;s what keeps the planet warm as well as the two mantle trust fighting around one another the outer person goes in One direction the intercourse goes in another direction which causes friction and create a thick lava lake ocean around the planet of hot lava motive Rock from the friction of the two crust of the inner Earth and outer going to opposite direction from one another their main shots going from one part of the Earth at the North and South Poles of the planet has a doorway shaft to get goes all the way through to the inner earth this is what I believe that that guy who is playing down into they want these big giant chess on at the post of the planet into a inner earth that had their own oceans in Lynn Mass and water so I can say there&#39;s a layer that goes around that shaft that has lava ocean of lava a motive Rock from friction from the two mantles going in opposite direction and restriction causes the Rock that say liquid side that&#39;s what feeds the volcanoes when they were up it&#39;s just lava from this ocean of lava that goes around the middle portion of the planet if he&#39;s the inside and outside warm that&#39;s why they can&#39;t just thrill to the center of the Earth it was found some way to make it through the lava they couldn&#39;t dig into other part cuz it&#39;s smooth so fast off the direction to go into the inner part of the planet listen going to the one that inner part volcanoes that I know even the inner earth must have as well as a surface of the planet to erase some of the pressure from the lava ocean desk warm and creating this The shield run a planet cuz it&#39;s not just got lava it&#39;s got to iron steel liquid side within the lava trade energy for our mind Earth&#39;s natural shield is created by this ocean lava and still liquid cover I believe there too makes me want to steal and iron but those materials are separated the cells from the Rock that&#39;s liquefied in the same area but they created magnetic field to create the shield around the planet check life on the outside of the inner earth domain and they got a silver shield in the inner earth protection from their own miniature signs these things are my specials about the planet Earth in my Siri as well anyone says the planet is flat got to be crazy and retarded cuz our planet is a ball with a inner ball with an interval shield around a miniature son as we have an outer shield around the outer part of the planet we have one on the inside protecting life within the inner earth as well as we got a shield protection out of life from rays from the Sun of the in Earth as the outer son killed keeps them people on the surface say from the race of radioactive material from the space get all the sons within the Galaxy sitting there rays of toxic material into deep space eventually reach us but so weak is there a raise by time they get to us star Shields are able to protect us from those where you active way raise of those Stars that&#39;s actually sons throughout the Galaxy this is my theory of our Earth take it as fact if you want that there&#39;s ring is still ring of iron rings of copper as most of with large areas between the rings of liquid rock great Nate ocean of steel and lava but these feel and iron and copper is separate from the lava but invisible failure where you know they all liquidified they do not mix together unless a metal that makes the magnetic field around the planet that starts shield for the outer planet as well as the inner planet fun to shield the inner earth from the rays of radioactive material from that song you know it&#39;s best to after equator we found evidence there of solar rays not going from the sky down but from the ground up

Sorry, incorrect about coming to rest at the other side (great opportunity for a follow up video). You&#39;ve assumed that the DURATION of acceleration at high and low gravitational effect are mirror images either side of the centre/core, they aren&#39;t. The first half of the distance starts with low velocity and ends at vmax. This means that the duration spent at high gravitation is far longer than the duration spent nearer micro gravitation. Loads of acceleration. Then, however the second half of the distance starts with vmax at low gravitation, far less TIME spent there than before, then the vessel is still at quite high velocity when entering the high gravitational effect nearer the surface, and spends less TIME in that effect. If anyone has trouble understanding this please familiarise yourself with the gravitational slingshot. Decades ago engineers used it to make the Voyager probes the fastest machines ever made. So actually you&#39;d fly out of the other side and probably (not sure) break away from the atmosphere, then slowly get attracted back, but at extremely high altitude.

BUT if the object inside the sphere does have mass, then it attracts towards itself the closest side of the spherical shell.", "comment_date": "2021-10-08T18:49:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frank DiMeglio", "comment_text": "What if you understood physics ?!!?<br>THE CLEAR, TOP DOWN, SIMPLE, AND BALANCED MATHEMATICAL PROOF OF THE FACT THAT E=MC2 IS F=MA:<br><br><br>E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM ENERGY IS GRAVITY !!! Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !!! INSTANTANEITY is thus fundamental to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma IN BALANCE; AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. THE SUN AND what is THE EARTH/ground are E=MC2 AND F=ma IN BALANCE. TIME DILATION ultimately proves ON BALANCE that E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. CAREFULLY consider what is THE EYE.) Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !!! (THEREFORE, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution.) &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity !!! Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. (&quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=MC2 IS F=ma. Carefully consider what is THE EYE.) Objects (AND what is the FALLING MAN) fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Again, carefully consider that the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky !!! (Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. SO, carefully consider what are the ORANGE SUN AND the fully illuminated and setting MOON ! Both are the size of THE EYE. Think LAVA !!! The Moon is ALSO BLUE on balance. Therefore, E=MC2 IS F=ma IN BALANCE !! It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense !!! Carefully consider THE MAN who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground !!! Great !!!

That&#39;s impossible. Depending on your position inside the hollow earth, the strength of gravity will be different. So if you are on the inner surface, you will be pulled towards the inner surface as the pull of gravity is stronger towards the surface below you compared to the surface above you which is 7100 km away. Only at the exact center of earth you will experience zero gravity because you are being pulled evenly from all sides at the exact center of earth. Deviate from the center of earth and you slowly begin to fall towards the inner surface as gravitational pull becomes more and more uneven in strength. That pull of gravity away from the center of earth towards the shell naturally creates a huge cavity inside all planets making them naturally formed hollow. Its that simple.

Then due to Inertia of ur motion you will pass to the other side of the tunnel and a decelerating force will act on you which will bring your speed to 0 but accelerating force will b maximum depending on how far in the tunnel you travelled to the other side.This oscillatory motion will continue till you will settle to the middle of the tunnel at the center of the core due loss of energy because of some gasses would b there in the tunnelOr you may keep on oscillating to and fro for ever if you consider no frictional force 2.

Besides, such a small body could never be a star, sooner a &quot;black hole&quot;, and then we would weigh far more on Earth surface than we do. If yet a star, it would burn the inner surface of the shell glowing hot - you would evaporize there, so there&#39;s no Agartha.\u00a0 Newton&#39;s gravity law also says that a gravitational field has a point center and that it behaves as if all the source mass is concentrated in that point. Anyone who says that is wrong, is stupid! Those who are not stupid understand that no matter what&#39;s inside Earth, the force of gravity always points towards the center. There thus cannot be an inversed gravity on the inside of a massive shell.

Traveling though a hole drilled other than at the poles, yes you would have to contend with the Coriolis effect of but angle of attack when you hit the wall as you travel would be so shallow as to cause the traveling body to essentially skid off the side of the wall surface during decent with about much the same way as sliding on a bowling alley floor. The cannon ball down the mile deep bore hole would have experienced the same effect as to continue to the bottom unless acted upon by an alternate force, it would have hit bottom. Oh, and the material comprising the wall will no doubt be rock and that becoming more dense with depth.\u00a0<br><br>It would have of course also reached a terminal velocity, perhaps skidded off the wall a couple times but still and all hit the end of the line. Ya gotta keep in mind that as the ball was dropped it too was traveling at the same velocity as the mouth of the hole. Granted there would be a differential velocity gradient in relation of the falling mass to the tunnel wall over time but NOTHING nearly so forceful as to &#39;stick&#39; it in the wall. A miner loss of acceleration due to terminal velocity plus a spot of \u00a0frictional loss during time of contact with the wall but overall, down ya go.<br><br>If you&#39;re in a closed box car on a train traveling at 80 mph and drop a ball, it bounces up and falls on the same spot at the floor because the ball and the air in the car are \u00a0traveling at 80 mph as well. To simulate the Coriolis effect, let&#39;s open the doors at either end of the car just slightly allowing a mild breeze from one end of the car to the other to cause the ball a slight deviation from it&#39;s 80 mph horizontal velocity (Coriolis) during drop. Now the ball, once dropped won&#39;t hit the same spot but just off a bit in the direction with the air flow. If this were done, say in front of a smooth plate full of small holes to allow air to pass, the ball would then strike and a skid on that plate a short way but only slightly if you get the drift.<br><br>Pole to pole and I&#39;m going to re install air (actually makes a little difference. Ya jump in and begin to accelerate at 32 ft. per second per second until such time as you reach terminal velocity around 180 mph (if memory serves correct) this depending of attitude during fall. Side ways, head, feet first what you are wearing etc. etc. But unlike falling half way through\u00a0toward the other surface, you are falling into a body of much denser mass which mean that all the mass you have passed through still has an attraction and will, over time, begin to slow your decent. You would pass the middle and begin to approach the opposite surface never reaching it as you slow due to loss of energy to gravity and then reverse your decent back toward center.<br><br>After several oscillation of this sort, you then would experience a slowing toward equilateral gravity and a feeling of weightlessness IF our hypotheses about the earths structures are true. I do have questions as to this considering the heavier and lighter masses reaction due to differences caused by centrifugal and centripetal forces during the molten stages of the earths formation. Centrifugal force slings heavier masses out while centripetal force causes lighter masses to migrate toward center of rotation. It this were so, and the earth cooled during that epoch, I see it as not beyond reason the the earth may have at least hollow portions to it&#39;s interior. That and how as the earths magnetic field is largely unexplainable, hey. Who knows for sure? If I&#39;m wrong, please let me know. \u00a0<br><br>Thanx.

We know a few things about the hollow earth from people who have been there (Admiral Byrd, Olaf Jansen, etc...) and that is that there is a central sun or mini star that is at the center of this hollow shell of crust. Not to mention, the polar openings in the north and south poles that these men physically traveled through. Consider these things: a mini sun on the inside ( I really shouldnt be calling it a sun because it is different and only similar in that it gives off light or rather reflects it). So, a mini sun, polar openings and the fact that the earth bulges at the equator and flattens at the poles. Given these (among others) factors we can conclude that the hollow earth can exist and that gravity would not cancel out inside but create a low gravity situation perfect for the growth of trees and animals and people. Where do you think the giants spoken of in the old testament were most likely descended from? If that doesnt float your boat, consider the colored snow of the polar regions that is caused by the pollen of the inner world beings released and being carried out on the polar winds onto the ice. Or the mammoths frozen instantly with food still in their mouths in siberian ice. Atoms, solar systems, galaxies and stars and hollow planets are all expressing the same principles. Even something as simple as an apple shows how our very own food and plants grow taking after the pattern of our planet. Blueberries are a great representation of earth as well with bulging equators and flattened poles. <br><br>Please do the research because there is simply more out there than our tyrannical governments want us to realize.

Can you explain why the field strength/acceleration is stronger nearer the core", "comment_date": "2012-10-13T13:12:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Farfromhere001", "comment_text": "WHO IS THIS OTHER GUY?!", "comment_date": "2012-10-13T00:50:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ToxicityAssured", "comment_text": "&quot;The heat of gravity.&quot;  What are you talking about?!?
