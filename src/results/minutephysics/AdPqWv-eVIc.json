That is just to cover the daily solar variation. To cover one cloudy day you would have to double that storage. <br><br>And you will still need 40% fossil generation for the seasonal variation, no storage available for that. And Hawaii has a very low seasonal variation, in many areas Solar has a ~6:1 ratio summer:winter variation, i.e. Switzerland, Britain, British Columbia, Norway, Germany, Russia with power demand max in winter, and wind is typically missing in action during massive winter cold spells and summer heat spells, solar missing in action during winter cold spells when power demand is max, there is no energy storage that can compensate for those seasonal fluctuations economically. This important fact is ignored in this video. And cost for that one solar/battery system in Hawaii, is $32K per avg kw, for 25yr hopeful lifespan only 6X the cost of a substitute Nuclear power plant @ $5-8k per avg kw for a 60-100yr lifespan. And you still need to pay for the vast fossil infrastructure, pipelines, gas fields, oil fields, coal mines, rail distribution, fossil power plants, military protection etc all fully maintained and operational to cover the minimum 40% seasonal variation (for Hawaii) and one or more days of cloudy weather, volcanic eruption, freak weather, monsoons etc. All you really are doing is replacing a bit of fuel, NG fuel costs 2 cents/kwh in the USA.

Also not considered in this video. That&#39;s why Big Oil just adores Wind &amp; Solar, they know it is no threat to their Energy Hegemony, it just pushes up electricity prices, so marginal oil &amp; gas resources are economical to exploit, and makes EVs less competitive to ICE vehicles.

I had been kidnapped and, when I awoke, I found myself handcuffed to a radiator.  The key for the handcuff had been placed out of my reach on the floor in the middle of the room.  There was also a handkerchief with a one inch thick stick next to the key.  I assume the last two items were there so I could use them as a tourniquet, since... next to me, I found a battery powered reciprocating saw.  After sitting there in bewilderment for several minutes, a voice came over a sound system... I&#39;m not sure from where because I couldn&#39;t see any speakers in the room.  I won&#39;t bore you with those details but, suffice to say, the person on the other end, who had a distinctive lisp and identified himself as a &quot;Sicilian&quot; (even though he had an American accent, without a trace of European) was very persuasive.  He told me that, if I didn&#39;t make the decision to hack off my own hand pretty soon... &quot;death was on the line&quot;.  I had no idea what that would entail but I got the impression that it was a bad idea to attempt to find out.  I was obviously dealing with a very dangerous character.<br><br>So, taking the reciprocating saw in hand and steeling my nerve, I began the gruesome work of detaching my left hand.  The pain was indescribable... to be honest, I don&#39;t know how I kept myself from passing out.  Then, with half the job left to go... the saw suddenly began slowing.  I thought, &quot;Perhaps it&#39;s  getting stuck&quot; and tried to reposition it but... it was the battery.  Someone (possibly the &quot;Sicilian&#39;s&quot; henchman, or henchmen?) had forgotten to recharge it.  However,  I never found out the answer to that question because, when I tried calling out to the Sicilian to discover whether he had another battery or possibly an outlet where I could plug in the tool directly, I was met only with silence.  I never heard from the Sicilian ever again.  Several hours later, the police broke in and I was rescued.  I had managed to staunch the bleeding with my own t-shirt until then.  With reconstructive surgery, they were able to save my hand (I only have partial paralysis in my pinky and ring finger).  The police never were able to find out what had caused the Sicilian to leave so suddenly.  In fact, their theory is that he may have left even before I discovered the battery problem.  They were only able to find a single clue... a note with the word: &quot;Buttercup&quot;.  They have no idea what it could mean.", "comment_date": "2017-08-09T18:31:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ant Cram", "comment_text": "Why weren&#39;t my chemistry lessons like this damn it", "comment_date": "2017-08-09T18:27:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cat Scaz", "comment_text": "what about the fact that they can&#39;t be recycled", "comment_date": "2017-08-09T18:10:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen E", "comment_text": "Borons.  ;-).

Its more of marketing material that true to form. There is a few issues. One of them is that some of the new 18650 cells are really not 18650 but really svollen up 18650. Its quite common to make use of smaler number historicly to make it seams the the development is faster than it is.<br><br>Also there is other issues. Most of the new high capacity batteries thin down on conductors, so they get very hot on high load, and there for decrease life expectancy. There is also the introduction of LCA that bumped the development a bit in the late 00-tys.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdPqWv-eVIc&amp;t=0m46s\">0:46</a> that is not really accurate. Good cells had a power density of about 160wh/kg in the (early) 90-tys. The best secondary cells available today have a power density of about 240-250wh/kg. That is not double, and not really close.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdPqWv-eVIc&amp;t=2m40s\">2:40</a> That cobolt and other additive is dead weight is not really true, not even in a electrical standpoint. For example LCA batteries have Aluminum added to increase the amount of ions that can be abosrbets, pretty much increasing the capacity.,<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdPqWv-eVIc&amp;t=2m50s\">2:50</a> the limit of about half (that would be about accurate) is a theoretical limit. It don\u00b4t include any of the support materials. Thinning them down is of cause possible, but that decrease the other performance factors of the batteries, as for charges speed and longevity. If you just want to be able to charge the battery 10 times and you may charge it in 24 hours.. then yea, you can push quite close to 350-400wh/kg, but it would be a horrible dangerous battery.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdPqWv-eVIc&amp;t=3m04s\">3:04</a> No not really the galvaning voltage of a Li-S battery is lower so the diffrance is not that big.. while its is higher density, the diffrance is rather less than half. Also, Li-S need more additives to work as rechrgable batteries. One issue with Li-S battery is that they break down after first discharge, making them less suitable for charging. more additives are needed to make them stable. Because Li-S have lower voltage, that gives it a additive penalty of about 20% to Li-Ion<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdPqWv-eVIc&amp;t=3m14s\">3:14</a> Li-O batteries is pretty much a scam. The issue is that its pretty much impossible to make it conduct, needing conduction materials that brings the weight up to more than a normal lithium battery.<br><br>Also Li-O batteries is not possible to roll, pretty much making it impossible to have any reasonable usage for it (as a rechargable battery)<br><br>Also, the charging precidure is pretty much impossible for a built in device. Having them as primary cells of cause work, but then you kind of loses the point with it. Primary oxygen battery exist and have so for quite some time<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdPqWv-eVIc&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a> While i don\u00b4t dissaagree with the general principle, its really no point in combining batteries with capacitors other then for very very heavy use machinery. Using combination of two types of batteries makes more sense.<br><br>Lithium-S have been on the market for 30 years now. They hardly developed what so ever, and there been quite a hard push to make them commercially viable. 30 years of development have yealded nearly no result what so ever.<br><br>LCA batteries are pretty much hit there practical limit.
