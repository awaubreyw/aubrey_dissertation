The first creatures to ever reach land most likely laid eggs, so the simple answer is: the egg.<br>However, why would someone even ask such an obvious question? If the answer really was this easy, how did this question ever reach its current popularity and why is it often used synonymously for an unsolvable dilemma?<br>It should be made clear that the term &#39;egg&#39; is not used in the broad sense here, but should be narrowed down to only refer to an egg from an actual chicken. So the question becomes, in short form; &#39;the chicken, or the chicken&#39;s egg?&#39;.<br>Now it should also become clear that this question is not that easy, and we could go about looking at evolutionary reasons for why this question is hard, but let&#39;s look at it differently first. The problem this question poses is one of definition, namely; what is a chicken&#39;s egg? Is it an egg which hatches a chicken, or is it an egg laid by a chicken? Hence why this question is used to refer to dilemmas, and mainly used in discussions regarding the problems of definition. Looking at it this way, the question has no right answer, because it&#39;s simply dependent on how you choose to define the egg. It is a dilemma exactly because both answers are right, but it&#39;s nearly impossible to argue for one or the other, making each answer not only right but both choices also equally ineffective. Neither answer truly answers the question, but provides an answer just for the sake of answering. It&#39;s a trivial question, and not one of the answers is more true than the other.<br>But some people will most likely still desire an evolutionary answer, and I can tell them they&#39;re out of luck. Even if there were a clear border between the chicken&#39;s ancestor and the chicken, the same problem of definition remains. Is it the egg that is laid by the chicken&#39;s ancestor and hatches the chicken, or the egg laid by the first chicken which should count as the first chicken&#39;s egg? But not only that, the clear line this evolutionary approach requires in order to answer the question is non-existent. There is no point at which the chicken&#39;s ancestor laid an egg and suddenly hatched a creature significantly different to be called a different species. Evolution is a gradual process and the difference between species can only be measured over greater time-intervals, not over the course of 1 generation. It&#39;s like measuring one&#39;s age, when you turn 21 you&#39;re not all of the sudden 1 year older than the day before. You&#39;re just 1 day older, just like every day, but after a year there&#39;s enough difference to note that you are indeed 1 year older than the year before. There&#39;s however not a single day that year which you could point at and say that was the specific day when you turned from 20 to 21. Same goes for the chickens, there&#39;s a point where we can say that chickens were different enough from their ancestors, who lived thousands of years before, that they have indeed become a different species. There&#39;s not however a single generation which existed at some point within those thousands of years which we can point at and say, &#39;this is when they turned into chickens&#39;.<br><br>And hopefully anyone who reads this will never ask this question ever again...

It, of course, is an extremely useful branch of philosophy. After all we wouldn&#39;t have computers or the internet without it. However, it is still just one branch. It feels like many people who claim to be &quot;scientists&quot; also say that they see no value in philosophy because it is speculative, while seeing value in Science as though it is a separate subject from philosophy. Nowadays the rest of philosophy is all but an unknown subject in modern classrooms compared to science.
