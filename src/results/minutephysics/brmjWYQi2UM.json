When a star goes supernova, the force of gravity compresses the core beyond the strength of nuclear forces causing all the fermions to stop pushing outwards and collapse into a superdense object. This collapse releases so much gravitational potential energy that it heats up this material, and releases an insane amount of energy literally blowing the everything outside the collapsing region into space. <br><br>The correct statement would be that the gravitational forces and pressure inside a star cause a black hole to form releasing enough energy to make the star go supernova.<br><br>That said, I loved this video, and I appreciate what you do.

FACT: Mass and Energy are equivalent. FACT: Gravitation is equivalent to Acceleration. FACT: The Lorentz Factors apply equally to Special Relativity and General Relativity. That means that just as it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate a mass to the velocity of light, it would take an infinite amount of force or mass to compress a mass to its Schwarzschild radius where the velocity of light cannot escape. FACT: at the Schwarzschild radius, the Lorentz Factors of both 0 time dilation and total length contraction must occur. This means that all motion or quantum activity in a mass must come to a stop and that its 3rd dimension must disappear leaving a physically\u00a0impossible two dimensional sphere through which nothing would be able to fall. This fact is revealed in the Schwarzschild coordinate system used by Karl Schwarzschild but is blatantly ignored in the Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate system that arbitrarily assigns all but one of the Lorentz Factors to occur at a singularity while retaining the 0 time dilation at the Schwarzschild radius. Not only is such a singularity an impossibility as shown by the Hawking-Penrose theorem, but the\u00a0factor of\u00a0time dilation is a direct consequence of the\u00a0factor of\u00a0length contraction. You can&#39;t have one without the other. Either 0 time and 0 length both occur at the Schwarzschild radius or 0 time and 0 length both occur at the singularity. In either case, it is a physical impossibility. The infinite amount of mass/energy required by the Lorentz Factors is a direct consequence of the Uncertainty Principle that reveals that localizing a quantum particle requires infinite energy to counter the particle&#39;s infinite momentum to result. It is this Zero Point Energy that ultimately prohibits complete time dilation/length contraction and therefore prohibits the existence of a black hole. So then, what are the objects that are being misidentified as being black holes? They are quark stars: highly dense quark matter cores surrounded by dense gluon fields. Unlike supposed black holes, quark stars can produce gravitational waves since gravitational waves are produced from the edge of a volume of mass and such an edge for supposed black holes would be within the event horizon from which nothing with the velocity of light can escape.", "comment_date": "2018-02-03T18:57:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "C\u00edan Mattern", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brmjWYQi2UM&amp;t=2m24s\">2:24</a> skip foreword 10 seconds 2 times and every time you do he says \u201cschwarzschild\u201d", "comment_date": "2018-02-03T15:38:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zhongyuan chen", "comment_text": "Does it mean the more mass you have for an object, the less dense you need the object to be compressed in order to form a black hole? \u00a0Does it mean the biger black holes are less dense wheras the smaller black holes are denser?

So does this mean that because black holes exist, there must be other anomalies that are its opposite? This brings me White Holes. So white holes are only but theoretical right. However, if a black hole absorbs and nothing can escape it&#39;s event horizon , then that means that nothing can enter the event horizon of a white hole and rather than absorbing it releases matter. So what it what the Big Bang just was a black hole that consumed all matter(if this is possible) then once it consumed all and it had nothing left to consume it started to consume it&#39;s self and became unstable. This instability lead it to collapse and start releasing mass, becoming a &quot;white hole&quot;. This white hole being called the &quot;Big Bang&quot;. So the universe is just a process of black holes consuming everything then becoming unstable and turning into a white hole.", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T01:22:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamie Jayasundera", "comment_text": "Boring", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T00:20:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "auricom24", "comment_text": "How to decompress?   <br>Wow. a how-to-make-your-own-BH tutorial.

I believe what you meant to say was that they are very dense objects, but even this is not true.  In fact, thinking about black holes as &quot;objects&quot; sets people up for profound misunderstanding - but more on that in a sec. <br>   We on Earth are very very far from the closest black hole, and from our perspective, black holes behave as if they are very dense objects most of the time.  This is because we can only observe other objects as they interact with the black holes from afar.<br>  Some black holes have relatively low density.  As you can demonstrate with your calculations, what determines whether or not a black hole forms is whether or not the Schwarzchild radius would be contained within the circumference of a spherical object of equal mass.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brmjWYQi2UM&amp;t=0m57s\">0:57</a>  Black holes are NOT objects that are &quot;so dense that not even light can escape&quot;.  People need to stop saying this, please.  First of all, density is not the determining factor.  It is the relationship between mass and the Schwarzchild radius that is the factor that determines whether a black hole has formed, as mentioned above.  Secondly, black holes appear black because the gravitational time dilation that occurs in their vicinity shifts the frequency of light from all objects in their vicinity towards the infra-red end of the spectrum.  The light waves become longer and are therefore red-shifted into invisibility.  This is why they look black - not because light is trying to escape, but can&#39;t.  Thirdly, from our perspective, and the perspective of any observer (or particle) OUTSIDE of the black hole, no object, particle, or anything has EVER entered the black hole.  Ever.  This includes light.  Therefore to say that &quot;not even light can escape&quot; ignores the fact that no light has ever even entered any black hole.  Nothing has ever entered a black hole.  A black hole is not an object - so much as it is a collection of all of the events that occur for observers that entered, but will never occur for us.  A black hole cannot be said to be massive, because remember, no matter has ever entered.  No anything has ever entered.  A black hole is just what it looks like to us when entire events cannot be said to ever take place for us.  The &quot;event horizon&quot; is the collection of the LAST events that ever be said to have occurred for any observers outside the black hole.<br><br>Gabe at PBS Spacetime did a way better job than I ever could of explaining these misconceptions.

For example when I view the night sky I don&#39;t see a solid black or dark blue, I see what starts out as soft shade of red blend into purple, which blends into indigo before blue then the black of space.
