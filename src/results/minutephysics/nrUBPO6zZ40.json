Looking at a bigger picture, we know that water is composed of water molecules (hydrogen monoxide), right? Knowing that water molecules are made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, we can assume that if one Brownian particle were to be placed in a container filled with only water and the other to be put in a container filled with only hydrogen, then theoretically speaking the Brownian particle in the water container should show more movement, since the molecules in the water containers have more mass and therefore have more force to inflict upon the Brownian particle. Of course, measuring the mass of an atom based on the movement of a Brownian particle has a high margin of error due to temperature differences, the size and mass of the Brownian particle, the angle at which it the Brownian particle is being hit, (etc.); however in the future I believe that calculating the mass of Brownian particles using this method will be possible, which is why I think Einstein wasn&#39;t that crazy for thinking that we can calculate masses using this method. Unfortunately, for now this method isn&#39;t very useful for calculating the exact mass of atoms. The only thing it can do that&#39;s really important is that it gives us an idea of the atom/molecule&#39;s mass and it gives us more indirect evidence that atoms exist.", "comment_date": "2020-12-17T06:19:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Juan Villagomez", "comment_text": "fun fact everyone has at least 200 atoms inside them from Albert Einstein", "comment_date": "2020-10-31T01:05:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hidde Scherphof", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrUBPO6zZ40&amp;t=00m15s\">00:15</a> in particlelular?", "comment_date": "2020-09-25T11:32:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "boRegah", "comment_text": "You are the uncrowned king of puns.", "comment_date": "2020-08-10T18:35:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dogvader9000", "comment_text": "sometime could you make a video and maybe a minute lab about how instruments work?", "comment_date": "2020-08-02T17:50:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tristan M\u00f6ller", "comment_text": "Ok so how\u2019d he do it?", "comment_date": "2020-02-04T08:41:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D", "comment_text": "Ah, nostalgia,  back when minute physics videos were a minute long... \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2019-08-11T10:38:18Z", "likes_count": 130}, {"comment_by": "Ken Behrendt", "comment_text": "If Einstein had not managed to very approximately calculate the size of a water molecule, eventually we would have developed electron microscopes and been able to directly measure the sizes of various molecules.", "comment_date": "2019-05-30T16:11:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henry G.", "comment_text": "He had to write thumbs up for penquins.", "comment_date": "2018-12-20T04:01:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lana Navan", "comment_text": "Unless you believe theories, no nukes", "comment_date": "2018-11-21T03:12:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trey Guinn", "comment_text": "this type of stuff fascinates me so much! love it.... definately gonna go back to school!", "comment_date": "2018-07-22T20:03:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aadharsh Ram", "comment_text": "To calculate Brownian motion you use a Lagrangian right", "comment_date": "2018-03-21T11:42:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Henry G.", "comment_text": "136 people missed the like button.", "comment_date": "2018-03-01T14:04:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jason gonos", "comment_text": "Slow down the voice to show people...", "comment_date": "2018-02-15T05:04:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ginny Jolly", "comment_text": "Measuring the size of a penguin by looking at how icebergs jiggle:<br><br>Well, that&#39;s how we found planets in our solar system.
