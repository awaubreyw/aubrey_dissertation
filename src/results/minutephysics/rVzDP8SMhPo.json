The normal view is physical contraction when it is really a scale change. Yes, the Lorentz factor gives the scale for the parameters of space and time (both in the same way). So, the traveling through time (passage of time) is the same for all reference frames, what changes are the scale factor of each one; that is the reason why in the twin paradox both brothers can meet in time after the event, they can be together in time. It also explains why the 2.2 microseconds value is at the same time as 220 microseconds. The same happens with the muon, how can two different values describe a physical height? The reason is again the longitudinal scale of one is different from the other meanwhile both travel through the same space. That is why the 4th longitudinal dimension is Lambda (Ct) of the energy involved, the 3D values in x-y-z need the complementary information of the energy to be fully known. In your explanation, the 50 km is equal to 500 m because of the scale each one is involved... The space is not contracted (only scale contacted) as many people draw a smash spaceship at relativistic speed, that is wrong, the spaceship maintains its longitudinal space, just its scale is changed and give a reduced value. Now you can understand that train in the tunnel paradox, the train doesn&#39;t reduce its space occupied, its value is only changed. This 4th longitudinal dimension can be clearly seen in Poincare&#39;s invariance, just take it to the smallest interval so the length involved is in order of atoms, or quantum dimensions; so it will be: Delta x^2 + Delta y^2 + Delta z^2 + Delta (iCt)^2 = invariant or (Delta x^2 + Delta y^2 + Delta z^2) + constant = Delta (iCt)^2 = Delta (iLambda)^2. [scaled space at one side and energy at the other side as Einstein&#39;s great GTR equation] The very useful Minkowski diagrams are referred to events (where and when) and analyze simultaneity and information availability (light cone limit). Minkowski&#39;s 4 dimensions mislead because it mixes a longitudinal one with a temporal one when Ct is taken as t alone; this is not the 4th longitudinal dimension! The Lambda is the one and the Lorentz factor gives the scale in which space and time are interacting.

My initial guess is that they are formed close to detection,  what we think as particles are manifolds, they are electrons caught in manifold loops which twist the fabric of spacetime and this formation of matter is caused by curvature, that is where a wave of energy hitting curvature is twisted into a vortex(electron) the angle it hits and the level of spacetime dilation determines which manifold shape it will take, most dont take any shape but I&#39;m talking about those that do.

One very \u201cscientific\u201d \ud83d\udce1\ud83d\udd2d\ud83c\udf9b method is to send a light signal between the two objects and then measure the time lapse between sending and receiving of the signal \ud83d\udd26 \u23f1 then knowing the speed of light [ we could use turtles \ud83d\udc22 but their speed is too variable to be very accurate ] we can easily calculate the distance. [d = ct].  In our normal lives most of us never do this, instead we use nice, rigid, easy to understand rulers \ud83d\udccf  [No, not you!\ud83e\udd34\ud83c\udffb] and this feels intuitively reasonable because we live in a world of seemingly \u201erigid\u201c objects and don\u2018t ever ask ourselves: \u201eWhat does it mean to be rigid in the first place?\u201c.  Well, the rigidity of a ruler, or any other mechanical measuring device, comes from the bonds between its atoms and these bonds, and therefore the distances maintained between the atoms, come from the fact that atoms are constantly measuring the distance between themselves by throwing photons [particles of light] back and forth \ud83e\udd39\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd39\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 they are doing the \u201clight-beam\u201d experiment for us!
