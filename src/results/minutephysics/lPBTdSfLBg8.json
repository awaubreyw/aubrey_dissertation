I have no problem with it, you are not selling out or what have you for accepting money for promoting something you believe in.<br>But... you did state that you believe that better energy generation is the key to the future( paraphrasing), all well and good, I think that it is laudable. But there are many public groups that are doing this kind of research, and while they may be hoping for financial compensation, their aim is for the results to be widely available so to allow this technique to be used in the wider scope of solar panel production. This company, however, is a private concern that seeks to hold private patents on this technology. Meaning that even if they get every dollar they need to not go under, therefore loosing all money invested leaving no results at all, the success of their work will be a held technique that will not be available to other for use(without paying royalties) so your hope/wish/desire for better, broader cheap and clean energy generation is not fulfilled by this, instead the creation of an monopoly.<br>Don&#39;t get me wrong. Private companies can do good, have the money and resources to advance the fields in which the research. And they deserve the rewards for the effort and cost they invest with their own money and time. But if given a choice of giving money from the public to fund research in such fields between a private company that will hold onto any and all discoveries and a public research group that will release the findings and techniques to be used at large and in a wider public manner, then the concern that allows for a broader application that can benefit more ppl and change the industry as a whole and therefore actually impact the manufacturing of solar panels in a more global sense, is the better option.<br>Sorry for the rant. Long to short - giving my money to a company to develop a technology that they will keep and use for their own, and make themselves more money for the self, over giving my money to a group that will develop the technology to release for use in the whole field at large, I personally believe that the more ppl who can use the technologies equals better for us all.", "comment_date": "2017-11-02T23:26:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Laloweed", "comment_text": "Why disable comments on your most recent video??", "comment_date": "2017-10-31T22:57:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brian Collins", "comment_text": "Question: if sheets of carbon are roughly crystalline lattices, can the same technology be used to separate sheets of graphene from a block?", "comment_date": "2017-10-31T17:10:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Dawkins", "comment_text": "for all the hate in the comments there are surprisingly few disliked on this vid", "comment_date": "2017-10-30T15:30:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atilio Viv\u00e9rn", "comment_text": "Simply amazing!", "comment_date": "2017-10-28T13:21:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sid da kid", "comment_text": "Lets use the particle accelerator to make solar panels to power itself", "comment_date": "2017-10-22T01:42:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Marcus Manifests Beyond Gravity", "comment_text": "Cut or peel.

In evaluating the company and an investment in the shares, careful consideration should be given to the following risk factors, in addition to the other information included in this Offering Circular. Each of these risk factors could materially adversely affect Rayton Solar\u2019s business, operating results or financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in the company\u2019s shares. The following is a summary of the most significant factors that make this offering speculative or substantially risky. The company is still subject to all the same risks that all companies in its industry, and all companies in the economy, are exposed to. These include risks relating to economic downturns, political and economic events and technological developments (such as cyber-security). Additionally, early-stage companies are inherently more risky than more developed companies. You should consider general risks as well as specific risks when deciding whether to invest.<br> <br>The company has realized significant operating losses to date and expects to incur losses in the future.<br> <br>The company has operated at a loss since inception, and these losses are likely to continue. Rayton Solar\u2019s net loss for 2015 was $725,762.

Because losses will continue until such time that the company can procure equipment and complete development of its manufacturing technology and because the company has no committed source of financing, the company relies on financing to support its operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued.<br> <br>Throughout 2016, the company intends to fund its operations through the sale of its securities to third parties and related parties. If the company cannot raise additional capital, it may consume all the cash reserved for operations. There are no assurances that management will be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to the company. If the company is unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital, it may be required to reduce the scope of its planned operations, which could harm the business, financial condition and operating results.
