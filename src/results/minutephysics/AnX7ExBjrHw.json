Then how do we measure speed at all? I mean, if for instance, Earth is the dead center of the universe. The Sun is then traveling around it at 1 cycle a year but the other planets aren&#39;t traveling around the Earth. So, what would you relate their speeds to? Would they be speeding up as the planets move away and slowing down as they get closer, because from our perspective we wouldn&#39;t be seeing them at the same speed. This, I understand, is the whole reason calculus exists. So, I know I am over simplifying the issue and probably misunderstanding something crucial.<br><br>For instance, if the universe (meaning whatever space/time we are sitting in) is traveling at 1 trillion mph in a single direction, then we go backwards into that direction at the same speed, wouldn&#39;t we be stopping? So, if we are going backwards into space at that stopping speed, would special relativity kick in and cause us to experience time dilation, or would there not be any effect at all, since we are technically losing speed.<br><br>or is space/time affixed in such a way that empty space is just a consistent thing that doesn&#39;t have the properties I&#39;m giving it, but if that&#39;s the case, what about if it were in relation to the galactic spin. So, that instead of us moving with our arm of the Milky Way, we &quot;stop&quot; in relation to it? Which would require us moving at enormous speeds relative to it.<br><br>I hope I explained that well, anyways, thanks for your time whoever reads this.", "comment_date": "2014-07-25T07:13:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "marycircle104", "comment_text": "If two particles are entangled does it require twice as much energy to move one?
