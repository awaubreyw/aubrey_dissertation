That suggests that long ago things were moving faster, and the closer your get to our time the slower they are moving.  This would suggest they are slowing down... ((OR)), another way to look at this.... Think of an explosion.. some particles move extremely fast and they become the outer part of the blast. Those are the galaxies we are seeing at the edge of the universe. Those particles inherited most of the energy from the expansion (big bang).. Of course they would be moving faster, how the hell do you think they got out at that distance from the center of the blast BEFORE we arrived at OUR location somewhere in the center? They&#39;d have to be Crusing at an extreme speed from the very start, they have less gravitational effects on them from the rest of the mass since they are so far away, they&#39;ll take even longer to slow down..

We can prove this.  Now we ask why (is it accelerating)?  We see the constants (laws) all around us.  They have always been around us.  Remember the apple that fell from the tree?  The apple, started at zero speed/velocity.  Once released, it went from a state of 0 (speed), to an accelerating rate until acted upon by an outside force (the ground, which was relatively stationary).  Nature.  Law.  An object (the apple) accelerated from &quot;zero state&quot;.  Why?

Let&#39;s look &quot;beyond our vision&quot; (visible eye).  What happened to the apple... is exactly why the universe is expanding at an increasing rate.  THERE IS MORE MASS OUTSIDE OF THE VISIBLE UNIVERSE THAN what is visible within.   That is why the extremeties of the universe are expanding faster than the center.

Recall we once believed the sun revolved around the earth.  We also believed the world was flat.  Then we thought that the Milky Way was the only galaxy.  We have expanded our awareness through science, technology, exploration.  Next venture!?

This could be considered to be the theoretical center of the universe. The closer an object is to this center of mass, the more likely it is to be pulled towards it via gravity of other nearby objects, and it&#39;s likely that there is already an inconceivably huge mass accumulating in this area, because of subsequent collisions. The further away an object gets from this center of mass, and/or massive object, the less the attraction affects them. The thing is, because of the scale of the universe, this gravitational pull is super weak, so any acceleration towards it is negligible, especially the further out you go (and it could be assumed that we, on Earth, are in the further reaches, rather than closer. The theoretical center might not even be close to our observable universe). However, acceleration is still there.<br><br>Think of it like this. You drop marbles from 500 meters above Earth, 1 kilometer, 1.5 kilometers, etc. If you measure relative distance to the other marbles, with one of the marbles as the reference point, they all appear to be moving away from each other (i.e, the marbles further from <b>and</b> closer to Earth than the reference marble will appear to be expanding away from the reference marble, no matter which one is the reference marble). But they&#39;re not. They&#39;re all falling towards Earth, except the ones closest to Earth accelerate faster.

But in a comment to a friend recently, I noted the difference between the texture and behavior of water boiled on a stove and water boiled in a microwave.  Water boiled on a the stove has a unilateral heat-source that heats the water in such a way that the bubbles attempt to escape in a particular direction (notably, in a direction <b>opposite</b> the heat source).  Water heated in a microwave <b>seems</b> to heat in a way that is expanding in every direction outward from <b>itself</b>.  I know this premise isn&#39;t 100% sound, but that&#39;s the impression I get.  <br><br>When you drop a tea-bag into kettle that was boiled and removed from the heat-source, the tea-bag generally floats briefly but produces eddies of osmosis as the tannins leach into the liquid.   <br><br>When you drop a tea-bag into a mug of water that was boiled in a microwave, the tea-bag very often still floats, but produces a sort of scum on the surface of the cup that is &quot;frothy&quot;. Also, the texture of the tea-water itself feels somehow &quot;less dense&quot;.  Since a microwave heats water not from a single point of origin but from within each molecule of water, it makes sense that the tea should have this (in my opinion un-desireable) sensation on the tongue.  <br><br>IS THE UNIVERSE EXPANDING BECAUSE WE ARE SIMPLY ELEMENTS OF SOUP BEING HEATED IN SOME DEITY&#39;S COSMIC MICROWAVE?", "comment_date": "2017-05-01T05:18:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "_ Maxxx_", "comment_text": "If the universe is expanding at X m/s at time T, then at time T+n a meter is larger than at time T.

When you are looking at a galaxy, lets say 20 million light years away, you are not seeing what it is doing at this exact second, but rather what it\u00a0was doing 20 million years ago, as the speed of light is finite and it takes 20 million years for light to get here from that galaxy, we can only guess what it is doing at this exact moment based on what other galaxies are doing, as described in this video, but for me, guessing what a galaxy is doing isn&#39;t good enough. So, instead of guessing, let&#39;s use what we KNOW instead of what we THINK we know. <br><br>We KNOW that the galaxy 20 million light years away from us is moving away from us at, let&#39;s say 500km/s, so 20 million years ago, it&#39;s relative speed away from us was 500km/s. Then let&#39;s take a galaxy 10 million light years away and we find it was going at, let&#39;s say 300km/s away from us 10\u00a0million years ago. Finally, let&#39;s take a galaxy 30 million light years away from us and we find that it is moving, let&#39;s say 700km/s away from us 30 million years ago. Now, if observed where the Earth is the baseline, then measured out, it would seem that the universe is accelerating as the speeds go up the farther out from Earth you go, HOWEVER, that requires that we assume that the galaxies are still doing now what they were doing 10, 20, and 30 million years ago, and like I said, I don&#39;t like guesses or assumptions, so we need another standard that doesn&#39;t require guessing, and that standard is time. <br><br>We KNOW that the galaxies are 10, 20 and 30 million years away in time and we KNOW their speeds are 300km/s, 500km/s, and 700km/s away from us respectively, so the farther back in time you go, the faster galaxies move away from us, which means that the closer to our time they are, the slower they are going, thus as time continues, galaxies move away slower and slower, thus proving that the expansion of the universe is slowing down.", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T14:47:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ziggy oickle", "comment_text": "&quot;as we look at a galaxy far far away, we see it as it was a long time ago&quot;<br>.....hmmmm &quot;long time ago&quot;&quot;galaxy far far away&quot;", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T14:46:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Galloway", "comment_text": "Felt smart cause I knew this XD", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T14:45:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tijmen van der Ree", "comment_text": "&quot;Actually strimmer, they&#39;re called <i>Supernovae</i> &quot;", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T14:39:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FawkesMD", "comment_text": "if the universe is expending in terms that there is new space, how does it make sense to see things as if they are moving?<br>if a light goes from object A to object B and both objects stand still and there is new space appearing between them that makes the light travel longer, it doesn&#39;t show if there is more new space or less", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T14:38:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adam Maheswara", "comment_text": "that siren shocked me lol", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T14:38:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Temporal Enigma", "comment_text": "He must got through a lot of markers", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T14:36:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ashutosh lakra", "comment_text": "existential crisis", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T14:36:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Akos Sam", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXkBfkeJJ5c&amp;t=1m58s\">1:58</a> you know &quot;my heart will go on&quot; started playing in your head even if you won&#39;t admit it...", "comment_date": "2017-04-26T14:36:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christine Whybrow", "comment_text": "I like the style of this series.

Due to this expansion, the furthest away two objects are, the bigger their time difference is from each other (this time difference can be measured using a linear timeline which starts on the Big Ben), the two objects would be on the past relative to each other, if the other object is in the future relative to the first&#39;s point of view, space would have expanded more to that object. If that&#39;s the case, the closer the light from a distant galaxy gets to us, the closer to our point on this timeline this light also gets, making it travel more space than it would need to if space wasn&#39;t expanding as it gets closer to us. Making it seem even further away as this light would get dimmer due to travelling\u200b a bigger distance.<br><br>  This explanation makes more sense to me and appears to be simpler than having to create an undetectable type of energy. It also includes something that many people disregard when talking about space expansion: Time is a dimension just like any other, if space is expanding, why wouldn&#39;t time? How would this time expansion look like on our universe.
