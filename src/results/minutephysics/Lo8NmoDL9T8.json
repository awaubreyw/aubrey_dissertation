Since the force of repulsion is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.<br><br> And since gravity is an acceleration.<br>    Whether it is caused by a space-time deformation (R\u03bcv-1 / 2Rg\u03bcv = (8piG / c ^ 4) * T\u03bcv) or if it is an attraction exerted by the earth on matter (F = G * m * M / r ^ 2) where this behavior of antimatter does not contradict the theory of Einstein or Newton.<br>   Where for very small speeds compared to the speed of light, like those in our ordinary world, the relatisistic force becomes.<br>    F = m a / \u221a (1-v2 / c2) = F = m a<br> And where a is gravity<br>   Again we see that Einstein&#39;s physics is not a break with Newton&#39;s, but a continuation of it where force, acceleration and mass differ at speeds close to that of light.<br><br> It would do it the reverse of magnetism, where poles of the same sign repel and attract different signs, where in a mass (m) a magnetic field is created due to the movement of the electrons that contain the atoms that<br> they have a &quot;spin&quot;, or direction in which they rotate and that determines that it has a north pole and a south pole.<br><br> And the inverse of the electric potential where electric charges of the same sign repel and of the opposite sign attract.  But similarly, if two electric charges of different signs come together, a circuit breaker occurs, this is due to a potential difference (a difference of an excess of electrons in the negative cable and a shortage in the positive cable) because the charged materials they tend to regain their equilibrium state, and to achieve this the atoms need to recover or give up electrons to regain their neutral charge.", "comment_date": "2021-12-15T16:16:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ed Kolis", "comment_text": "Do positrons have goatees, like mirror Spock?", "comment_date": "2021-12-12T01:52:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaac John", "comment_text": "Could the reason there is more matter than antimatter be similar to the reason why all planets orbit in the same direction in our solar system??

The energy of sunlight is far below the one of within the nucleus of an atom. Therefore those discovered positrons must come from those electron-shell rather than the nucleus. Since only negatively charged particles are within the electron-shell therefore positrons are also negatively charged particles\u00a0 like those electrons except they have opposite intrinsic spin direction than the one of electrons therefore they have opposite magnetic configuration than the one of electrons. Einstein&#39;s famous equation, E=mc^2 is wrong otherwise garbage also can be used to make nuclear bombs as long as it is matter or it has mass. Energy and matter can&#39;t interchange one another according to Einstein&#39;s famous equation. One must have photons before one can emit out photons. Photons are particles and they have mass. All forms of EMWs including light and heat are dynamic photons per volume per time in different saturations.

An electron has a charger of -1.  A proton has a charge of +1.  Yet, in the hydrogen atom, the electron does not fall in and touch the proton and annihilate the entire system.

Always making false assumptions due to a sheer lack of knowledge in the particular subject you are commenting about. It&#39;s great that you are asking these questions, but please, for the love of god do not ask them in a comment on a youtube video. You will NEVER get the response you&#39;re looking for. Instead, go talk to your nearest teachers, academia professors, professionals in the work field, people with the experience and knowledge to help answer any question you may have. If you can&#39;t do that, then go to professional scientific forums where many PhD/Graduate students and degree holders would be gladly to answer your questions there too.\u00a0<br><br>As a third year Chemistry major, who has a complete love for understanding the world we live in, it pains me to see the only thing people seem to care about are answers to particular questions in which we are unable to answer at this point in time.We are all looking for answers, yes, but at this point in time, we are unable to do so.

Take a water molecule for example. Oxidation states, Chemical bonding, Polarity and Net dipole moments, Molecular geometry and Bond angles, Molecular Orbital diagrams, Hydrogen bonding, Wavefunctions, Phase changes, Triple and Critical points, Orbital density functions, Frontier orbital interactions,Thermal conductivity, Solubility, Entropy, Enthalpy, Amphoterism, Acidity and Basicity are all properties that chemists used to explain the nature of water.<br><br>\u00a0A Biochemist, on the other hand, could tell you how water functions inside the body.\u00a0<br><br>Physicists use Physics and Mathematics (mostly vector calculus and differential equations) to explain the kinematics and dynamics of fluid flow (or the way in which liquids (or water in this case) moves through time and space).\u00a0<br><br>The point is that what people think they may know about something that seems to be common knowledge (such as knowing what water actually is, how it&#39;s important to everyday life, and how describing it&#39;s motion can be used to solve various problems throughout various fields of engineering to help benefit modern day human life) may in fact be actually something they could learn and benefit a lot from.

It has some areas of exitation and anti-exitation on it (add some ripples up and down). At some levels of exitation - the field will present a permament particle that will not go away willingly (add two dashed lines above and below &quot;field&quot; line, crossing some hills and valleys.).<br>The line is in the middle. So if you want to create a wave that will peak as a particle it will also peak as an anti-particle someplace else. You can not have a hew particle without generating a new anti-particle.<br>But let&#39;s imagine what would hapen if the &quot;field&quot; line was not in the middle between &quot;matter&quot; and &quot;antymatter&quot; thresholds, shall we?<br>(Draw another pait of dashed lines and a new &quot;field&quot; line way closer to the upper border, than to the lower one.)<br>What do we see now?<br>Firsty - now we can generate a new particle faving a wave with way less amplitude. And secondly - this smaller wawe will not hit the antiparticle threashold. So we generate a particle without it&#39;s antiparticle counterpart. What will happen with this wave&#39;s downpeack? She correct answer is - it will go on and on travelling this field and affecting all other places. But that is only if we consider a single anti-peak. If we imagine a whole lot of them - they will basicall fill the entile field and work as decreasing the entire field level. Move the &quot;field&quot; line closer to middle, and creating lots of matter particles. without creating many antiparticles (some accidential interferences of many ani-peack might actually result in an aniparticle beint presented for many matter particles even at this state, so I will not tell that none aniparticles are generated)<br>So over time many particles are born. And the more particles are there - the harder it is for new particles to be born. And more likely it is for new ani-particles to be born.<br>And at some point - the field moves to the middle between thresholds and it becomes as hard for a new particle to be born, as it is for a new aniparticle. And we have a present universe. With tons of matter and mere drops of antimatter.<br>Simply because the starting state was not simmetrical.<br><br>How unsimmetrical it was?<br>Well/ This version is but a my assumption, but lets imagine this situaion:<br>(draw pair of threshold lines) The universe is fresh and new. It has nothing in it. Nothing can crate some informality in out field to start any waves. There is nothing to tip the universe into action. So the original state of the universe should be unstable and work as it&#39;s own tipping point. And I can imagine only one way to do this - (Draw the field line exactly at the upper threshold).

Provided that the magnitude order of k is so small, in order to create an electron-positron pair, extremely high temperatures (ridiculously high) are required. So when the Unierse no longer was at that temperature, no more of these interactions took place. In theory, there should be the same amount of matter as of antimatter (we&#39;re talking of 10^(-35) seconds after the supposed Bang. However, as these particles started to decay, antiparticles decayed at a much faster rate. This lead to the particle era (10^(-12) seconds after the Bang) at 10^15 Kelvin.
