Million dollar question (where&#39;s my money!!!) Can we time travel to the past? NO.

Then comes the power to do so... to rearrange all to infinity and beyond... After that and if it would be achievable, the person would go to another version and not to the past, time would have passed too, but always forward, and if the process could be again reversed, it would never come back to the same time, but to somewhere in the future, and even if the world seemed &quot;ok&quot;, it would be just another version, not the same... if anything would be another timeline.

Time is the collection of all events (a literal set of events) and time moves by the changing of events. An event is defined by the position or organisation of everything within the universe, so if you had the past, where you don&#39;t exist, call that event A. You travel back there, YOU ARE NOT TRAVELLING BACK IN TIME BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT IN EVENT A, you are now another event (B) because in this timeframe, you exists in the universe, which means these two events are not identical therefore not the same event therefore you have not travelled to event A and therefore you have not gone back in time. Now currently event B&#39;s matter count = event A + you, which is impossible as event A&#39;s matter count must = event B&#39;s matter count because matter cannot be created or destoryed. Lets say we ignore that, I kinda agree in one of your ideas about the two timelines being entagled, in my opinon, they are not two timelines, it is one timeline, the &quot;timeline&quot; where you kill your grandfather is just the future to the present from which you &quot;travelled back in time&quot; from. Because any event that hasn&#39;t already occured is the future, but we commonly make the mistake of percieving it as the past because one, its similar to the past in ways humans can registered information, two, its hard to see its the future because its impossible to be the future (as in, physically you cannot created event B in any circumstances).

The logic of the paradox does not allow for what you proposed. If you DID go back in time and killed your grandfather, there is no long contrived excuse that would prevent you from immediately vanishing upon his death. Your method relies on a lot of what ifs and assumptions and just clouds over the original premise of the paradox, whilst none can deny the paradox. Example. If your grandfather bought you a car 20 years ago, but you went back in time and blew up the car back then, the car would not exist in the current anymore, nor in that past. Just because we replace car with the grandfather himself, does not alleviate this logical fact. Likewise, if you went back in time to your birth and killed youself once you were delivered, you would NOT continue to exist.

First, blow off that nonsense about another reality by which in one the grandfather is alive and the other he is dead and thus an alternate path...blah, blah, blah. This is nonsense. As for superposition with regard to composite entities, it doesn\u2019t exist. Schroedinger\u2019s thought experiment was formulated to make fun of this idea. Though the Copenhagen school embraced it, even Bohr rejected it. As an example\u2026consider the schroedinger experiment with the cat in the box. Keep the emitter and the radioactive material, the collector, the hammer, but instead of poison in a vile, use acid. This too is poisonous and would kill the cat. Now, and this would not change the experiment, have the vile of acid on a mechanism that when the cat lay down, it would tip over and spill its contents on the floor of the box. So, the collector counts the right number of particles, breaks the vile of acid, the fumes kill the cat, it falls to the floor of the box onto the mechanism, tips the vile of acid which then eats through the bottom of the box. We as observes never have to open the box to see the cat. Instead, we see the acid dripping out and know that a string of objective, deterministic events took place and that the cat is dead and only dead which is why the acid is dripping from the hole it burned in the box. Where is the wave form and its supposedly necessary collapse then? Where is this need for alternative universes and all that nonsense?<br>\r<br>So, there is no alternative time line scenario. If you go back in time and kill your grandfather so you are not born then you cannot go back and kill him so you are born then you go back in time and kill him...etc., I believe this loop would be repeated infinitely which is what makes it impossible. Infinity is impossible in material reality. To illustrate, consider the claims by physicists that the universe is infinite in scope yet who also claim that it expanded from a quantifiable size, i.e., 10 -15 meters to the size of a grapefruit, also quantifiable during inflation and then from there on but slower. What is expansion? It is the progressive increase in number, value or measure by quantifiable increments. So what would that last increase in measure be just before the very next one was infinity? I included this to show clearly that infinity is impossible in material reality, so\u2026this precludes this time loop which (I do believe) would have to be infinite, which it cannot be. \r<br>I think that what would have to happen is that the boy who goes back in time would certainly continue to exist until the very moment he kills his grandfather. Until that moment, there would be no paradox possible.

Probably developing some alternate version of the very technology I invented to kill my grandfather (so, in my timeline, I invented backwards-time travel, and in the alternate timeline, my grandmother invents side-time travel poetic, non?).<br>I&#39;m being a little silly here, but if we&#39;re entertaining what-ifs, I can make time for entertaining sci-fi premises based on thought experiments. :)", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T05:34:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rudrayan Pramanick", "comment_text": "Friend : Well, then is grandfather dead or not?<br>Me : Idk, but my brain is for sure...", "comment_date": "2021-08-21T18:21:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kunal ganotra", "comment_text": "It\u2019s another form of Schrodinger Cat<br>Isn\u2019t it?", "comment_date": "2021-08-20T20:18:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Madden Boseroy", "comment_text": "So...<br><br>Mobius Strip+Closed Timelike Curve (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R47UM8ShioY)+Schrodinger&#39;s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R47UM8ShioY)+Schrodinger&#39;s</a> cat=Grandfather Paradox+its solution", "comment_date": "2021-08-20T18:49:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "FJ25 Official", "comment_text": "Feeling sad for that poor old grandfather\ud83d\udc74\ud83d\ude1e", "comment_date": "2021-08-20T16:30:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kushagra", "comment_text": "But what if you go back in time and you miss then your Grandfather kills you with his bolt action rifle in a deadly family shootout ?", "comment_date": "2021-08-20T07:47:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "relaxing rain", "comment_text": "When your grandfather but your still alive:", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T03:24:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hello its ok \u2022 7000 yr ago", "comment_text": "what if....??<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>people in future went back in time and two of them started living caveman life and reproduce hence , creating themselves<br>i know its against evolution  but who knows may be they gave some sort of drugs to monkeys apes and then send them back in time and the monkeys started evolving and adapt their habitat n all other evolution thing", "comment_date": "2021-08-18T16:33:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spider 141", "comment_text": "The morale : dont kill your grandpa or something idk", "comment_date": "2021-08-18T12:30:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tengku Muliya", "comment_text": "Time travel is impossible.", "comment_date": "2021-08-17T20:57:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pradosh Verlekar", "comment_text": "Well he created the mobius strip that Tony Stark discovers in endgame... that&#39;s why you should watch YouTube", "comment_date": "2021-08-17T07:37:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K\u0336R\u0336I\u0336S\u0336H\u0336Z\u0336 D\u0336A\u0336N\u0336C\u0336E\u0336", "comment_text": "What was that \u2753\u2753\u2753\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T15:29:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Topi Linkala", "comment_text": "I really really like Larry Nivens take on time travel: If there ever is a functional time travel machine and it&#39;s use CAN change the history then the history would change up until it is stable eg.

And mathematics is one of such invention, although it is called as the Queen of Science but still it is incomplete and will remain forever,<br>It is a language that we developed to Codify the world, to understand this world.We say 2+2 = 4, but there is no such thing as 2 or 4 in this universe, it&#39;s just we humans use some symbols and sounds to understand this world.<br>Mathematics is a system upon which we all agree , thus it provides us a Common measuring rod to understand this world. There may be another Civilisation far away, say 10000 billion light years away ,which may have a different system of understanding this universe. In fact all other Sciences are Languages only, like Physics, in which we apply mathematics to understand physical phenomenon, we define a natural phenomenon as Gravity (here we used English and named it) we measured it with an equation (here we used math). Same goes for Chemistry , we named some Liquid as water and measured it in terms of its mass , structure etc.<br>The real question is why ? Science even answer this question but that answer is not eternally valid , it is valid relatively,  Einstein  was the first Genius who understood this, it is because of this understanding he gave theory of Relativity. Science will answer how apple fallen from tree , but why it fallen on that day when Newton was sitting and why only Newton ? You may answer this question by Saying, Apple have been  falling from the  trees from ages but Newton was the first one to observe it, again question arises Why nature chose Newton and Why only through Newton Nature emerged as Laws of Motion. There are many things which we cannot define precisely, there are forces which we don&#39;t understand. <br>Socrates was right &quot;Real wisdom is knowing that we know nothing&quot;<br>It&#39;s just our limited knowledge through which we define our reality.

Imagine that you are using a watch, while you get into the time machine (a black whole, for instance), and you are directed to the past. Your watch is certainly going to keep marking time and will show you that a few hours/mins/seconds have passed. So, you\u2019ll be in your future. But your future will bring you to the past. Now, this is no ordinary past, it\u2019s one where you\u2019re able to identify your grandfather and kill him. In other words, you go to your past, while keeping your consciousness (which can precisely recognize that the error that appears in your watch\u2019s calendar is no artifact, but the reflex of the fact that it was set in another time zone).<br>In your future, entropy has increased. Yet, you went back in time, where entropy is lower. So, you\u2019re violating the 2nd law of thermodynamics. That\u2019s actually not a problem, as the law is not ontological, but probabilistic in its nature.<br>However, in this future that is your past you need a higher level of information, as you need the information that was there in the first place and the information of your consciousness, which allows the identification of your grandfather (and the understanding of the discrepancy between what appears in your calendar and what you\u2019re peers in the past assume to be correct).<br>Where does that the surplus of information comes from in the first place? How can you do...(whatever it is) and add information to a state of the world, without adding anything to it? Impossible to say.<br>That\u2019s why I (and others) would argue that you\u2019re not going back as yourself (with your beliefs/consciousness), which is pretty much as saying that the so called boring hypothesis is not so boring after all.

There are 3 main theories. The first, as mentioned in the video, is that there are alternate timelines in which certain major events in your life happened differently, so going back in time and changing something wouldn\u2019t affect your timeline, but instead it would make a new timeline in which such an event had occurred. An example of this logic being used would be avengers endgame. This means if you go back in time and kill your grandfather, you\u2019ll just be opening up an alternate timeline in which you were never born. However, this timeline would not affect yours at all. The second theory is that it\u2019s a closed loop. This means that while the events do happen in your own timeline, they don\u2019t affect them, since they\u2019re predestined to happen the same way and nothing will change that. This event has occurred many times before and will continue to happen many times over since it\u2019s a loop. An example of this logic being used would be the movie tenet. This would mean that if you went back in time, you might\u2019ve tried to kill your grandfather, but somebody would\u2019ve stopped you, this is because you\u2019re obviously alive up to the point where you\u2019ve went back in time, which means your grandfather hasn\u2019t been killed. This means you\u2019re destined to fail at killing your grandfather, and this event has probably occurred a million times before and will continue to occur a million times more. The final theory is the one most people follow, which is what makes it a paradox. This is the one in which changes to the past will directly have an affect on your timeline. This means that by killing your grandfather you would in fact cease to exist, but in doing so, your grandfather would still be alive. This remains unanswered within the context of this theory.", "comment_date": "2021-05-19T01:07:22Z", "likes_count": 105}, {"comment_by": "CrazyCoolYT", "comment_text": "&quot;One Direction&quot;<br>(Shows picture of One Direction)<br><b>For two frames instead of one...</b>", "comment_date": "2021-05-18T23:59:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harshal", "comment_text": "Basically the Netflix show dark showed this", "comment_date": "2021-05-18T20:54:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aashir Shaikh", "comment_text": "Marvel: multiverse.

It is impossible to kill your biological grandfather in the past, simply because it didn&#39;t happen. We have observed that your grandfather survived, therefor he can&#39;t be killed until your parent was born. In the same way you can&#39;t swim upstream if the current is too strong.

As time occurs differently to different viewers depending on how far away they are in space, then there could theoretically be an opposing universe exactly the same as ours (the universe is infinite so there are infinite variations of everything in the universe). Because of this, you could theoretically go to this separate version of the timeline you exist in and change events there. This would then allow you to in essence &quot;kill your grandfather&quot; without affecting your timeline. He&#39;s still technically your grandfather as your genes align normally showing family lineage. <br><br>Another theory I have is that every action causes a splintering of &#39;time pathways&#39;. Every action causes a split in which an infinite amount of universes with separate outcomes exist, with infinite times where these splits could occur along our perception of time. This causes an infinite amount of infinite outcomes and ensures we can find one timezones that is suitable enough to travel to and change. This would create new splinters along that timeline, thus   leaving the paradox of killing your grandpa. Then go back to my theory above and you have a feasible theory for how time travel could work.

Let&#39;s play out alll the possibilities. In some, Joe succeeds to get rid of Bobba on the first try. In others, he&#39;ll fail again and again.

Assuming the period between your arrival in the past and your departure from the future is in this constant double superstate, in which your grandfather both is and isn\u2019t alive, then what happens going forward from the point in the present from which you left to go to the past? Are there two parallel futures that coexist simultaneously\u2014one in which you exist and one in which you don\u2019t? Because the trouble is, it isn\u2019t that these two universe\u2019s exist at the same time, right? The existence of one universe both causes and NULLIFIES the other. So in my mind, it\u2019s more of an infinitely rapid vibration between two realities. Perhaps functionally there is no difference. But I think it\u2019s an important distinction. <br><br>So that being said, if it keeps rapidly flip-flopping between realities, does the existence of each entire TIMELINE going forward do the same? Is the question of which universe is \u201creal\u201d actually determined by which one exists on some sort of higher dimension? That way, each timeline would be lived through the entire way from the perspective of a three-dimensional creature living within it, but if you were a creature capable of perceiving these higher dimensions, you would see the timeline flickering back and forth between each possibility?<br><br>This is all very confusing. At this point I\u2019m not even sure if what I\u2019m saying is coherent.<br><br>EDIT: Or perhaps the two futures are the same. Perhaps the act of traveling back and causing a paradox itself prevents you from returning. Let\u2019s say you go back and kill your grandfather, and create this strange superstate reality in which your grandfather both dies and does not die. Because your  grandfather dies, you are never born, so you disappear. But then because you disappear, your grandfather never dies, the universe corrects for this, and everything goes back to normal. The timeline plays through with your grandfather alive, you are eventually born, and you decide to go back and kill him. You vanish from the present into the past and then... time continues. By traveling back, you\u2019ve essentially just erased yourself, with no other consequences. And going forward, you\u2019ve basically just vanished into thin air never to be seen again. <br><br>Or perhaps time works like in the Terminator. Perhaps it does still self-correct, but not so drastically as to erase you from existence. Let me explain.<br><br>Depending on how you interpret the film, in The Terminator (the original, that is), Kyle Reese may not be HIS John\u2019s father. That is to say, when John Connor sends Kyle back to the past to protect his mother, to this version of John Connor, yet unaffected by time travel, his father is some other man who died. And Kyle Reese is a random other guy with no connection to him. But then Kyle goes back and the very act of time traveling back and replacing John\u2019s original father MAKES him John\u2019s father. And I doubt Sarah would\u2019ve ever met the man who became John\u2019s father if Skynet had never sent the Terminator back, so the fact that it HAS been sent and has caused a change in causality means she never WILL meet this guy. The universe corrects for this the easiest way it can: using Kyle as a replacement for whoever John\u2019s father would have been. And they explain it all by saying that the future is flexible and not yet set in stone. In other words, the events of the past take precedent over those of the future. If something is changed in the past, the future HAS to change slightly to compensate, but paradoxes can be avoided and general timelines can be maintained.<br><br>So now let\u2019s apply this to the grandfather paradox. I go back and kill my grandfather. This breaks causality, which is obviously paradoxical. But rather than spazzing out, the universe fixes this. Perhaps my grandmother goes on to marry a new man who becomes my grandfather, or has a one-night-stand that could actually have happened in my ORIGINAL, unaltered past. <br><br>There\u2019s another movie that I think fits this type of time travel: Back to the Future. Think about it. Marty accidentally prevents his parents from meeting and begins to disappear. This is a HUGE change to the timeline that the universe can\u2019t outright repair by making changes. So Marty has to fix it himself, but in the process, his parents are changed from how they originally were. But wait a minute\u2014he still shouldn\u2019t exist, because his life differs from the timeline. But instead, the timeline just corrects for the small changes and Marty is allowed to keep existing.", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T22:03:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tojo05x3", "comment_text": "Me after watching Steins; Gate:<br>Amateurs", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T09:10:17Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "PARNOiSA C.B.", "comment_text": "If you like this video pls go the link below and watch my chanel &amp; subscribe it.

Of particle x 2), and rearrangement of this grain of sand into one definite state is 10^-21, which is too small a probability to even consider applying entanglement to a macroscopic particle.", "comment_date": "2020-08-04T05:10:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M.C Ellen", "comment_text": "Case in point to keep from infinite deja vu - don\u2019t go back in time to kill your grandfather", "comment_date": "2020-08-02T22:51:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ayush Kumar", "comment_text": "The beginning is the end and the end is the beginning....\u23f3\u23f3\u23f3", "comment_date": "2020-08-02T18:14:17Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Kalisius Trit", "comment_text": "CHANGING THE PAST DOESNT EFFECT THE FUTURE", "comment_date": "2020-08-02T17:05:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pancreas Channel", "comment_text": "Plot twist you were made in laboratory \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T11:30:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u2605 \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude47\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude47\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude4f", "comment_text": "<b>Well...this theory reminds me of Schr\u00f6dinger cat theory...</b>", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T07:45:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omansh Sharma", "comment_text": "latest research shows tht there is nothing such as butterfly effect<br>.......so cheers!!", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T05:44:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Far_ oppositeflow", "comment_text": "Searching for Okabe rintarou&#39;s comment", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T05:26:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Jin", "comment_text": "As said by Scott Lang: \u201cSo Back to the Future is a load of bullsh*t?\u201d <br><br><br><br><br><br>And dis is for all people that have watched Avengers endgame in 2019", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T22:43:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dark Fun", "comment_text": "Fun fact: in reality there&#39;s no such thing as paradox here&#39;s why what do you need to travel back in time time machine what does time machine do move super fast faster than speed of light which is negative seconds now if you even manage to do move faster than speed of light and everything have been rewind you wouldn&#39;t be able to interact with any thing because you&#39;re still moving faster than the speed of light which means everything you see is just an after images of what already happened and even if you tried to stop moving on the time that you want to go back to everything would just play like a movie and everything would be still just an after image... <br>To be clear if you stop moving you&#39;ll just be returned to the time where you started moving faster than the speed of light", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T11:03:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kaltoum Kaltoum", "comment_text": "This is impossible \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T16:57:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hitech Divyanshu", "comment_text": "Make a time machine plzz i m with u", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T11:57:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rigz Movie Diaries", "comment_text": "I think that if you killed your grandfather when going back in time, time would just stop.

Answer: there were no laws, so time is not required for the universe to start, because that would make it a law. So the universe started without time. An event <b>occurred</b> without time. So your discrepancy is if superposition can be possible within a constant time loop the universe is set in a 3 dimensional state (or 3.5 if you include 4 sets of mass, density and changeable volume etc..) Which is overwriting outside the universe as that is set to the highest possible dimension and if dimensions are infinitely long due to that theres no laws that can occur, meaning superposition of law and information can occur without specified dimension. So superposition is not compatible if it was set outside the indicated area, making this invalid. <br>The answer to the paradox in this case is there is a law preventing super position from existence in time as a law overwrites that created without that law, causing a loop of indux superposition that is always constant and juxadized above the superposition theory.

They travel outside time, it is the only way they can move to the past or future. To accomplish this, they must take a supply of time with them, in their time ship, in much the same way that an astronaut or deep sea diver must take air in tanks with them in order to not die. The time traveler, during the trip, must make choices - such as where to land, or what temporal coordinates to set - and in order to make these choices they must have a personal time line of their own within the ship in order to take action at all.\r<br>\r<br>When a time traveler lands, they merge with the existing timeline of the universe, and no longer need to live off of the stored time within their ship. They can freely take action.\r<br>\r<br>There cannot be a true grandfather paradox.\r<br>\r<br>If a person travels back in time and kills their own grandfather, they cannot erase themselves. They can erase the causal chain that would have brought them into existence, true, but - because they are a time traveler, moving outside of normal time - they are not affected by any such change. When they return to their own original time, and step out of their machine and merge with the universal timeline, they would not fade or vanish. They would not need to be in a parallel universe at all. They simply step out into a world, the same world, where their past no longer exists. They are the only being that has knowledge of the previous worldline of the cosmos, and they are a person who now exists devoid of a provable history.\r<br>\r<br>They had a history, it simply no longer exists.

You travel to the past in a parallel universe and time goes on with you and nothing happens except your grandfather is now dead in that universe. <br>The other option is if you go back to your own universe\u2019s last and kill your grandfather then. Like Schrodinger\u2019s Cat, the universe more or less splits into two simultaneous realities that interconnect with one another creating what I like to call a Passive Loop. <br>A Passive loop is a type of time loop where there is a loop happening, but it is very possible to escape and reality continues. Sure the loop never ends, but you would only experience the loop once and never comprehend the infinite times it does loop. <br>An Active Loop, however, is much more dangerous. This is the kind of loop where you DO experience each iteration and comprehend it all. The most common and well known example of this is Groundhog Day. Escaping these loops is either possible or impossible. If you can alter reality or make different decisions each time, you are technically piling up alternate realities and traveling universes every single time. There are an infinite number of these all exactly the same so there is no fear of running out or using too many. Your timeline forms a sort of spiral going away from the universe you started in. Looking st it from the right angle (in a higher dimension of course, everything would pile up on top of itself and all mesh together. <br>The other option for an active loop is that there is no way to alter reality.

This creates a problem, because it means that the state is only able to exist as long as it stays the same, essentially creating a time loop in which their state is only one possible progression, following the loop.\r<br>\r<br>Here their are 2 possibilities: either the entire universe follows the loop; or the loop will exist in a pocket universe, while the other universe continues as if nothing happened. If it forms a pocket universe, it will be stable and will NOT collapse\r<br>\r<br>Conclusion: You are stuck in an infinity time loop and if/when something (ANYTHING, even a single quark) isn&#39;t in the perfect state as it was in the first time the event happened, the state will collapse.\r<br>\r<br>What is would mean if it collapses isn&#39;t that easy and not definitely possible to know. A possibility is that you create a parallel universe (only if their do not yet exist parallel universes). In the original one their will be a case where your grandfather died, and you were never born; While in the newly created parallel one its tricky to know because either you will continue to live but with a grandfather who is still alive but you will still have killed him. This is because your timeline will have skipped from realities. The other option is that you will exist but your grandfather will have died and so every event what happened after his dead in which he was involved (yes, including the ant he killed while walking in the woods) will never have happened.

Or in the same  events of the grandfather paradox, you attempt to go back in time to kill your grandfather however, you are prevented from doing so, no matter how hard you tried. This set of strange events would then appear as your grandfather being really lucky which could be a story he&#39;s never told anyone (or is that really crazy story your grandfather always told that made no sense). No matter what, you didn&#39;t kill him because you still exist. Again there is no paradox. This gives the illusion of fate, but it&#39;s just really cause and effect rather than fate. Something causes you to want to go back in time, so you do, then you cause the effect that caused you to go back in time in the first place.

In fact, during quantum superposition, particles are not doing anything. Quantum superposition is a statement about the indeterminacy of the states of a particle. If no information is available about a system from prior measurement, then the system is in quantum superposition, because the state of the system does not exist, meaning there is no such a thing as &quot;the state of the system&quot;. The system only acquires a state (randomly) the moment you perform a measurement, which amounts to altering the wave function, which is why it acquires a state in the first place. As such, quantum superposition is a terribly bad explanation for time travel, and this video also just does a bad job at invoking quantum mechanics in general.<br><br>Also, the grandfather paradox does not really exist when you consider a purely scientific perspective of time. Time is not linear as you suggest it, it is not frame invariant, and it is not disconnected to time and quantum fields. As such, the concept of the paradox does not make sense: the paradox in the first place assumes the popular non-relativistic view on time, which happens to be far from accurate.<br><br>The real problem with time travel has nothing to do with paradoxes.

If you travel back through time, that doesn&#39;t  suddenly create a new you, because that doesn&#39;t make sense at all. 1 doesn&#39;t suddenly get 2 by traveling through time. Traveling through time means, you make the time flow differently for yourself while the rest of the world works normal.  So to travel back through time you would have to make the boiled egg back raw, but not just the egg, but also the rest of the world including your body. The only thing you shouldn&#39;t revert is your memory. So if you manage to do this somehow, you went back through time and there is no paradox. And that&#39;s that. So in theory traveling back through time isn&#39;t so complicated, but doing this in practise is extremely difficult. If you want to travel through time forward, you would have to go into a closed system, in which you can freeze yourself, so that every of you&#39;re action or organical process gets stopped until the time you want to travel. You didn&#39;t change, so that means time didn&#39;t continue. You might think, this isn&#39;t real time traveling. But that is time traveling. It might not be the fascinating way. But it is a way that works and one that we already use. Sleeping is one example of it. Another example is the refrigator.

Noemic notions of time require that there is a single true state and that time is just the progression of change ... in noemic time there cannot be multiple competing states - and thus their grandfather cannot be in two states.<br><br>It&#39;s a rather silly mistake to make, considering that they have already conceded a hupostatic universe in positing the possibility of travelling to a prior state.  It cannot now be abandoned.<br><br>So, the problem appears to be one of inconsistent perspectives.<br><br><br>If we were to kill our grandfather and retain the hupostatic view required for time travel, we&#39;d only kill him in parallel, as each slice is already an independently real state.  After all, there is already an equally real state in which all the atoms of our grandfather are scattered about the cosmos ... and another where his vital elements are yet to be formed in supernovea or not even yet condensed out of the plasma prior to nucleosynthesis... in other words, there is nothing unusual about him being alive and dead, here and there, old and young, in equally existing non-preferential frames.<br><br>Why then, given that hupostasis is required for time travel, should be consider it a paradox that we have complementary states?  That truly is a noemic worry, and since noemas do not support time travel in the first place - they must be ruled out in our scenario.<br><br><br>So, let&#39;s correct the error and throw out noemic interpretations...<br><br>Now, whether the interactions of two parallel outcomes should be regarded as a kind of mobius strip of linear hupostatic time, or independent frames is, once again simply a matter of interpretation.   Both situations are perfectly rational given that hupostasis requires us to view our history as a static four-dimensional shape... that shape having a mundane potential for loops, curls and twists, divergences, convergences... and even isolated islands (howsoever they might occur)<br><br>And NONE of that strange geometry is at all paradoxical if our history is a hupostatic four dimensional manifold.<br><br><br>The only paradox here is trying to <i>&#39;have your cake and eat it too&#39;</i> ... that is, you manipulate a four dimensional hupostatic form ... whilst at the same time insisting that the effects of such manipulations must be evaluated as though time were simply a noema, the measure of change in a universe with a single valid state.<br><br><br>It&#39;s clear that proponents of the Grandfather Paradox really don&#39;t have all their ducks in a row, and should have spent more time understanding what time-travel would imply as regards the nature of the universe...<br><br>... instead, they just waved their arms and made time travel happen by magic, lazily, without following the consequences of such a universe ... and with absolutely no consideration of what such a universe would look like.<br><br>Meh.

You can\u2019t change time.  Saying the future is pre determined is a bit of a stretch\u2014 actually no that\u2019s exactly what  I mean. you are bound to fate.  You can\u2019t change time because it would defeat the purpose of the past or future.  Obviously we have free will but that doesn\u2019t have to contradict the fate theory.  This is because the fate can be your decisions.  Maybe that is a little barbaric but my counter argument to that is that this is the universe or multiverse and we don\u2019t have a say it what is happening even so you can\u2019t change the past or future because you can only cause it otherwise the reality you would cause a paradox and grandfather paradoxes defy our laws of time therefore the only time paradox that is possible is the bootstrap paradox and if that is so then you can\u2019t change the past you can only cause it.  However you could make it seem like you changed he past without ever knowing.  You could go back in time and kill Hitler and then tell everyone to change the history books to say that he wasn\u2019t killed and pretend like he died in 1945 like he originally did and raise you when you were born to think he died in 1945 when he could\u2019ve died earlier.  Maybe people from the future went back in time to kill hitler which is why he said \u201cNein!\u201d This could explain many disappearances because of thins.  Maybe in the future people realize that this theory is true and we start going back in time and stealing records that we had lost.  Maybe that\u2019s why Amelia Airhart dissapeared.  Maybe this means that the bootstrap paradox determines every single thing that happens in time and means that your decisions are your fate theorefore allowing you to have freewill along with fate.  I\u2019ll add on to this some more.  The reason it defies our laws of physics is because you can\u2019t have it going fotever.  If you do something to contradict your past you will fail, because you can\u2019t change things that have been done.  Nor can you change things that will be done.  You may cause them, but if you wanted a different route to take place it would not work.  So what I\u2019m trying to say is that you dont have to worry about changing time in the past.  Because you can\u2019t. And if something does happen where you kill someone before they should\u2019ve died, it means that your whole life leading up to that moment you have been told a lie.  So immediately after you would have to tell everyone to pretend he is still alive until whatever time said person dies.  This means that all your life in the present before you went back in time he was actually dead, but everyone claimed he was alive because of you from the future but back into the past told them to.  Idk why they would listen to you but maybe you could mindwipe them or kill them and replace them idk.<br>Whoever you kill, spare the dogs. Kill the cats.  In the most brutal way ;).

In short time travel to the past is entirely impossible (time travel to the future however is extremely easy).", "comment_date": "2018-02-07T00:57:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rory_Emery", "comment_text": "Soooo basically Schrondinger&#39;s cat?", "comment_date": "2018-02-07T00:07:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael", "comment_text": "What ?", "comment_date": "2018-02-06T23:50:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Derpachu_ lel", "comment_text": "I have an even better soution, you jus killed your grandpa, now he\u2019s dead, so you weren\u2019t created, that doesn\u2019t make you not be created, aka you won\u2019t die or disappear, you can\u2019t just disappear ; or already have been created, you would h e just had to stay there, and if you traveled back to present time, you would go back with your grandma married to someone else and none of your family there, you would have see everything in between if you had just stayed there and not gone back to the present.

Although not all things that look like paradoxes are true paradox, I think the Grandfather Paradox is pretty genuine. Quite frankly, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s so boring about the concept of an alternate timeline. Think of it as a loop in an infinite string which, in this hypothetical scenario that allows for time travel, is able to pass through itself. Let the infinite string represent time. The string curves backwards when time is run back, then moves forward again at the point in the past that was changed. This video essentially demonstrates connecting the end of the string to a point in the middle to create a circle, but the string has no ends because it is infinite. In short, I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but this video\u2019s conclusion doesn\u2019t make any sense to me, even in a hypothetical universe in which time travel is possible, which it probably isn\u2019t.

So - just after killing your granddad you will alter the then future (you will not be born) - but in no sense will you have altered the past in killing your granddad (because it has, by time travel, become the present) and therefore killing your granddad will in no way halt your current or future existence because at the moment you kill your granddad you actually exist.

I will therefore attempt the thought experiment of what the superposition of states is past the end of the time loop, to those not actually traveling backwards in time. Let&#39;s designate t0 as the time when you activate your time machine to begin your journey to the past. We&#39;ll designate tp as the time you go back to, when your grandfather is a kid, and t{f} as all times that are in the future compared to t0. The universe is in a superposition, starting at tp, of grandfather alive/dead. By t0, it is in a superposition of a lot of conditions based on your grandfather&#39;s alive/dead state, including you being born/unborn. <br><br>The interesting thing about most superpositions is that they occur below a certain threshold of energy/time, or position/momentum. This is where the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle dwells. (Classic form with which most are familiar is that you can&#39;t know precise position and precise momentum, because measuring one changes the other. The same is true of knowing precise energy in a system at a precise time.) We&#39;re dealing with a scale of energy and time where both numbers are enormous compared to the dE and dt required to generate the uncertainty that leads to most quantum superpositions, however. But when below those thresholds, you cannot be certain of the energy within a system at a particular time, so it can have, temporarily, fluctuations in its total energy. <br><br>This leads to such effects as spontaneous particle/antiparticle pair creation. In very brief moments, they spring into existence, and the net energy in the area drops below zero. But before the dt passes within which you could precisely measure their existence, they are attracted back to each other by their opposite charges, and do a matter/anti-matter annihilation which generates exactly enough energy to bring the deficit back up to zero.<br><br>What I&#39;m getting at, here, is that quantum superstates that are not very, very carefully maintained have a tendency to collapse down to one measurable outcome over a macroscopic period of time. If you could create a superstate that existed on the scale of your grandfather dying/not dying before your father was born, such that you did/did not go back in time to murder him, this superstate would be very prone to collapse down to one state. This suggests to me that, at some t{f}, events in both superimposed timelines would arrange themselves such that the differences caused by you existing/not existing and your grandfather dying/not dying before your father was born would somehow resolve themselves. <br><br>Perhaps, in the you-don&#39;t-exist timeline, somebody else would remember this strange time traveling murderer showing up to kill your grandfather, and use a time machine to go back and prevent it. It may even lead to multiple loops, as he goes back to stop you, and you go back to try it, warning yourself of how you were thwarted last time, and you eventually create a massive superposition of timelines until one of them results in you going back, and your foe going back to stop you because what HE remembers is somebody trying AND FAILING to kill your grandfather, and he realizes he&#39;s that guy.", "comment_date": "2017-12-08T01:03:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Somu Soni", "comment_text": "Loved it", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T13:37:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OldYtAcc", "comment_text": "Talking about time travel yet time doesn&#39;t even exist", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T12:21:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "De batze", "comment_text": "Superposition can only work to quantum objects", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T04:53:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Parsons", "comment_text": "So you&#39;re answering the problem with Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s Cat", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T00:22:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Mote", "comment_text": "But the real question is, why would you kill your grandad?", "comment_date": "2017-12-06T22:20:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aca 792", "comment_text": "then you&#39;s become a serial murderer just by killing only 1 person", "comment_date": "2017-12-06T20:17:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dani\u00ebl Kunenborg", "comment_text": "I AM ALIVE<br><br><br><br><br><br>and i am not?...", "comment_date": "2017-12-06T19:57:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Balkaran Singh", "comment_text": "so..no solution", "comment_date": "2017-12-06T19:53:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guilherme Branco", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t really get the &quot;superposition of two states&quot; part.

So instead of seeing it as a rope attached to two ends and when going back to a part of the rope and cutting it that the other end falls off, you are just putting all of the atoms around you in the same exact position as they used to be, but you will be untouched. It would achieve the <b>exact</b> same effect and I don&#39;t see why it wouldn&#39;t work.

Since there is a quantum possibility that you may get either state, you will eventually hit an iteration in which you die and therefore the time loop is broken. At this point we do not know how things in the universe are affected by quantum fluctuations, but it may well be that due to them, the universe is not deterministic and therefore multiple iterations of the same events are not guaranteed to happen in the same way.

Most people think of time as something which is 1-dimensional - we are traveling forward along a path of time which is independent on space. I see it as more dependent on space and the space-time continuum. See, imagine we are a function on a complex, 4-dimensional graph, which has already been drawn out, something we are following along (sort of like the linear theory, but it&#39;s different, just bear with me). There are axes for length, width, height, and time. Any given point in time (which is the dimension which the rest of the function depends on, just like y depends on x in a 2D function) on this function represents the position, behavior, and age of each and every particle in space. Now, since we are moving forward in time along this function representing the space-time continuum, which maps the behavior/position/age of every particle, traveling back in time would just be turning around on the function and moving in the opposite direction, to a place where we have already been. So essentially, every instance of time exists simultaneously, but we are only grounded on one point of time at once. For instance, take the function y=2x. If you follow that function to the point (3,6), the point (1,2) still exists, you are just not currently at that point. The difference here being, you can see the entire function y=2x on a piece of paper, but you cannot see the complex 4-dimensional function which our universe is on. So anyways, let&#39;s say I travel back in time to 1932 to kill Adolf Hitler, thus preventing him from rising to power and starting WWII. Easy, right? WRONG. Because, since I am only traveling backwards on the function on which we already preside, a function on which Hitler does rise to power and start the second World War, it is impossible for me to accomplish. You see, the time part of the function, the age of each particle, would stay the same, while the behavior and position would change, since Hitler survived before but dies now. Therefore It would be like traveling along the 2-dimensional function y=2x, and, upon reaching the point (3,6) you decide to go back to (1,2) and change the x coordinate without changing the y coordinate. It wouldn&#39;t work. It couldn&#39;t, because it would change the function without changing the function. It would create a hole in the function. So therefore, (and, again, I know this is confusing, because I have spent many hours pondering it, so try to bear with me for a few more sentences) any time travel to the past, (or the future for that matter), is already ingrained in this function of space-time, shaping history either by intention or by failure to change it. A good example of this is the Terminator movies. Why, you might ask, can&#39;t the technology through which Skynet is created be destroyed? Because the function of space-time required for Skynet to be created. If the Terminators were not sent back in time until the 2020&#39;s, how could Skynet be created before then using their technology? Because although we cannot see the function, it still exists all at once. There is truly no &quot;going back&quot;, per se. In the 1980&#39;s, a Terminator appears out of nowhere and is destroyed. Then the tech is used and the rest is (movie) history. So in conclusion, if I WAS to travel back in time to 1932 on say, April 17, 2034, it would not magically open a new timeline on which I existed in 1932. I already existed in 1932, I just don&#39;t know it yet because I have not reached the point in time in which i travel back to 1932 yet. Interesting, isn&#39;t it? Anyways, thank you for reading this and sorry if the explanation is convoluted or unorganized or confusing. Tell me what you think of this or ask questions if you have them. I don&#39;t know if this theory on time and time travel has been proposed before, it may have been (or maybe I come from the future where we already know).", "comment_date": "2017-07-11T07:40:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BagOfOreos", "comment_text": "PLOT TWIST: you&#39;re adopted", "comment_date": "2017-07-11T05:37:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave Jacob", "comment_text": "HUGE mistake in your thinking:<br><br>1. grandfather is young.<br>2. his life and decisions causes you to exist<br>3. you travel back in time<br>4. you kill your grandfather.<br>5. his not existing life causes you to not exist.<br>6. noone travels back in time.<br><br>you claimed that 6. causes your grandfather to survive.<br><br>WRONG.<br><br>there is no need for anOTHER time travel since the past of 6 is already 4. there is already a version of you in this timeline that came out of a weird wormhole or something like that. either way, a version of you suddenly came into being that killed your grandfather and THEREFORE he is dead. <br><br>therefore you are not born &quot;again&quot;, but that doesn\u00b4t matter.<br><br>the only weird thing is that point 2 and 3 are only true in another truth, be it a parallel-world or some weird kind of &quot;past&quot;.<br>you could claim that the suddenly appearing version of you that kills your grandfather is the outcome of incredibly unlikely quantum-fluctuations.", "comment_date": "2017-07-10T13:32:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isekai Buff", "comment_text": "cisco", "comment_date": "2017-07-10T09:46:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TE MATAR\u00c9", "comment_text": "What if you went back and time and your grandfather kills you because he ain&#39;t no bitch!", "comment_date": "2017-07-10T05:45:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blk Sqd", "comment_text": "lmao y&#39;all so close minded I know the answer but try not to publicate , if you go back and kill him then when you go back to normal time it doesn&#39;t effect you because you were out of deaths reach there for it will warp the present time but you&#39;ll be alive", "comment_date": "2017-07-10T02:01:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerseyan USA", "comment_text": "This is fantasy not physics.

Thank you for the explanation!<br>Here&#39;s something I&#39;m curious about, how would you explain this:<br>So there is an anime in which this situation seems to happen.<br>The kid is sick, him and his mom are in a car, but they get stuck in the snow, and can&#39;t move on to the hospital. Then suddenly a guy appears who seems to look like the grown up version of the kid, putting his coat under the wheels and helps the car to move on, therefore this guy seems to go back in time to save his kid self&#39;s life. But here&#39;s the twist. The kid is influenced by his hero&#39;s looks so he decides to copy his look as much as possible, mainly his hair. But in the scene we can see details like the school uniform on the hero, the earring and things like that. (The town they were in when he was a kid, had no school yet, therefore there couldn&#39;t yet be a same looking school uniform, plus a school uniform is not chosen by the kids obviously.) So we can almost surely say that the guy somehow went back to the past and save his kid self. How does all that work? I can&#39;t wrap my head around it.<br>The anime is &quot;Jojo&#39;s Bizarre adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable&quot; btw, in a small unexplained scene.<br>Thank you in advance.", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T12:20:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meta", "comment_text": "thank god, I thought the grandfather paradox is when you replace your grandfather... that is one fucked up paradox", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T10:16:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scyon Barker", "comment_text": "The solution is...you&#39;re you&#39;re own grandpa", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T09:59:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Id\u017a Id\u017a", "comment_text": "what", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T09:25:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Wu", "comment_text": "what if you killed ur grand father... but still ur left in the past amd nothing to go back to the present and ur stuck in the past so u made ur family and now ur the grand father of ur fam tree\ud83d\ude1f???", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T09:16:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Captain Italia", "comment_text": "What?", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T08:45:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "anthems", "comment_text": "the answer to this is:<br>he killed him after having a child xd", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T06:31:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nuke Star", "comment_text": "How can grandfather&#39;s be real if time travel isn&#39;t real?", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T04:23:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spodo bbb", "comment_text": "and here I thought there was only one way for a man to be in 2 places at once", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T03:58:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deathsicon", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t be the only person that was waiting to see a reference to Fry being his own grandfather", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T02:19:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Ludwig", "comment_text": "Simpler Answer: You lived in the original timeline.", "comment_date": "2017-06-12T02:08:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheDankDragonite", "comment_text": "Uhhh, I don&#39;t know if this thinking is flawed or not...

The trick to this approach is determining some form of relative time that can be tracked on an individual basis.", "comment_date": "2017-03-07T23:42:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rob Elliott", "comment_text": "I love this stuff.

So even if it&#39;s possible for a person to exist in a superposition of alive/dead states, neither you nor your grandfather would be actually be able to under the circumstances of the paradox.<br><br>The only way to avoid the paradox with this superposition idea would be if you and your grandfather both completely vanish from time and space ... which upon further reflection might actually be a reasonable resolution to the paradox.", "comment_date": "2017-01-24T08:14:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dylmon", "comment_text": "this is some Barry Allen shit", "comment_date": "2017-01-24T05:50:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Keithkmarshman", "comment_text": "Quantum mythology.

In my variation we freeze the second photon (the speed of like is only constant in a vacuum and can be zero) and then decide what to do with the entangled half only after the results of the first come in. We&#39;d have to set up the second experiment in advance because we can only freeze light for about a minute last I checked,  but the choice to observe can be decided quickly.  If the first photon behaves like a wave it means a message from the fuure from it&#39;s entangled half was observed, so we won&#39;t observe the second one. If it behaves like a wave, we will observe the other. We just do the opposite which ensures that a paradox emerges.

And So on and So forth, but here is an answer that would prevent the Grandfather paradox, say you do go back in time to when your grandfather is a child and kill him, but............... you don&#39;t travel back to the future which means this is where the disappearance from your existence comes into play.<br><br>Think of Marty McFly in BTTF1. He goes back to 1955 and prevents his parents first meeting and the time stream catches up to him within 1 week after the event, for example:<br>Marty was born in 1968, 13 yrs before his birth.  and then you do this:<br>depending on where you are at the past this equation comes into play.<br>Take me, I was born in 1991 and my grandfather was born in 1934 so I went back during his childhood to kill him and I would assume it would be somewhere in the 1940&#39;s(I would never do that though, to be honest, but for hypothetical reasons let&#39;s assume that I would). and for all intents and purposes let&#39;s assume it&#39;s 1941 the death date of my grandfather as child. and that&#39;s 50 yrs in the past before I was born so how long would it take for the time stream to catch up to my predicament. Take the 13 yrs from the date of birth in Marty&#39;s and then<br>13yrs=1 week<br>26 yrs=2 weeks<br>39 yrs =3weeks<br>52yrs=4 weeks<br><br>So I would have around 3 1/2 weeks before the time stream caught up with me. And   I would have to think of a way to save myself, by becoming my own grandfather. Remember i would still exist 3 1/2 weeks after the demise of my original grandfather until the time stream caught up with me. Now this a theory that some people might be their own grandfather, our grandmothers or great-grandfathers or great-grandmothers or you might be your own great- something or other ancestor.

You tell Carl that you will be back. The day finally comes and you time travel and kill your grandfather. Now if you kill your grandfather then you know that your father will be dead( obviously) . But if i continue the thought that there exist only ONE of you then surely there exist ONE dad for you. So that means that if Carl sees your dad, he us still alive. Therefore i think that when you kill your grandfather, you take part of a time where you kill your grandfather and your family linage doesnt exist. So if you go to the future after you kill your grandfather then you will be in a future where NOBODY knows who you are. So in order to prevent this you have to go back to the future and not kill your grandfather because there is only one of you if we still assume a linear time.  So you choose to take part of the killing of your grandfather or not.

There aren&#39;t even sound hypotheses, but let me go on the explain this impossible thing anyway.&#39;  I guess that would take all the fun out it, right? It wouldn&#39;t keep getting said.

In fact in it&#39;s subtlety of implausibility it&#39;s even a bit more at risk of become widespread beliefs. As in &#39;there (probably) ARE other parallel universes that you could go to, to get around the impossibility of reverse time travel&#39;. That is a CLASSIC example of a mechanism of cognitive dissonance. If you can&#39;t support the impossible with anything reasonable, simply make up something unreasonable to support it.   And of course grab for the least unreasonable and most fitting you can find, even if it&#39;s actually still quite unreasonable..  I&#39;m not saying this happens with intent or malice. But it&#39;s a thing, ok? If I seem &#39;uptight&#39; consider that to be less like I&#39;m being is to be even more tolerant of collective delusions.

Lying (to itself) is one of them.  <br><br>ALL THAT SAID, in like form,  in the  end,  I will say that in spite of offering apparent support for an absurd hypothesis earlier on you do seem to redeem yourself with a better framing of it near the end. And it was also an interesting reference. So for that, you get credit. But you didn&#39;t say all that first, and you didn&#39;t thread it throughout...the delusion is still promoted despite the honorable mention of caveats.  Because as you know a lot of people aren&#39;t going to remember or focus on the caveats. So what to do instead? <br>Don&#39;t call an absurdity a paradox. There is no &#39;solution&#39; to such a thing&#39;. We can apply logic &#39;solutions&#39; to such absurdities, but we are in danger of thereby &#39;validating them with a serious response&#39;.  Don&#39;t try to offer solutions to the alien invasion under such a pretense. <br>I&#39;d say just focus on the caveats from the beginning and throughout and marginalize the delusion, discredit it, and frame it as obsolete, boring, and even its name can be obscured...&#39;that thing we used to say&#39;... Brilliant people should maybe not work<br>so deep in the weeds when no disproof is really needed in a practical sense.  I guess it might not seem so absurd to them at the time, idk.

Going back in time just means reversing the flow of energy, like pressing the rewind button on a tape recorder. But will the same song still play? Not likely.<br><br>Once &quot;your&quot; particles go back through spacetime, the chaotic and randomized nature of the universe means that &quot;your&quot; particles, now likely miles away from one another, are not destined to become &quot;you&quot; again. They are actually much more likely to get roped into doing something else, becoming constituents of another person or object, perhaps a clump of dust somewhere. Your entire existence hinged on a very specific universe existing in a very specific state, but that state always changes, randomly. Destiny does not exist. You were a random event, and the chances of that event repeating itself are nearly zero after one rewind. If the universe was rewound infinite times, you&#39;d probably spring up again from the chaos, but who really knows?", "comment_date": "2016-06-14T16:50:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "taylor darna\u00e9", "comment_text": "That&#39;s why you do what fry did and become your own grandfather  before you kill him \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2016-06-14T16:30:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kriss Homena", "comment_text": "I thought that was an error or something.

For example, if one were to travel back in time, kill baby Hitler, and replace him with an orphan, that orphan will grow up to the Hitler known to history. Under this theory it is impossible to travel back in time to fix history, but is also equally as impossible to break history, because anything you while time traveling has already happened and must happen.

Love it! Between this and the &quot;All your actions in the past have already happened in this reality&quot;, there is no escaping fate. (For the latter theory, you killing your genetic predecessor is clearly impossible. Either you must have failed in some way, or there are other factors at hand that you are unaware of, eg your father/mother was actually adopted, or your grandfather had already sired a child, or they used his genetic material to produce offspring, or your true grandfather was a different person, etc. Whatever you do in the past, will have already happened in your present reality&#39;s past, and there is no altering that, whiceh is a more typical depiction of time travel than the loop you have presented here... Which I really love and need to write a story about asap.)<br><br>Edit: Hmm hmm! There&#39;s also the theory that what you do in the past is a permanent alteration to this current reality, no offsplitting. Essentially every time you travel to the past, everything that occurred between the present moment and the moment you arrive at is completely, permanently erased, as your presence rewrites everything. Meaning that no, you do not exist in the future  (your present), because it does not exist. By killing your grandfather, you are not erasing yourself, because you are undeniably physically HERE in this present moment. This is dangerously close to the &quot;split timeline&quot; theory though.<br><br>I suppose the distinction lies in whether time is being split or overwritten, if that distinction can even be made. Since the physical possibility of the &quot;splitting&quot; of time/reality seems to me to be much more unlikely, unless we discover some earth-shattering secrets within quantum physics or some such, then I suppose it really doesn&#39;t make a difference, and certainly makes no difference from the perspective of the time-traveller, who has still lived a life in a reality that no longer exists where they are.<br><br>And now I&#39;m wondering about time in video games (in the few games that I&#39;ve played that have featured time travel as a game mechanic that you have to play with). Usually in these games you have two distinct, specific &quot;moments&quot; running in parallel with each other, between which you can cross freely. You can safely travel two a specific moment again and again without creating duplicates of yourself, which could leave one to believe that the character has been detached from the laws of reality and exists as a separate entity, able to interact, but never truly be &quot;present&quot; (wink wink). Aside from that, these generally seem to run on the &quot;overwriting reality&quot; principle, where any action you take in the past moment has a permanent effect on the future moment (uuuuntil you change the past again), without any further complication.<br><br>And then there&#39;s Homestuck.", "comment_date": "2016-05-24T18:56:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nydo", "comment_text": "From a fourth-dimensional standpoint, anything you do in the past has already happened.

It can even be the cause of your original cause, turning causality on its head. In simpler terms, if you have time-traveled into the past, whatever you do in the past has already occurred <i>in the past,</i> before you choose to travel there. Or... choose to travel then, I suppose. Your free will is not being taken away; it&#39;s not that you <i>can&#39;t</i> kill your grandfather, you just <i>know you haven&#39;t</i> because <i>you exist.</i>", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T23:05:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James", "comment_text": "you don &#39;t have to go back in time to kill your grandfather.", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T22:47:15Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "universal minded", "comment_text": "wtf??", "comment_date": "2016-05-20T22:33:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Twitchy", "comment_text": "Look, here&#39;s the real question.

Also, the old timeline between the traveler&#39;s (present) departure and (past) entry has no bearing on whether the traveler continues to exist (in his/her present state).<br>To reiterate, the traveler would keep existing, and keep all his/her memories. However, obviously, the traveler will never be born in this new timeline (and there is always only one timeline). So, the traveler could future-time-travel to a year during his/her lifetime, but the past-self will not exist (was never born).

If an old boat gets so many parts replaced that all the original material is gone, is it the old boat or a new boat? It&#39;s not really a paradox. The answer changes depending on who you ask; it has to do with how the strict duality of our language shapes our concept of new and old, different and same. We don&#39;t consider the in between. If we consider the in between, then it logically follows that as each new part is added, eventually, given enough time, it would be considered part of the old boat. But how quickly that part becomes old depends on the observer. One person might consider it old after a month, for another it might take ten years.

An analogy I just though of, however, is this: If we think of time as a dimension, then the past present and future are all positions along that dimension. So say I decide to leave my house for awhile on a whim. Someone&#39;s trying to kill me by blowing up my house but fortunately that happens after I went out. Would I die just because I was in my house earlier that day. No, if I&#39;m not in the house when the explosion happens, it will not affect me that directly.<br>To put it simply, once I arrive in the past I exist in the past and any events or lack of events in the future cannot affect me.

And as usual, the answer can be found in Bill Murray.<br><br>Rather than viewing the event as having two possible timelines, consider an essentially linear timeline that loops back on itself, changing slightly each time.  On one of the attempts, the time traveler would eventually fail to kill his grandfather (Got the wrong guy, caught by the police, something went wrong with the time machine so never went back in time, etc etc etc) and this whole causal loop will finally break and... to an outside observer the traveler simply fails and never kills his grandfather.

If we send something back in time, all of a sudden we have created a great big object with a positive enthalpy.  This is in apparent violation, or at least bending of the second law as entropy is temporarily decreased.  The solution to this is that to send back an average sized adult human, assuming 100% efficiency, an amount of energy at least equal to e=mc^2, or something on the order of 10^19 joules of energy will have to be put in to the system.  This is comparable to the amount of total energy the United States currently uses in a month.  This amount of energy would have to be spent at the point in time the traveler goes back to.  So in essence, a time machine wouldn&#39;t look so much like a box you go into that ends up in the past, as a gate that is opened into which someone from the future could enter.

It&#39;s a paradox because some of the assumptions made have to be incompatible with others, or the accepted models of reality. People assume that if time travel is possible, one could go back in time and change things. The reason this is wrong in that for the present to be, the past must have manifested precisely, up to that point, the position of every particle in the present is dependent on the position and interaction of themselves, and others, prior. If one can send things or people to the past it would imply that their existence and interaction had manifested then, having been set in motion now. So, you could never go back and successfully kill your grandfather. You would always fail. Not because of some unseen force, but because you&#39;re living proof of what way your murder attempt went. Universes where time travel is possible are fixed timelines. So I guess all of them.<br> <br>Although, I don&#39;t believe in material time travel. I&#39;m more interested in information time travel. That is, using some form of material in the universe that due to its mechanics moves in the opposite direction of time, relative to ourselves. We would record information onto this medium, which would have allowed us to have access to that same information in the past. This would be amazing for all of human knowledge, since we could set up an inquiry process that would rely on making clear goals for what information we want to receive, like curing cancer, acquire the information and study it to identify if it satisfies our goals, after which, and upon success, we would send that information back in that same medium. This is amazing and would only output success, because if ever we were to stumble upon information in this process that does not satisfy our goals, we would simply not send it back, which would put that information&#39;s existence in question. Because such is impossible, and as long as we were rigorous in what we sent back, every finding would be exactly what was expected.<br>The material? Anti-matter...?
