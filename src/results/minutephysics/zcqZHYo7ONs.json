The waves interfere with each other creating troughs and peaks. If you pass light through a single slit, you would get what is expected. A thin line. When you make a second slit beside the first, things get interesting. If you think photons are only particles, then you should get 2 lines. But since they are also waves, you get troughs and peaks. Where you expected to get 2 lines there is nothing. But in the middle you get a bright line, brighter than the single slit and brighter than if nothingwas in the path of the photons (primary peak). Then on each side you get a line that is dimmer (secondary peaks) then 2 lines outside those that are dimmer still. Polarized lens is like making a hundred slit. Since you would get the primary and the secondary and so on in between each slit, the amount of light getting through would only be dimmer by a small fraction. When you place to polarized lens at 90 degrees, the photons must travel only like particles to get through. But it is a wave therefore no photons get through. When the second len is at 45\u00b0 to the first, you are now allowing a wave through that is cos(45) or 70.7% of the light When you put the next lens at 45\u00b0 to the second, either 90\u00b0 or 0\u00b0 to the first lens you are allowing cos(45) or 70.7% of the first cos(45)  for a total of 50%. Remove second lens, add a lens at 22.5\u00b0 from the first lens then it would be cos(22.5) or 92.4%  and add a lens  22.5\u00b0 from the second lens and that would let 85.4% through. Add a third  22.5\u00b0 from the second lens and a forth 22.5\u00b0 for the third, the amount of light would be cos(22.5\u00b0) or 92.4%  \u00d7 cos(22.5\u00b0) \u00d7 cos(22.5\u00b0) \u00d7 cos(22.5\u00b0) or 72.9% of the light.

It makes absolute clear and toral sense using wave mechanics.  <br>This excerpt from the Theory of Everything (mine, which works, fixes, explains and unifies everything in physics) explains what is actually at work in Bell&#39;s Theorem.<br>Bell&#39;s Theorem is another example of where the mathematics show that it is a wave that is moving through the lattice, it is not particles moving through empty space. Where we have energies, traditionally identified as particles expected at 75% of the total possible energy it is in fact the swell of a wave which at 75% of energy is at 85% of it&#39;s full swell, so the values collected on analysis do not reflect the number of expected particles they in fact represent the number of nodes in the lattice being passed through at 75% of the swell of the oscillating wave. Conversely when the wave is only at 25% its full energy level it has only aquired 15% of its maximum momemtum. <br>In the polarising lenses in the accompanying video the reason why a wave can be totally obscured to darkness when a filter is added and orientated at 90\u00b0 but further filters added between the darkened filter actually brighten it when we intuitively expect more filters would only compound it&#39;s darkness is because the darkened filter is positioned in time and space where the waves that were in phase at the initial filter are out of phase and not visible because they are blocked at the later (darkened) filter.  Adding more filters in between means the waves are propagated at closer to the full swell of the wave so more waves are generated/propagated at closer to full swell so rather than these waves oscillating and decreasing at the later (darkened) filter they never actually appear out of phase, rather instead they are closer to the full swell, that is, the more filters are added at specific angles the more they keep the wave moving at closer to full swell. If we add 3 more filters between the initial filter and a filter orientated at 90\u00b0 which appears dark because the waves from the initial filter are all out of phase then this is what happens.<br>When another filter is added between the darkened filter orientated at 22.5\u00b0 the wave is propagated at 85% of the momentum at the first filter, propagated as a wave at full momentum. Another filter added at 45\u00b0 propagates that wave at 75% of it&#39;s momentum which is 85% of its total swell (which is the square root of 85% of 85\u00b2) which is approximately 78% of the momentum relative to the 1st filter&#39;s momentum rather than 50%.  This in turn is propagated at 85% full momentum which relative to the first filter is 72% (the square root of 85% of 78\u00b2) the initial momentum rather than 15% momentum (or 75% through its progression to it&#39;s trough). So by the time the initial waves arrive at the filter orientated 90\u00b0 they are not all out of phase appearing dark, they are carrying 66.5% (the square root of 85% of 72\u00b2) the momentum of the initial wave rather than 0% as we expect from a wave that is out of phase. <br>The full explanation is in the video on the topic on my channel.

(4) In July 1947, I was stationed at Fort Worth Army Air Field [later Carswell Air Force Base] in Fort Worth, Texas. I served as Chief of Staff to Major General Roger Ramey, Commander, Eighth Air Force. I had the rank of Colonel. (5) In early July, I received a phone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, Deputy Commander, Strategic Air Command. He asked what we knew about the object which had been recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, as reported in the press. I called Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the Roswell Army Air Field, and directed him to send the material in a sealed container to me at Fort Worth. I so informed Maj. Gen. McMullen. (6) After the plane from Roswell arrived with the material, I asked the Base Commander, Col. Al Clark, to take possession of the material and to personally transport it in a B-26 to Maj. Gen. McMullen in Washington, D.C. I notified Maj. Gen. McMullen, and he told me he would send the material by personal courier on his plane to Benjamin Chidlaw, Commanding General of the Air Material Command at Wright Field [later Wright Patterson AFB]. The entire operation was conducted under the strictest secrecy. (7) The material shown in the photographs taken in Maj. Gen. Ramey\u2019s office was a weather balloon. The weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press.

Essentially, when light passes through a polarization filter, it becomes polarized, oriented according to the orientation of the filter. At that point, another filter oriented the same way allows the same amount of light through. A filter oriented 90 degrees to the first allows no light through. A filter oriented at a different angle, say 45 degrees, allows some light through (50% at 45 degrees), and now the polarization of the light is at that new angle of orientation. So, now the filter that&#39;s oriented at 90 degrees to the first filter is only oriented 45 degrees to the second filter. Thus it&#39;s letting 50% of the remaining light through (25% of the light passing through the first polarizing filter).

If you have a filter B after filter A, some photons will go through but remember: light is also a wave, not only a particle, so the wave will be polarized on a different axis, the same axis of filter B to be exact. Now, if the photons are polarized on the B axis instead of the A one, they will not be perpendicular anymore to filter C, they are going to have a component on the C axis and therefore a change to go through and get polarized again. This is valid for any rotation.<br>Polarizing photons will block some of them lowering the light intensity, but considering the light wave you can polarize them by small amounts without losing much intensity, that&#39;s because with a small rotational angle the component on the original angle is very large. Basically it&#39;s better to take 99.9% for a hundred times than taking 50% one time.

When a photon passes through a filter, it is perturbed, because of the speed of light and the angular momentum of its phase, that info breaks outside of the Space-Time light cone (at the Plank length where the past and future come together not as a true 0 point but at a parabolic geometry 1 Plank wide) this allows information into the hyperspace and arc back in time but only 1 Plank time to share future info with the photon back then. The thing to note is: Once info goes back in time, it can go back only 1 Plank time (instant) at a time, but since it is in the past, it could keep going back each instant and reach all the way back to the big bang if needed to effect the outcome of the now and future. So no matter how far back info had to travel, we get the result instantly in the present (which appears as faster than light interaction to us because large objects do not go back in time, only tiny packets of info do at the quantum level). The simple takeaway is: At the quantum level info also travels backwards in time. Reality at the quantum level is: The future is not certain, the past is ever changing, and the now is where the two meet to form a certain and stable existence (that lasts only until it becomes the past 1 Plank time later).  So there are paradoxes, but they are localized to one Plank area and last for only 1 Plank time. Our reality is all that fuzziness is smoothed out to what we observe at a more macro level. Whoa!

So, if, say, 50% of polarized light passes through a filter that&#39;s misaligned by 45\u00b0, then going 45\u00b0 again should allow 25% of all light to pass.<br><br>There has to be a mechanical analog that might support this idea. If you had some linkages (or perhaps cams, gears, or flexures) that moved in a wavelike pattern along one plane, and were perfectly rigid perpendicular to that plane, then you could expect them to move in perfect unison and have 100% power transmission (assuming negligible friction). If you could then misalign a portion of them radially, but keep them aligned axially, then it would be like you&#39;re constraining a portion of its vertical stroke, you&#39;re virtually shrinking the height of that linkage. The amount you&#39;re shrinking it by would not be linear; it would follow a cosine function. And the amount of power you&#39;re therefore able to transmit is also limited according to that function. Energy would be lost in the form of friction. Perpendicular means the mechanism jams, with zero power transmission, equivalent to cos(90\u00b0). It makes intuitive sense, because you&#39;re moving about a circle. If you introduce more stages that are only gently tilted relative to each other, then you should see more power transmission and less mechanical resistance, in proportion to the product of the cosines of their respective angles.<br><br>Now, given that photons are quantized and cannot just have their energy reduced without also changing their wavelength, then reducing power transmission through polarizing filters must be probabilistic, and successfully passing through would mean a photon with a new polarity comes out the other side. But on a macroscopic scale, only X% of energy is being transmitted as if the amplitude of that light was constrained, and the polarity has been twisted. If you could have the light perfectly in phase, as in a laser, then effectively, you ARE decreasing the amplitude of light in exactly the same way as our mechanical analog. The energy lost would either be in the form of back reflection or heat.<br><br>I don&#39;t know enough about quantum physics to understand if this somehow introduces a hidden variable, but it doesn&#39;t feel like it would.

They may clarify debatable points.<br><br>The Schr\u00f6dinger time dependent equation (STDE) when applied to a wave representing an initial state of, say, an electron bound to a proton and together forming a hydrogen atom, predicts and retrodicts all the future and previous states of the electron wave, in the same fashion than the evolution equations of classical mechanics predicts the movement of the Earth around the Sun. Note that the STDE is energy conservative, that is, the initial state as well as the predicted and retrodicted ones all have the same energy.  <br><br>As is well known the bound electron has a completely different conduct. Whatever the initial state and in absence of other interactions an excited electron will settle in a stationary state radiating energy (in the form of a photon) along the way. If the stationary state is the ground state the electron will stay there forever (in absence, as said before, of other interactions). Otherwise the stationary electron state is ephemeral and will be abandoned to radiate a photon and assume a new stationary state of even lower energy. This &quot;down the staircase&quot; process repeats until the ground state is reached. There is no manner to adapt the STDE to this physical process. This inconsistency was discovered by none other than Niels Bohr, as can be inferred from the report of Werner Heisenberg.

References to this historical detail would be appreciated.<br><br>It is hard to believe but, against reasonableness and common sense, Bohr decided to adopt the STDE as correct and that continuity, causality and determinism of physical processes were wrong because they contradicted the STDE. Apparently mathematical equations on paper were more relevant than the experience of the whole human race. Then a series of new and fanciful &quot;quantum physical principles&quot; were adopted. <br><br>In my opinion the powerful quantum establishment dogmatically defends Quantism and strongly rejects any attempt to correct its misdeeds, even if the correct deterministic time dependent wave equation is available. <br><br>With best regards to all<br>Daniel Crespin", "comment_date": "2022-05-11T14:22:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sibusiso Ngqondo", "comment_text": "Isnt this the same as change of variable in statistics", "comment_date": "2022-05-10T14:18:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Sanders", "comment_text": "I had a hall pass but got blocked at b.

The polarizer is depicted in the classic way as a series of slits, to allow us to get a gut feeling for how it works, by screening out photons whose electric (magnetic?) field is not oriented with the slit. But what happens in actuality?  I see no reason not to think that passage through the polarizer alters the polarization of the photon. And, that it is not a simple slit effect, but some kind of interaction between a non-circularly symmetric photon and a non-symmetric polarizer.  I need to start by examining those ideas before even beginning to think about the 50%/85% etc things.

Whether this can be done at infinite speed, or only way faster than the speed of light we do not know.<br>It would be unwise to entirely rule out the possibility of non-physical matter, and physical quanta perhaps being a composite of a purely physical particle, and a non-physical yet material wave, perhaps made of innumerable non-physical quanta filling physical space, with a limited interaction between physical particles and non-physical quanta (explaining how particles can interact with each other at a distance). The same might be true or not be true for these minuscule non-physical quanta (being composed of a pure particle part, and a material wave made of even more subtle matter), if they are quanta indeed and not a mere continuum of &quot;space substance&quot;. The world seems to be quantised in so many ways though, so why should not the substance of space that allows for waves of physical fields also be quantised?<br><br>It is also an interesting question how much of the original light is let through by the first filter, it can&#39;t be 100%, since in the entangled case a photon is let through one filter exactly when its entangled twin is absorbed by the other filter, rotated 90\u00b0. No doubt this is a question of actual measurement, to find out how much of unpolarised light is absorbed by the filter.<br>We may ask though if it matters which one of two entangled photons first passes through a filter rotating its polarisation (especially if we have several filters in a row), although it seems like it doesn&#39;t matter, we may reason &quot;as if&quot; light travels backwards in time in the form of one photon and then forward in time in the form of the other entangled photon, although strictly speaking this is nonsense.<br>I wonder if it is possible to annihilate entangled photons in a similar sense to creating them, giving the impression of light moving backwards through time yet again?<br><br>I believe special and general relativity are interpreted incorrectly, surely length contraction and time dilation occurs, but time is not a dimension, instead 3d space is curved in higher dimensional 4d space, and internal physical processes are slowed down by really fast acceleration into relativistic velocities compared to the non-physical yet material substance of space, such as that within our solar system.<br>So information travelling backwards in time is nonsense (as well as different reference frames of time), there is only one well defined present moment in which perpetual real change occurs (the parts of the physical past and future that may be said to really exist being stored in some possibly higher dimensional space, inside non-physical matter, so they exist in the present, yet hidden, insofar as they exist at all), but faster than light communication is possible as long as it doesn&#39;t change the part of the physical state described by quantum mechanics, which is inherantly incomplete.

Lining up two U-joints so that the direction of rotation in is the same as the direction of rotation out effectively makes it as though there&#39;s one solid shaft. Metaphorically to the polarization example, 100% goes in and 100% goes out.<br><br>2. Transferring a directional rotation around a ninety-degree angle doesn&#39;t work with just one U-joint (it would require an infinite amount of torque due to the conservation of energy). Thus, 100% can go in but nothing (in terms of torque) comes out.<br><br>3. Connecting a U-joint at a forty-five degree angle and then another U-joint at a forty-five to that one alters the direction of rotation ninety degrees... but note that it actually works. Instead of making light appear brighter like in the video, adding this third &quot;filter&quot; (U-joint) to the setup decreases the workload. I haven&#39;t mathematically confirmed that the equation is the same for determining how much the workload changes on this U-joint setup, but I believe it follows the same formula as the photon pass rate.<br><br>Hopefully somebody understands this cryptic explanation.

If a disc is close to perpendicular to the slats it is going to bounce back.

Think about the light spot of a magnifying glass. Essentially the filters are also diffusing some of the light out and away from the situation. This video also assumes that the piling up of photons produces a linear increase in brightness, when light is known to have quadratic falloff. This is why the brightness of the end result happens to be brighter when more filtered are used. The additional filter allows more of the positive oriented photons to hit at the right place, leading to less cancellation of brightness and more luminosity (due to angle). To the subsequent filters, the end result is more photons oriented in such a way as to display brighter. With only two filters, the resulting interaction of waves produces a cancellation of brightness that appears to be a logical filtering of a certain number of photons. But it is not a measure of photons but of brightness. So the brightness is the issue, not a count of photons. Brightness is based on the composite photon angle, that is altered in a non-visible way with each filter added. The experiment is not measuring the amount of light going through the filters but it is showing us the resulting brightness due to the interaction of the filter angles. We have to understand that the angle of the light itself is not a hidden factor, in fact it is revealed by this experiment when we interpret it correctly.

From every entangled experiment I&#39;ve seen performed, the results are invariably that entangled particles always retain the same states even when one of them is altered and the other is not interacted with... Maybe this breaks the locality principle somehow, but I don&#39;t particularly care about that. What I do care about is whether or not a filter actually has some probability of altering the polarity of light passing through it based on how different the filter and light&#39;s polarities are. What seems perfectly intuitive is that closely aligned polarities have a higher probability of being shifted. This would mean that you could in theory with an infinite number of perfect filters each rotated infinitesimally, change 100% of the polarity of a polarized laser, to be a different polarity on the other side. Of course this is also physically impossible because infinite qualities are pointless to speculate about in a practical environment.<br>This principle of making very small adjustments over many iterations in order to circumvent a problem that cannot be solved in a single operation, is a fundamental idea.<br>I don&#39;t see it addressed why this can&#39;t be and isn&#39;t the most rational explanation for what&#39;s happening with the light filters.<br>It seems almost like the paradox only exists entirely due to a highly flawed approximate understanding of light that isn&#39;t accounting for the fact that light is more complicated than just addition and subtraction of a single variable.<br>And to be clear, I don&#39;t mean that there&#39;s some hidden variable that determines whether the light should pass through or not... I mean that treating the pass or fail of the test as a fundamental property at all is far too general and ignored too much of the behavior.

Maybe if we could have better understanding of the direction the photon is being altered/curved we might have the answer.

I.e. the sum of entangled photons passing their respective filters A (0 degree) + filter B (0+22.5 degree) give 85% passing...and entangled photon 1 passing thru A (0 degree) + photon 2 passing through C (0+45 degree) give 50% passing - and the \u201cissue\u201d being \u201cwhy is the photon probability passing through the separate AB/BC and AC filters 85% and 50% respectively, when it should behave like 100% if taken in \u201cisolation\u201d?\u201d<br>4) My question is, are these entangled photons passing through the filters at the same time or is it passing through A before B or C, but far enough as to have the effect observed at B or C occur \u201cfaster\u201d than the speed of light if physical propagation is assumed (is this where the faster than light comment comes from)? Whether the passage of the photon thru the different filters occurs instantly or after a \u201cdelay\u201d, it would suggest that photons (or perhaps even all electromagnetic waves) that are exactly in-phase with each other form a \u201cconnection\u201d (can influence each other) that spans all of \u201cspace\u201d instantly and they form part of the same connected \u201cwaveform\u201d. However, their observed transfer of energy i.e. \u201cdetection\u201d occurs when the wave form is disrupted in a location, but without disruption exists as a lattice covering all of space. One problem with this idea is that photons literally travel at the \u201cspeed of light\u201d I.e. light from the sun has a time-delay to reach our \u201cdetectors\u201d once emitted from the source. Perhaps to explain this, the EM lattice encompasses all of \u201cspace\u201d instantly (it is itself \u201cspace\u201d, but it is the \u201cenergy transfer ability\u201d of each particular \u201cradiation\u201d (photons in this example) that occurs at radiation-specific \u201cfrequencies\u201d which gives the perceived time component (because frequencies vary between waves of different frequencies, I.e. \u201ctime differential\u201d) when \u201cdetected\u201d/interacting with something - meaning the outcome when manipulating in-phase EM radiation should have the same outcome as when modulated in the same order/sequence, despite being separated by space because \u201cspace\u201d exists to serve as a dimension for \u201ctime\u201d to exist, but it is really only the \u201corder of modulation\u201d of the waves that matter?

That&#39;s all the Bell&#39;s Inequalities state. 0nly a setup such as the following would actually prove &quot;spooky action&quot; between the pair. First, particle A of entangled pair is aimed at alternatively vertical and horizontal polarizing filters (only 50% of time will it successfully pass either). If Particle A passes, a filter is then quickly set to the same orientation for particle B which then passes through it (100% of the time). Now, particle A is passed through a filter at 45 degrees (after which we can ignore it) and then particle B is passed through a cross filter (rotated 90 degrees to the first filter). If in fact a rotation has occurred via spooky action in Particle B as a result of Particle A successfully passing through a 45 degree filter (again 50% of the time, so there is only going to be an end result 25% of the initial Particle A runs) then Particle B should sometimes pass through a horizontal filter (50% of the time). If no rotation was imparted to Particle B as a result of Particle A passing through the 45 degree filter then the horizontal filter should act as a cross filter and block Particle B 100% of the time. Since the null result is indicative, this method has the benefit of avoiding detection loopholes completely.  This experiment would also demonstrate no actionable information can be transmitted faster than speed of light merely because a single wave function might link distant particles. This is because the experiment doesn&#39;t demonstrate anything until Particle B&#39;s filter is correctly oriented based on what happened with Particle A, and this information (the proper filter orientation) still needs to be transmitted conventionally.

However, when we introduce another filter let&#39;s say C at 30 degrees with A in between, A first allows all vertical vibrations, if we break this vertical vibrating light into Acos30 and Asin30 then the cos30 component vibration passes through C (think of a polariser as a slit which allows only the vibration aligned with slit to pass) and everything gets else blocked, now when the light finally passes B, we know that B is at angle 60 degrees with C so we component Acos30 again into Acos30cos60 and Acos30Sin60 and only the Acos30cos60 PASSES and hence we have some light.

The shown experiment (first part) can easily be explained by classical maxwells theory. The solution is very easy, because the filters just filter out vector components of the field and therefore inserting the 45 degr filter enables the light to pass the 0degr-90degr filter-pair. The inserted complication within the &quot;quantum&quot;-explenation in my opinion is a first warning sign for something going wrong with the whole theory.<br>The fancy explenation of the second part by the assumption that the polarization of a photon only exists in one definite way when measuring it, is in my opinion a nonsensical concept, because the measurement process itselfe is a process, that is part of the universal system. And if we assume that quantum theory is the underlying theory, this process can not be fundamentally probabalistic, because the equation of motion of the theory, that describes the dynamic of the system, is a deterministic equation (dpsi = -iH/h psi dt). This shows that the whole theory and the probabalistic interpretations are just very effective describtions of something deeper, that we have not yet understood at all. The &quot;proof by contradiction&quot; in my opinion just shows, that even in special relativity we do yet understand something wrong. Seriously - the claim, that there are properties in the world, that can in principle not be explaint by hidden, not knwon &quot;variables&quot;, is not something a real scientist would not accept without closing his field of work. Packed with this pseudo-intellectuell interpretations of &quot;oh the world is only real, if we look at it...&quot; this is the most epic excuse of modern physics in my opinion, and perfectly hides the huge problem in our understanding that we currently have.<br>But such pseudo-interpretations will not help us further. We&#39;d better go back and find out, where we have understood something wrong. Going back to Einsteins, Plancks and Schr\u00f6dingers ideas, and readapting the thinking of these persons, will help a lot more, I would say. And dealing with the thinking of thouse people - who essentially opened this field of physics by the way - one gets aware, that they never had taken these probabalistic interpretations seriously.<br>THIS should be shared, such that everyone can understand, that these &quot;fundamental&quot; conclusions of a theory, that is to so high degree effective, should not be taken too seriously. Quantum theory is a good theory to a certain degree. But at some point it just blows up in complication. And this is not because physics gets more complex, if you go deeper (if you think this, you listened too often to the fancy philosophical quantum jabbering of some people nowerdays), but because the theory goes into a wrong direction.

The source of light doesn&#39;t change in either of those spaces but it&#39;s relation to its surroundings changes how it appears. Second theory is light taking on 3 potential states as it passes thru a filter (again assuming 100% passing) It either passes thru with no interference. Passes after hitting the filter but does not combine with other photons, or passes after hitting the filter and combines with other photons. Using the flashlight example again, if someone was to shine a flashlight on your back you wouldn&#39;t see it unless it&#39;s light bounced off surrounding things...letting you know the light was on by evidence and not a direct observation of the light itself.

Just for arguments sake lets say it was a particle shaped like a pin and that different colours of light were different lengths of pins. A vertical pin of two millimeters viewed head on would one millimeter high if it was tilted back at 45 degrees. If that pin was tilted back 90 degrees it would almost disappear. If we assume we have two grates (filters) made up of bars very close to the diameter of these hypothetical pin shaped light particles and laid them flat to each other so the bars of each were rotated 90 degrees to each other then we would create a matrix of holes the size of which the particles could pass through and because of the orientation could not be seen. Now if we were to add a third grate (filter) at a slight angle the pins would be coaxed to spin clockwise or anti clockwise to our perspective. Now what would happen if instead of our filter being made of bars it was made of sheets and we twisted the sheets so that the pins going in at a vertical direction came out at a horizontal direction.

Next, draw a Bell curve that begins at ~0y at 0 degrees, hits maxY ~100Y (arbitrary value) at 45 degrees and goes back down to ~0y at 90 degrees. Next, draw a second identical curve with its maxY ~100Y displaced 45 degrees, at 90 degrees on the X. The area covered by the two should be light passing through both. Next, calculate the area within the two curves, then draw a new Bell curve (on a clean graph) that has the same distance of distribution (0Y at two points 90 degrees apart) but with a new maxY so that the area of this graph equals the  area of overlapping two graphs earlier. The area should btw be 50% of the area of the very first curve. Next, copy this graph and displace it 45 degrees again, same procedure as before just with a slightly lower area. The new overlapping area is the amount of light that would pass through all 3 filters, or Bell-curves, equal to 0.25 of the original. <br><br>If you instead do just the first two curves but 90 degrees apart, you&#39;ll end up with 0% of the area. <br><br>If you introduce more steps of 22.5 degrees displacement between each new filtering curve, calculating the area and redistributing it to a new 90 degrees long Bell-curve between each time, you&#39;ll see that when having gone through a total of 90 degrees change (5 filters including the first) you&#39;ll have significantly more total area in your last curve than in either of the previous experiments, about 0.522 of the original.<br><br>What were doing here, is abiding by the principle that every time we measure the polarization, in terms of probability, we also affect it, by calculation how much should have gotten through (the area of the overlapping curves) and then accepting that due to our filtering measurement this should now have a probability curve centered around the filtering polarization orientation (transforming the area back into a correct probability curve).<br><br>Horrible disclaimer!: I visualized this on the train to work as a customer service consultant - in other words, I have no formal or professional expertise and have not yet done the above myself.

This is why none get through 90 degrees lens, because they don&#39;t have enough energy.<br><br>Now, based on observation, lets say it take 15 energy units to rotate 22.5 degrees, but 50 energy units to rotate 45 degree.  This would line up with the experiment as well. As passing through A-&gt; B leaves 85% of the photons, those same photons then going through C only need 15 energy units to pass through, leaves 70% of the photon.  <br>But, going from A-&gt;C, they need 50 energy units, and that leave us with a 50% photons passing through.<br><br>It like comparing climbing a set of stairs one by one, or jumping up from the bottom to the top.

Some recent work in theoretical physics (actually due to two finding a connection between two of Einstein&#39;s works known as ER = EPR - for the fact that it proposes a connection between the results described by Einstein-Rosen bridges and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox) has suggested that entanglement may be the result of dramatic curvatures is spacetime (i.e. &quot;wormholes&quot; or Einstein-Rosen bridges) which allow for the seemingly &quot;instant&quot; communication between the entangled pairs - actually just taking a geometric shortcut. If this view turns out to be correct, then the EPR paradox doesn&#39;t actually place locality and realism into conflict.

It&#39;s an aether perturbation. <br>Take the Michelson/Morley experiment (the only experiment that inevitably &quot;defuted&quot; the theory of the aether), it&#39;s a faulty experiment.  The idea is based on the Earth moving through the aether (an electromagnetic field that fills all of space, or everywhere there is matter), where you &quot;should&quot; be able to measure the EM force of the Earth moving through this stagnant EM field. <br><br>The M/M experiment is faulty tho. They claimed to disprove the aether, due to barely getting any shift in their interferometer, when they should be getting a huge displacement.  So, they &quot;disproved&quot; the aether, which led way to particle physics, but there&#39;s one massive problem: you can&#39;t use an interferometer to detect this EM pressure, while in a huge magnetic field (the Earth&#39;s magnetic field - Aurora borealis, shield from the sun).<br><br>In fact, if you spin an interferometer on its side (perpendicular to the Earth&#39;s surface), you can measure the magnetic pressure, because the field is greater as you go up into the atmosphere (lighting is created from the difference in this pressure), but you can&#39;t measure something weak as a stagnant EM field.  It&#39;s like trying to measure the wind pressure in a driver in a car, but with the windows rolled up; the pressure is there, but a barrier prevents the measurement. <br><br>What this means, the M/M experiment being the ONLY refuting experiment, is that the aether is still a valid theory to be studied (being a classical idea since the Greeks, long before the Newtonian theory).<br><br>What this also shows is that it makes more sense to think of light as a wave, not a particle.  The only reason for the idea as a particle, mainly has to do with the aether theory being (falsely) debunked, but also how light carries a charge (this all makes sense in the aether theory btw).  One fundamental issue is studying EM interactions, using EM sensors; it becomes unclear when you&#39;re receiving a charge vs manipulating a charge. <br><br>So, detecting EM radiation (like beta or gamma radiation) can be unclear, if some particles (not denying particles btw, just photons and electrons) naturally emit an EM displacement and can be confused at the &quot;field&quot; that makes this occur.<br><br>Another thing to keep in mind is that the aether has two major forces to consider: one being a magnetic (or stimulated) field or gravitational field.  In this case, the aether becomes the field that mass can pull on, like a huge spinning ball in a fluid.  So, no need for an Einstein spacial divit, it&#39;s just a tug in this EM fluidic field.  So, not only can aether describe the EM spectrum, but also gravity. <br><br>In an age where standard model is replaced by standard model 2 and now replaced by the &quot;higgs field&quot; (which is just the aether, btw), it makes sense to clarify any studies that tossed out completely sane ideas we used to rely on.  The aether theory is still 100% valid, denying that means ingnorace to the study that disproved it.  <br><br>Sure, it seems simple and Newtonian, but there&#39;s clearly a problem with the M/M experiment, which means the idea of photons really doesn&#39;t hold much weight over a field that carries charge.  Not only does the aether explain gravity, light (and the EM spectrum), magnetism, particle radiation and the speed of &quot;light&quot;, it also explains dark matter, gamma forces on radiation, electricity, particle existence and charge exchange within particles...<br>and also why light is a wave.<br><br>Stop letting foolish scientists tell you otherwise.", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T14:51:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miu Miu Koo", "comment_text": "Great work I am  useless at math but i see the sunglasses thing So cool\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T14:27:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Darin Smith", "comment_text": "We&#39;re going to have to better understand photons themselves to untangle this.

The amount of light that passes though is almost the same when the lenses are 0 and 1 degrees off from each other, but the amount of light that passes through when the lenses are at 89\u00b0 is way more than when the lenses are 90\u00b0 apart.

But as we know it doesn&#39;t, we can assume that the light leaving a filter will be polarized in a manner similar to a normally distributed probability curve with the maximum at the mean direction (in this case the angle of the filter) and decreasing as you increase or decrease the angle until certain outer limits where it diminishes completely. From the video we know that a rotation of 90 degrees on either side is required to completely block out the light so the distribution function will range from -90 degrees to + 90 degrees around the angle of polarization. <br>Further, another fundamental assumption made in the video is that the light is getting blocked and allows a certain polarized direction to pass. But, it is more helpful to think of the filter rather as a source emanating light with a certain polarization distribution (described previously) using the incoming light. <br>So when the light leaves filter A (angled at 0 degrees), it has the polarization distribution with a maximum a 0 degrees and outer limits at +90 and -90 degrees. Hence when filter C (angled at 90 degrees) is used, the light is completely blocked. However, when filter B (angled at 45 degrees) is added, the light leaving filter B will have the polarization distribution with a maximum at 45 degrees and outer limits at +135 and -45 degrees. Now, when filter C (angled at 90 degrees) is added after filter B, the distributed polarization of the light leaving filter B enables C to act as a source and the light passes through albeit very dimly. I suspect specific brightness values could also be explained using the concept of the polarization distribution and would validate this whole concept. <br>This is just my opinion although I feel it reasonably explains the experiments.

I dont know alot about bells theorem to have any accurate say and thats not saying much. Photons dont experience time like we do. Their life is instant.

Energy or information cannot be lost either and that is very telling. Two entangled particles, one is measured and the superposition is determined. The other matches it instantly. If it took time to match the other there would be a loss of information. If i were a photon and wanted to travel to jupiter the moment i left, i arrived at jupiter. Thats from my perspective. Theres no wait time. Thats what we see with entangled particles. There is no wait time they experience.

Where he is at that moment determined where he traveled to. Everywhere else was just a probability until time was added back in or a &quot;measurement&quot;.

I read the comments. The comments made me look into the details in the video, and here&#39;s my insights: this video causes unnecessary confusion.<br>The video bases everything on the assumption that &quot;but it does not equal when we add it up separately!&quot;.  Well just like sin(60deg) is not equal  to sin(30deg) + sin(30deg). I&#39;m an engineer, and though I don&#39;t deal with optics, it seems that the video wildly overcomplicates things for a much simpler phenomenon, adding unrelated popular science topics to it to make it sound even smarter (the quantum entanglement that does not introduce any meaningful conditions to the experiment).<br>Can someone verify, what am I missing? <br>The amount of light blocked between two filters is a function of the angle difference between the preceeding filter and next filter, but it just seems that it is not a linear (proportional) function. That&#39;s it. <br>So the light blocked  = f(angle). <br>f(45deg) is NOT equal to f(22.5deg) + f(22.5deg). <br>Or like if rotation between filtres would be x, and blocked light would be f=x^2  ---&gt;  for 3 degrees diff between filter A and B and 4 degrees diff between B and C, we get the amount of light blocked =  3^2 + 4^2 = 25. But then we remove the middle filter, and the difference becomes 7 degrees. With that the amount of blocked light becomes 49 (more than 25), even though we have less filters! And we see that 7^2 != 3^2 + 4^2. <br>What is so exciting about it?<br>When we work out the precise equation for this relation between filters (the video is so foggy on telling us if this equation is known already or not...) it will just come out as non linear and that&#39;s it. Are we really expecting it to be linear? (I can&#39;t make it out from the video...?) If we are not sure that it absolutely surely should be linear, why is it a paradox? Not all physical quantities can be added up or interchanged (superposition).<br>To me it seems that the video makes the wrong assumption that it is all linear and we should be able to add it, which just does not seem to be the case. The analogy around the 8th minute just seems not applicable and confusing - Venn diagrams don&#39;t really fit the narrative there making it ultra confusing visually, suggesting that we can group fotons/people by adding corresponding circles (that visually resemble the filters themselves!) and that the position of the circles on the diagram and how they arrange the space and how these areas can be added/subtracted proves that it should directly correspond to how much light subsequent filters capture. Also i think, there are areas in the diagram that don&#39;t fit the narrative, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=6m18s\">6:18</a> we have this group of 6 photons that &quot;Pass through A&quot; and &quot;Pass Through C&quot; but don&#39;t pass through B - these don&#39;t make sense at this moment and only come into play later - the venn diagram is again (in my opinion) not the right visualisation tool for this situation, adding to the confusion. This whole approach requires the introduction of totally othervise reduntant &quot;hidden variables&quot; that again, add to the confusion. In reality it seems that there are no hidden variables, and we just capture photons by increasing the angle between subsequent filters however it just is just not linear. <br>The question I want to ask, am I missing something above? I really want to understand why this would be so shocking (maybe the video is too complicated to me...). It seems to me that it may appear counterintuitive at first , if you think of the filters as some sort of rigid barriers that block light, logically the more rigid barriers you have, the less light goes through (and friggin video seems to imply that around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=0m53s\">0:53</a> &quot;all these filters do is remove light&quot; this may manipulate someone to conclude that &quot;no fiters remove no light, more filters remove more light&quot; the proper sentence voiced there should read &quot;the angle between the filters has a key role in removing light. With one filter you don&#39;t have this angle (angle between two filters), so no light is removed&quot;.)<br>It just seems to be a reasoning error, the real barrier is the angle between the filters, not the quantity of filters. This filter just gets improportionally stronger, the more rotated it gets vs the earlier filter. You could probably line up 90 filters each rotated by +1 deg or so, and have a minimal amount of light blocked this way.<br> It does not appear to be &quot;impossible&quot; given the above. Is a linear function expected there and that&#39;s why it is so shocking???????<br>The &quot;Impossible numerical weirdness&quot; (I quoted the video there) is impossible only if we assume direct proportion and try to &#39;bruteforce add&#39; all the components.<br> pls someone explain<br>If I&#39;m right this would mean that video had wrong assumptions, poor choice of tools to explain the phenomenon and introduced tons of unnecessary confusion (hidden variables, venn diagram). And don&#39;t get me started on the entanglement part of the video - this just seems to be unrelated to the venn diagram part of the video where we have regular particles, and refers to experiments on entangled light particles and how they get filtered - making it a different topic, though still being used to push rhetoric based on the &quot;we should be able to add everything together&quot; assumption, not giving us any more information (just confusing a bit more with buzzwords - generally saying that if you have two identical light particles, and do separate experiments on them you still get the same results). Dragging quantum entanglement into this is like saying &quot;if we performed the same experiments on the orbit of the biggest black hole in the galaxy (can you imagine how powerful and black it is?), even though it clearly affects the photons, the results would still be the same! Mind blown!&quot; &lt;- thats because it is not related to particle being entangled, nor being on the orbit around a black hole. It just depends on the angle between subsequent filters, but I guess it is too boring of a premise for a 17 minute video...<br>It just feels like someone forced the use of Venn diagrams just because they look like filters in the shot around the 1 minute mark and forgot that not everything is linear and one does not have to drag in quantum mechanics/entanglement to talk about this...<br>If I missed something I&#39;m sorry, I never said I was a good engineer;) still I would like to know where I&#39;m wrong, this video and other people&#39;s comments have me puzzled", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T16:48:55Z", "likes_count": 124}, {"comment_by": "brzpicnic", "comment_text": "I watched this video through Polaroid sunglasses and it certainly helped filter some of the entangled photons....

But now it is traveling in a different direction, thus the &#39;state&#39; of our bullet has changed. Therefore, placing a second 45 degree piece of sheet metal would again give the same chance of a ricochet as it has the same relative angle to the bullet.

The only reason it seems like evidence against hidden variables is because for some reason faster than light communication is apparently more crazy to accept than things don&#39;t really concretely exist. <br><br>Both are honestly crazy, neither one makes more sense than the other. And at the end of the day, both work out mathematically, just the realism one takes a bit more work and math. <br><br>And by Occam&#39;s Razor that makes us want to accept locality over realism. But Occam&#39;s Razor isn&#39;t a rule either, it&#39;s just a suggestion. The simpler explanation is more likely to be right. Or in this case, the simpler math.<br><br>At the end of the day, in the current state of math and science, both are technically unfalsifiable. So although one is simpler than the other, neither is correct. You can&#39;t make that assumption nor suggestion on unfalsifiable claims. They&#39;re both nuts.<br><br>If science wants to find truths, which it does, it shouldn&#39;t make assumptions. It should test and adapt based on results. Not realism is true, not locality is true, not shut up and calculate. <br><br>I mean that&#39;s how a century of physics almost broke down with CPT symmetry. By making assumptions without testing it, and performing tests based on those assumptions. <br><br>I know scientists are trying to get to the bottom of it and we&#39;re getting closer all the time, but it frustrates me when when they find evidence on local and real mutual exclusivity but present it as a case against realism. <br><br>Cuz instead of actually trying to find out how the universe works in an unbiased manner, they&#39;re trying to prove one thing over another possible solution. <br><br>Localism might be how the universe works. In which case, this might be faster. But realism might also be how the universe works, faster than light communication may be possible at least in the quantum scale, there may be something beyond the quantum realm.<br><br>In which case this makes things exponentially slower, with only evidence of their exclusivity being chalked up as evidence for one and against another.<br><br>I mean imagine if, when we couldn&#39;t test beyond the size of atoms, we justified every bit of evidence as there not being any underlying variables in atoms? <br><br>There&#39;s obviously the quantum realm but, you know, technically that&#39;s more math and isn&#39;t simple enough on the scale of atoms so let&#39;s just Occam&#39;s Razor that away and just chalk it up to every atom just has its quirks.<br><br>I mean, that&#39;s essentially what happened. Explaining it away as every atom just has its quirks and there&#39;s anomalies just ended up eventually being too complicated we had to accept the quantum realm to simplify things when we go smaller.<br><br>I mean explaining the flow of fluids through the motions of every individual atom in a small container of billions of atoms is technically more right but also infinitely more work than the heuristical fluid dynamics.<br><br>We don&#39;t Occam&#39;s Razor it away completely, we just want equations that work on a bigger scale to simplify things. But the smaller scale will always be more correct. Just impossible to fully solve or even simulate with the strongest computers.<br><br>So if there are underlying variables in quantum mechanics, that&#39;s not making things more complicated, that would just be a different scale. Different equations for different scales.<br><br>At the end of the day, something is wrong. Quantum mechanics and general relativity hate each other when they meet. There&#39;s a problem somewhere. Maybe string theory solves it. Maybe it doesn&#39;t, because we don&#39;t really have the capabilities to actually test it on a falsifiable scale yet.<br><br>Sorry for my rant and tangents, but seriously, there&#39;s no evidence against realism.

This is a key aspect I feel they ignored too much, because if you do the math by considering each polarizer one at a time and reevaluating the angle after each, you find that the phenomenon makes perfect sense. This is even more true when you understand how the projection of a wave onto the transmission angle determines the resulting intensity. The most problematical part about this is the fact that they&#39;re ignoring the polarization from the first filter, which is itself polarizing the light in the first place. Actually, this little bit from one lecture sums it up: &quot;It&#39;s important to realize, however, that we are dealing with a vector wave here, and not just an attenuation of intensity due to passing through filters. For example, the addition of more polarizers does not always mean the final intensity will decrease.&quot; This is not to say the video is wrong, it&#39;s just making a claim about how quantum physics creates emergent properties in wave and particle physics using binary sources, in a confusing manner, at least to anyone who hasn&#39;t heard that previous phrase before ;-).", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T21:36:53Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "fenhir1972", "comment_text": "To much fast, to much &quot;tecnic&quot;,<br>I can&#39;t follow it, sorry.", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T16:38:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blockbuster999", "comment_text": "I like to imagine that this phenomenon is so unfathomably strange and fundamental, that it took the collaboration of two of the best explainers to ever grace the face of YouTube to conquer it.", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T11:50:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JeremySlather", "comment_text": "It&#39;s because you should see it as a sen(x) curve...", "comment_date": "2020-04-15T03:31:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Russian Acorns", "comment_text": "Heyyy I have a beard and glasses and I like minute physics", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T16:12:24Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "jesus juice", "comment_text": "The property of the photon changes as it passes a filter due to disturbance.

There&#39;s nothing saying that the &quot;waves&quot; are actually being blocked... We can only measure the output and such in the sense of &quot;is it there or not&quot;... But again, stop thinking that they are being blocked, and start thinking that they are being realigned. If they are waves, then having an inverted wave traveling with you would cancel you out. Thus making things seem darker. Basically you are aligning the waves in certain proportions based on their already existing form. When you add a second filter at 90, you are trying to again shift how the waves are traveling. During that additional shift, it happens to equal things out as some shift one way while others a different way, which causes it to all go black. Basically you&#39;ve made them equally inverse and thus cancel out nearly completely. When you add the B filter, you are not shifting them as much, and as such not as many of them are flipping their positions so you get only a slightly darker outcome. Then when you have filter C after the filter B, it&#39;s again not shifting as much as it would have been at the 90 degree angle, and thus you csn actually get a LIGHTER outcome because they would have shifted even more to allow less inverse waves and thus less canceling out.<br><br>I&#39;m on my phone so this is kind of difficult to really get out in a quick go at it...

Glad the video points out that static measurements don&#39;t work. &quot;Simple counting problems&quot; just cannot explain this phenomenon however, and I got annoyed that much time was spent dwelling on that fact without any explanation of why the cos square formula came to be and why the numbers are weird.

When a light source emits light, it is typically uniform in polarization orientation, but any matter it encounters will reflect, refract, or absorb the light waves. Just completely ignoring the absorption aspect because I have never had to deal with it, any instances of the other two will result in a polarization shift of varying degrees and percentages of light affected. Polarized glass is no exception.  The only difference is, the light that is reflected/ absorbed.... (not quite sure on that part), is at a perpendicular or 90 degree orientation from your new polarization standard coming through your first lens. So what I have concluded from this is that 15% of the light that passes through the lens has been refracted to a 90 degree orientation relative to the following lens at 22.5 degrees, 50% at 45 degrees and so on. However if your lenses are radially polarized, I believe the concept will still apply. I am just not as familiar with the mathematical equations/ graphs to represent it. I don\u2019t have any time to test this myself, but if you ever get the chance I would be very grateful if you could test it for me and put another video out.

However, what is important here is the order you place the lenses. Had we taken the middle lens (lens B) out and placed it on top of lenses A and C the final light intensity would be 0%. The reason is because if we start with lens A, then place lens C on top of it at 90 degrees, it will result on 0% brightness, so adding lens B on top of that at 45 degrees would be 70.71% of 0%, which would be 0%.

There is no need in &quot;hidden variables theory&quot; to allow a photon to change its polarization state after passing the first filter and so change the way how it interacts with the next filter.\r<br>\r<br>To sum the things up:\r<br>\r<br>1. a filter does change the way the photon will interact with the next filter, it changes the photon polarization state\r<br> so that it becomes alligned with a polarization direction of the filter it has just passed.\r<br>2. this fact only allows easy calculation of probabilities of how a single photon passes a set of filters. No any weirdness here (except that the passing of each photon is probabilistic). At least no weirdness in how probabilities are calculated and how adding filters changes the transparency of the system - which is what is the author&#39;s concern.\r<br>3. this has notihng to do with Bell Theorem and correspondent experiments which indeed greatly refuted the idea of &quot;hidden variables&quot;\r<br>\r<br>4. the &quot;photon polariation state&quot; is not a &quot;hidden variable&quot;.

My argument is that polarizing filters twist the beam of light.  So, the beam that goes in is off by X degrees from the beam that comes out.  So, if a polarizing filter can accept light that is +- 10 degrees (80 degrees to 100 degrees), some of the resulting photon&#39;s polarity is rotated by an additional 8 degrees (plus or minus).  Thus you have a range of photons coming out in the range 73 degrees to 108 degrees.  In this example a polarizing filter at 22.5 degrees would let about 80% of the photons through and the resulting &quot;C&quot; filter would let another 80% of those passing through B through C.  <br><br>So to be clear, the theory is that some or all of the photon&#39;s are altered when they pass through the filter the same way photon&#39;s are refracted when they pass through other mediums of different density...like air, water or glass.  Except they are not refracted.  I propose that photon polarity is rotated by a mechanism similar mechanism to refraction.<br><br>There are two possible mechanisms for this refraction.  One is that the absorption of polarized light has a boundary condition within the polarizing filter.   This is the reflection on the boundary layer creating polarization.<br><br>POLARITY SHIFT DUE TO REFLECTION<br>You could think of a polarizing filter as a series of bars where light passes through imperfectly.  <br>|   =  |   =  |  where photons of a given orientation can pass through:<br>|+=+|+=+|   (In this case the &quot;+&quot; is a photon passing through)<br>If the &quot;+&quot; is rotated 8 degrees it still passes through.  However, 3 % of the photons passing through hit a boundary and are refracted back into the the 72 to 108 degree beam... possibly proportionally to how far they were out of rotation.<br>In this scenario you have your highest concentration of light between 72 degrees and 75 degrees and 105 degrees and 108 degrees.  This is because 3% of the light is interacting at the boundary layer and reflecting back in--rather than being absorbed--at those degrees.  it creates a beam with the highest concentration of light at the boundaries and not at 90 degrees as you would expect.  So If I&#39;ve got 20 degrees of freedom in the beam plus 12% of the beam polarized to where it can interact with the 22.5 degree rotated polarized filter, having further interaction in the 22.5 degree filter and modifying the light stream so that more light would go through the 45 degree filter than would happen with the 90 degree and 45 degree filters alone.  <br><br><br>Infant, based on the data you&#39;ve provided, the math would look like this:<br><br>Light out of A = <br><br>POLARITY SHIFT DUE TO ABSORPTION AND READMITTING<br>When light passes through glass or water, it slows down.  This is due to the photon being absorbed by an atom and re-admitted.  The readmitted light may have a polarity change due to the orientation of the atom in the crystal, how the photon hits the atom relative to it&#39;s polarity and direction of travel.  This is basically how reflection works but due to the light traveling through the medium rather than off the surface it may have different interaction characteristics.", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T13:51:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A A", "comment_text": "\ud83e\udd15", "comment_date": "2019-07-12T11:16:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nick Z", "comment_text": "Would this experiment yield the same results everywhere on the planet?

By introducing a filter which has a predetermined effect upon the polarization of light &quot;particles&quot;, you are ensuring that the 0/90 effect is being manipulated. It&#39;s now a 0/45/90 effect. When discussing angular momentum, you can&#39;t ignore the additional influence. <br><br>To make an example, imagine a comet zooming around in orbit around a sun. Now imagine if there was a second sun with which this comet orbited. It makes one orbit around one sun, and its orbit and momentum carry it into its orbit around the second sun, which throws it into orbit again around the first sun, and on and on this goes. This is like the 0/90 effect where the pattern is predictable  over and over again. <br><br>Now imagine as the comet was being flung towards its orbit around the second sun, it comes under gravitational influence of a large passing body of mass. Maybe not strong enough to move the comets orbit much, but just a little bit. That little bit is all takes to alter the perfectly balanced comets orbit so that in subsequent iterations around its sun, it&#39;s orbit is no longer perfectly balanced. It&#39;s orbit becomes ever increasingly variable, until the inevitable conclusion where either the comets orbits direct it to crash into one of its suns, to be flung off into space, or the variability produces a situation where the comets orbit becomes &quot;balanced&quot; again (repeating). <br><br>The comet is a light &quot;particle&quot;, the suns are the balancing filters 0/90, and the large passing body of mass is the 45 degree filter. Even slightly altering the spin and rotation of the comet causes increasing instability in a predetermined outcome. Similarly, introducing a third influence upon a system which depends on 2 systems in a predefined state, is going to to alter the results.<br><br>If A = Angular Vector probability and Z = percentage of photons arriving at destination, <br><br>it may be fine to say that A(0) + A(90) = Z(0) (0 percent of photons arriving at destination),<br><br>but there is nor mathematical reason to rationally state that A(0) + A(45) + A(90) should ALSO HAVE TO EQUAL  0.<br><br>The equation is changed, and would therefore have a different quantifiable result.<br><br>What am I not understanding?

Some kind of threshold concept might explain this, or really any nonlinear reaction. In one example they encounter one shallow angle after another. In the other example they hit a bigger angle.

You could easily test this by comparing polarising sets of different thickness and opacity, and you should see a variation in the probabilities you&#39;ve calculated.

The model of the photon in GUT-CP is a sphere of charge currents, which currents traverse along great circles on the orbitsphere. The photon, being polarized circularly in native mode, according to GUT-CP,  gets through any filter that is oriented at an angle that exactly fits the orientation of the charge current. No Bell theorem required to solve anything, since there is no mystery in this model of the photon. The GUT-CP is also a hundred times more accurate than the encumbent theory with wave -particle duality at its core, when applied to molecular modeling, than any method using the wave-particle model of matter. That method is the Millsian molecular modeler. No entanglement required in GUT-CP, disproving quantum computers. In fact each of the q-bit computers is a simulator of the q-bit mechanism, further indicating the fallacy of quantum wave-particle duality. GUT-CP was started at MIT by  Herman Anton Haus in 1986. Haus gave a copy of that paper to Randell Mills. John J. Farrell  helped Mills develop the theory at Franklin and Marshall College in 1990. HuubBakker is developing the theory further, in regardsto gravity model thatisa also hundreds of times more accurate then the accepted model. <br><br><a href=\"https://webcast.massey.ac.nz/Mediasite/Play/8ef7e03e26fc458b8eb7f351738f26811d\">https://webcast.massey.ac.nz/Mediasite/Play/8ef7e03e26fc458b8eb7f351738f26811d</a><br>The only mystery is why this extremely accurate theory is looked down on by most theoretical physicists.

Now the 45\u00b0 filter after the 22.5\u00b0 again only has a cos(22.5\u00b0) vertical component to filter out of the wave. This experiment makes more sense if you treat light as an EM wave instead of a particle that can be physically filtered.<br><br>Also note the sense of EM waves changes with reflections/transmissions based on material and angle of incidence only artificial magnetic conductors, AMC, at the frequency of the EM wave will generate the same sense after reflections and is why they are used in antennas to reduce the space between the antenna and ground plane.", "comment_date": "2019-03-10T15:56:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WashingtonWebFoot", "comment_text": "Greatvideobuthadalittletroublefollowingthepace!", "comment_date": "2019-03-10T06:38:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wes johnson", "comment_text": "You make it too difficult.

And 15BC where photon passes B but is blocked by C. The region representing photons passing A and blocked at C includes less than all of 15AB plus all of 15BC. On the extreme right hand side of 15AB there is a small dark space (SDS1) inside both C (so not blocked by C) and A but outside B. On the extreme left hand side of 15BC there is a small dark space (SDS2) outside both C (so blocked by C) and A but inside B . The space inside A but outside C is 15AB+15BC-SDS1-SDS2.  Removing these two small dark spaces from 15AB+15BC shows that the space in A but outside C must be less than 15AB+15BC. So when B is present the number of photons available to C for blocking is much less than 50% of photons passing through A. With B present C can block fewer so more light gets through than when B is not present.\r<br>\r<br>Note that at scenario at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=11m25s\">11:25</a> SDS1 is inside A so the photon can get to B where it passes on to C where it also passes.

When 100% of the photons pass through filter A they are blocked by filter C positioned 90 degrees in a different direction which cancels 100% of those photons which have passed. The tricky part to understand is when filter B is introduced half way in between (or any angle other than 90 degrees). The way I understood the process and would try to explain it is that if the waves of light aren&#39;t being altered in some fundamental way, the filters must have an effect that only affects the passing of photons through a filter screen depending on orientation. This could make it so that filter B essentially cancels out noise the way you would think of sound waves but in respect to light waves. This allows for less photons overall in the venn diagram cross section (middle) but because most of the photons can pass through filters A, B, and C in that region it appears brighter the the observer. Much like how when you have two bright white lights shining on the same wall of different strengths, the weaker white light appears to be black on the wall. This is the same property observed with the filters but in the opposite manner where the area appears brighter because a higher percentage of photons are emerging overall in that region when compared to the others.

I know first hand how they work and, for this reason I disagree with your explanation. Polarized filters do not block 50%. They are known to have an EV correction of minus two stops. One stop is half, or 50%, two stops, half again, or 25%. Cross polarization at ninety degrees, another two stops, 12.5%, then 6.25%. This is commonly called a cold filter and is used in photography of, for example, oil paintings, to reduce or almost eliminate reflective drop outs from an extremely random reflective material. I know because I have used this technique professionally. It is also used, with the appropriate frequency filter, for both infrared and ultraviolet photography to almost completely eliminate the visible spectrum. Polarizing filters are like a pair of blinds or slits. I&#39;m curious to know if they tried the simultaneous testing with instruments both observed and unobserved? Seems like this is just another double slit experiment done twice. Shouldn&#39;t you get different results from observation, just as the original double slit experiment shows? I am leaning toward the idea that I might have some valid theories on how current science is making assumptions about the nature of both particle and quantum physics. But, probably not.

That&#39;s a COMPUTING issue. If a person likes physicists &amp; , one with glasses scratched his car &amp; flipped him off, he won&#39;t like physicists with glasses. HOWEVER, if the pains old &amp; , the rest physicists with glasses they LIKE fresh on there mind, then, it will depend on how recently they&#39;ve had there car scratched &amp; been flipped off, to remind them of the BAD physicist.  Likewise, those factors, can be addictive, OR subtractive, in reality, as, ALL those questions, &amp;, pairings, are asked together, at the same time, in all forms, when dealing with object interactions. Since these experiments, it can be assumed, are on UN polarized light, before the first filter is applied, the sampling is holistic, &amp;, ALL questions are asked.<br><br>Even then, that has NOTHING to do with what&#39;s going on here, &amp;, just goes, more &amp; more, towards me thinking, that, these &quot; quantum fields &quot; , use less logic, on the part of the PHYSICIST , then, even the most BAISIC plebian,  ( yo ) , is capable of understanding &amp; criticizing. In this case, note, that in the case of &quot; brightening&quot;  by the filter, the new &quot; half step &quot; filter, is always placed, BEFORE the 45 degree filter. This theory, for there to be ANY controversy about it, or, for it to be &quot; revolutionary &quot; in any way, must assume 2 ( technically 3 ) things, that, any one, with a BAISIC understanding, knows. 1 , that energy , by its NATURE , doesn&#39;t seek &quot; ground&quot; , ie , the &quot; best &quot; path , for it to be dispersed ( or, as the third part, that light, by its nature, ISNT energy, or, does not CONTAIN energy, is some form, enough to be influenced, by this rule ) . 2 , that, by its nature, a molecule, atom, or matrix , Incapable of absorbing a photon, will reflect, or, REFRACT said photon. Thus, when a new filter is added, since, there is a potential of REFRACTION, will, instead, &quot; mildly &quot; change the angle, of, the incoming light. Baisicly, imagine a baseball pitcher is throwing a ball at a section of metal roofing shingle. This represents the ANGLE of the wave ( aka, the polarization of the light ) . If the pitcher throws the ball then the shingle is parallel,  then, with small exception, the ball goes past. If its perpendicular,  then, with little exception, the ball bounces back. If it&#39;s tilted, so, that it faces an angle, EXACTLY halfway, between those two options, then, it either bounces at a 90 degree angle, or, ROLLS, as, its deflected forward, at, a lesser speed. Now, when DOZZENS of baseballs, are flung at a SCREEN of these tiles, then, they &quot; interact &quot;  drawing the low speed balls, back, with the momentum of the HIGH speed ball&#39;s. In physics, this is usually called &quot; cohesion &quot; , or, how likely something is, to stick to its self. This, in fact, is a similar concept, to ADHESION , the tenancy of a substance, to stick to OTHER objects around it. There seems , for some reason, to be this UTTERLY UNFAILING belief, that , light, does NOT , interact, in ANY way, with other light ( photons ) . We KNOW this to be false, by a simple, transitive property. This is, due to the existence, of black holes.<br><br>Black holes, are a gravity well. Anything with gravity, is, in fact, attracted to anything else with gravity. Thus, anything with gravity, can not escape a black holes gravity well, without being a significant distance from the event horizon, &amp;, having some other force to propel it away from such. Light does not escape the event horizon, &amp;, &quot; lenses &quot; around the black holes gravity. Thus, light, has gravity. Gravity reacts to gravity, thus, in some small way, light effects light.<br><br>Gravity, is, by many, also called mass. Light is assumed not to have mass. Yet, light is assumed to have energy. Thus, technically,  we can treat light being effected by a black hole, as proof of e= mc^2 . Or, that, because light has energy, it has gravity, which, we usually determine, as mass. Now, you may ask &quot; well, why doesn&#39;t light curve in the presence of other light then? &quot; simple. Its escape momentum at &quot;sorce &quot; is greater then, the &quot; gravity &quot; around it, from other light, thus, the effect is minimal, simply &quot; polarizing &quot; the light, a tiny bit, adding &quot; warble &quot; . The difference would only be present, when, large &quot; clusters &quot; of light travel together, creating a consistent gravitational effect, or &quot; cohesion &quot; . Thus, due to constant &quot; warble &quot; , of, the lights combined field, the cohesion of some escaping parts, drags the rest, into a correct &quot; warble &quot; , to, cross the polarized barrier. This is the baisic sort of physics , a PLUMBER may use.<br><br>This also explains some phenomena,  that, is used to JUSTIFY, the &quot; quantum  problems &quot;  of light ( waves ) , &amp; mater, as a paradoxical state, in sub atomic particles. For instance, how do we measure the thickness of a &quot;warble &quot; , &amp; , differentiate, a SEVEARLY warbling photon, from, SEVERAL photons, warbling &quot; less &quot; , sharing the same &quot; thickness &quot; , due, to appearing as a more &quot; wiggly &quot; photon, instead, of there constituent parts? <br><br>This offers a &quot; counter theory &quot; to, the more &quot; modern&quot; version, of, the dual slit experiment, where, the &quot;single photon&quot; , is actually multiple photons, appearing to be one, by, being &quot; packed&quot; together sideways, &amp;, released, at the same time.  This, is actually an invaluable tool, that, by creating more potentials , in various paths, for the photon to act upon, that, can tell us of a &quot; thickness &quot; of photon , that, we couldn&#39;t measure before.<br><br>As well, I should point out, that, all of the electron gun &quot; wave particle duality&quot; experiments , were, tested within , a large, gravitational field ( earth ) . This could, in fact, create &quot; warble &quot; in the electron, in the vacuum, with, nothing to act as &quot; cohesion &quot; , to, straighten its course. Many people have said to me &quot; oh,  come on. Physicists arnt that stupid. they must have tested it in space. &quot; . Apparently, they are. i can find no record of such a test. i checked. EXTENSIVLEY. Thus, even though it&#39;s nearlyimpossible, with current technology, to be free from gravitational annomaly , I would expect, at the very  least, it be tested, I various parts of space, for significant differences in the results, distances before &quot; warble &quot;  ( wave shape ) sets in, &amp;, differences in shape, &amp; placement, its self.<br><br>The examples of quantum mechanics, simply being a tool used by scam artists, is no more present, then in the quantum computer. The quantum computer may register more then 1&#39;s &amp; 0&#39;s , but, any attempted &quot; hacked &quot; computer won&#39;t. Depending on its parts, the computer in question, unless its also a quantum computer, will just register a 1 or a 0 , &amp;, lock the quantum computer out, after a number of tries, eventually, changing its routing methods, calling the quantum computers &quot; hacking &quot; , a simple dose attack. Its hacking capabilities are FAR OVER misrepresented.<br><br>Again, this even goes into SCHRODINGER&#39;S view of things, as, he agreed, quantum physics was idiotic. The cat analogy, was MADE to be exploited, for, it&#39;s simple flaws. Simply put, it takes time for the poison to fill the cage, time for it to circulate, time to enter the cats system, time for it to take effect, &amp;, time, for it to reach leathel, incurable dose. Schrodinger&#39;s model, hinges on SO MANY VARIABLES , that, any answer, save, that the cat is still alive, is utter foolishness, or, rigged by a &quot; mad person&quot; , who, enjoyed killing cats.<br><br>Likewise, quantum immortality is pure fantasy. Any path such a theoretical &quot; quantum photon&quot; would take, leaves a strict case of &quot; the gun never fires&quot;  due to SOME photon being detected , at some point ( no experiment disproves this ) , or, the photon taking BOTH paths, as, there known to do from time to time, &amp;, killing him. There is no reality, where, eventually,  both the guns don&#39;t fire, killing them both. &amp;, if it&#39;s simply rigged not to shoot when light hits a side, the odds are STILL in his favor, meaning, there&#39;s not a &quot; quantum coincidence&quot; just a higher number of universes where he lives. So, by quantum logic, the main universe is where he lives, so, reality should &quot; correct&quot; to where he &quot; lives&quot; that reality, having the largest, &quot; quantum&quot; likelyhood. : ( do you.... do you REALLY not see, how, ridiculous,  &amp;, either compleatly disporoven, or, cleverly designed, to be unprovable, in the same way, that, one could say &quot; you can&#39;t prove there&#39;s NOT a God &quot; , this entire PORTION is?<br><br>Frankly, until we they repeat the &quot; electron gun &quot;experiment, is a series of LESSER , or, if it proves possible, NONEXISTENT large, gravitational fields, then, I don&#39;t see the point of these fields, as, the experiments, which, make up any proof of these theories, remain inconclusive, &amp; FLAWED.", "comment_date": "2019-02-14T04:48:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dracoko0604", "comment_text": "Okay, I know nothing about science on this level, but, what if all photons are related and their variables change based on how many are passed through what?", "comment_date": "2019-02-14T04:34:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "docfaceful", "comment_text": "And that&#39;s why married women behave like their single at the bar.it&#39;s quantum!", "comment_date": "2019-02-14T01:44:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bob V", "comment_text": "Thanks for sharing now I know as much as I did at the start of this video, Not your Bad, mine and my understanding.Light is one of the strangest things we can study.", "comment_date": "2019-02-14T01:08:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "patrick white", "comment_text": "I remember doing this in senior college  physics  in lab.

(Basically it&#39;s gotta bounce through some midpoint that one that is bouncing 90 degrees to it could also go through, which is also a point that would allow passing through the filter).  It seems as though having a similar phase angle (position in the wave&#39;s period) is playing a role and that introducing a third filter that reduces the step between the 1st and 2nd filters would be acting on this periodicity in such a way that what light is let through the second one is more likely to be close enough in phase angle to also make it through the third filter (after all, polarizing coatings are only 100nm thick which is a little less than 4x the shortest wavelength of visible light)...

Measurement or observation is influenced by the thing called timr. In other words, measurement is the distance between two smallest units of time. In other words, while trying to entangle two particles, and taking a measurement at the very instant, involves time having passed at least 1 plank constant. The whole universe is a connected with waves  in different electromagnetic frequency spectra, and has a space of circle and is governed by conservation of energy. That is energy can neither be created or destroyed, so essentially even using poloroids or doing any experiment involves transference of energy between particles being observed and particles observing then. <br><br>So just like Einstein said there is no such thing as unpredictability, because you merely need to know energy transferred between any two particles. <br><br>P.S. The phenomena described in this video are not predictable. To me any other observation would be impossible, because the whole underlying concept of conservation would be broken ( like sum of all the numbers on the number line being less than or more than 0). Where positive numbers are massful particles (combine to form matter), 0 is light. and negative mass forms anti matter. Each wave in the universe is a number, and runs a 360 degree circle with a frequency of the energy wave of the corresponding number, which is why you see a Pi almost everywhere. This is essentially how discrete logarithms work in cryptographic functions, where you run the wave of a large enough prime number, and since prime numbers are not composed of any sub wave, they will in universe as well face the least resistance from any other wave, apart from wave 1 and wave -1 for it&#39;s it&#39;s corresponding anti prime wave.<br><br>Just as why you don&#39;t see negative numbers with positive numbers, you don&#39;t see anti matter with matter in our universe. But every action that we do transforms a particle to it&#39;s corresponding negative part and the negative (for anti matter space) to matter space. And you have no way of knowing which one is which, unless ofcourse you ran the same experiment in anti matter space at an instance before the current instance. <br><br>This same principle adds to energy generation of E=mc2. Where c2 essentially comes from the two cycles formed in a single wavelength = the up wave and the down wave. Why you use light and no other particle is because it has null charge, so it can move in both negative matter and the matter world, with half the time spent in matter world, and the other half in anti matter world. The mass is in the equation because anti matter consumes the matter to give out some of its energy. The fastest way to achieve that is combustion, which involves light transferring matter to anti matter space, also the principle of nuclear fission, where some amount of matter is always lost. This is the transference of dark energy from anti matter world, which is also the energy created in this world. This is essentially how hydrogen atom works, radiating energy from the negative charged electron socket which is the portal of energy from anti matter world releasing certain frequencies into matter world, because just like 1, -1 has direct access to all anti matter.", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T22:54:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nj Osborne", "comment_text": "Entanglement and Collated <br>WHY\ud83e\udd13<br>Light IS Energy<br>Which means Time my friends <br>You need to work in Time/Space <br>Congratulations, <br>You have just proven that time is persistent and operates at the speed of light\u203c\ufe0f<br>Without Time there is No Power <br>Only the potential of power \ud83d\udc48\ud83c\udffd", "comment_date": "2019-02-02T20:43:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex M", "comment_text": "Small details make these explanations plausible like for example you never explained how more light appears when you stack another polarized.

If you think of all particles as a fourth dimensional particle.  In order for a particle to exist, it must experience time.  But existence is strange as well, it&#39;s like binary.  On/Off.  A particle exists, but it&#39;s constantly changing, rotating in every direction.  Stretching, shrinking, overlapping.  We might never be able to 100% view a particle.  That would require a single consciousness to be omniscient of the particle, meaning that that consciousness would create that particle in itself (because any interaction between existence and it&#39;s observation would be skewed).  Which is impossible, because unless we can create a machine that observe every single angle of the particle, then display every piece of information in a way we could perceive it in it&#39;s complete event(every form of radiation a particle can emit), we will never have it&#39;s full information.  Quantum computers may be able to do that.  If we consider particles themselves as infinities of their own experienced time, then how can we perceive the particle if we didn&#39;t create it.  We would have to observe a particle from creation (utter existence) until destruction (utter nothing).  We create particles in CERN and view them, but only through our current technological computing power.  There&#39;s also the forces that are enacted upon the particle.  Any interaction would change it.  Thinking of observing that 100% of a particle, but our observations are only the shadow of the particle, not it&#39;s actual form.  If most particles do move in forth dimensional, then quantum mechanics could probably never compute even a single particle.  A single particle, if in the event form of X,-X (existence, non-existence) would be infinite.

Light refracts as it goes through filters.  Bend it a little and the light covers more area, spreading the energy over a wider area.  The angle of refraction is what you change with each filter, along with a percentage of transmission.  You are still affecting the same amount of light at all times.  Yes every material has a slight blocking effect, some light is reflected, but in filters, much of that is also refracted, changing the characteristics of a percentage of light that passes through.  Refract 45 percent of the total light, the total light hasn&#39;t changed.  Refract another 30 percent of the total light, the total light hasn&#39;t changed, but how much transmitted light you are refracting vs how much already refracted, and how that refraction refocuses already refracted light means that you will be refracting less than the last filter, or less than an average of the filters.  A 25% refraction, with a 45% refraction equates to 70%  divided by 2 which usually is only about 45% max. Add a 60% to the mix and you&#39;ll get 130, divided by 3, which is just over 43% max refraction, giving you more transmission.  Any photographer will tell you, you don&#39;t use polarizers to block light, only to subdue intensity, which means refracting some of it out of focus.  With higher iso and smaller apertures, you can damage sensors with too highly intense light.  Polarizers shift some of that light out of focus, making it less intense.  Density filters actually do reflect more light than they let pass through, only because their coating is more reflective than refractive.  Stacking these filters lets you reflect light away and reduce intensity for extremely long exposures.  High iso and narrow aperture will alow you to focus light more carefully, and you can decide on the effect you really want, without the filter over correcting the focus of your light.  Many polarizers will alter the focus of the light a bit. making it more difficult to get a clear image, though the contrast of the light values in each area of the focal plane will be much higher.", "comment_date": "2018-11-28T01:40:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BigMobe", "comment_text": "I use polarized camera covers in manufacturing vision systems to change how the light is scattered, not to block it.

What if the waves aren&#39;t tilted enough to be blocked at all? Maybe the filter slightly adjusts them and lets them through anyways.

Only one nit-pick.  Bell&#39;s Theorem does not imply a violation of locality.   The reason being is no INFORMATION is spread faster than light.  Wavefunctions are not information, just the results of their measurements.   Which actually the first step to understanding the apparent paradox.  Quantum wave functions for quantum entangled particles are time reversed of each other.  In the same way you can view a quantum teleported particle as still the same particle, you can view an entangled particle as the same particle.   Now at first this seems like time travel.   But as we already stated, no information is exchanged.  You are transmitting an cause back in time to cause an effect.   You are integrating a probability function with a negative value of t -&gt; -t interchange.   Normally we can transmit information forward in time as the result of measurements because either we have a filter, or we compare measurement results.   But there is no such thing as time reversed filter, and to compare measurements can only happen at the speed of light or less...   So no time travel.

The first problem is adressed by minutephysics in the first part of the video, in that the single photon is indeed changed when passing through the polarizer so you can&#39;t exclude hidden variables from that. The entanglement experiment is exactly the same! Instead of one photon you now have two, but they react to the filters in the same way: if one passes through A, the second will too. If one passes through A and the other through B, you now know that the first could also have gone through B. The distribution of probabilities remains the same because it should! Nothing really changed in the system. The only thing this experiment does is enable us to measure 2 hidden variables instead of one by letting the photons go through different filters. That is, we now know that the two photons had the &quot;pass through A, but not B&quot; hidden rule associated with them, instead of only getting to know &quot;pass through A&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t pass through B&quot;. I&#39;m not sure how the numbers in the table were calculated; for example, through AA we don&#39;t have 100% chance of both passing through, we have 50% of both doing it and 50% of both NOT going through, as explained seconds before, and I believe the other numbers have a similar issue?

The first lens flips the photons one way which is why with the second lens at 90 degrees, it blocks 100%. But the reason the middle lens causes the increased light instead of it being blocked is simply because the second lens then flips the photons again which would not be blocked by either since it doesn&#39;t reach 90 degrees from the other 2 lenses. This can be shown again if you take 4 lenses, one at 0, two at 45, three at 90, and four at 125.

I see the light passing thru one filter as another source of light which is slightly polarised but steel has many polarising axels, I will compare it with torch lights which by a difference of a  LASER are more spread.  When an unpolarized light passes thru a polarising filter only 10% of light are absorbed, a polarising filter will absorb mostly photons with polarisation axel close to 90deg. This affirmation makes me also consider that the light passing thru the first filter is repolarised so we have 90% of unpolarized light become polarised and when passing thru second tilted filter it is partially absorbed and repolarised to another degree! That&#39;s why a tilting with 10deg will not give an expected absorption. In the end, the light will be absorbed at 100% only if next to one filter is placed another one at 90deg.<br>Polarisation is used in TV broadcasting via radio waves, a polarising filter is used and it does not absorb the energy radiated it only repolarises the electromagnetic waves. Only waves with a hard incidence angle as close to 90 deg are absorbed.<br>A mechanical analogy is a car with front driving wheels, the energy is transferred with a loss to the traction wheels, 100% at 0 deg, the transferred power drops drastically only as front wheels steer and approach 90deg angle.", "comment_date": "2018-09-30T02:22:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RoRo Rants", "comment_text": "You said it at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=9m16s\">9:16</a> &quot;Faster than light communication&quot;  same as the double slit experiment.

So half the visible light remaining after an initial polarization of 90\u00b0 will be filtered after and additional 45\u00b0 phase shift.

The air between the filters can change the polarization of a certain amount of light because as light flies through air it will (some small percentage will anyway) bounce off of air molecules or dust particles and be changed in their angular velocity.<br><br>It makes 100% perfect sense that adding a stack of polarization filters in a row, slowly from 0 degrees all the way to 90 or even 359 degrees, will let more (or even all) of the light through, because you dont just &quot;select&quot; what light goes through, you actually influence the light itself to become polarized at that angle, and it will do so within a certain tolerance to the perfect angle of polarization.<br><br>When you have a 1 degree difference, and 99% of light is within the 5 degree margin of error to pass through, and now becomes more generally polarized in that direction of polarization, as we go through each successive filter, it actually changes the direction of the light through a full 360 degree rotation (or 90 if that is as far as you go)<br><br>think of it this way, 0 degrees, +- 5 degrees, then 1 degree, +- 5 degrees, there is still 9 total degrees that can go through that second filter, and since almost all the light through the first is now within that angle of accepted polarization, and each filter polarizes the light into 90% of the acceptable range for the next filter, in reality a ridiculously low % of light would be lost. You are just rotating light in a circle.<br><br>In fact, this only applies for vertical (or longitudinal anyway) polarization, light can also be chirally polarized, meaning something that goes through one filter could ACTUALLY be at a different angle afterwards because it rotates along an axis, and now the vertical angle of deflection is different, meaning one photon could go through all the polarization filters and keep its original (chiral) polarization.<br><br>Besides all this again, i know how quantum entanglement works, usually if you measure one photon the other becomes the opposite state, and because usually states are measured using rotation filters, and polarization is a form of that, using entangled photons to measure the state of a photon&#39;s spin isnt going to work very well simply because they are actually spinning in a direction that isnt measured by the rotation filter. There are four axes that a photon can spin along, and yet you only measure one axis and are surprised when you add repeated measurements on that only measure one axis that it can allow 99% of the light measured to be a thing, when measuring it changes it intrinsically to begin with.<br><br>We already knew measurement changes the state of photons, meaning expecting entangled photons to tell you something about entanglement but in the wrong direction, was a silly idea, because one photon is always going to go through the phase angle detector first, and cause the opposite photon to do the opposite angle.<br><br>Honestly you guys should have invested more time into studying the spin of photons and how they are measured, in fact i know one of you guys has DONE a video on that before, so you shouldnt be ignorant of this fact.<br><br>Basically, just because some thing can pass A, and can pass B, doesnt mean it will pass C, and just because a thing can pass A, and pass C, doesnt mean it will pass B, they are ALL independent of each other and they are not equal even though they should be.

I think you have the action of the filters on the photons completely wrong. The filters do not block the photons they simply twist the angle of the waveform of a percentage of the photons so a percentage of those wave forms cancel each other out and therefore do not appear as visible light. When you add the third filter in between it is also twisting the angle of the waveforms of a percentage of the photons before they hit the last filter so that many of the photons again appear as visible light. In addition the percentages that are acted upon at angles that are not 45% just demonstrate very clearly that the interaction between the filters and the angle of the waveforms is a threshold percentage so every waveform beyond a certain angle is bent leaving the rest alone in a progression from 1 degree to 45 degrees.

Thus the assertion that light passing through previous filters isn&#39;t affected by the filter is false. Ironically, this video  demonstrates that percentage of light that is shifted through a mechanism called polarized refraction. Which is 23% at 22.5 degrees.The incidences of polarized refraction is always equal to the differential between the interfering angle of the intermediary filter and the two polarized filter that are perpendicular to each other.

Ihr erkl\u00e4rt die Funktion der Polarisatoren im Video &quot;Etwas Licht Quantenmechanik (mit MinutePhysics)&quot; sehr gut. Wieso kommt Ihr pl\u00f6tzlich auf (wie Bell) auf die dumme Idee, dass ein Polarisator ein reiner Filter ist? Der Polarisator dreht die Polarisationsebene und dabei werden cos\u00b2 Photonen herausgefiltert. <br><br>Doch wenn die Polarisationsebene gedreht ist, macht die ganze ABC-Eigenschaftentheorie keinen Sinn. Damit ist Bells Theorie absolut ungeeignet zur Kl\u00e4rung der Lokalit\u00e4tsfrage. Das ist so, wie wenn jemand behauptet nach klassischer Physik sind R\u00e4der achteckig und nach Quantenphysik sind sie rund. Und alle Experiemente zeigen, dass R\u00e4der wohl rund sind und damit ist die klassische Physik nicht g\u00fcltig. Aber wo bitte behauptet die klassische Physik das R\u00e4der achteckig sind. Und wo behauptet klassische Physik, dass ein Polarisator die Polarisationsebene nicht dreht?<br><br>Die Drehung der Polarisationsebene steht in keinem Widerspruch zur klassischen Physik. Die Ergebnisse, die Ihr sowohl bei den hintereinander geschaltenen Polarisatoren als auch bei den verschr\u00e4nkten und \u00f6rtlich weit entfernten Polarisatoren zeigt, passen ohne jeden Widerspruch zur Lokalit\u00e4t der klassischen Physik. Mit der Verschr\u00e4nkung werden ja per Definition 2 Photonen mit gleicher Polarisationsebene erzeugt. Dann ist es absolut klar, dass:<br>- bei gleicher Polarisatoreinstellung entweder beide durchgelassen oder beide gesperrt werden<br>- bei 22.5\u00b0 Polarisatorversatz werden beim 2. Polarisator etwa 85% derer durch kommen, die beim 1. Polarisator durch kommen sind (und umgekehrt)<br>- bei 45\u00b0 Polarisatorversatz werden beim 2.

Und solange es kein Experiment gibt, dass der Lokalit\u00e4t widerspricht, nehme ich einfach das einfachere Modell. <br><br>Mir kommt die Wissenschaftsgemeine vor, wie beim M\u00e4rchen mit den Kaisers neue Kleider - obwohl Bells ABC-Theorie nicht zu Polarisatoren passt, plappern alle den daraus entstandenen Unfug nach.<br><br><br>English:<br>Hello, I like your videos, because they visualize a lot very good. But I&#39;m very surprised, why you try to explain Bells wrong theory (and of course you fail).<br><br>Polariser are not real filter. You explain the function of polariser in you video &quot;Etwas Licht Quantenmechanik (mit MinutePhysics)&quot;  very good. Why get you suddenly the same silly idea (like Bell) that a polariser is a pure filter? The polariser rotate the polarisation plane. And with this operation, cos\u00b2 photons are removed.<br><br>With rotating the polarisation plane, the ABC attribut theory had no sense. So Bells Theory is absolutely unsuitable to clarify the question of locality. For example I would state, in classical physics, wheels have octagon shape and quantum physics tell wheels are round. Then I did a lot of expermiments, which come to the result, that wheels are round, so classical physics is not right. But where did classical physic tell us that wheels are octagon? And where did calssical physics tell us, that polarisator is not rotating the polarisation plain?<br><br>The rotation of polarisation plane is not in contradiction to classical physics. The results, you showed by serial arrangement of polarisators and the one with the entangled photons and polarisators with big distance are without any contradiction to classical physics.

But this doesn&#39;t seem to acknowledge that we can orient the first filter in any direction and still get 100% through.<br><br>Well what if we can&#39;t observe photons&#39; passage not due to whether the rotation of the particles is correct but because of when they are unable to reorient themselves within the limited geometrical conditions of the filters themselves?  If that&#39;s the case then a 0 degree to 90 degree rotational &quot;switch&quot; in the particles particular orientation is too great a rotational upset and therefore gets stopped up in the process of passing through the filter.  Not in a way that limits their passage but in ways that limit our observation thereof.  However if a difference of 22.5 degrees is used, it&#39;s close enough to the orientation of the first filter that light passing through A can &quot;get&quot; 15% oriented the right way, while a good deal of the rest of the particles gets oriented in another perhaps opposite way.  The observed phenomenon becomes not only possible but expected if that 15% passing through B is able to meet the opposite alignment of particles which previously oriented in the other direction.  In this way the 15% is added to 35% of the original particles which aligned through filter A, reoriented contrary to observation in B, but found an orientation close enough to filter C&#39;s passage parameters to meet the 180 degree opposite orientation of the forementioned 15% of light particles.<br><br>It seems to me that filter B isn&#39;t something we should think of as blocking or not blocking light but rather something which is funneling more light in ways favorable to their passage through filter C and subsequent observation.  I&#39;d be very interested to see what would happen if greater numbers of filters were used breaking up the rotation from the first to the last filter.  If my hypothesis is correct, then either more light may be observed passing through all 4 or 5 filters or we begin to notice predicable patterns of more and less light cyclically being filtered through depending on the number of and orientation of additional filters.<br><br>Follow up vid?", "comment_date": "2018-08-30T04:38:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jakob Alexander", "comment_text": "The result of  A influences B back in time :-)", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T19:59:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jagad Hariseno", "comment_text": "where is the paradox? since you filter at delta = 22.5 degree always 15% reduction then filter at 22.5 degree also 15% reduction.", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T17:51:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mathis noell", "comment_text": "Honestly this result could have bin explained in 3mins using the principle of Superposition in the polarisation of electromagnetic waves.", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T10:00:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Jones", "comment_text": "Look up Kelvin Abraham &quot;tetryonics&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T09:47:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chaos Incarnated", "comment_text": "wtf... our universe is on crack.", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T03:29:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sound Gardener", "comment_text": "Crom frowns at your quantum Venn diagram paradox.", "comment_date": "2018-08-29T02:44:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "deoxyribonucleicacid", "comment_text": "This would be more impressive if it worked by adding the third filter AFTER the first two, rather than in the middle.

For brevity\u2019s sake, we will not talk about movement through the TSC, this only about the three dimensions we experience and whether there is a need for superluminal communication.<br><br><br>So that means every particle already has a \u201cBow Wave\u201d and a \u201cShips Wake\u201d, that is equivalent to a type of degenerate pressure being emitted from a particle. Even though the particle may be an infinitesimally small point, the degenerate pressure and fields surrounding the particle are not and their shape and variables are relative (not in a superposition) to the observer.<br><br><br>Squat, Bank and Bank cushion effects are hydrodynamic functions when a ship is producing waves and an surface reflects those waves back at the ship causing the ship\u2019s relative position to change. Now if only the ship is producing waves when it enters a restricted space like a canal, the tendency of the ship is to favor one side or another and one doesn\u2019t adjust the steering then the ship will run aground on one side or another.<br>At this point, if one compares a ship moving through a stationary canal with a photon moving through a polarized lens; it makes absolutely no sense. By all accounts, every photon should be absorbed by the polarized lens. So obviously a more complex understanding of wave function is needed.<br><br><br>Texas Chicken is not a barbecue recipe, it is a mariner term coined by pilots that work in the Huston Ship Channel. The way this maneuver works, two ships passing each other have to steer directly at each other in order to avoid colliding. If you have steered a ship while doing this maneuver, I will guarantee the first time will seem completely counter-intuitive until you understand the underlying dynamics of wave mechanics.<br><br><br>Now, what happens if there are three ships, two are moving parallel to each other and the other the opposite direction that passes in-between the two parallel moving ships? The waves produced by the two ships traveling in a parallel to each other will push the center ship moving in the opposite direction to a course that is perpendicular to the center point of the line segment that intersects the two parallel moving ships, this happens even if the center ship is coming in on a slightly canted angle.

This would explain why, when the second filter is angled at 22,5 deg. the amount of light passing through both filters is 85% and not 75% as expected. We can calculate therefore,  that 10% of the light waves are being turned on their axees as they pass through the combination of filters. Consiqintly, in the experiment with 3 filters, with 2 at 90deg. and the middle one at 45deg. about 10% of the light is being turned on is linear axis as it passes through the first filter, and again,  about 10% of the light is being turned on its linear axis as it passes through the second filter.  So then by the time that the light reaches the third filter, about 5% of the total starting light has been  turned on its linear axis, and a further 10% of the total light reaching the thrird filter,  will have been turned on its linear exis as it passes through. The result is that about 7% of the starting light waves are now at an angle where they can pass through the third filter (33% of which, have also been turned on their linear axis while passing through the last filter).<br><br>So, no quantum physics. What is left now is for science to find out how the light waves are interacting with the polarising crystals. <br>Is this twisting effect from refraction or reflection off the crystals?", "comment_date": "2018-08-14T06:49:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "plowmaster1206", "comment_text": "Talk faster", "comment_date": "2018-08-14T06:26:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Day In The Life", "comment_text": "Filter changes the photons.", "comment_date": "2018-08-14T05:55:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Voices4dayz", "comment_text": "Being stuck on the idea that nothing is faster than the speed of light is not very B R I G H T... realism is great sounding until it&#39;s wrong.

In the example with just filters A and C 50% of the light gets blocked. However when you insert filter B rotated at 22.5 degrees then the light coming out of filter C would be measured at 70%. If we examine whats happening closer then it can easily be explained. The loss of light from filter A t when filter B is rotated at 22.5 degrees is 15% leaving only 85% of the original source light. From here if we examine the relationship of filters B and C disregarding filter A, we see that filter C is rotated yet another 22.5 degrees from filter B. Therefore, it stands to reason that another 15% of the current light intensity should be lost as the light passes form filter B to C leaving the 70% light intensity that was observed in the experiment.. <br><br>In the other example, obviously a rotation of 45 degrees causes a rejection of 50% of the photons of the current light source passing through the filter.

Due to some as yet unknown theorem of entanglement thermodynamics, any entanglement you don&#39;t know about invariably manifests itself as &quot;random seeming&quot; quantum indeterminacy. What this video is calling an entangled pair of particles (as if this was a simple idea) are actually two particles which share an identical, unknown background entanglement with all other particles in the universe. This permits observable cancellations of the (nearly?) infinite ignorance term. <br><br>Ask yourself at what point in time, t, locality is provably violated. Definitely not until the quantum states of the two independent measurements have combined through local interactions near the on/off lightbulb that indicates the final experimental result (inequality violated, not violated).  From the view that entanglement is universal and pervasive (all particles presumed entangled), instead of rare and exotic (these two particle streams, only, considered entangled for duration of this particular thought experiment) there&#39;s really no reason to think that the massive entanglement state between the measured particles and the measurement itself resolves itself nanometers or nanoseconds before the counterintuitive lightbulb goes on or off. <br><br>So the third door, in my view, is that there&#39;s no such thing as isolated entanglement, and that isolated entanglement is an illusion caused by the theorem of entanglement thermodynamics, such that the entropy of entanglement prevents unknown entanglements from being distinguished from random chance, meaning that in all but special circumstances, you can pretend that universal entanglement doesn&#39;t exist, by approximating universal entanglement as random quantum indeterminacy\u2014this experiment being one of the rare cases where you <b>can&#39;t</b> make this happy approximation and still get the right answer. <br><br>I&#39;m not really a physicist.

I don&#39;t have the explanation, but think of it like how the time constants work.<br>100  - 90% of 100 = 90<br>90 - 90% of 90 = 81<br>81 - 90% of 81 =  72.9<br>72.9 - 90% of 72.9 = 65.61<br>--------<br>now, with just two lenses, 100-40% = 60<br><br>so, by passing the light through four lenses, we have more light passing than with just the front and back lenses.... WOW?!<br><br>These aren&#39;t exact, but to demonstrate that stative nature of light. The more lenses you use, the less deviation from polarization it is, and the less light lost in the transit of the next polarizer. It is this deviation that blocks the light transiting a polarizer. (Think gyroscopically and change its orientation a little, vs a lot.  change too much, too fast, and the spin angular momentum bounces it.) So, with light passing a filter, they become oriented... the less you change that orientation at one time, the less losses you have, thus, you can stack dozens of polarizers just a few degrees apart and still have more light passing than with a 90 degree offset.  That is one theory... another is similar, but without the gyroscopic SAM requirement.<br>I am presuming that all light passing the last polarizer is in that polarized orientation.<br>What needs to really be answered is how doe the light wave/particle achieve its new orientation by going through a polarization? <br>Why and how, when going through exactly one filter, is 360 deg phased light (unpolarized) NOT losing a significant amount of itself since 1/360th of the light is in the proper orientation to pass the filter. <br>Anyhow, this loosely explains why when you take light through multiple filters at lesser angles that you still get light passing when you meet/exceed the 90 degree polarization rotation where you would normally get 0% passing. If you &quot;rotate&quot; the light too far at once, you lose the light. Some kind of inertial mechanism in changing the polarization of light .<br>Maybe if I take the time to read up on what others have studied and researched, I might make some changes to my thoughts.", "comment_date": "2018-07-16T06:45:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "frecio231", "comment_text": "my answer, they aren&#39;t waves, they are strings!!! string theory is better for explaining the universe than quantum theory.", "comment_date": "2018-07-16T01:57:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "directrix1", "comment_text": "So does this mean 2 90\u00b0 filters don&#39;t block all light.", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T21:05:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rumen Rumenov", "comment_text": "What about the proven fact that communication between quantumly entangled particles works faster than light, doesn&#39;t that favor realism over locality?", "comment_date": "2018-07-15T15:41:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B.

It measures a photon that is now polarized to the filter B so with this &#39;new&#39; photon you can just start from B and forget about A.<br>In the second experiment the entangled photons  are described by a single wave function so you have to threat them as a single object. Passing one photon through one filter changes the wave function accordingly so the other photon will act as it has already passed through the other filter.<br>If the entangled pair passes through filters in a way that they would be unable to &#39;know&#39; the event without FTL communication than it&#39;s impossible to say which one was measured first and the results will be the same if you assume that either the top or the bottom photon was the first one.<br><br>BTW I think that locality is overrated", "comment_date": "2018-06-30T22:50:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bruno Lepri", "comment_text": "non-local hidden variables", "comment_date": "2018-06-30T13:37:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kabil Farris", "comment_text": "This might be completely wrong, and sound ridiculous, but the addition of filter b, at 45\u00b0, in between filter a, at 0\u00b0, and filter c, at 90\u00b0 would cause it to let more light pass through. You stated that when the light passes through two filters with a difference of 90\u00b0, that light is not going to lass through it.

The two entangled photons do not need to break localisation to have those same results, if they are entangled they already have the changed state that we are expecting to happen when they go through the first and/or second polarisation just they are in that state from the beginning instead. Hence why the % of light that gets through is the expected amounts. (IE of those that pass through A, 85% pass through B and 50% through C).

Photons travel through, whilst having their lighting properties disabled, which is what we detect. Second theory is that light is more of a pulse than a wave. Light appears as waves to us, but truly acts as a pulse. The first filter merely weakens the pulse, whilst the second blocks the light aspect of the pulse, while a undetectable energy passes through- likely on a dimensional scale. When a third filter is added, the energy remaining from the pulses is returned, and hits the second filter, breaking it&#39;s capacity to absorb light . This return of energy creates an endlessly, though slowly, increasing amount of light that appears, even though the amount of pulses remains the same.

So my theory is that the farther away a lense of light is from a light source, the darker that light will be due to the fact that light takes time to travel and hit it, and bounce back to our eye, adding to the fact  that  light first bounces of a, but then put b over it and light bounces to your eye through a but bounces back from c and then into our eyes, and the same happens while adding c, so this happens as a result of more layers of surfaces for sources of light to bounce off of.", "comment_date": "2018-01-15T19:09:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Z.

I need to know that I&#39;m not going insane here, so could someone comment on this and let me know if this is just me, or if this really is what is happening? I feel like in the video, the speech waveforms are simply amplitude modulated to make it look like how someone would think it should look like (if they don&#39;t know any better), but the actual waveform itself is not changing like it should be. Here&#39;s why I think this. Real vowels look very different from each other, and the ones in this video all look pretty much the same. The &quot;o&quot; sound should be much closer to a sine wave, and the &quot;e&quot; sound should have a lot of high frequency components in it.  The &quot;s&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, and &quot;th&quot; sounds should be all high frequency noise, and quite low amplitude, but I&#39;m not seeing that here either. Next, the waveforms are way too low of frequency. The waveforms appear to be scrolling quickly to the left, implying that it is one continuously drawn waveform with no samples omitted. It&#39;s not just skipping entire screens forward as it would need to show the level of detail we have here, but really is showing a continuous waveform moving. We can count the peaks then to estimate the frequency, and they are way too low. The distance between the peaks doesn&#39;t change enough for the change in pitch of the voices. If it really is the waveform of their voice, i feel like it has been massively time compressed (by omitting most of the peaks and stitching together the result). If you actually record your voice and look at it at the same zoom level as shown here, rarely in any vowel sound are there fewer than at least dozens of nearly identical peaks/troughs repeated. Here, it shows just a few for each vowel sound, which is much too fast.<br>Maybe I&#39;m just rambling at this point, so I&#39;ll stop here.", "comment_date": "2018-01-11T17:30:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dennyjoe", "comment_text": "Amazing stuff!", "comment_date": "2018-01-11T17:02:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Social Crusader", "comment_text": "A is to B as AB is to C...

Perpendicular =&gt; No component in common.<br><br>Now, consider what happens if we add a second filter B between A and C, with a polarisation axis at 45\u00ba from the other two. The light that passes through B will have a polarisation 45\u00ba from A, and 45\u00ba from C. It will have a diminished magnitude. When this light hits filter C, it is not perpindicular to C&#39;s axis, and so some of it will pass trhough.<br><br>Q.E.D.

Yes, at that point you can start to prove Bell&#39;s Theorem. But you&#39;re doing a completely different experiment, which is only related to the first in that they both take advantage of polarisation being a property of light.<br><br>In fact, I <b>think</b> you&#39;re wrong in their description of the entangled experiment. I believe to make the experiment work, one needs to use circularly polarised light, not linearly polarised light. Unfortunately, lacking the apparatus to make entangled photons, I can&#39;t check this. It doesn&#39;t help that most of modern scientific progress all hides behind prohibitively expensive paywalls.<br><br>The experiment you describe uses two photons with the same linear polarisation, and a large number of photon pairs with (both photons having the same) random polarisation. The linear polarisation of a photon is not an unknowable quantity - it&#39;s very easy to create photons with a known polarisation.<br><br>One could recreate this experiment with a hidden variable: Instead of using quantumly entangled photons, lock up a grad student in a black box with a small hole to shine light in, and another hole which the light will exit. Instruct them to place a polarisation filter in the path of the light, and rotate it randomly. Take the light that exits the black box, put it through a partially silvered mirror to split it into two beams. Send that light to your far away filters. One will get the same results you have described. A grad student with a polarising filter is not an unknowable, unmeasureable hidden variable. It&#39;s a person doing things, and it&#39;s entirely explainable using classical EM.<br><br>Finally, to nitpick:<br> - Water waves and sound waves are just as quantum as light waves. Acoustic energy is quantised, and the sound wave equivalent of a photon is named a phonon. I don&#39;t know if there is a name of for the quantisation of energy in gravity waves (not to be confused with gravitational waves).<br> - You claim that polarising filters only remove light, but that&#39;s not true - it also changes the direction of polarisation.", "comment_date": "2018-01-03T02:22:25Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Br Uno", "comment_text": "potato tomato...my iq comparing this,,,,,", "comment_date": "2018-01-02T23:32:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicolas Cacace", "comment_text": "The Universe is deciding...?

Of course, we only see the outcome we&#39;re looking for (for example, with the dead cat); while the photons contain the information for the entire range of possible systems. <br><br>Perhaps you&#39;re not filtering photons, so much as filtering perception?

A typical quantum system describes an isolated subsystem of a classical statistical ensemble with infinitely many classical states.

Then all the usual laws of quantum mechanics follow, including Heisenberg&#39;s uncertainty relation, entanglement and a violation of Bell&#39;s inequalities. No concepts beyond classical statistics are needed for quantum physics - the differences are only apparent and result from the particularities of those classical statistical systems which admit a quantum mechanical description. Born&#39;s rule for quantum mechanical probabilities follows from the probability concept for a classical statistical ensemble. In particular, we show how the non-commuting properties of quantum operators are associated to the use of conditional probabilities within the classical system, and how a unitary time evolution reflects the isolation of the subsystem.

Maybe the lens is weakening the light (using up the photon&#39;s energy). so the physical normal of photons isn&#39;t changing really, but the over all compensation of the photons is changing via entering the lens. Lens A doesn&#39;t really effect the photons because it&#39;s one barrier, but adding C  at a 45 degree angle creates a barrier that cost more energy to enter and thus the photon is overall weaker, but still present. Lens B requires exponentially less energy then C because of the shift In the angle. Since the angle is now less 45 degrees between A-b, B-c the energy is overall less then just A-C. The main point is that I believe the lens clearly has a exponentially effect on the number of photons (we can clearly see it through the percent change).

We know that when a polarizing filter is introduced and rotated to block light, the angles are important. However, when introducing a third filter, we assume it will block out more light; however, this is not entirely the case, as witnessed here. The easiest and simplest explanation is this; when the third filter is applied, we assume the light will either diminish or darken more but the light (waves &amp; particles) actually brightens. This is due to third filter refraction realigning the light ray, regardless where the filter is applied; top, bottom, or in between... the path of light has changed to allow light to pass through due to the change of angular paths cause by the third lens. This is to say, if you have two perpendicular sets of lines that are arranges to block light with two filters, the third lens automatically changes the orientation; thereby negating the effect of the blocked polarized lines due to refraction angles; the angle of incidence of the third lens has changed the orientation of the other two to allow light to pass through... at least, this is my simplified theory on the matter.", "comment_date": "2017-11-29T21:44:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "trnod", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t the particles in the filter always vibrate, and therefor affect the outcome of the entangled fotons?", "comment_date": "2017-11-29T20:41:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "111455", "comment_text": "sounds like some sort of superposition property the wave would re-randomize somehow?", "comment_date": "2017-11-29T20:30:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sanjuansteve", "comment_text": "IMO, a photons is a particle, orbiting dark matter particle, and the orientation of that orbit at it travels determines if it is an axial wave or a helical or circular wave.

Now at let&#39;s call it &quot;new light value 1&quot; or &quot;NLV1&quot;. NLV1 is 100% of the light that is going to hit filter 2. So filter 2 is tilted at a 22.5\u00b0 angle and 15% of light is blocked so out of NLV1 we have 85%of light passing through we will call this now this is &quot;new light value 2&quot; or &quot;NLV2&quot;. NLV2 is now 100% of the light source after the filter at 22.5\u00b0 so we add another at 45\u00b0 only 22.5\u00b0 apart so it will block 15% out of 100% of NLV2 so yet again 85% of then left over light passes through. Now let&#39;s pass 100 light particles through this equation. 100 particles hit Filter A 50 go through and 50 are blocked. 50 is now the same as NLV1 and is all the light available to go through filter 2 so the 50 particles hit Filter 2 and 15% out of 50 light particles are blocked so 7.5 particles don&#39;t get through but 42.5 particles do get through Now 42.5 is NLV2 and is 100% of the light available to hit filter 3 in which so out of 42.5 particles 15% are blocked at filter 3 so 6.375 particles are blocked so 36.125 particles get through.

It does so in a way that minimizes the idea that filter b changing the state of the photons is likely or even possible. Again, more misdirection...

But duh. Maybe that&#39;s exactly why the 3 polarizing filter experiment demonstrates Bell&#39;s theorem or maybe it just isn&#39;t a good demonstration of Bell&#39;s Theorem at all.

When the second lens is introduced at 90 degrees, the photons that spend most of their time at 0 degrees are blocked, but those that spend more time  switcging over to oscillate at 90 degrees make it through the second lens.

If Photon A passes through the first two filters but not the third, for reasons we would predict, but Photons B-H go all the way, then wouldn&#39;t the logical hypothesis be that something about photon A&#39;s experience with the filters affects the behavior of other photons, allowing more of them to succeed where Photon A failed?<br><br>Perhaps photons give out a shockwave or wake (in spacetime, ambient passing photons, or whatever) that&#39;s unique to their recent experience, like a swirl of water in the wake of a paddle, which affects other photons that go through the same or similar experiences, like a second, identical Titanic following behind the first one and coming across lifeboats before running into the same iceberg.

The actual mechanism is more like aiming the stream at the target actuated valve; the original stream does not pass through the target, but is \u201cexpressed\u201d through the other side as a different, yet proportional stream. A sheet of glass may appear to be perfectly \u201cclear\u201d to our eyes, but depending on its chemical properties, may be almost opaque to infrared or ultraviolet light. On the other side, an infrared lens may appear to be opaque to our eyes, but is almost perfectly transparent to infrared light. Therefore, light energy does not \u201cpass through\u201d transparent materials, but rather is \u201cconverted\u201d to \u201cquantum packets\u201d whose transmissivity is affected in very different ways, depending on the medium. Like the \u201cNewtons cradle\u201d toy, the \u201cball\u201d that impacts the mass of stationary ones causes an almost perfect transfer of energy through the row, but the ball that \u201cpops\u201d off of the end of the row is obviously not the same one that started the reaction. The properties of the crystalline matrices in various transparent materials also give rise to differences in reflectivity, color transmission, refractivity, scatter, and coherence. It became easier to grasp the effects of materials on quanta when the idea of transparency was divorced from the perception that the photons I observe from one side of a window are the \u201csame\u201d ones that entered the other side.", "comment_date": "2017-11-18T15:30:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jesus Gutierrez", "comment_text": "I feel like you are thinking about it all in numbers, without tryong tp figure it out in just the way light works, how it interacts with surfaces.

That is, we can imagine a stream of light containing a huge number of potential orientations. The filtering out of all but one orientation is impossible. In reality, the number of points on the circumference of a circle cannot be defined (infinity). <br><br>That means in reality, the difference between any one angle and the next is infinitely small (perhaps limited only by the Planck length between line segments drawn on the circumference). That is, the most perfect circle one could ever hope to achieve in physical reality is really a polygon with sides of one Planck length. That means that for any orientation of a light wave propagating at a particular angle, there is at least one angle left and right of that orientation one Planck length apart. These would effectively be the same orientation though they are actually different. <br><br>Of course, the Planck limit is more about our inability to define lengths that are smaller and not necessarily anything intrinsic to reality itself, so there could be an undefinable number of angles between one Planck length segment and the next on a circle&#39;s circumference. That would imply that there is an infinite possible orientations that will pass through what we would regard as one Planck degree, which is as perfect as a polarizing filter can hope to ever be due to the uncertainty principle and quantum effects. That is, just because half a Planck length is meaningless to us does not mean it is meaningless in reality.<br><br>The point is that though we might think 50% of the light is making it through two filters 45 degrees different, more light is getting through than we should intuitively expect because of quantum indeterminism and the physical functional limitations of polarization (the absence of actual perfection). Even if we could construct some quantum polarizing filter, where the polarization is perfect to one Planck length of angle, we have no guarantee that some wave of slightly less than that difference wouldn&#39;t also make it through. We just could not tell any difference as such waves would be functionally (though not actually) equivalent.  <br><br>This is why quantum indeterminancy is apparently required for any system involved at fundamental levels like moving photons around. The fact is that it is necessary for there to be an incomplete description (the unknown variable issue in this video). The hidden variable necessary to make such systems purely deterministic is likely just something WE wish exists. <br><br>The reality that we cannot calculate is only approximated in our best methodology, which appears itself to remain necessarily incomplete. Think of it this way, a strict determinist might regard Schrodinger&#39;s cat as actually alive or dead, and that merely our lack of knowledge of the cat&#39;s state doesn&#39;t change that fact about reality. The cat is not really in both states until observed as that is absurd (a violation of the first logical absolute). In the same way, surely a light wave only has a single orientation regardless of our ignorance or inability to calculate/predict that orientation. <br><br>But reality gives us the finger by making it impossible to know such details in advance and apparently doesn&#39;t give a damn about time either (the whole super-luminal communication is merely presuppositional nonsense based on a biased view of unidirectional time). What we have to do to make sense of MANY quantum interactions is throw out such biases and let quantum entities behave as they apparently do in both directions of time. <br><br>Just look into Feynman&#39;s diagram for Beta minus decay. The whole thing doesn&#39;t work unless we presume (at least as a convention) that anti-particles are just their positive equivalents going in the opposite direction in time. Now, the $10,000,000 question is whether or not this convention reveals an underlying truth about reality or is just a convenience for our puny brains. Why should it be necessary to describe such an interaction this way if it is actually not the case? Wouldn&#39;t messing with time such that it can be reversible just to make our calculations and diagrams work be cheating if it wasn&#39;t actually something that maps to reality?<br><br>Given the various experiments that show how particles can interact with themselves or affect change in a series of events that requires future events to affect prior events, it is starting to seem like time really is something that quantum entities use in both directions.", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T09:21:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CRX REY", "comment_text": "This is a lot easier to understand than this.", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T07:37:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shinmen wize", "comment_text": "I dont understand it at all.

But when he said that violates expectations I was confused because it made sense to me (as a layman). My immediate internal logic was like this...imagine a fairly flat rock and skipping it on water. If the Angle is shallow enough, it will deflect and skip, otherwise with it too steep or under powered, the water will absorb its energy and it sinks. Ok, so then I imagine the photons on a certain plane being the rocks, and the polarizer filter being the water. Every photon in alignment with the filter may pass. But it&#39;s not a 100% match. Some photons are only slightly askew and fit through, others are vert askew but shallow enough to deflect when hitting the filter. Instead of the photon skipping like a rock, the deflection causes a plane rotation along the axis of travel, knocking it sufficiently into alignment to pass through. So 90 deg filters are sufficiently different that nothing can get through one and the other. But adding intermediaries of lesser degrees means that as the photons pass, a greater percent will happen to be within tolerance to deflect into alignment. The smaller the rotation needed to deflect, the more of the photons are likely to be in similar enough alignment to each other. I wonder if you c o.oiuld test this by having a large number of slightly rotated filters such that at the end of the series, you&#39;ve deflected the photons into nearly perfect alignment. Then rotating one suddenly 30 Deg or something where some would normally make it would be just outside the tolerance of the more tightly aligned photons and you&#39;d see a much larger proportion blocked, thus proving my theory.", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T05:07:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mutation of Randomness", "comment_text": "Huge Typo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=17m57s\">17:57</a>", "comment_date": "2017-11-16T00:56:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Gavel", "comment_text": "Because three dimensions is the illusion, this is all happening single dimensionally.

Right? And then the filter, the measurement, forces it to &quot;collapse&quot; into one of its probable states. <br><br>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case. I think the photon is flashing between a set of discrete states. Not being in those states <b>at the same time</b> , but rather <b>alternating</b> between the states, <b>one at a time</b> . Whether or not it goes through a given filter depends on <b>when</b> it hits the filter -- which state it&#39;s in at that instant. If the photon was initially unpolarized, and it hits a horizontally polarized filter, then it is initially flashing horizontal - zero - vertical - zero. (The &quot;zero&quot; state encodes the energy of the photon and which direction it will flash next, but it&#39;s not currently &quot;out&quot; in either direction.) IF it hits the filter when it&#39;s in its horizontal state or in the zero state about to go horizontal, then it will go through. IF it hits the filter when it&#39;s in its vertical state or about to go vertical, then it won&#39;t. And if it does go through, the filter takes away the vertical component -- from that point on, it&#39;s only encoded to flash horizontally: horizontal - zero - horizontal - zero. Neither of these states can make it through a vertically polarized filter, so none of them make it through filter C.<br><br>This explains &quot;entanglement&quot; WITHOUT requiring violation of local realism. The entangled particles are simply in sync with each other timewise as well as direction-wise. They key here is that they&#39;re going through the filters AT THE SAME TIME. So of course they will either both make it through or both not, when given the same filter <b>at the same time</b> -- because they&#39;re both in the same state at that time, either a state that can make it through the filter, or one that can&#39;t. Likewise, if one hits filter C <b>at the same time</b> as the other hits filter A, they will both either be in a state to make it through C but not A, what happens depends on what point they&#39;re both at in their (identical) phase cycling. 1/4 of the time they will both be in a state to make it through both A and C; 1/4 of the time they will both be in a state to make it through neither; 1/4 of the time they will both be in a state to make it through A but not C; and 1/4 of the time they will both be in a state to make it through C but not A. <br><br>You have to look at energy and not just time, I think, to understand how filters A and B interact. This is why wave functions work so well to describe this motion. While the photon is alternating between horizontal and vertical (and zero) flashes in time, it&#39;s also got different amounts of energy that fluctuate with time. And the entangled photons, remember, are perfectly identical, coordinated in time. To make it through the filter that&#39;s at an angle between vertical and horizontal, it has to not just be in the correct state at the instant when it hits the filter, but it also has to have enough energy to make it through in that state. (I think the energy is also (probably) quantized, by the way, but it&#39;s a lot easier to use a continuous function to represent it.) And it&#39;s the <b>amount of time</b> the photons spend in each combined direction-energy state that determines the proportions we see going through the filters. Of the ones that are in a state that can make it through A, 85% are also in a state that can make it through B *at that exact same time*. And vice versa. And similarly for C and B, too. <br><br>This completely explains it without requiring any kind of violation of local realism. No?<br><br>BTW, it&#39;s easy for me to think of it this way because I see space and time as quantized and the universe as (most likely) working like a game of Conway&#39;s Life, with some kind of rules governing each space cell&#39;s state given the cells around it from instant to instant. That this kind of structure would generate quantized energy levels and phenomenon that look like waves and are described by wave equations (except that they&#39;re quantized) is not at all surprising to me.

Bell in principle proves that this is decided jointly by the sender and receiver in a timeless manner. Einstein really has no explanation for all this and neither has anyone else. A photon is a crutch to describe electron interactions. Entanglement is a crutch to explain what is happening on a quantum level when photons are considered as particle or a localised wave packet. And yes, the double slit experiment already shows that photons are neither but just have a certain probability of location until the receiving electron interacts. It basically proves that the sending and the receiving electron exchange the energy of a photon timeless and non-local. This also explains the &#39;waveform collapse&#39; of the Copenhagen interpretation. As there is no wave there is no need for it to collapse timelessly, which would also conflict with Einstein. The truly exciting part of this is that time, energy and distance are one and the same and can be freely interchanged. Photons have no real &#39;rest&#39; mass but real energy through the relativistic mass as they travel at the speed of light. It means they are not something that exists at any point in time between electrons. Space is not filled with light. Space is just a medium that enables electrons to interact at long distances. When the electron jumps from one energy state to the other (quantum leap to a lower energy position) that effect is received with some probability distribution in the whole universe. That energy can be exhibited in distance, time, or a &#39;massive&#39; effect depending on where the receiving electron syncs with the sending one. Once you accept that there is no paradox of photons getting blocked by different filters on their way to the viewer, it becomes clear that the filters just change the probability of electron interaction on that path. That path only exist&#39;s because of Fermat&#39;s principle. It actually explains Fermat&#39;s principle as to why the photon is always able to take the shortest path (in energy/time expenditure in space) between the two electrons.

I studied everything I could find, but nothing explained the 3-polarizer effect. Everyone concentrated on the 2-slits problem, and nobody seemed familiar with the 3-polarizer one. When I learned more about it, it was from a statistical probability approach. It claimed that those waves making it through AB were left partially rotated, and the combination of two rotated waves produced an average that was rotated at a degree that bisected the angle between the two, thus was rotated off the plane of either, which is the plane now allowed to pass by filter C. (sorry... been a long time since I tried to explain this) This new angle from the combination of the other two now can pass the third filter.

Now imagine the C filter is hit slightly sooner than B, how does this photon know to pass 100% through C so that 0.85 will go though B, or whatever math would be needed so the combined pair passing 0.85.

Your pictures show the magnitude of the output wave <i>reduced</i> when the filter is not aligned with the polarization of the input light.  Then, at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=2m25s\">2:25</a>, you switch to viewing light as photons.  Here, you fail to mention a very important point, which is that the energy of a photon is related to the wavelength and hence the color of the light.  If the same thing happened as for the wave point of view, photons with polarization not aligned with the filter would come out with different magnitude, hence different energy and so different color.  This doesn&#39;t happen.  Your pictures correctly show that photons either pass through the filter with unchanged magnitude (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=2m30s\">2:30</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=2m33s\">2:33</a>) or are absorbed (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=2m32s\">2:32</a>).  You also show, <i>but do not describe,</i> that in order to pass with unchanged magnitude (energy, color), the photons <i>change their polarization direction</i> to align with the filter.  The filter <i>reduces the light intensity</i> by <i>completely absorbing</i> some photons and passing others with no loss of energy but with <i>polarization now aligned to the filter.</i><br><br>Armed with the above reasoning, the three-polarizer phenomenon that you introduce at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=0m48s\">0:48</a> and describe as &quot;super weird&quot; at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a> is qualitatively unspurprising and easily explained.  Your claim that &quot;all these filters do is remove light&quot; (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=0m51s\">0:51</a>) now seems incorrect and misleading.  The filters remove some light <i>and</i> rotate the polarization of the light that they let through.  In the two filter case, the second filter absorbs all photons because their polarization is off by 90\u00b0.  In the three filter case, the second filter lets through half the photons because their polarization is off by only 45\u00b0 and <i>rotates the polarization of the photons that it _</i><b><i>_does</i></b>_ let though_ to be 45\u00b0 off from the third filter, which therefore lets through half of them, so that a quarter make it through all three filters.  This explains the observation, at least qualitatively.<br><br>So I don&#39;t understand all this stuff about a hidden variable.  Why do we need a hidden variable?  At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=5m12s\">5:12</a>, you worry that it seems impossible to know the probability of a photon passing through each of the three filters before it actually happens.  This is not a problem at all.  The probability of a photon passing through C is different depending on whether B was there or not.  B changes the photon in a manner that alters its polarization with respect to C and therefore the probability of it passing through.

I have always liked your channel, but I am not too keen on this video. As others have mentioned, you fail to acknowledge that the interaction of such filters can be simply explained through basic optics. Please read about Jones Matrices in Optics by Hecht. Using a simple transfer matrix, you can represent all of this and see that indeed that light passes through the the stack. A very intuitive way of understanding why the light passing through is based on cosine of the angle of the polarizer to the polarization of the light is to understand that you are taking the dot product of the vector representing the polarization of the light with that of the orientation of the polarizing lines of the filter. The dot product represents the portion of a vector which is parallel to another vector. So, what you are seeing is the scalar projection of the light onto the polarizing line. A portion of this energy (which is cos(angle)) is input to the polarizing line (the oscillating electric field component of the light moves electrons on it and thus creates a current).

From.that perspective, each photon has a 50% chance of getting through the misaligned polariser, and half the incident photons duly get through. Now comes the really strange thing. Those photons that do get through have, in effect, been twisted. They are polarised at 45 degrees to the original polariser, so what happens if they now encounter another polariser at right angles to the first?

Small enough to make photons scatter like how you can play with shadows or the double slit experiment and have the wave wobble a little. <br><br>That means that if the filters are perpendicular, there is not enough wobble between the slits to get light through. Think of it as 2 bell curves with lens A on the left and lens C on the right. only the third devastation of each graph are overlapping. The overlapping bit are all the photons that have wobbled enough to go past both filters so through. Since the lenses are at such different angles, a small portion can get through, and with with so few photons over the same area (Assuming you stacked the lenses), it becomes much darker.<br><br>Now with the lens B in the middle, the overlap of the bell curve between lens A and lens B is much greater. Using the numbers from the video, it seems like the photon loss at 45 degrees is 50% and 22.5% is 15%. <br><br>Now the smaller the angle difference between lenses, the more photos can get by from the wiggles. I am hypothesizing, that is you can get a polar filter with 2 different angle slits  on the same plain (Not stacked!), would would get a cool circular version of the double slight experiment with rad probability hot spots. <br><br>But ya, I think the slit of the polarizing lenses are making a bell curve with that angle of cut on the x axis and the amount of wiggle is the width. Tighter slits, more spread out, yadda yadda, highschool science stuff. With only lens A and C, vary little of A is carried and forced to spread across the lens C bell curve. But with that lens B, it adds a middle bell curse that can take a lot more from lens A, and gives more to lens C since it shares more.

Theoretically going faster than the speed of light is back in time. I think of many theories that I can&#39;t contradict or prove with 9th grade mathematics. Also crossing the light-speed-barrier requires slowing down enough to come back from it. Acceleration and deceleration both take energy. Thus, our attempts to reach the past will end up in vain if we can&#39;t slow down fast enough forcing us to travel forwards in time as we decelerate from light speed. It requires too much energy. However I have another theory, If you move enough relative to huge chunks of matter (go fast for long) you move through time. Likewise if you move through time (relative to other stuff unlike trapped photons) , you move through space (to prove me wrong I dare you to be still relative to the moving universe.) Thus exists space-time. (This is how I theorized space time, before I knew it was a thing. I still don&#39;t know the real explanation) In the LHC the colide particles together so strongly that they release their strored energy &quot;creating&quot; new particles. Matter and anti-matter pop in and  out of existences all the time. Why can&#39;t we say that matter and energy are very similar? Just like space-time? Matter/Energy cannot be created or destroyed . It only changes form (I&#39;m too lazy to write the laws separately but I still write this). Why can&#39;t they be a mix of each other always changing form and making more scientist confused? A particle with enough energy can more through space and time, fade in out of existence always interchanging between wave and particle form. Just looking at the speedy photons making you see.

I say that it is serious because correcting this error changes the whole way you approach this problem.<br><br>When you put a second polarizing filter after the first set at 45\u02da, half-way toward 90\u02da, the amount of light coming through is <b>not</b> 50%, or 1/2. It is (\u221a2)/2, about 71%. (Please verify this with a photodetector; if it is indeed 50%, then I am in error and I stand corrected.) This is can be calculated from the wave treatment of light.<br><br>Think of the amount of light as the amplitude of the wave. This amplitude is in a direction, so let&#39;s work with it like a vector. The amount of light that passes through the second polarizer comes out in the polarity of the second polarizer, but it&#39;s amplitude is equal to the cosine of the angle between the two polarizers\u2014in other words, its amplitude is a directional component of the light waving in the direction of the second polarizer. (Correct me if I&#39;m mistaken, but I think this makes the amplitude the dot product of the two polar directions, assuming both polarizers pass do not dim the light in any way but isolating the component in their polarity. So in a weird sort of way this is a vector dot product.)<br><br>If this is so, then it isn&#39;t really that weird that inserting the polarizer in at 45\u02da between two perpendicular polarizers lets so much light through. The first polarizer isolates only one polarity (let&#39;s call this 0\u02da), the second one, at 45\u02da, lets through (\u221a2)/2 at 45\u02da, and the last one reduces this by another (\u221a2)/2 at the 90\u02da polarization. So the amount of light coming through should be ((\u221a2)/2)*((\u221a2)/2) = 2/4 = 1/2, or 50%.<br><br>No quantum weirdness needed to be invoked to do this. No hidden variables. If you change amplitude to probability in my calculations above, it should still work. Or am I mistaken?<br><br>Please use a photo detector to check whether a 45\u02da relative angle between two polarizer filters really gets you a 50% light transmission, or a 71% light transmission, and whether light passing through three polarizers set at 45\u02da rotations lets through 50% of the light.

As Kevin Lyon points out below, that leads to seemingly contradictory results because what actually passes through the polarizing filters are not particles, but electromagnetic waves. These waves are not comprised of discrete particles that individually have a statistical probability of passing through a particular filter, they are fields that propagate through space. The crucial difference is that unlike particles, waves can be readily superimposed into a collective wavefront without &quot;colliding&quot; with each other (they produce periodic interference patterns instead). <br><br>In an unpolarized light source, the polarization of superimposed waves is randomly distributed, producing a wavefront with randomly varying interference patterns. When it passes through a polarizing filter, the wavefront that emerges is polarized in a particular direction. All waves that comprised the original wavefront pass through the filter, but the intensity of each polarized wave depends on how closely its original polarity happened to be aligned with the polarizing filter. Since the filter imposes the same polarity on all emerging waves, they combine without mutual interference into a uniformly polarized wavefront.<br><br>Once the wavefront is polarized, additional filters act like valves that determine how much (intensity) of the wavefront passes through, while imposing the filter&#39;s polarity on the emerging wavefront. A filter that is rotated 90 degrees (with respect to the wavefront&#39;s polarity) is effectively &quot;off&quot;, reducing the wavefront&#39;s intensity to zero. A 45-degree filter allows the polarized wavefront to pass through at 50% intensity. Thus, two 45-degree filters allow 25% of the polarized wavefront to pass, with a cummulative polarity of 90 degrees, whereas a single 90-degree filter would block 100% of the polarized wavefront.", "comment_date": "2017-09-16T20:43:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "George Crabtree", "comment_text": "Is it a certainty that the wave axis of light is constant?

I know relatively little about physics. But I do know one thing about photons (light waves) that may or may not explain can why &quot;faster than light communication&quot; is not necessary to facilitate this &quot;paradox.&quot; A photon &quot;lives&quot; its entire existence all at once. From our perspective it  moves from the sun to the earth in 7 minutes; from its own perspective it is in all those locations at the same time as a huge, elongated thing (maybe call it full time dilation... I don&#39;t know the correct term). It discharges and dies at the same time, exists all at once everywhere it exists. Life and death at once in a single blink of existence where both ends coexist outside of time. A photon isn&#39;t traveling through these filters from its own perspective, it exists in totality all at once. It&#39;s traveling through from our perspective. We see it as passing through.

I mean you explain what they <b>are</b> , but the rest of the story really depends on the ability to reliably <b>produce</b> pairs of them, as well. So you&#39;ll need to convince me that we <b>can</b> make entangled photons, by explaining <b>how</b> they make entangled photons as well as how they <b>know</b> what this lab setup produces <b>is</b> in fact entangled photons.<br><br>This skipping over dealing with how to produce entangled photons (as well as, I&#39;m assuming you probably can&#39;t do that at home, unlike the polarising filter part of the experiment), kind of makes the whole thing fall apart a bit, for me. Especially the bit near the end (from about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=13m40s\">13:40</a>): &quot;The math is a simple counting argument and the underlying physical principles can be seen in action with a cheap home demo. It&#39;s frankly surprising more people don&#39;t know about it.&quot; <br><br>That bit is IMHO, frankly <b>disingenuous</b> . Because the cheap home demo--yes it does show quantum weirdness which is very cool, but it does <b>not</b> show anything about entanglement, &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot; or in fact any reason why there would be any problem explaining this with hidden variables. In fact, if I didn&#39;t know any better, and did this experiment at home, without anyone to jump in like at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcqZHYo7ONs&amp;t=8m45s\">8:45</a> and tell me about entanglement (which I can&#39;t reproduce at home), I would look at the experiment with three polarising filters, think really long and hard how this can happen, and come to the conclusion: OMG this is amazing, there must be some kind of hidden state-variable thing going on with light and polarising filters, that is so cool! And there&#39;s really nothing I can do or try at home that would even suggest anything wrong with that conclusion. Or is there? Because I&#39;d love to hear it :-)<br><br>Not being able to reproduce entanglement at home, but easily being able to reproduce the polarising weirdness, a more honest final remark would be: &quot;It&#39;s frankly surprising more people don&#39;t come up with the idea of hidden state variables&quot;.<br><br>Also, do you artificially speed up your voice, or do you really talk this fast?

Thus, when a filter is placed between two other filters at large angles to each other and the middle filter&#39;s angle is halfway between the other two, it changes the polarization of some of the light that passes through it in such a way that it assists the light to pass through the last filter where it wouldn&#39;t have before the middle filter was inserted.<br><br>And concerning entanglement, there&#39;s nothing that says that entangled particles can&#39;t communicate faster than the speed of light.

Its been known since Arthur Fine&#39;s work in the 80s that the issue is not determinism vs non-determinism, a non-deterministic hidden variable theory also produces Bell Inequality. 2.) Its been known since Lawrence J Landau&#39;s proof of BI that its not locality vs non-locality that is an issue, a even a non-local theory will produce BI if you assume a standard probability space which is what you are doing here with Venn diagrams. This has been reiterated in more recent times by Karl Hess et al. and by Ray Streater 3.)  Whether there are some hidden parameters present indirectly determining outcomes or whether the outcomes are elementary events themselves is not the issue (again Landau&#39;s proof shows this). The fact of the matter is that you can&#39;t represent incompatible observables with a standard probability space. Just using counting arguments on sets with Venn diagrams is even more useless as counting arguments are not mathematically well behaved enough for describing probabilities when dealing with anything other than probability on a finite set. (The standard example, takes the natural numbers listed as 1,3,2,5,7,4,9,11,6,13,15,8... looks like a randomly chosen number being odd is twice as likely as a number being even :P ) Even without entanglement and just one particle one gets the Kochen-Specker paradox if one assumes that a standard probability space can represent both pure states and superpositions of states regardless of experimental context.

The Venn diagram simply shows those percentages by showing each photon that would make it past each filter in your hypothetical sample.<br><br>But there&#39;s no way to make any combination of those values match with the experimental results, because any overlap between any two of those circles will cover up too much of the third circle. In other words, there&#39;s &quot;not enough area&quot; to overlap all the circles with a proportional amount of light that matches both the multiplication of probabilities as well as the experimental results of the actual probabilities, so one of those two can&#39;t be right. And since we <b>observe</b> the experimental values... we have to assume that&#39;s the correct one, and the mathematical way that assumes there are pre-existing properties of the photons that would determine their percentages at each filter? That must be wrong.<br><br>And the entanglement part simply rules out the idea that maybe there IS a property that still determines the percentages, but that property changes after a photon passes through one filter, so you can&#39;t just multiply the probabilities out. With the entangled particles, each particle only ever goes through one filter, so there is no way any properties can be changed in the process, unless somehow one particle passing through Filter A can &quot;tell&quot; the other particle that it&#39;s done so and alter the other particle&#39;s probability of passing through B or C. But the particles are so far from each other, and they pass through the filters at basically the same moment, so the only way for Particle One to &quot;tell&quot; anything to Particle 2 would be if they somehow communicated faster than light.<br><br>And so that brings us to the conclusion here: either quantum particles have no pre-existing properties that determine their behavior until they&#39;re measured (they&#39;re &quot;non-real&quot;), or somehow they can communicate faster than the speed of light (they&#39;re &quot;non-local&quot;); they can&#39;t be both.", "comment_date": "2017-09-14T09:00:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Megablademe", "comment_text": "The best content on YouTube :D Please do more videos with 3Blue1Brown!", "comment_date": "2017-09-14T09:00:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tomix1024", "comment_text": "Wait.

Let&#39;s call the polarizing filter of orientation &quot;A&quot; at one location &quot;Filter A1&quot;, whereas the polarizing filter of orientation &quot;A&quot; at a location far away from the first one will be &quot;Filter A2&quot;. Similarly, let&#39;s look at a pair of Entangled photons, where the member of the pair to be sent to Location 1 is &quot;Particle p1&quot; and the one to be sent to Location 2 is &quot;Particle p2&quot;. We&#39;ll have p1 passing through A1 and p2 passing through A2. No other directions needed.<br>Now, the fact that p1 and p2 are Entangled, means that no matter how short a time passes between p1 passing through A1 and p2 passing through A2 -- even if they pass at the exact same time -- the photons still have to either both pass the filters or both be stopped by them. Similarly, regardless of how far the filters A1 and A2 are apart, p1 and p2 are guaranteed to either both path through the filters or both be stopped by them. In other words: even if [the distance between the filters] divided by [the time between the particles passing through the filters] exceeds the Speed of Light, both photons <b>still</b> get the same result when attempting to pass through the filters.<br>But hang on. We assumed that the particles wouldn&#39;t &#39;know&#39; whether they would pass through a filter oriented in a certain direction until they passed through it. This means that an non-Entangled photon should have about a 50/50 chance to pass through a polarizing filter oriented in any given direction. If Entangled particles would not communicate at all, this would give a 50% chance that, if two Entangled photons were fired at filters oriented in the same direction, one photon would pass through it&#39;s filter and one wouldn&#39;t. But this is contradicted by both the Theory and the Experiment regarding Entangled particles -- two Entangled photons <b>always</b> either both pass or both fail to pass though polarizing filters oriented in the same direction. Thus, we have proven that Entangled particles most definitely communicate with each other, even if no Hidden Variables exist.<br>Furthermore, due to the fact that the similarity of the results at both locations depend neither on the distance between the locations nor the time between one photon passing through it&#39;s &quot;A&quot; filter and the other doing the same, this communication has to be Faster Than Light.<br><br>This is the Thought Experiment put forward by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen, also known as the &quot;EPR Paradox&quot;.

Maybe I&#39;m just grossly over-simplifying the problem, but how&#39;s this for an explanation:<br>The light passing through a filter is 100% polarized in the direction of the filter. If a wave isn&#39;t perfectly aligned, the wave can still &#39;fit through&#39;, albeit with a lower amplitude, but is rotated to that filter&#39;s polarity in the process. You can prove this experimentally by placing two filters that are slightly offset from one another, and then a third filter that is aligned with the 2nd - the third filter won&#39;t block any additional light. The fact they rotate the wave is actually a very important property for how we use polarizing filters. The amplitude of the resulting wave will be the cos^2(a) of the angle between the two filters. This makes it very easy to explain this behavior both in terms of a wave, and a particle:<br><br>For a wave: The filters rotate the wave to their own orientation, so both filters combined will block less light than just the two filters. For example, 3 filters with 45\u00b0 between them, will transmit 25% of the light coming through the first filter, as explained in the video. This also explains why more and more intermediate filters transmit more and more light: With the transmitted light per filter coming closer and closer to 100%, the total amount of transmitted light rises as well. In theory, with an infinite amount of polarizing filters rotated from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, it would be possible to rotate the light&#39;s polarization by 90\u00b0 without losing any of it, because 1 * 1 * 1 * 1 ... will equate to 1.<br><br>For a particle: We can go with the explanation the video gave us that a photon will have a cos^2(a) probability of passing through the filter. If it passes through, it is also rotated to the same polarization as the filter requires. With 3 filters with 45\u00b0 between them, any photons passing through the first filter will have a 50% chance of passing through the 2nd filter, and any of those will also have a 50% chance of passing through the 3rd, giving us the same 25% of the light that came through the first filter. These probabilities follow the exact same trend as the wave explanation, up to 100% of the light from the 1st filter being transmitted and just having its polarization rotated by 90\u00b0. <br><br>With all this in mind, we can easily assume that each filter simply alters the state of the light, however you choose to look at it, and that any subsequent filter decides what to do with the light based on its polarization when it gets there. There are no &#39;hidden variables&#39; and there also is no need for faster than light communication. This hypothesis fully explains the phenomenon shown in the video without questioning our current laws of physics, and without requiring any changes to the model of reality science has built for us thus far.

When they are 90 degrees off from one another nearly all light is completely misaligned with the second filter it hits so you get almost no photons passing through. However, if you place a filter between at 45 degrees between them, then the light starts getting redirected a bit (i.e. rotated to align with the middle filter) so more light is within the angle threshold of the last filter when it hits it. Adding more intermediate filters guides the orientation more gradually with each subsequent filter so less light gets blocked. This is how LCD screens work. The liquid crystal twists the light as it passes through it (much like a stack of gradually changing polarizing filters). It&#39;s like throwing a frisbee through a picket fence.

Not sure what he means here. Thanks guys!<br>EDIT: ah he answered this later in the video.<br>NEW QUESTION: Why would it be incorrect to say this. All incoming photons that pass through filter A has differing phases. A, at orientation, 0 degrees, blocks, in this video&#39;s diagram, 50% of the photons. These photons have the correct phase to be blocked by filter A. Yet those that pass through are not unaffected. Their phase is shifted, not as so much to be blocked by filter A but enough to pass through onto filter B. Filter B essentially has a whole new &quot;set&quot; of photons differing in phase from before filter A. Thus only 15% of the ones passing through Filter A &quot;match&quot; the phase of Filter B and are blocked, due to the phase change from filter A. Yet Filter B ALSO, like Filter A, changes the phase of some of the passing photons. Filter A and B, slightly shifting phases, is what causes Filter C to block 15% of the photons passing through Filter B. This would make sense because in the case of two filters, filter B is not present to change the phase of photons, and 50% of the photons are blocked by C. <br>Are we assuming that all incoming photons have the same phase and do not change phase as they pass through each filter? If so i can understand, even at Filter A, why only 50% make it through. The real question is why those 50% when all the photons are identical. <br>I am not a physicist so I know i am wrong some where.

And when we observe the double slit experiment (collapsing the wave function and leading to no interference), the mechanism of observation wipes the sand flat again, so no interference in the slit.

I will try explaining why. <br><br>From what it seems (and math would work here) is that when photons go through polarizer they have some probability to go through so part of them go through. This part that did go through is now polarized in the direction of polarizer. That means those photons actually changed their polarization from one to another one (and decreased in energy). So if 0 polarized photons go through 22.5 polarizer their energy is lowered to 85% and than this is lowered by another 15% which results in photons having 72% of the energy on exit. By putting them through 22.5 deg polarizer we prepared them for easier passage through the 45deg one. Now if we would force them to go directly through 45deg than obviously 50% of them is &quot;stopped&quot; and the result is 50% of the energy on exit. as we can see 72% &gt; 50% so i dont see any non intuitiveness here .... :P", "comment_date": "2017-09-13T14:55:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean Ehle", "comment_text": "There is nothing in Einstein&#39;s GR that prevents non-causal influences from travelling faster than light.
