This would not work for shapes like an ellipse although it seems that it should work&#39; --&gt; Reason: The beads have a uniform thickness. If you map each point of the circumference of a circle in a direction of normal at that point at equal distance (which is radially outwards in case of a circle) then you again get a circle. This won&#39;t happen in an ellipse. In an ellipse, if you map each point normally outwards at equal distance in hope to create an annular elliptical shape, you will fail because the outer boundary won&#39;t be an ellipse. [Sorry that I can&#39;t prove this here on youtube comments.] And then the beads won&#39;t have a length proportional to the distance from the center. So, it won&#39;t form a triangle. To cross-check these all, equate the standard formula of the area of an ellipse to the area that you would get by the procedure similar to the one done in the video for circles. Then using that, back-calculate the circumference of an ellipse which you will find to have a very simple expression (either 2Pi*a or 2Pi*b) which won&#39;t depend on either b or a (a= semi-major axis and b = semi-minor axis) and that is absurd.
