I have met people and worked with people in different trades and different professions people who knew their profession or their trade better than possibly anyone else, than what you could expect any expert in their field could ever accomplish but yet they did not have the gift of knowing how to break it down simple and teach and convey  it to others.  I have known people in the welding field for example, they were very good welders , but they didn&#39;t know how to teach it to others, they would have been some of the worst teachers and would have  just turned people off. I think when teaching anything to another person you have to go slow,  you can&#39;t speak the jargon or the lingo relevant to that field very fast,  like you&#39;re running a race,  and you have to explain every little segment as you go along,  because if you go too fast,  some people are just gonna get overwhelmed with the lingo that they&#39;ve never heard before and they&#39;re just gonna tune in to some other place hoping that somebody else will be gifted to be able to teach it and break it down so they can learn it more easy , And that&#39;s why we see in a lot of our schools , or let&#39;s just say, across the nation , that other countries,  I think we&#39;re 29 on the list of being  below other countries when it comes to math knowledge,  there are teachers that can teach you math and make you love it but then there are other teachers that try and engage themselves to teach you and make you hate the very thing that you wanted to embark upon. China turns out more engineers and scientists than the USA, they prioritize their students to learn math if nothing else. Some teachers can teach calculus so easy, some other teachers will only further confuse students and make them forsake their major in college that required high grades in calculus, it&#39;s so sad that it&#39;s like this in the USA, we have to import nuclear physicist from other countries, or the Manhattan project never would had been successful.  Teachers at the beginning of the year need to explain to their students first WHY THEY NEED THIS MATH KNOWLEDGE AND HOW IT IS RELEVANT TO THEIR FUTURE CAREER, because many students sit in class daily, bored, asking themselves how is this or knowing it going to help me in life, then they sadly divorce their attention and thoughts from the math lectures being given to them by their teacher daily, and flunk it. Math teachers 3 times a year ought to expound to their students their need to know all math through calculus. But nothing is going to change for the better in this country. When you have a Supreme Court that legitimizes men marrying men and women marrying women, then you have set the stage and advanced a nation to be ripe for the judgment of God, every segment that comprises human life from that point on races forward into perversion and degradation,  darkness is upon this land and people, the highest court in the land have shaken their fist at God, as God spoke through the prophet NAHUM, (I will pour abominable filth upon thee), so now we see this in a country that God previously blessed, but no longer, this nation is cursed in the food market and gas pump, and it&#39;s going to elevate into cataclysmic horror, when God fights against a nation that backsides from His commandments and laws, believe me, there are no brighter days ahead folks. Start storing food, water, fuel, and all necessities,  because the locust storm heading our way will burn up our food supplies,  martial law will become the rule of the day, and fear of daily existence will rob people of what peace and contentment they once knew. God is no respector of persons, the very elected leaders that we see daily make and act upon insane drafted policies , designed to steal and rob us of peace, safety, and prosperity, are part of the punishment from God,  who is now fighting against a nation that embraces perversion and prosecutes those that are against it. IM NOT A LOOSE CANNON, I&#39;m just reverberating what investigating journalists tell us daily in local and nationwide broadcast, granted the freedom to do so by the constitution of the USA, and the freedom of information act. The truth hurts and offends those that are guilty of violating the principles of wisdom, who seek to walk in their own ways that are destructive to theirselves and others. Back to math knowledge,  watch what I proclaim, next year USA students will fall even lower in the nation, a nation that through its court systems have shaken their meager fleshly fist at God and rebelled horribly against Him.", "comment_date": "2022-03-19T21:45:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mayank Mohanty", "comment_text": "All serious JEE(joint entrance exam) know about this.<br>U made it more interesting<br>Thank you.", "comment_date": "2022-03-15T08:04:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mayank Mohanty", "comment_text": "If u turn all the velocity vector by 90\u00b0 about centre <br>U will get anothe ellipse!", "comment_date": "2022-03-15T08:03:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\uc218\uacfc\ud559\uc560\ud638\ubc15 MathScienceFancier", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude0d", "comment_date": "2022-03-13T22:51:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Carlos Arce Vargas", "comment_text": "You might also like: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/UZamUk4xy-8\">https://youtu.be/UZamUk4xy-8</a>", "comment_date": "2022-03-13T22:36:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris", "comment_text": "Right?

A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

It has to do with when the ellipse translates into a parabola. Now I know this happens when the eccentricity value is 1, when some energy is added to the orbiting object. However, I don&#39;t know what happens to the major and minor axes during the transition to a parabola. Does the minor axis remain constant, while the major axis is stretched out to infinity? Whats the context: my physics textbook states that the most energy efficient way for an object to be put into a circular orbit is to be launched with some initial velocity that will give the object an elliptical orbit until it reaches the apogee. Then it will execute circular motion (geostationary in this particular case, as it&#39;s the most useful for a satellite). However, I wonder what would be implied from this statement if the eccentricity was extremely close to 1. If the apogee is not an infinite distance away, but still pretty far away, does this imply that obtaining a circular orbit would require an extremely high amount of energy? I ask this because I also know that certain comets, depending on their current direction, can be placed into orbit via Jupiter (but not the sun) from initially having unbounded motion.", "comment_date": "2020-12-11T03:49:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bilim - Felsefe - Din", "comment_text": "Please consider the subject as mathematics, it is not a matter related to religion.\r<br>If you are interested in the equivalence below;\r<br>If you understand or want to understand what kind of structure it is.\r<br><a href=\"https://www.7and19.com/002-00-to-imitate-or-write-similar-one-of-the-quran/\">https://www.7and19.com/002-00-to-imitate-or-write-similar-one-of-the-quran/\r</a><br>\r<br>There are many natural things that we can observe in the world and that human beings cannot make with today\u2019s technology.

For me, the only questions are: 1) Given the distance or temperature of the fires, what should the other figure be? and 2) What is the specific equation for the ellipse at that campsite that they figured it out to be.

Therefore, we can actually &quot;measure&quot; at what point everything stop to making sense. We have a &#39;edge&#39; of understanding. Save that for a moment. I understand this lecture in a spooky way because of the combination of physics shenanigans that I was tripping in Youtube. In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdIjYBtnvZU&amp;t=18m00s\">18:00</a>, he draw lines in a circle and I was immediately pushed to think in a 3D funnel like shape. \r<br>So, I remembered a video about Higher Dimensions and it refers the Klein Bottle (that has a funnel like shape) but I wondered that Klein&#39;s representation was too &#39;smooth&#39; to be a representation of our universe/reality. \r<br>\r<br>However, before I was trying to understand Higher Dimensions, I was interested in what dimensions are. \r<br>\r<br>So, in the video that I watched the author says that, counting time as a dimension, we are in the 4th dimension. If we were in the 5th dimension, we would be able to travel to parallel worlds as long as they had the same initial conditions. If we were in the 6th dimension, we would be able to travel in time in these twins worlds. If we were in the 7th, we would be travel to all parallel words no matther the initial conditions. In the 8th, we would be able to travel in these. In the 9th we would be able to compare possible universes. The problem with this assumption is that we&#39;re still chained by time. In a cycle of space and time, space and time, and again and again. Like 5th dimension (space), 6th (time), 7th (space), 8th (time) and so on. \r<br>\r<br>Bear with me! \r<br>\r<br>But why was I looking about dimensions? Because I was trying to understand the craziness of the Mandelbrot Set, and its relations with the PI, the Fibonacci numbers and especially the called logistic map (which is a 2D print of the Mandelbrot Set, or how a 2D person would look at the Mandelbrot set). \r<br>\r<br>But why especially the logistic map? In the Veritasium channel, the guy drops the question: what is the Feigenbaum constant? As he simulates in the screen, it looks obvious that the fractal repeats itself in Feigenbaum constant rate. Then I went looking what fractals are I stepped on a video of a guy explaining that fractals are typically not self-similar and what took my attention there was the fact that he was using parts of the fractal to discover the overall shape of the fractal. \r<br>\r<br>In addition, I watched a guy very happily solving a sequence problem with crazy circles and geometry on Numberphile channel and another Veritasium video about the Quartz not respecting the symmetry of time. Final a video about the G\u00f6del&#39;s Second Incompleteness Theorem. \r<br>\r<br>Conclusion: Our math system is incomplete (good!) and the fact of the quartz not respecting the symmetry of time may means that when we look at this scale are not looking at the insides of the Mandelbrot Set anymore, where the laws of physics work, but at the outside of it, where it blows the equation. Outside the Mandelbrot, set is another dimension where the time has no symmetry because it can explode the equation. In addition, it can explode the equation because is faster than light and we cannot understand things faster than light with our incomplete math system! \r<br>\r<br>My question is: Does it make any sense? If yes, couldn&#39;t we use the same circle method used in the Numberphile video to make measurements and comparisons using the Mandelbrot set as a map starting from the boundaries of the quantum realm?", "comment_date": "2020-06-30T16:58:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr Broncanuus", "comment_text": "i think you need to watch this 5 or 6 times before you get...but you must understand every step", "comment_date": "2020-06-29T19:05:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Detters", "comment_text": "I watch this while snorting a line, wondering what drugs the people who came up with this was on.

I mean, when you said that the velocity vector is changing by some constant (although in terms of vectors the change is not constant because the vector is rotating, but then you say you mean only it&#39;s amplitude), to form the circle the rotation (so change of velocity delta_v)  of velocity has to be the same with each slice. But clearly when you take a look at the elliptical orbit shape the velocity and the force vector don&#39;t encapsulate the same angle with one another... (here was my mistake. The change of velocity has the same angle as the acceleration with each slice, not the velocity vector itself!) do you mean because the acceleration is the change of velocity over time but also changing from slice to slice by a constant angle it implies that the velocity vector from one to the next slice has to rotate by the same amount since the only change is it&#39;s orientation (again: Not the velocity vector rotates by the same amount of angle but the vector that describes the change of velocity does...)?<br>By the way, I&#39;m not stupid.

I then set out to find similar constructions for ellipses and hyperbolas.  For the ellipse, start with a circular disk of paper and an off-centered point.  Fold each point on the edge to the point and the creases form an envelope of the ellipse.

You make the sun somewhere not in the middle of the circle. Which makes an ellipse automatically? But why? And how does that solve anything? What I would like to know is how do you know the distance the Earth moved its speed? And Anything that you just explained? If I a regular person wanted to solve. Where our orbit is. I would first ask the question. Does the sing that I assume I am orbiting? Change in size over the course of the so-called year which was a made-up thing? Without even the idea of what a year is. Only knowing what a day is. How did anyone ever come to the conclusion that a year actually existed of us going around a sun? If somehow I was able to take measurements of the Sun and noticed that at some point it was closer and at another point it was farther away. If over a certain large amount of days I would end up finding out that this is a repeating pattern. I would be able to then the deuce. That there is an ellipsis happening which explains the US getting closer and I was moving away. If we lived in a binary system, it would be a different story. And considering the Venus is pretty bright. Not as bright as the sun. We can pretty much assume that we are not in a binary system. I remember seeing someone explain that if our son moving for the Galaxy And us going around the Sun the actual result. Is this corkscrew? And an ellipsis is part of that. Somehow. If I wanted to know. That it was an ellipsis. Assuming the Galaxy orbit of the Sun. And it&#39;s constant movement around the disc Galaxy regardless of the galaxies movement I would then assume that if Earth is going around the Sun. Consistently The speed of the earth and the speed of the Sun. If we consider the direction of the Earth rotation as we get dragged behind the sun we would notice. If regular Pole Makes us move in the same direction as the sun. We actually have consistently almost near the same Direction in the galaxy as the Sun at one point, but as we get closer to the Sun or I should say. As we get to a certain point in the orbit we should expect that we would be then turning around and going back. In the opposite direction of where the Sun is going. To some degree. Rotating around the Sun We would see. The speed and direction of the planet versus the Galaxy orbit means that we technically if we were not moving as fast as we are<br> I&#39;ll put it a different way.<br> observe that there are galaxies. Then make the assumption that our star is in a galaxy. . As we also moved through the galaxies he and go around the star. Or even if It is going around us like the Moon is. . We should expect that Because there is an orbit. Assuming the orbit is moving. We can. Easily assume That during one part of the orbit. Both items AE the Sun and the Earth Will move in the same direction at one orbit. There will be a cross. point where the sun is moving For a better term up as we move. To the side And the Sun is almost catching up with us. And the down orbit Where the momentum of the Sun? moving in One Direction versus Our Moment based on our speed in the orbit move in the opposite direction Will make us shoot back. Behind the sun&#39;s Tale Obviously further than as we&#39;re moving in the same direction as the sun. but because of the gravity we keep Getting yanked back. And the reason why it&#39;s not a very thin ellipses. And the reason why I can never be a circle. Orbit, is because Of the sun&#39;s orbit and because of our distance from the Sun. and our speed and its speed. Say for example, you had the sun virtually not moving in the galaxy. Well, the first thing that would happen which is terrible is that the sun would just be pulled into the centre of the Galaxy. But let&#39;s say that the sun is displaced from a Galaxy. Somehow I shot out of the Galaxy and left into a virtually open space. It technically would still have momentum moving forward. But eventually might end up. Just sitting there. Let&#39;s say if the Sun and its orbit. solar system was flown outside of the universe that would make sings Crazy. Eventually the Sun not affected by any other gravity whatsoever. Would stop having sings be yanked. And then we would simply start. spinning around the Sun in a similar way to the sun around the Galaxy. Which is a disk because galaxies momentum crew the universe is extremely negligible. If the sun stops moving. Through space-time and All the bodies are simply still in the roads the position and given a certain speed. Based on their Mass. Would all the items still be orbiting or would they actually just start Free Falling? As we know there is nothing pushing the Earth. To keep it speed up so that we keep an orbit going. And in order to do an orbit around our planet, we assume we need to actually keep moving in the sideways Direction Ron. We start Falling Towards the planet. Except for the moon doesn&#39;t because it simply is. but the moon has an ellipses orbit because it Is going around a body that&#39;s being pulled around the Sun. So let&#39;s say if the Sun if Orbitz we&#39;re basic circles. Because the sun was not moving through space. Orbitz would technically never occur. Because the pull of gravity would simply pull us all towards. the song If the stone wasn&#39;t there the pull of gravity would simply pull the moon towards the Earth. Knowing the thought experiment of what would happen if things were simply not. in some vast clock We&#39;re in the sun moves in the Galaxy the Galaxy for whatever reason. You would think must be moving. also And we didn&#39;t even need to know any measurements to come to the conclusion. We just simply put the father experiment what happens if you post something rotate something or yeah.<br> I don&#39;t need measurements. I just need the fog experiments. What if all things were? or if anyone sing rotating around the other Has its centerpiece not actually moving through space Also. swing a yo-yo around and it will be move in the circle. But if you stop swinging it a constantly just drops. so therefore Another question is why are we not just dust like the dust of a comet? It&#39;s like<br> He didn&#39;t even talk about. How if you drag a kite behind you? Say the Rope is gravity. You are the sun and the kite is the Earth. It&#39;s just behind you. And does not move in an orbit. This is how we know that our orbit is farther away. from the centre of the Galaxy making a slow orbit. Thankfully. because if we were moving any faster, we would be closer to the Center And there would be the sky Ting effect. Of the Earth moving directly behind the sun constantly. Instead of an orbit at all. so when we think of the idea of stars in the galaxy and potential good planets We have to remember that as we get closer. to the Galaxy Core those good planets Would kite away from a sun only refers to the mass of the Sun versus the mass of the planets And they would likely have just constantly North chasing Suns.<br> We are in fact more lucky than we say to have a planet on the outer edge of a galaxy orbit. on a solar orbit as we do", "comment_date": "2020-02-07T05:28:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jianguo Qi", "comment_text": "This is totally amazing.", "comment_date": "2020-02-05T09:27:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "onlyme0349", "comment_text": "Props for all the effort that went into this, I kind of expected a more intuitive overview with some examples of why this is useful, but we can&#39;t really expect you to be Feynman", "comment_date": "2020-01-31T12:09:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mmcP.118.8", "comment_text": "Have you seen the heliocentric model with the Sun zooming through the galaxy ????<br>Makes me wonder why the sky NEVER changes .....", "comment_date": "2020-01-26T21:49:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abigrael Halo-Hymn", "comment_text": "Is this why we have short summers and long winters?", "comment_date": "2020-01-24T15:12:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicolaj Bunting", "comment_text": "If you know the orbital period, minor and major axes, the position of the apogee and perigee, and the initial starting point in Cartesian coordinates could you determine the position of a planet from knowing just the elapsed time?", "comment_date": "2020-01-23T23:53:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A i", "comment_text": "I have yet to pat myself on the back...will I ever?", "comment_date": "2020-01-22T10:24:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "raultejedor", "comment_text": "I already knew my intelligence was not infinite.

I got a little lost at that part, but that might&#39;ve just been me. :P Also, (I&#39;m a little new to physics) how do we know the velocity vectors?

Now it will have the same radius of the initial circle . Now the centripetal force will be pointed to the sun . Consider it to be a line. Now ,we know that it is passing thru a single point (sun) .

Millison\r<br>\r<br>Great physicists from the past decide to return to Earth for one last road-trip vacation to the coast together. They all appear on Earth on the appointed evening. Heisenberg pulls up behind the wheel of a gigantic 1930&#39;s car, a huge grin on his face. \r<br>As they&#39;re getting in the car, Hubble looks up and says &quot;What a wonderfully dark sky&quot;.\r<br>&quot;Shouldn&#39;t be&quot; responds Olbers.\r<br>&quot;Always has been&quot; says Hoyle.\r<br>&quot;No, it hasn&#39;t&quot; says Lemaitre.\r<br>&quot;I knew that!&quot; says an embarrassed Einstein.\r<br>Once they&#39;re all in, Teller says &quot;Hey guys, this trip is going to be The Bomb!&quot;.\r<br>&quot;Yeah, but why do I always have to organize?&quot; asks Oppenheimer.\r<br>&quot;Where exactly will we end up?&quot; asks Kepler.\r<br>&quot;That&#39;s impossible to predict&quot; says Bohr.\r<br>&quot;I just can&#39;t believe that&#39;s true&quot; says Einstein.\r<br>Heisenberg punches the throttle and the old car roars off.\r<br>&quot;Say - this thing sure accelerates&quot; says Newton.\r<br>&quot;I don&#39;t know, Isaac. It feels like gravity to me&quot; smirks Einstein. \r<br>\r<br>Later that night, as they are speeding down a country road, a police car catches up to them and pulls them over.[1]\r<br>&quot;Do you know how fast you were going?&quot; the cop asks. [1]\r<br>&quot;No, but I know exactly where I am&quot; Heisenberg replies. [1]\r<br>The cop says &quot;You were doing 55 in a 35&quot; [1]\r<br>Heisenberg throws up his hands and shouts &quot;Great! Now I&#39;m lost!&quot; [1]\r<br>The cop thinks this is suspicious and orders him to pop open the trunk. He checks it out and says &quot;Do you know you have a dead cat back here?&quot; [1]\r<br>&quot;We do now, asshole!&quot; shouts Schrodinger. [1]\r<br>&quot;I think it&#39;s time to split&quot; says Everett.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;Say, how did you manage to spot us on such a dark night?&quot; asks Hubble.\r<br>&quot;I saw the light from your head lamps&quot; says the cop.\r<br>&quot;How fast was <b>it</b> going?&quot; asks Michelson.\r<br>&quot;That&#39;s simple addition&quot; giggles Galileo.\r<br>&quot;Not exactly&quot; says Lorentz.\r<br>&quot;Look here&quot; says Heisenberg, &quot;how do you know I was going that fast?&quot;\r<br>&quot;I clocked you over a measured distance&quot; says the cop.\r<br>&quot;How often?&quot; asks Hertz.\r<br>&quot;I disagree with your measurement, officer&quot; interjects Einstein.\r<br>&quot;Don&#39;t start tonight, Albert&quot; says Bohr, shaking his head.\r<br>&quot;What Herr Einstein is trying to say&quot; continues Heisenberg, &quot;is that time was running at a different rate for you than for us&quot;.\r<br>&quot;WHAT!!!???&quot; exclaims Newton.\r<br>&quot;It&#39;s true&quot; says Maxwell. &quot;We&#39;re all famous scientists and, believe us, Herr Einstein has proved it, though it came as no surprise to me&quot;.\r<br>&quot;Sounds complicated&quot; responds the cop.\r<br>&quot;I&#39;ll draw you a simple diagram&quot; says Feynman.\r<br>Totally flummoxed, the cop lets them go with a warning. As he drives away, Doppler cocks his head and listens to the sound of the receding police car. &quot;Gotta love that&quot; he says.\r<br>&quot;Amen&quot; responds Hubble.\r<br>\r<br>Returning to their car, Lord Kelvin remarks &quot;Sure is warm tonight&quot;\r<br>&quot;Yep - lots of disorder&quot; replies Boltzmann.\r<br>&quot;In places you&#39;d never expect&quot; adds Hawking.\r<br>&quot;I was lucky to get away with that&quot; says Heisenberg. &quot;Most cops think they&#39;re better than everyone else&quot;.\r<br>&quot;Yes - I hate inequality&quot; adds Bell.\r<br>&quot;Though you <b>were</b> speeding&quot; says Faraday to Heisenberg. &quot;I carefully observed the needle creep from 35 to 55&quot;.\r<br>&quot;Actually, it was jumping, Michael&quot; replies Planck.\r<br>\r<br>As they pile back into the car, Bohr says &quot;See here - you must fill the seats in order - no empty spaces allowed. And stop interfering with each other!&quot;\r<br>&quot;Only one of you can sit next to me!&quot; yells an agitated Pauli.\r<br>&quot;Say, Werner - it&#39;s stuffy in here. Be a good chap and crack the window a bit&quot; says Hawking.\r<br>&quot;Sorry, Stephen. It can be all the way up or all the way down, but nowhere in between&quot; replies Heisenberg.\r<br>&quot;Hey guys - Albert and I just figured out a great shortcut. Only one bridge&quot; announces Rosen.\r<br>&quot;It will save us a lot of distance&quot; says Einstein, &quot;but it might get spooky&quot;.\r<br>\r<br>Arriving at the beach the next morning, they hurry from the car and stand looking out over the ocean.\r<br>&quot;Look at the wonderful waves&quot; says Schrodinger.\r<br>&quot;They don&#39;t look like waves to me&quot; says Bohr.\r<br>Looking down at the fine sand, Dirac exclaims &quot;Look at all the particles!&quot;\r<br>&quot;Now <b>those</b> look like waves&quot; says De Broglie.\r<br>&quot;This is great!&quot; exclaims Feynman, rubbing his hands together. &quot;Now, lets go meet some girls!&quot;\r<br>&quot;Let&#39;s delay&quot; says Wheeler.\r<br>&quot;We have to be discrete&quot; warns Bohm.\r<br>&quot;Girls?

This was much easier at the time because so much was known about the geometric properties of the ellipse than was about F=m a. In fact, Newton couldn&#39;t really mathematically use velocities because they compare two quantities with unequal units (distance, time). Also of course algebraic notations and vectors weren&#39;t invented yet. But still Newton claimed to have won his bet, and the Principia avoids any clarity about proving the inverse square law vs. the converse (proving the elliptic shape). <br>I&#39;m sure Newton would have LOVED this type of proof, and this proof in particular! Although I&#39;m sure he&#39;d appreciate how much more powerful modern mathematical notation and ideas such as vector or Lagrangian calculus are.

Like a true fan with a circle shaped &quot;leaf&quot;. What about taking the centre outside of the circle, resulting in exactly two vectors that are going in the same direction but one is just a lot longer?<br><br>Looking at what happens to the orbit when you bring the centre of velocities towards one side makes the resulting orbit more and more elliptic. Having the centre of velocities sit at the circle would then probably correspond to having exactly escape velocity, as in an orbit that has barely too much energy to close into an ellipse.  There&#39;s exactly one zero velocity vector which to my understanding would be located at infinity.  However, I can&#39;t trace this on the paper, because the resulting shape isn&#39;t a smooth curve.<br><br>What seems to happen when you bring the centre of velocities outside the circle results in a really weird shape. It&#39;s like a round object, possibly a circle, but sitting away from the centre of the &quot;orbit&quot; and the velocity is at its highest at the point that is furthest away from the centre of the &quot;orbit&quot;. I have no explanation for this and I have no idea what I&#39;ve created in terms of mathematics.

I&#39;m in my 60&#39;s &amp; was a high-school dropout. I went on to get a modest amount of formal education &amp; training in a limited variety of subjects. I did okay with electronics algebra &amp; basic trig, but then I hit a plateau. It took me a good  decade to recover from that setback, and begin to realize that math can be awesome, beautiful, and even entertaining. I became a person who wished they could have been an astrophysicist. Part of that desire came from finding my way back to a youthful obsession with the nature of the universe, of which I&#39;d all but forgotten. Later, I began to see how impressive were the skill sets of many of the world&#39;s physics giants. In the last several years, while I mainly do more-mundane, day-to-day achievements of a kind, I spend a lot of time examining  everything I can find on the laws of nature &amp; the stories of science. I can&#39;t seem to get enough of it. But I&#39;m too often struggling with concepts that are way over my head, and I&#39;ve wished to find an easy way to learn some of the fundamentals. Meanwhile, I&#39;ve tried hard to acquaint myself with every existing variety of fields in which the highest math skills are put to work. I&#39;ve gotten some great books from the library, and have devoured countless, thrilling stories of the history of science. I&#39;ve been given or purchased several of my own, too, and have read all the magazines for the last 15 years.. I&#39;ve learned about the important breakthroughs of Aristotle, Ptolemy, Newton, Brahe, Copernicus, and quite a few others, including Johannes Kepler. I have an awareness of a good number of modern-day achievements, along with today&#39;s heavy hitters. too. I can&#39;t entirely explain this fascination I&#39;ve developed. It has a grip on me, and sometimes I think life would just be a lot easier, if I dropped the whole thing, but but just won&#39;t go away.

Well how complex wave forms form eclipses. Not everything is a circle especially at the quantum scale. At least in the drawings in my <a href=\"http://head.one/\">head.One</a> of those shapes in my head is one step further then this lecture so hang on. If you take the eclipse formed by the eclipse and then use that semi circle. Rotate the semi circle about it&#39;s offset axis in the dimensions you have the complex wave form sheet of what I see as a stabile or it of an electron. But instead of an orbit it&#39;s quanta of energy is like a string vibrating and moving fast. This makes it appear to occupy a circular space the electron shell. But with precise measure beyond or capability and slowed down forms a bumpy spherical wave. This is how matter of am electron appears to have a probability of existing in a certain place. It&#39;s orbit is detected with various probably as these orbits I&#39;d eclipse change in 3d orientation to the off set focus. You can see the cross section of the outer edge of an electron shell in my painting called theoretically. The reason E=mc^2 is that e or motion is required more as the mass converts into the energy of motion. More energy in motion is required to fill space as a 12 dimensional object expands towards compete entropy to fill the space between the other 12 dimensional objects surrounding it. The whole math of a cube of spheres with a sphere that fits in the inner space but some how by elongating it&#39;s edge or wave forms will expand until it&#39;s outer edge reaches the outer radius of the spheres surrounding it. To do this E is required to vibrated with such energy to fill the space with its now spread out mass that it&#39;s equivalent to E=mc^2. That kind of that vibration is necessary to advice that state after such it&#39;s mass escapes the bonds of the surrounding spheres or cannot achieve a higher vibration and appears as inert straight line stretched as far as they can from the inner spheres center. It&#39;s complete higher energy state not had completely converted it&#39;s mass into and no longer soars to exist as mass.", "comment_date": "2018-07-22T18:53:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Patrickhh", "comment_text": "More like hourphysics", "comment_date": "2018-07-22T18:37:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Lopez", "comment_text": "But how does this work when other objects are constantly acting upon it?, but is it irrelevant because said objects are being affected  by it and the same sun?", "comment_date": "2018-07-22T18:30:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Donata", "comment_text": "For some reason this made me extremely happy<br>man I love science", "comment_date": "2018-07-22T18:10:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "culwin", "comment_text": "wut", "comment_date": "2018-07-22T18:03:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "noobmaster69", "comment_text": "God tier animation", "comment_date": "2018-07-22T17:33:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kartik Joshi", "comment_text": "This lecture is pure gold for aspiring theoretical physicists of the future.

First, realize that the angle theta shown in the velocity space is offset by 90 degrees from the angle on the orbital diagram. The move at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdIjYBtnvZU&amp;t=18m52s\">18:52</a> then amounts to simply re-aligning these mismatched thetas, and then pointing the velocity vectors back in the right direction. Restoring the proper positions of the velocity vectors in a way that precisely mimics the construction of an ellipse shows that the orbital path must be an ellipse.<br><br>However, we haven&#39;t proven that the velocity-space theta and the orbital theta actually are offset by 90 degrees. It looks reasonable, and for some special vectors it&#39;s easy to show, but an actual proof would be very nice. To see why it is, consider the acceleration vectors (the little yellow ones that form the boundary of the velocity-space circle). They are all of equal length and are all aimed at a common point. Their orientations relative to one another are the same as those of the radii of a circle. However, in the velocity-space diagram, the acceleration vectors have the same orientation, but they are tangents of the circle, not radii. Because the radius of a circle is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point the radius meets the circumference, we can conclude that the tangent of a circle parallel to a given radius is 90 degrees away from that radius. This means that in order to be rearranged from being radii to being tangents while maintaining orientation, each acceleration vector must have been offset by 90 degrees.<br><br>Now that we know for certain that the angles in the velocity-space are offset by 90 degrees from the actual orbit, it&#39;s clear that the elliptical construction at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdIjYBtnvZU&amp;t=18m52s\">18:52</a> is simply returning the velocity vectors to their rightful places, indicating that the shape of the orbit is elliptical.", "comment_date": "2018-07-21T05:18:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jerome L.", "comment_text": "That&#39;s why I teach history and not science.", "comment_date": "2018-07-21T05:04:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Use It", "comment_text": "Grant not only is a genius but he is also a fantastic teacher.
