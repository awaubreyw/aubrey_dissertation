At first, I wasn&#39;t sure why you&#39;d be angry about the video, but realized that it would be a normal response to feeling that you&#39;d been lied to for reasons that were intended to get something from you, which maybe was more obvious in considering the context or entirety of the email. I assume they were trying to get you to click on something or to somehow direct you to some link that would compromise your system, and nobody likes being targeted this way. <br><br>Supposing, though, that someone manufactured this story to make people feel good? It&#39;s less maddening, but still irksome to be misled. It might even give you a nice feeling to know that someone had this intent -- even if the means were bothersome. You doodled 2 outcomes at one point: be mad, or feel warmth. If these are the only consequences to the information, then, you might ask yourself, what is the preferred outcome? It&#39;s a question that poses other questions that can be a little triggering. For instance, since the obviously preferential state would be warmth (over rage), then to choose this state might seem to suggest, assuming you&#39;d discovered the video to be falsely presented as depicting something it didn&#39;t , that you choose to indulge in a kind of denial or self-deception in order to experience the warmth, simply because the truth elicits anger. It&#39;s not the best example, since it could be argued that there might be further consequences to the information, which violates the conditions of the thought experiment.  A better one might indicate that there&#39;s no way for you to know for certain what the intent was, and that -- even if you were able to ascertain the intent -- there nothing you can do about it, and no action you could take that might prove useful to yourself or others. The superpower, then, is the ability to prevent a waste of your psychic energy on something over which you have no control and cannot even have all the facts. <br><br>Wasting our emotional bandwidth on things about which we have no control is a phenomenon that makes sense, from an evolutionary point of view, but in the context of modern stimuli can prove to be a detriment to our wellbeing or productivity, even in a typical human mental process. And too often it can prove to rise to the level of disorder in proper functioning or pursuit of a peace of mind. Commitment to the interpretation of annoying interactions as originating in malice can serve as a protective barrier to the threat of being victimized, and one might say that it&#39;s wise to err on the side of distrust, if only to avoid this, but, supposing that this has the result of giving you a generally false view of others and the world, then wouldn&#39;t this fall into the same category of delusion, or indulging in a (this time protective) outlook that was so distasteful in the first instance? <br><br>Supposing that someone &quot;cut you off&quot; in traffic. When this typically happens, the immediate assumption is that someone has done this selfishly, recklessly, and in some kind of contest of ego that might demand an engagement on your part. We often thing that we can &quot;read&quot; the intentions of drivers based on the movement of their vehicles, but -- even if we could be sure that the perpetrator was guilty of the mindset and motivation that we imagine has engaged him/her -- what is the best outcome that could come from engaging with the driver? Do we think we might prevent the driver from behaving this way in the future if we find some way to communicate our thoughts of disapproval and disdain? What if we were able to read the mind of the driver and found, to our surprise, that there was no selfishness or malice, but, for instance, maybe there was a momentary lapse of judgement that was extremely rare for him/her, and that he/she just didn&#39;t see you, and was mortified when they&#39;d discovered they had cut in front of a care that they didn&#39;t know was there? Or perhaps there was a medical issue -- an epileptic fit that couldn&#39;t have been predicted, or some momentary blackout that should be a cause for your concern, and not the object of your rage? To some degree, we choose our reactions to stimuli all day long, based on partial information from which we assess probabilities and consider preferred outcomes, while weighing the problematic implications of reacting in a way based on assumptions that might be wrong. Our perspectives on any encounter will inform how we respond emotionally, with that emotion being most useful as a tool for effecting a change in the state of affairs when our assumptions are correct, but more often than not, even these reactions serve little purpose even when our intel is the very best. <br><br>I bring the traffic example up only because it comes to mind as an example of a conscious choice that an acquaintance of mine has devised as a matter of habit to practice a state of mind that is more conducive to peace and happiness. When cut off in traffic, for instance, he makes the conscious decision to acknowledge that, not only can he not be certain of the circumstances of the infraction, but that he has the power to view even the worst interpretation (that the car is being piloted by an ass) as an indication that the driver is afflicted with a condition that is more deserving of pity than of any engagement in a way that one might instinctually turn to. Perhaps the person, this acquaintance pointed out, was a victim of abuse, or had just been fired, or any other explanation one might imagine as causing this moment of assholery. This superpower is one that has replaced an inclination to obsess over the behavior of others, and he finds that pity will dissipate in the presence of uncertainty much more readily than will rage. And it has had the effect of preventing that menacing waste of energy that had otherwise been so problematic and pointless. <br><br>Having said that, please don&#39;t think that I&#39;m intending to excuse mendacity or exploitive misinformation. It&#39;s important to expose lies in most situations, if only to deter any mindset that might think it might be normalized.

I know that many people are actively seeking &quot;confirmation bias.&quot; However, I do think that there is a psychological element at play. Sometimes, people &quot;listen&quot; to sources that are &quot;verified&quot; by other &quot;sources&quot; (which are simply repeating the same claim found elsewhere -- as with the &quot;eye of newt&quot;). In fact, I was trying to explain this when it came to the sinking of the RMS Titanic. <br><br>There were survivors who made some very specific claims that could not possibly have been true. From claims about the ship sinking in one piece, the captain&#39;s demise (there are about a dozen conflicting reports), a shooting of a passenger, a suicide by the first officer to a supposed drunk man swimming in the ocean for hours -- there is no end to myths, urban legends and outrageous claims about the sinking of Titanic. Yet, many of these things began from the mouths of the survivors themselves!  This begs the questions regarding &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how.&quot;<br><br>My guess is that many of these stories began aboard the Carpathia. Traumatized survivors gave and listened to various accounts by other survivors throughout the trip from the rescue to their docking in New York City. I personally believe that some of these accounts amalgamated into &quot;widely known&quot; stories until they became &quot;first-hand accounts.&quot; Some of the survivors who were &quot;eyewitnesses&quot; of certain events, at the time they &quot;witnessed&quot; the events, were actually aboard lifeboats (floating at sea level) a quarter-mile from the sinking ship. <br><br>There is a condition in which repeated stories are visualized by people so often or vividly that they become faux memories. I think that this is what happened in many cases. At the same time, I think that some passengers embellished their own &quot;story of survival&quot; for fame or money (as it was common practice in the early days of yellow journalism to PAY people for their stories). The story of &quot;I jumped off the boat, climbed/clasped aboard an overturned lifeboat and focused on holding on for dear life&quot; wasn&#39;t exceptionally &quot;exciting&quot; or &quot;newsworthy.&quot; So, it became a story of swimming in the ocean for hours (physically impossible given the temperature) or tales of what those on that overturned lifeboat saw regarding the sinking. <br><br>I think that this is why happens with cases of the &quot;eye of newt&quot; (albeit in a different form). There is a parable of Jesus about how difficult it is for a rich person to go to Heaven. Jesus said that it was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to go to heaven. Over the last few decades, there are people who claim that the &quot;eye of a needle&quot; that Jesus was referring to in that parable was a physical passage in the desert where people had to crouch as their camel went through it. Yet, this simply isn&#39;t true (at least as the focus of that parable). Yet, it was repeated so often that it seemingly became &quot;fact&quot; for many people. <br><br>Personally, I think that Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;eye of newt&quot; is just that -- the &quot;eye&quot; of a newt. I could be wrong, but I am not going to be persuaded otherwise unless I see a viable firsthand (contemporary with at least Shakespeare) source to prove otherwise.", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T18:30:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Scott Andersen", "comment_text": "Also good rules to keep you safe from malicious email.", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T18:24:14Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Dennis", "comment_text": "This is an excellent video.

Especially when emotional responses are the attempted goal.<br><br>And we all need to learn how to take the pause even with what they belive is trusted news sources. <br>Pause. Especially with news and political outlets.<br><br>Now I would like to share how I do the pause when it comes to those sources <br>It&#39;s a long read.<br><br>I always pause and write down the logic blocks that are presented, and double check sources. If the sources are not boots on the ground reporting I discard the news source entirely, if it&#39;s boots on the ground reporting I remove any charged language and form my own opinion, comparing it to statistical analysis of similar events.<br><br>If it&#39;s opinion however at all I follow these steps<br>First, even if I <b>think</b> I know the definitions I double check them. Capitalism and liberalism are not what we culturally think they are, for example.<br>And I will use the claim of &quot;capitalism is what provided the western quality of life&quot; for the example going forward, because right wing or left wing or neutral this will equally peeve everyone off.<br><br>Capitalism is a form of hierarchical ownership and profit share based on level of monetary investment. The more you invest the more you own.<br><br>Then I block out the logic In a simple chain of rules claimed.<br><br>Capitalism is claimed to be constructive.<br><br>All other systems are assumed to be worse.<br><br>Only capitalism is allowed to contribute to constructive growth.<br><br>Then I look to see if the rules hold out.<br><br>The biggest quality of life improvement was the Interstate highway and freeway systems. These where done by government spending and built by both goverment laborers and private capitalist contractors. It&#39;s a wash, but any wash is a strike against the argument.<br>Similar can be said for tech development with universities, NASA, and the Military Indistrial Complex, private companies etc.<br><br>So the statement is wrong. But how wrong?<br>Now I carry out an logical extension of the argument made.<br>How can private investment lead to to better growth in quality of life?<br>Well it means ownership requires some intrest in company success. Your money is on the line. <br>So how does that impact quality of life and innovation?<br>It means that there will always be an attempt to make the highest profits. But that is not a direct connection to quality of life or innovation, just addiction and dependence.<br>Next I form the first opinion, counter statement.<br>Capitalism by itself <b>can</b> be a driving force for innovation and improving quality of life, but nothing is showing its the best motive force for innovation and quality of life.<br><br>So how do I tweak capitalism to be a driving force for innovation and quality of life? (Here is where the leftists get peeved)<br>If I change the rules to be laborers may only invest for ownership that ties more responsibility to ownership and increases the motive force for improving quality of life, and reduces the motive force for quick profits, but does not direct the force towards quality of life any better.<br>Same goes for community ownership.<br><br>So what if I change the idea of hierarchical ownership? Switching it entirely<br>Hierarchy comes from hierso meaning divine, and archos meaning ruler. We can ignore the divine safely now.<br>So we want not a ruler but for the chain of command to the top to be followers with more responsibility.<br>The opposite of the investors in capitalism is the consumers.<br><br>Would having consumers own the companies lead to better quality of life, and Innovation? It would definitely lead to better Innovation as customers would always want the flashiest coolest newest and most novelty and would have to take responsibility if those novelties are a flop.<br>But quality of life? Let&#39;s look at the biggest areas we know we have to explore.<br>Medical. If customers owned the medical facilities then they would be shopping around for the lowest priced innovation for the most rewards and least amount of Dr visits possible.<br>In this case the answer is yes.<br>Technological.<br>Customers wanting the latest and best products for the lowest cost would lead to cheaper made products and more disposable products, not better products.<br>So it&#39;s a no.<br><br>So now I have a conclusion.<br>Capitalism does not lead to any special results, and there are systems that can lead to better results <b>if applied</b> in certain markets, and likely if I continued looping over the logic rule blocks long enough I would find ways that make more sense for each industry, but there will never be a best way for <b>all</b> industries.<br><br>Sorry to say to the  politically inclined, there is no one best system.", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T04:24:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RackPullAboveTheKnees", "comment_text": "Now that YouTube removed the dislike counts, we have no way to know what is real or fake on YouTube.", "comment_date": "2021-12-23T04:23:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mike Heffernan", "comment_text": "There&#39;s no time limit on the pause, either.
