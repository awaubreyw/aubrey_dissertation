However, since we&#39;re not omnipresent/omnipotent, it&#39;s not exactly realistic to the &quot;real reality&quot; to assume we know everything. It can be a practical and coincidental assumption that some variable did in fact cause something, but data doesn&#39;t ever really &quot;imply&quot; or in other words, &quot;prove&quot; that it must have caused it. That&#39;s not to say that we might not have ruled something out, but since we can&#39;t control the unknown, we cuds&#39;t possibly prove the cause either. Moreover, under the environment of our universe (or under the assumption for our universal laws), for an object/concept to cause something to another object/concept, it takes two or more to achieve. That being said, there can be many causes to one thing. I might have contributed to something depending how one person views it. Conversely, time I might&#39;ve thought I caused it with my own free will but might not have caused in reality. That&#39;s to say, we are pretty limited in our knowledge of causation and in fact, determining causality might be subjective as well. I also get that many people suggests &quot;practicality,&quot; but if we&#39;re talking about proofs that try to straighten out facts in black and white, it might fall flat when we test that &quot;proof&quot; in all situations. There is the statistical &quot;law of large numbers&quot; or however you call it. It&#39;s certainly useful for assumptions and practicality, so it&#39;s enough for an &quot;implication&quot; (in other words, &quot;suggests&quot; causation) under a confidence level or an assumption that suggests that a variable is independent from everything else (aka we assume no other variable causes something). This is probably why I&#39;d say, unless we&#39;re somehow omnipresent/omnipotent, the only thing objective in this universe, is that it is objective under constraints/assumption. Statements can be objective if it literally adheres to it&#39;s definition. Under an agreement, we can only make objective statements under assumption of what we know or what we agree to limit the subject/conditions to. That being said, we may say something objective under our own scope/conditions, however, that statement might not bear weight over what really happens in our reality. Science/observations about the universe, are examples of what most of what I consider is subjective. Logic, is closest at heart to the objective, even if things seem improbable. For example, if I say that &quot;anything is possible&quot; mainly because there are infinite many unknowns, then there will be red flags going off in some people&#39;s heads because that doesn&#39;t sound right. &quot;How can statements be in true and false at the same time?&quot; Well they can, if the nature of the words used in that statement are ambiguous (similar to super positioning and thee logic that comes with it). The only way to get around that, is to strictly limit your definition and make it more specific, aka make the definition more known (just like determining a position from a nonzero velocity, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is basically analogous to this). Besides, making a statement more objective is about making it more known and unambiguous to the point where it&#39;s basically the definition of another concept. I get that definitions can be &quot;subjective,&quot; however, that doesn&#39;t relate to our concept of making an objective statement anyways, because things are objective only to it&#39;s observation. Moreover, we also have to unambiguous discern which of the two definition of &quot;possible&quot; are we using, that it is able to happen vs it might happen but we don&#39;t know. Like one thing to consider, if God can kill you and promise&#39;s that he&#39;ll never kill you (and we know he doesn&#39;t break promises), can we really say that it&#39;s &quot;possible&quot; for God to kill you? It&#39;s &quot;possible&quot; that he can kill you be cause he is capable of doing so, but it&#39;s also &quot;impossible&quot; because he made a promise to do so. Effectively it&#39;s impossible to happen, but it&#39;s possible because he&#39;s capable, which demonstrates two different meanings of &quot;possibility&quot; which gets straightened out as I break down into more specific components. So if we use the &quot;capable&quot; definition of &quot;possible,&quot; then it would mean it is &quot;possible that something is truly impossible&quot; which is a contradiction in itself (which is related to Russell&#39;s paradox). And all that is possible because by our own definitions, we explicitly define the opposite of &quot;possible&quot; is &quot;impossible.&quot; By the nature of that fact/logic, there&#39;s basically a set of known&#39;s in the universe that we can deduce more known statements from, in fact, an infinite many, and it&#39;s up to us to pick and choose to define. In the end, I just want to stress the importance of what unknown and known (and definitions) can bring, especially in quantum physics, statistics, philosophy, logic, math, science, etc... today. Under specific and constructive definitions, I can really say, there is objectivity at heart of pure logic. So if you&#39;re sad that not everything is constantly defined, straightforward, or answered, don&#39;t worry, we have foundation set up to know some universal truths under our concern and definitions. If you&#39;re sad that something you want &quot;everything is possible&quot; but find that an infinite many things are simply not by principle, that&#39;s ok, because most of the things that we are &quot;certain that is impossible&quot; are restrained to certain subjects and they must be worded so that their explicit definitions are direct opposites (so they will no matter what contradict each other making it impossible for both events to occur). So, we still have &quot;endless possibilities&quot; because of unknown/ambiguity, which is nearly just as good for skeptics and dreamers out there, just keep in mind, statistics is a strong form of evidence, not proof, so be mindful of what you make out of that.", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T11:04:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "whoised", "comment_text": "Here&#39;s the issue: Inference of causality is not the same as proving a causality.

Being fatter than average isn&#39;t itself inherently any less healthy than being taller or having more muscle than average because all the stats that are directly 1-to-1 linked to issues with weight like joint pain and blood pressure are based on BMI, not fat content, and there are a lot of conditions that are correlated to poor behaviors and illnesses that sometimes also lead people to be fatter than average. Laymen present the case that being fat is unhealthy, but it&#39;s really that being fat is one of the many conditions correlated to, but not always caused by, the same unhealthy behaviors. Doctors play into this, by considering a fat person who dies of a heart attack or diabetes to have died from something &quot;obesity related&quot; but a thin person who dies from the same thing does not have their condition connected to their death, and the statistics for &quot;obesity related deaths&quot; grow whether the condition was actually cause by the obesity or not. The real danger here is to thin people who assume they can eat terrible food and treat their body like garbage just because they aren&#39;t fat or gaining weight. When a thin person gets type II diabetes, everyone is surprised, even though they shouldn&#39;t be, because it&#39;s considered a disease for fat people. These are the kind of biases that lead to fat people getting way more abuse than they deserve and often they face it while out on a run from passing cars, even while actively exercising. The idea that they are unhealthy because of their body, rather than their health practices,, and without considering that third variable, is ultimately ignorant and based on bigotry, not facts.
