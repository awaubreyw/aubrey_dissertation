But the particles in that soup are still moving around and bumping into one another, each one of them following the system&#39;s equations of motion, despite them all being in equilibrium. So this argument, while interesting, can&#39;t explain why there&#39;s a perceived arrow to time in the first place. In fact, according to general relativity, the flow of time shouldn&#39;t exist at all regardless of the initial conditions at the big bang because time is just a dimension, one of the four dimensions in spacetime. So the flow of time itself seems to be an illusion (see Brian Greene for more on that). I think it will require some nontrivial understanding of human consciousness in order to explain the arrow of time, and perhaps it&#39;s related to entanglement (quantum complexity).

The Big Bang was not the &quot;lowest entropy&quot; state of our local universe.  That existed inside of the Super Black Hole at the moment <b>before</b> it destabilized and then exploded to release its accumulated energy and mass so they could give birth to our present expanding Big Bang local universe.  However, our visible local universe is not the only one in existence.  All of the infinite space of the cosmos is filled with an infinite number of other local Big Bang universes all expanding as does ours now.  <br><br>At some point in the future, perhaps a hundred billion years from now or more, the outer expanding surface galaxies of adjacent local Big Bang universes will begin to collide with each other throughout the infinite space of our cosmos.  At that time the entropy of the cosmos will be at is maximum.  These colliding dead galaxies&#39; burned out stars, under the influence of mutual gravitational forces, will coalesce, accumulate, and then form an infinite collection of growing Super Black Holes spread out across the infinite space of the cosmos.  It is during this time that the entropy of the entire cosmos gets automatically reversed and brought back to its starting point.  <br><br>When all of the energy and matter outside of the infinite number of growing Super Black Holes is finally absorbed into them and passes through their event horizons, then the cosmos will be ready for Rebirth and a natural process will begin to occur in all of the central bodies or &quot;singularities&quot; of all of the infinite number of Super Black Holes which will cause them to destabilize and, perhaps after only a ten billion years or so, more or less simultaneously detonate in an infinite number of Big Bangs that will then the fill infinite space of our cosmos with an infinite number of local expanding Big Bang universes again.  <br><br>This process had no beginning in time, is occurring now, and will continue to happen into the infinite future.  It is the order of things.  It is the only thing that can exist and, indeed, must exist.  No conscious life&#39;s effort in the cosmos can do anything about its directions of entropy changes and time flows on the infinite level, but, perhaps, with enough advanced technology it might be possible to affect things on a small local scale; that is, it might be possible to prematurely reverse the entropy of small parts of the cosmos in a laboratory environment using special equipment and processes.  Thus, we would be able to make cool objects spontaneously heat up, springs spontaneously expand or contract, clocks run backwards and their mainsprings tighten, old organisms become young again, water run uphill against gravity, and scrambled eggs unscramble themselves.

Two possibilities: either the universe existed for a finite amount of time or an infinite amount of time. <br><br>If the universe has existed for an infinite amount of time then there has been an infinite amount of time before us for this heat death to occur, thus the universe must have infinite usable energy or it would have already occurred. That or something triggered the low entropy state to start on its path to high entropy, which makes no sense in such a context as an infinite amount of time would have already passed for this trigger to have occurred, thus it should have occurred infinitely many times already if possible. <br><br>If the universe has existed for a finite amount of time then how did it get to a state of low entropy? Two possibilities for that as I see it: the universe had high entropy before but entropy was reversed or the universe began at the point of lowest entropy. If entropy can be removed then the heat death is avoidable. In either case the universe did not always exist, therefore the low entropy state came from nothing at some point. Therefore it is possible for a low entropy state to be created from nothing and given an infinite amount of time after the &quot;heat death&quot; of our universe this low entropy state will be created from the nothing of our universe and will remake the big bang.<br><br>There&#39;s also the special case that time as most of us understand it is not real and is rather a product of the movement from low entropy to high entropy. Assume time only moves forwards because of this change in entropy, then a state of complete equilibrium would have no time. This would mean that time did not exist before the big bang, but it would also mean that time cannot exist once we reach this heat death equilibrium. So as we get closer and closer to this final equilibrium time will move slower and slower, thus taking longer to reach the equilibrium and creating an asymptotic bound to time. Thus we can never reach true high entropy equilibrium.<br><br>Of course this is all based on the assumption that &quot;if it is possible then it will happen given enough time&quot; and the assumption that &quot;given an infinite amount of time then everything possible will have already happened and will happen infinitely many more times&quot;.", "comment_date": "2016-10-23T23:30:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bigtiddiecommitteesponsor", "comment_text": "Time doesn&#39;t exist...", "comment_date": "2016-10-22T22:53:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jason", "comment_text": "lol was that supposed to be a Simba reference at the end. nice", "comment_date": "2016-10-22T20:16:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RelatedGiraffe", "comment_text": "What does &quot;meaning&quot; refer to in the subtitle of Sean&#39;s book (&quot;On the Origins of LIFE, MEANING, and the UNIVERSE ITSELF&quot;)?", "comment_date": "2016-10-22T20:08:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "vitfirringur", "comment_text": "So I&#39;ve been reading about / watching videos about entropy recently, and apparently, using the term &quot;disorder&quot; to describe entropy is a Bad Thing(TM).

The only way that system behaves like Option #2 is if we assume we have complete knowledge of the past and no knowledge of the future (we assume this by filtering the event space as time progresses or, mathematically, by modeling the family of event spaces as a filtration of sigma algebras that grow in one direction of time and shrink in the other direction). The system would behave like Option #1 if we don&#39;t make any assumptions about our knowledge of either past or future.

Couldn&#39;t we say that at the moment of the big bang the universe was evenly spread (its energy)? Like an infinite sheet of uniform steel for example?

Preface regarding the Space parts: It seems that &quot;backwards&quot; in space just a perception based on our forward-looking eye-holes. If we had eyes facing in all directions, would we have this concept of backwards? Probably not. Backwards can also mean &#39;going in a direction opposite to our current direction.&#39; But once we change direction, this &#39;backwards&quot; becomes the new forwards. Another definition is that &quot;backwards&quot; can mean returning to a point of origin in space; for example a -&gt; b -&gt; a. This form of backwards is also only a perception that is easily countered by a person travelling from the destination to the origin, then back; as in b -&gt; a -&gt; b. In this same frame, we use negative values to graph/calculate movement through space. But this practice seems to be more for convenience because our numbering system works easier with negative values.
