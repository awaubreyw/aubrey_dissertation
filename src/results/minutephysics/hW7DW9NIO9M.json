GRAVITISM.<br>        Over the last decades there have been remarkable developments in thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. Yet many of the basic problems have remained largely unsolved. In the spectrum of opinions expressed by authors who have attempted to solve these problems, one can roughly distinguish three main schools of thought:<br><br>1) Traditional\u00a0axiomatic\u00a0thermodynamics, which cannot explain the origin of irreversibility and time asymmetries.<br><br>2) The statistical school, which generates\u00a0\u201cman-made irreversibility\u2019\u2019\u00a0by imposing asymmetric conditions on symmetric ones in order to describe reality.<br><br>3)\u00a0The new gravitational school, which\u00a0deduces\u00a0the origin of evolution, irreversibility, electromagnetic and thermodynamics from Einsteinian gravitation and the verified expansion of the universe.<br>This school includes some new modifications to the physics as part of GRAVITISM.<br><br>My object is to obtain a consistent mathematical formulation of irreversibility in probabilistic theories. So far physicists have done this by means of (a priori) imposing on symmetric equations an (often hidden postulate of) asymmetry (which,\u00a0in itself, is equivalent to the very results that the mathematical analysis is aimed \u201cto prove\u201d).\u00a0In other words, the (asymmetric) \u201cresults\u201d (of classical and quantum-statistical physics) are not really results for they are deliberately enforced on, not deduced from symmetric formalism.<br><br>Such quantum-mechanical tactics are unacceptable, partly because they lead to a highly misleading philosophy of science, which, in turn, has generated a ludicrously incongruous mode of thinking in education and in general philosophy.<br><br>Their advocates all fall into the trap of assuming that which they set out to prove. One cannot get uncertainty for certainty, nor indeterminism from determinism\u00a0(see below).* These conclusions lead to somewhat surprising results, which, in turn, are related to the very core of our physical theories and to the role of time, causality, and determinism in philosophy.////", "comment_date": "2022-06-02T06:49:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Bolton", "comment_text": "Cats in space.

ACCORDINGLY, the known mathematical unification of Einstein&#39;s equations AND Maxwell&#39;s equations (given the addition of A FOURTH SPATIAL DIMENSION) is proven and explained. BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.

In fact, I have also clarified, clearly identified, and corrected the limited notion of curved &quot;SPACE&quot;. MY UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS SURPASSES ALL OTHERS. E=mc2 IS F=ma. A galaxy is basically FLAT. Think !!! GREAT. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE as well. It ALL makes perfect sense. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

in 300 years ago the Newtonian mechanics was born<br>during the modern industry germination times, basically the gravity, explosive<br>force or trajectory force was primarily studied. The industrial science<br>develops up today, as the kinetic foundation the Newtonian mechanics should be<br>developed followed by dynamic, have a complete theory system to face all<br>dynamical phenomenon (including personal force). Such as\uff1aelectromechanical dynamics, hot dynamics or<br>hydrodynamics and so on , it is the most important part in all personal living<br>environments. There will have some questions if they are interpreted by the<br>Newtonian mechanics. The most basic reason is that the Newtonian mechanics<br>takes the disposable use of force as the object of research but the modern<br>mechanics mostly needs to face the situation of the long-enduring use of force,<br>and photo-electrical and the Big Bang Theory", "comment_date": "2021-03-08T20:35:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Meme Thief", "comment_text": "<b>M A T H S</b>", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T13:01:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "nguyen thao", "comment_text": "Where doppler effect for energy formula come from.

They believe the big fat cognitive lie that e=MC2.  The blind spot, why humans can\u2019t do this is because their brain is not at all capable of understanding that higher intensity does not need to be reduced for continuity.  Non knowledge brain only knows ups and downs. It cannot be up continuous.  Only a person who knows continuous UP is possible.  He can grasp without reducing the intensity continuity is possible.  Never a common brain can understands intensity and continuity. Infinity and continuity.   E=mc2 is so wrong.  What is mc2- it is the difference between intensity and continuity.  What is energy and what is matter? Matter is continuity and energy is intensity.  What you call as matter anything continued. What you call as energy anything intense.  The intensity and continuity is separate for a crooked brain that can only understand ups and downs (the infinity symbol \u221e is also a reflection of the ups and down concept).  It cannot grasp that C is M and M is C.  M and C is not M and C- it is MC! Intensity and continuity are not two different things.  Eastern symbol of infinity is the circle, no ups and downs.  Brain made to believe that they are 2 separate things is a brain made to continually suffer forever.  A brain that can grasp that Intensity and continuity are the same, it can draw the circuit and handle electricity and hold and store it without reducing its intensity.  If I believe energy and intensity are simultaneously happening -that way the battery core will be charged; when you believe they are one.  Cognitions matter in circuits of physics because chemistry of the physics functions by cognitions ability to realize MC is your state there is no M and C separate.  Intensity and continuity are naturally together.  Intensity is Energy and Continuity is Matter and the brain that is made to believe it is not 1 suffers forever.

Carefully consider the man who is standing on what is the Earth/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Therefore, E=mc2 IS F=ma. This necessarily represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy.<br><br>THE EYE is the body. (The DOME of a person&#39;s EYE is ALSO visible.) The BALANCE of what is BODILY/VISUAL experience is essential. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE. OVERLAY what is the eye in BALANCED relation to/with what is the Earth. Notice what is the BLUE SKY. (The Earth is ALSO BLUE.) Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. E=mc2 IS F=ma. SO, what constitutes the falling MAN (ON  BALANCE) feels no gravity; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Therefore, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL resistance; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Accordingly, the rotation of what is the Moon matches it&#39;s revolution. Moreover, objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; as E=mc2 IS F=ma. Indeed, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. So, A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is the Sun (as A POINT, of course); AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that E=mc2 IS F=ma, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Ultimately and truly, time is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper understanding of physics/physical experience, as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand.) It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. (Notice the black space of what is THE EYE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.) Indeed, the stars do twinkle in what is the night sky. THINK !!! THOROUGHLY consider what is A GALAXY. Great. In fact, stellar clustering proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

There is a transformation of relations between (s, t, u, v) and (x, y, z) - cartesian between (s*, t*, u*, v*) and (x, y, z), between (s, t, u, v) and (s*, t*, u*, v*). The theory is an attempt to account for the existence of magic numbers in terms of interactions between an individual nucleon and a force field produced by all the other nucleons. Combination of the cartesian coordinate system with our news coordinates arise as very firmly fastening structure for description of nuclear spheres (shells).\r<br>\r<br><a href=\"https://www.trendsinphysics.info/kniha/new.html\">https://www.trendsinphysics.info/kniha/new.html\r</a><br>New Trends in Physics CD Rom /book, Elementes Pictures, Spheres in Nuclei, Forecasted Nuclei\r<br>67 Pages.

It is stated &quot;because you are moving TIME PASSES AT A DIFFERENT RATE FOR YOU AND THE CAT!    According to my understanding of relativity all velocity is relative and there is no unique (or prviiledged) frame of reference that can be shown to be &quot;at rest&quot;.   So therefore ANY frame of reference can be arbitrarily chosen to be &quot;at rest&quot; and other objects have there velocities indicated by their velocity relative to the one chosen.   We can arbitrarily regard the space ship you are in to be at rest and the cat to be moving OR the cat to be at rest and the space ship you are in as moving.   If neither the space ship nor the cat is accelerating then the two are &quot;dynamically reciprocal&quot; with regard to their velocity.   We could choose a frame of reference that moves at a constant velocity such that it remains midway between them and then both the cat and the space ship would be moving at the same velocity in opposite directions relative to that third middle frame of reference.    IF THEREFORE, they are dynamically reciprocal and either of them can arbitrarily considered to be &quot;at rest&quot; and the other one moving, it is not logical to assume that time is passing more slowly for one than for the other.   If Mary is taller than then Jane cannot be taller than Mary.   There is a proof by contradiction that neither the cat NOR the space ship have time passing at a different rate.   It might be true that as MEASURED by either, (while ignoring that light travels at the same rare relative all inertial frames of reference) thst time is passing more slowly for one than for the other, but in actuality the situation is reciprocal so that time is NOT passing at a different rate for either.

In order to understand the natural laws of the universe, it is necessary to use science and depend less on our common sense. Common sense is useful for living in society and solving our daily problems, but it is not useful for understanding what we cannot see, hear, smell, taste or feel. Trying to understand the macrocosm just by looking at 1% is an impossible task and we can only decorate the theories with philosophy and mathematical equations. The only tool we have to understand the universe is the law of universal gravitation, which seems to be, it continues to work even in the environment of a black hole, but inside, nobody knows what happens to matter, time or space. The microcosm is something we understand much less, everything smaller than the wavelength will never be seen. Albert Einstein relied on the impact force equation to deduce the energy equation F = 1 / 2mv2. If we eliminate 1/2 and assume that force is energy and substitute the speed of an object for the speed of light, the equation is as follows: E = mc2. This formula has several problems. In empirical since it cannot be deduced theoretically and also it cannot be proved that it is true. If the photon has no matter, then it should not be attracted by the gravitational field of a planet, much less by a black hole, it can be concluded that the photon is matter since before a gravitational field of a planet or a black hole it behaves as matter, therefore, matter itself can move at the speed of light and Albert Einstein&#39;s theories are all false.", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T19:06:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Z W", "comment_text": "In <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW7DW9NIO9M&amp;t=1m32s\">1:32</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hW7DW9NIO9M&amp;t=1m35s\">1:35</a>, How did he go from -E+KE2= +KE1-E*[1+(v^2/2c^2)] to E*(v^2/2c^2)+KE2= +KE1?<br><br>Plz explain", "comment_date": "2020-08-01T08:16:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Black Lakes", "comment_text": "Wrong.

How exactly did you derive that relativistic doppler effect equation? If the frequency of light as seen from a stationary frame is f, then an observer moving at speed v will record that light to have frequency sqrt((1+B)/(1-B)), where B is v/c. The energy is defined similarly by multiplying by plank&#39;s constant. Now, I assumed you took your velocity to be very small as compared to c, and so Taylor expanded that equation. But if you do that, you get E = (1 + B  + 1/2B^2), which is not the same thing you have. More importantly, you said that the kinetic energy of a particle is 1/2mv^2, which simply is not true. You can derive relativistic kinetic energy by integrating (dp/dt)dx, where dp is gamma*mv. If you do this, you get m0c^2(gamma-1), where m0 is the rest mass.

This is completely and totally arbitrary and there is no way that EINSTEIN could have really verified these measurements in his day...and perhaps even now we have not yet really done it , so it is all classical &quot; thought &quot; experiments with self serving, circular reasoning which is NOT proven.<br><br>The same type of circular, self-serving reasoning is the basis for what I consider to be  the flawed application of the LORENZ TRANSFORMATION equations for MASS conversion used by EINSTEIN to say that NO MATERIAL OBJECT CAN TRAVEL FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT.<br><br>In that MASS CONVERSION equation EINSTEIN concludes that NO MATERIAL OBJECT can travel faster than the speed of light because  V squared EQUALS C squared in that equation, the denominator becomes a ZERO and EINSTEIN makes a philosophical conclusion that a zero in a denominator equals INFINITY and then in a self serving statement concludes that since infinite mass is impossible...therefore no object can travel at the speed of light.<br><br>That conclusion is based to two potentially flawed premises; that a zero in a denominator equals infinity and that infinite mass is not possible, and maybe a third assumption that the speed of light is what we think it is...it is NOT. The speed of light has been repeatedly observed to be far faster that the conventional &quot; C &quot; in many different experiments by different groups all over the world and by TESLA...the man EINSTEIN called the &quot; smartest man in the world &quot; <br><br>So again, this conclusion about the speed of light is patent self-serving and circular reasoning and based on the arguable premise that a zero in a denominator equals INFINITY , which is NOT a mathematical law and which many physicists and mathematicians disagree with.<br><br>It also defies ordinary logic and common sense to propose that an object can travel at 99.99999999999 % of the speed of light but hits an invisible wall which prevents it from going that little extra 0.0000000001 %<br><br>This is intuitively implausible. Every science fiction writer in the last hundred years has dismissed this limit and ignored it...and they have never been wrong in predicting the future...so I prefer to add their insight to my own arguments above and conclude that we CAN in fact travel faster than the speed of light...whatever that REALLY is.<br><br>More importantly, the consequence of all of this is that we hape hope that space travel is a realistic goal  and that we are not stuck in our own galaxy, nor do we have to make ourselves into sleeping frozen human Popsicles in order to travel to the stars on trips that would take hundreds of years if we are stopped at 186,000 MPH ...ALL PATENT NONSENSE", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T19:11:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Muh Guntur", "comment_text": "<b>OHAYOU SEKAI GOOD MORNING WORLD</b>", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T13:13:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Claude Adiceam", "comment_text": "E=mc2 is a joke for some few clever people and a formula from a genius for ignorants  ...

This proof for E = mc^2 is super flawed and erroneous, it is not even funny.<br><br>To start with, the kinetic energy is NOT K = (1/2)mv^2. Yes, people are taught that this is true in their introductory physics course, but that is because introductory physics is taught using Newton&#39;s laws and Galilean relativity. This is to say, the speed of light is assumed to be infinite. However, in Einstein&#39;s special relativity, the kinetic energy of an object is given by K = (\u03b3 - 1)mc^2, where \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2). Furthermore, the formula for the <b>total</b> energy is E = \u03b3mc^2, not E = mc^2. E = mc^2 is true if and only if v = 0.<br><br>Also, the claim that the mass changes as speed changes is simply false. The mass of an object is determined by its particle composition, and the particle composition of an object does not change with speed. What does change is the Lorentz factor \u03b3, which is multiplied by the mass. This is what the video failed to account for. In reality, the explanation for why E = mc^2 when v = 0 is much more convoluted. It is derived from both the law of conservation of energy and the law of conservation of translational momentum.<br><br>Unfortunately, there is no simple explanation. It just does not exist. It is not possible for it to exist. That is the reality, and we all need to accept it.<br><br>You can stop reading here, but if you want a real, scientifically accurate, non-butchered, and more detailed answer while still not too complicated answer to why E = mc^2 when v = 0, then stick around for the next few paragraphs or so. But, <b>be warned,</b> you are not going to understand the explanation unless you know some introductory Lagrangian mechanics.<br><br>In Einstein&#39;s special relativity, there are two fundamental assumptions that have been tested and verified over and over for around a century now.<br><br>1. The first assumption is that c, the speed of light, is the same regardless of the observer. In other words, if I am on Earth and I measure the speed of a ray of a light, then I will measure it to be equal to c. If you are on a rocket ship moving away from the Earth at a constant speed, then you will also measure the speed of that vary same ray to be c.<br><br>2. The second assumption is that the fundamental laws of physics are the same in all non-accelerating reference frames. This is to say, the fundamental laws on Earth work the same as in inside your rocket ship.<br><br>Since the laws of physics are the same, this means that there must exist a notion of &quot;distance&quot; such that if you measure the length of a ruler in your rocket ship, it will be the same than the length I will measure on Earth. Such a notion does exist, but it is different than what we learn in Newtonian physics. In Newtonian physics, all distances are calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. However, with Einstein&#39;s assumptions, distance behaves differently, and the new distance formula is given by s^2 = (c\u00b7t)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2), where t is the time coordinate, and x, y, z are the familiar 3D coordinates of space. Then, to establish the &quot;position&quot; of any object in the universe, we need all 4 coordinates, (ct, x, y, z). These are called &quot;spacetime&quot; coordinates.<br><br>You will notice that here, time behaves as if it were a component of space itself, and like time tends to behave in Newtonian physics. That is because, well, it is a component of space. However, there is a quantity that behaves the same as time does in Newtonian physics. This quantity is called &quot;proper time&quot;, and is denoted by the Greek letter \u03c4. Namely, c^2\u00b7\u03c4^2 = s^2 = c^2\u00b7t^2 - x^2 - y^2 - z^2. This is important, because, to calculate our new &quot;velocity coordinates&quot; from our &quot;spacetime coordinates&quot;, we need to take the derivative with respect to this quantity \u03c4, much like how in Newtonian physics, velocity is given by taking the derivative of position with respect to time.<br><br>So, we want to find c\u00b7dt/d\u03c4, dx/d\u03c4, dy/d\u03c4, and dz/d\u03c4. Now, dx/d\u03c4 = dx/dt\u00b7dt/d\u03c4, by the chain rule. The same works with the derivatives of y and z. Therefore, the quantity we need to find is dt/d\u03c4. How? Einstein already did that for us in a thought experiment. The thought experiment is a little complicated to explain without drawing a diagram, so I won&#39;t try here. All you need to know is that the thought experiment consider a light-based clock, and thinking about how you measure time ticks in that clock when the clock is not moving relative to you, and then thinking about how the same ticks if the clock moves away or closer to you. Anyhow, the result of this thought experiment is that, because c is constant, dt/d\u03c4 = \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where v is just the speed that the clock has moving away or closer to you.<br><br>With this knowledge, we have our new velocity coordinates, (c\u03b3, v_x\u00b7\u03b3, v_y\u00b7\u03b3, v_z\u00b7\u03b3), where v_x is the x-component of the ordinary 3D velocity we are familiar with from Newtonian physics, and v_y and v_z are its y and z components. We might shorten the notation by writing (c\u03b3, <b>v</b> \u00b7\u03b3), where <b>v</b> is the 3D velocity we are familiar with, and c\u03b3 then repesents the &quot;fourth&quot; coordinate, the new coordinate that results from adding time as a new component of space. This new velocity with 4 components is called &quot;four-velocity&quot; and is denoted U. We do it this way to distinguish it from <b>v,</b> which is simply called the velocity, as we called it in Newtonian physics.<br><br>Muliplying the four-velocity U by the mass m gives the four-momentum P, which has the time-component being \u03b3mc, and then the 3D component being \u03b3m*v,* which is simply called the momentum <b>p.</b> Now that you know this, the only step that&#39;s left is to show that \u03b3mc = E/c. However, this is the hardest part. Everything before this can be understaood just by understand Newtonian physics. But not the next paragraph. You are NOT going to be able to understand it unless you know Lagrangian mechanics.<br><br>There is a quantity known as the <b>action</b> in physics, denoted by the letter S. It&#39;s defined as the integral over time of the Lagrangian L. If you are familiar with even basic Lagrangian mechanics, then you know what the Lagrangian is. Then, the time integral of that is the action S. The action S of the system determines the energy of the system and the momentum of the system. The (partial) derivative of S with respect to time is equal to E. The gradient of S, given by the derivative of S with respect to the coordinates x, y, and z, is the momentum. This works out due to the conservation of momentum and of energy.<br><br>Similarly, it can be shown that four-momentum is conserved in Einstein&#39;s special relativity. Again, explaining this easily involves a diagram, so I won&#39;t bother trying here. Besides, the idea of four-momentum being conserved should not be all that surprising. So, due to this conservation, we know that its components must be equal to the time derivative and gradient of S, respectively. Specifically, p = grad(S), and \u03b3mc = (dS/dt)/c. But, dS/dt = E. Therefore, E/c = \u03b3mc. Therefore, E = \u03b3mc^2. Now, if v = 0, then \u03b3 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0^2/c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0) = 1. So, when v = 0, E = mc^2.", "comment_date": "2019-12-03T18:37:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kzuna", "comment_text": "Conclusion: u have a different timeline or the cat  moves fast cuz the time in space is different in earth?", "comment_date": "2019-12-03T06:44:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oel Dave", "comment_text": "Hello people from the future I&#39;m from 2019.", "comment_date": "2019-11-28T13:10:16Z", "likes_count": 9}, {"comment_by": "Kenshin", "comment_text": "E=mc2", "comment_date": "2019-11-27T10:27:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Boge Boge", "comment_text": "Anyone who watch Dr stone  click like", "comment_date": "2019-11-25T13:48:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Suhas", "comment_text": "E", "comment_date": "2019-11-25T04:11:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sin Bad", "comment_text": "Yep I\u2019m confused", "comment_date": "2019-11-25T03:54:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheQuabi", "comment_text": "Why tf is it ke square then ?", "comment_date": "2019-11-24T13:08:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Consequence No. 62", "comment_text": "I&#39;ll just take your word for it.", "comment_date": "2019-11-24T09:27:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Giang Nguy\u1ec5n", "comment_text": "Please speak snowly", "comment_date": "2019-11-24T03:35:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Al D", "comment_text": "What is the point of not taking time to explaining something?

Cats are indispensable to science!<br>Holy smoke, talk about convoluted logic. With maths you can explain anything by manipulation. If data doesn&#39;t work, take its log, or take the sine or cosine or tangient or square it or divide it by pi  or many unlimited transformations. You keep on doing this until you get the desired answer. Unmistakably, the tone and conviction of some one completely brainwashed by &quot;Time&quot;. &quot;Mathematics&quot; and &quot;Money&quot;. Does he know that 15 sq. meters on a sphere&#39;s surface is not equivalent to 15 sq. meters on a flat surface? But our maths says it is. Space-density gradient -actually part of a continuum from infinity to minus infinity - runs from a very high number (for a black hole) to say .0000000000000001<br>in some units - probably spacons, for material entities. Recall an atom is mostly empty space. Physical space has the property of density. Science&#39;s constants become inoperative at some point on the space-density gradient. Science doesn&#39;t want to know that. Look at<br>the mess in the quantum mechanics . Strange probability maths had to be formulated to explain the unexplainable. Quantum physics cannot be<br>completely understood that way. The lower we go on the density gradient , the less the applicabilty of &quot;mathematics&quot; and &quot;time&quot;. But that&#39;s all that science uses for measurements. Science doesn&#39;t know that at very low densities of matter, the space density of certain voids in the human body become part of the experiment.

This means that a lump of coal - can power a large city - for a few months.  Although <b>I&#39;m</b> not buying it, let&#39;s take a ZERO mass item.  Let&#39;s multiply it by the speed of light squared (89,875,517,873,681,800).  That&#39;s QUADRILLION, folks.  And that&#39;s with NO MASS.  Can you IMAGINE what LEAD or GOLD would produce??  Now, as it stands, that lump of coal has more energy that 270 atomic bombs.  OK, may be (*I&#39;m* not buying it!), but that also means that gold (79) has more energy than the sun, and lead (82) has more than the universe.<br><br>Now, that&#39;s not even CONSIDERING the facts that:<br>1) Einstein is known for being a devout Christian .... when in FACT, he was a DIE-HARD Atheist.<br><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein</a><br><br>2) Albert had illegitimate children, and had MANY affaires behind his wife.  With his mistress Mari, they had a daughter they called &quot;Lieserl&quot;.  She died a few yaers later from Scarlett Fever, and Einstein was RELIEVED (!!!) - because he didn&#39;t have to worry about one of his big secrets getting out.  You think COSBY is a jerk - Einstein is just as bad!<br><br>3)  Einstein promised his wife (who helped him GREATLY with his physics!) that he would give her equal credit one day.  Have you ever heard a WORD about her (until just now)?<br><br>4)  Einstein left his children (and his wife, of course)  to pursue fame (and fortune).<br><br>5)  Einstein helped with the atomic bomb - which killed 1.2 million Japanese CIVILIANS, and maimed 7 million more - for life.  The radiation destroyed and maimed fetuses - all living ones have HUGE deformities.  Look it up!  LTILL proud of Einstein?  He kills 8 million, and he&#39;s GREAT.  Hitler is hated for 6 million.  The USA has killed 19 million civilians world-wide, but THEY are *great*.  Britain and Australia killed 19 million, bet THEY are *great*.  See where this is going??<br><br>6) Einstein&#39;s political view was in favour of socialism  - and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as &quot;Why Socialism?<br><br>7) Einstein thought of himself (and Jews) FAR SUPERIOR to any other race.  Now how can we fault others for doing EXACTLY THE NAME THING???<br><br>8)  We (collectively) are ROBOTS - we tout &quot;don&#39;t HATE&quot;, but we hate BIG-TIME.  &quot;Don&#39;t be intolerant&quot;, yet we don&#39;t tolerate - anyone we don&#39;t tolerate.  Look at Hitler and Trump: You HAVE to hate them.  We don&#39;t TOLERATE dressingt-up as Hitler for Halloween.

The rules of quantum physics state that an unobserved photon exists in all possible states simultaneously but, when observed or measured, exhibits only one state. Spin is depicted here as an axis of rotation, but actual particles do not rotate. Entanglement occurs when a pair of particles, such as photons, interact physically. A laser beam fired through a certain type of crystal can cause individual photons to be split into pairs of entangled photons. The photons can be separated by a large distance, hundreds of miles or even more. When observed, Photon A takes on an up-spin state. Entangled Photon B, though now far away, takes up a state relative to that of Photon A (in this case, a down-spin state). The transfer of state between Photon A and Photon B takes place at a speed of at least 10,000 times the speed of light, possibly even instantaneously, regardless of distance. A proposed experiment would send one photon of the entangled pair to the orbiting International Space Station, a distance of around 310 miles (500 kilometers).

The frequency and therefore energy of light emitted from the cat is different when observed while you are at rest and while you are moving relative to the cat. This is deduced through relativity. Since the total energy of the cat is equal to its kinetic energy plus the decrease in energy of light emitted from the cat, there are two scenarios of which the total energy of the cat can be measured; the case of kinetic energy of cat while you are moving relative to cat plus light energy observed while you are at rest and the case of kinetic energy of cat while you are moving relative to it plus light energy while you are moving relative to the cat. It can be deduced that these two total energies are equal since in either scenario there was nothing there which could possibly cause the two total energies to be different. Thus, setting them equal to each other and doing some manipulation, it is shown that one side has the kinetic energy and the other with the kinetic energy plus some other stuff. The kinetic energies would be equal if one side didn\u2019t have other stuff added to it. Thus, they\u2019re different with the KE on the right side having more energy than the one on the left side. Since the kinetic energies are different, and the velocity of the cat as measured while you are moving relative to the cat is the same in either scenario, the mass must have changed.

Inertia/inertial resistance is proportional to gravitational force/energy, as electromagnetism/energy is gravity. Gravity/acceleration involves balanced resistance to/with inertia, as gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND balanced; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Therefore, gravitational force/energy is proportional to inertial resistance; as this balances gravity AND inertia. So, gravity/acceleration involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance; as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. Great. (This explains F=ma AND E=mc2, as electromagnetism/energy is gravity.) Accordingly, inertia/inertial resistance is proportional to (or balanced with/as) gravitational force/energy; as this balances AND unifies ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy AND gravity; as this balances gravity AND inertia.

ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.<br><br>Gravity/acceleration involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance, as gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. So, a given planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times; AND this is then consistent with F=ma, E=mc2, AND what is perpetual motion; as electromagnetism/energy is gravity. Again, balance and completeness go hand in hand.<br><br>E=mc2 AND F=ma both apply to and describe the sun. &quot;Mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance consistent with/as what is balanced electromagnetic/gravitational force/energy, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity/acceleration involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance, as electromagnetism/energy is gravity. A photon may be placed at the center of the sun (as a point, of course), as the reduction of space is balanced with (or offset by) the speed of light. Gravitational force/energy is proportional to inertial resistance, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; as this balances gravity AND inertia. <br><br>Touch AND feeling blend, as electromagnetism/energy is gravity; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy AND gravity are linked AND balanced. Inertia/inertial resistance is proportional to gravitational force/energy, as gravity/acceleration involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance; as electromagnetism/energy is gravity. So, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND balanced; as electromagnetism/energy is gravity. &quot;Mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance consistent with/as what is balanced electromagnetic/gravitational force/energy, as electromagnetism/energy is gravity. Great !!!!<br><br>Objects fall at the same rate (neglecting air resistance, of course), as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. The falling man feels no gravity, as the feeling of gravity by the man who is standing on the earth/ground also involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance; as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. Fantastic !!!<br><br>At bottom and fundamentally, physics/physical reality is possible/potential AND actual in balance, as electromagnetism/energy is gravity. Invisible AND visible space in fundamental equilibrium and balance IS the middle distance in/of space consistent with balanced electromagnetic/gravitational force/energy. The eye is the body. As is true in the case of dream experience, bodily/visual experience is visible AND invisible in balance; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great !!! The eye is invisible, AND a person&#39;s eye/body is also visible (as the dome of the eye) as well. Dream experience and wakeful experience are fundamentally linked AND fundamentally related, and they are separate experiences.<br><br>The earth/ground and the semi-spherical blue sky are then linked AND balanced, as the earth/ground and the moon are linked AND balanced; as the flat, orange, AND setting sun (with the space around it then going invisible) is linked AND balanced (as what does then involve full/maximum gravity, relatively) with/as lava AND the earth/ground. Great. In fact, the shapes of the spaces match. Notice that the curvature of the moon does match the curvature of the earth/ground (given a clear horizon, of course). Lunar rocks are practically identical to earth rocks, as the earth and the moon are considered to be the same body compositionally. Now consider the appearance of the earth from outer &quot;space&quot;, as half of the blue earth does remain constantly illuminated. Great. Gravity is electromagnetism/energy. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. &quot;Mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance consistent with/as what is balanced electromagnetic/gravitational force/energy, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravitational force/energy is proportional to inertial resistance, as gravity is electromagnetism/energy; as this balances gravity AND inertia. Gravity/acceleration involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Awesome !!!<br><br>ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. This is proven by F=ma AND E=mc2. This involves what is possible/potential AND actual in balance. &quot;Mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance consistent with/as what is balanced electromagnetic/gravitational force/energy, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Inertia/inertial resistance is proportional to (or balanced with/as) gravitational force/energy, as this balances AND unifies ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy and gravity; as this balances gravity AND inertia. (This explains F=ma AND E=mc2, as electromagnetism/energy is gravity.) Accordingly, gravity/acceleration involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance; as electromagnetism/energy is gravity.<br><br>The ability of thought to describe OR reconfigure sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which thought is similar to sensory experience. (Thoughts are invisible.) Think about it. It is a very great truth/fact that the self represents, forms, and experiences a comprehensive approximation of experience in general by combining conscious and unconscious experience. This is FUNDAMENTALLY (or very deeply) true of dream experience. Dream experience is/involves true/real quantum gravity. Dream experience is not a creation of thought. Television is a creation of thought. Dreams make thought more like sensory experience in general, thereby improving upon memory and understanding. There is no outsmarting the genius of dreams. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The integrated extensiveness of thought (and description) is improved in the truly superior mind. Very importantly, less explains less in physics; AND more explains more. Inertia/inertial resistance is proportional to (or balanced with/as) gravitational force/energy, as this balances AND unifies ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy AND gravity; as this balances gravity AND inertia. This is fully and always consistent with/as dream experience. Gravity is electromagnetism/energy.

But when the cat is moving and is losing energy, the energy has to come from somewhere, either its kineting energy or its speed, OR its MASS. Since we see the cat being slowed down we can see that the energy can come from either the mass OR the speed, aka energy therefore there is a correlation between them.<br><br>PLEASE tell me where the energy is coming from, minutephysics!

As you can see from this, pc, momentum times the speed of light, is the energy that is associated with motion, kinetic energy, while the mc^2, the rest mass energy, is the same for the object regardless of the speed of the object.", "comment_date": "2017-04-12T21:39:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Diego", "comment_text": "I got lost at doppler", "comment_date": "2017-04-12T04:00:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vatan Sever", "comment_text": "Had to watch half speed to understand.

The rock is bright because it is radioactive.  You figure out a way to measure the radioactivity leaving the rock and how the rock is losing energy and mass. But you also account for the stored kinetic energy (because it is on a shelf, and if the shelf broke and fell to the floor, when it hit the floor that would be energy released too).  You get excited because you found a really good example of mass and energy being related, so you get excited to tell your teacher because you think you might get an award.  So you run fast to your teacher... really fast... near the speed of light.  You&#39;re measuring the energy and the rock as you run and you notice that the kinetic energy is different.  That&#39;s weird.  It&#39;s still on the shelf in the same place.  You go back to your room and bring your brother to help measure things with you.  You run to the teacher right away while measuring the rock energy.  Your brother starts measuring the rock energy, but then he realizes that he might miss out on the award you&#39;re getting and he thinks he deserves an award for helping.  So he starts running near the speed of light while still measuring the rock energy.  You both get to the teacher and have different measurements.  That&#39;s weird too.  It turns out that you need to factor in the speed of light to know how much energy a given mass has.<br><br>Moral of the story?

EINSTEIN WAS OBVIOUSLY WRONG.<br><br>His conclusions about the limitation on the speed of light and on the effects of this speed on creating INFINITE mass, which he says is therefore impossible, are based on the inaccurate application and interpretation of the LORENZ TRANSFORMATION equations. I won&#39;t waste time spoon feeding those of you who know what I am talking about because you all know what the LORENZ equations look like.<br><br>EINSTEIN&#39;S conclusions about the limitation on the speed of light are all based on the the mathematical &quot; philosophy &quot; that a ZERO in a denominator resolves the equation to INFINITY. This is not a mathematical law...it is a theory or philosophy. If he is wrong, and many mathematicians have long ago said that he was, then the speed of light CAN easily be surpassed without worrying about the invisible &quot; barrier&quot; of infinite mass.<br><br>We have all known &quot; intuitively &quot; that he was wrong forever because firstly it makes no sense intuitively that you can accelerate to 99.99999% of something but at that other 0.000001% ( I am only a dumb former trial lawyer, so I don&#39;t know if this math is correct..but you get my meaning ) there is an invisible WALL and if he was right it would mean we could never travel to the stars and aliens could never come here. This is so obvious that every science fiction writer has ignored EINSTEIN&#39;S conclusions this being a limitation on our speed capabilities since the start of the 20th century.<br><br>Now, besides the observations that alien propulsion systems must have obviously enabled them to travel MUCH faster then the speed of light to get here and that they are using a propulsion system which cancels the effects of inertia and/or gravity, we have a much more powerful ally; the greatest real scientist of all time, whose inventions are thousands of time more important to mankind then EINSTEIN&#39;s &quot; ideas&quot; \u00a0ever were...NIKOLA TESLA... disagreed with almost everything of importance that EINSTEIN had to say.<br><br>TESLA said that he conducted many experiments where he observed supra-luminal speeds and when a man with 178 of the most important inventions in history says so...I BELIEVE HIM. He also completely disagreed with EINSTEIN&#39;S theory that GRAVITY was \u00a0only a distortion of space. He said gravity was a FORCE.<br><br>This &quot;DISTORTION&quot; theory also makes no sense intuitively because even when you look at the usual &quot; bowling ball on a mattress &quot; analogy, it represents space as only being distorted in ONE plane...what would this DISTORTION look like if, as it would have to be, the distortion takes place in ALL directions at all times ?<br><br>I SAY THAT THERE IS AN &quot;INVISIBLE&quot; PORTION OF LIGHT WHICH WE CANNOT YET MEASURE BECAUSE IT TRAVELS FASTER THEN &quot; C &quot;<br><br>My own theory, which I included in a satirical piece called EINSTEIN PUT ON TRIAL and where I presented the arguments that I would raise to attack EINSTEIN&#39;S theories, presented an ALTERNATIVE argument that the theories of the DUAL nature of light and that the puzzle of the PARADOX effect and the TUNNEL experiment would all be resolved, and QUANTUM mechanics would be reconciled with classical PHYSICS inertial models \u00a0if we concluded that there is an INVISIBLE portion OF LIGHT which travels much faster then what we accept as &quot; C&quot; but which can only be measured by our current instrumentality when it slows down to the speed of light.\u00a0<br><br>This would also confirm BURBRIDGE&#39;s idea that the RED SHIFT is far smaller then what we think and that therefore the UNIVERSE is much smaller then we think and the stars are much closer.<br><br>TESLA created a patent for electrostatic propulsion which he theorized would allow us to greatly exceed the speed of light,...consistent with the observations and theories about the capabilities of ALIEN propulsion systems.<br><br>If we don&#39;t already have such systems...something I hope is wrong...C&#39;MON you engineers...let&#39;s complete TESLA&#39;S work and get this done already.\ufeff", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T23:15:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ibrahim Farooqui", "comment_text": "If I go to my friends and say &quot;I understand the Equation!&quot; Trust me don&#39;t trust me!\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T13:34:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PhronesisPlays", "comment_text": "I understand up to the point when you bring &#39;c&#39; into it.
