I get that&#39;s not the purpose of this video in particular, but let me clear some things up.<br><br><br>1. &quot;Nuclear waste&quot; is better termed &quot;spent fuel&quot;, because there&#39;s still a LOT of useful energy there. Current American laws prohibit reprocessing, but this fuel could be recycled with existing technology and used again, reducing the quantity that ultimately has to be stored.<br>2. There&#39;s not nearly as much of this spent fuel as you might suppose. The amount produced since 1950 for all of America would cover a football field to a depth of less than 10 yards. That&#39;s a manageable amount, IF there&#39;s a plan in place (sadly, right now, there&#39;s not a good plan).<br>3. We know what to do with it. We have simply lacked the political will to make it happen. What you do with it is seal it in a container far away from human habitation and bury it. Radiation follows the inverse square law, which means that if you double the distance you halve the radiation. So you just have to make sure the radioactive material doesn&#39;t travel, say by water contamination, and you&#39;re all set. For a great example of how this could work in practice, check out Finland&#39;s waste facility: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/science/nuclear-reactor-waste-finland.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/science/nuclear-reactor-waste-finland.html</a>. They will seal up the fuel in copper containers. They will go deep underground in an area that has little to no water filtration and hasn&#39;t for millions of years, dig long corridors, then bury the containers in holes in those corridors. The corridors themselves will be backfilled with more clay and the whole thing ultimately sealed up.

As the video mentioned, the required speed for an object to orbit a body gets faster the closer the object is to the body. If the object is traveling faster than that orbital speed, its momentum will overcome the centripetal acceleration provided by gravity and the object will leave orbit, spiraling outwards. Meanwhile, if the object is traveling slower than orbital speed, the centripetal force of gravity will overcome it&#39;s momentum, and the object will fall towards the body, spiraling inwards. Thus, if the rocket maintains the same orbital speed as earth, but is moved closer to the sun, it will have an insufficient speed to remain in orbit, and spiral down into the sun.<br>      This strategy would work fairly well for the whole nuclear waste scheme (barring the practical implications of nuclear waste in rockets). However, with the probe, we may want it to approach the sun as quickly as possible to get as close to the sun as possible before the probe&#39;s sensors are fried.

Until some other people realised that it is far easier and cheaper to extract gold, silver, copper and other precious elements from old electronics comparing to extracting it from ore that needs to be dig out of the ground. With advancement of technology such time can also come for what we now call nuclear waste. One technology with potential to do this is thorium molten salt reactors - with some adaptations to their designs you can dump nuclear &quot;waste&quot; into the molten salt core of such reactor, it will there be bombarded by huge numbers of neutrons and that will cause the radioactive material to decay far faster and then the on-line reprocessing section of the thorium reactor can extract the converted elements out of the molten salts and separate the useful parts. Sure, such operation of the reactor will not be as efficient at making electricity as operation with pure fuel, but destroying the nuclear waste would be a nice and valuable side effect.", "comment_date": "2018-02-02T17:49:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "my opinions are facts", "comment_text": "Yup, just throw all of your problems into the giant Fireball in the sky.

We know this time is dictated by the rotational speed of the planet however if we wanted to know the rotational speed of a planet then we would ask for the rotational speed and not for the length of a day which would imply a day and night cycle, light and dark.<br><br>We experience day and night due to incident light sourced from the Sun however if your standing on the source (All praise our Glorious Leader!!!) then surely the concept of the length of the day goes out the window as there is no day night cycle and just light all the fricken time. So asking how long a day is on the sun  seems to give the obvious answer that there has only been one day on the Sun because its always been light but if your referring to how long does it take to do one rotation and use this as the definition of a day well then wikipedia has this to say <br><br>Solar rotation varies with latitude because the Sun is composed of a gaseous plasma. The rate of rotation is observed to be fastest at the equator (latitude \u03c6 = 0 \u00b0), and to decrease as latitude increases. At the equator the solar rotation period is 24.47 days and almost 38 days at the poles. <br><br>So there we have it, depending on the Glorious Leaders latitude on the Sun&#39;s surfacing he would be experiencing a day of somewhere between 24 and 38 days long, not that he would realize that a day had passed seeing as there is no bloody day night cycle to judge by.
