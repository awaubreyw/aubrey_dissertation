Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight,[9] and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The resolving power of an eye depends both on the optics, large eyes with large appertures suffers less from diffraction and can have larger retinal images due to a long focal length, and on the density of receptor spacing. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion.[1] Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human fovea (65,000/mm2 in American kestrel, 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long distance vision&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-07-26T19:22:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dirceu Santos", "comment_text": "or maybe he is a elf!

It is widely accepted and tested in Physics that light (and, in fact, all matter) behave in a dualistic way. In fact, using the terms &quot;wave&quot; and &quot;particles&quot; is a severe linguistic limitation in discussing quantum objects, it&#39;s not like they can be one thing or the other. They are something else, which the words &quot;wave&quot; and &quot;particle&quot; can satisfy the purpose of understanding phenomena from time to time. Those terms were originally used for macroscopic entities, such as a particle of dust and a wave of water, but they become a lot less intuitive when describing things in the quantum scale.", "comment_date": "2015-01-14T15:52:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Psycadelius Kexis", "comment_text": "perhaps legolas have better lightreceptors in his eayes then humans do... cant rly comnpare a human eye to an elf eye... when elfs are imortal in the story, then its pretty obvious that they &quot;arent&quot; human lol... alot of animals can percive light better than humans... just take any predetorial bird and that &quot;blurry&quot; distance is is of no use...", "comment_date": "2015-01-14T03:11:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brock York", "comment_text": "I like to imagine the elves have a sort of o.o.b.e sight, where they can &quot;leave&quot; their body and zoom in on things.

Our atmospehere is actually reasonably transparent for the near UV range from 400 down to 200 nm.

That would give you not only the ability to precisely count the horseman, but is sufficient to see if somebody is <b>considerably</b> taller than the rest of the group. However, you would not be able to say that it was their leader, as every detail about him (clothing, etc.) would be blurred out. Physics aside, there is also the question of physiology of the eyes. Given that Legolas has human sized eyes and pupils and could see near UV, he would need really tiny cone cells in his fovea to get a visual aucity that would actually make use of the near UV spectrum. Something on the order of 20/4 or better (just a guess I am lazy to do the mahts). But even if Legolas could see near UV (200 nm) and would have a visual aucity that matches the physical limits of his eyes and fovea, he still would have a big problem to look past atmospheric haze anyway. Especially in the UV range. So the &quot;reasonably transparent&quot; atmosphere is useful only at &quot;short&quot; distances (let us say up to 1 000 meter). However if Legolas could see in the near infrared spectrum, he could clearly see well beyound atmospheric haze (even the haze that we see in the visible spectrum), but the resolution in the near IR spectrum is even worse than visible, making diffraction a bigger problem. So the whole UV (near or far, 200 nm or 20 nm) is nice in theory, but over a distance fo 24 km I believe haze would have made it impossible to see anything useful. If it were useful for us humans, our eyes would have evolved in that way here on earth, in our atmosphere. Same with near IR. Not useful for us as a species. And both near UV and near IR give zero real world advantage in surviving and mating for our ancestors.

Low skilled jedi can only use it to sense impending movement in their enemies to be able to block blaster shots with their light sabre, whilst Yoda can peer into the future, at least to some degree.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-07-02T12:30:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dirk Diggler", "comment_text": "maybe next you could use science to explain why Legolas does not age", "comment_date": "2014-07-02T12:13:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DickyTracy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk2izv-c_ts&amp;t=2m13s\">2:13</a> - No, no!

I mean honestly? Theorizing that Legolas can&#39;t see that far, or any elf for that matter, is like saying an Angel can&#39;t watch us down here from Heaven. Elves are magical, fantasy life forms that are natural and of the Earth; just as we are. And as far as any of us know, they could have countless imaginative abilities. I sometimes see them as just higher humans who have become more distinguished by accepting their natural connection with the Earth and their Divinity. Humans, as most of us already know, have potential to become just like them in theory. Eventually anyway. If or WHEN we are using a much larger percentage of that magnificent, mysterious organ that is our Brain. Anyway, Smart ass, we only know life on Earth as WE know it. Our so called &#39;Laws of the universe&#39; that we follow so directly here are more than likely ludicrous any where else. Even if Elves are the creation of us, that is no exception of what they might be capable of in movies no less. You attempting to &#39;debunk&#39; something from a movie like Lord of the rings was a bit pointless anyway. It is one of the many utter definitions of &quot;fantasy&quot; itself, and everyone knows that. OH, don&#39;t get me wrong, the so called &#39;lesson&#39; that was meant to be taught I totally got. But, that doesn&#39;t lighten my agrivation on how you approached it. For all anyone knows, Elves could be a type of lesser Angel, but are still beautifully magical creatures whose abilities are beyond comprehension. I&#39;m only going this far because I&#39;m a writer of Epics, Fantasy, Medieval, etc. . What are you going to theorize next? Why superman shouldn&#39;t be able to have heat vision? Or why \u00a0Hulk shouldn&#39;t even exist? Or why Some Mutants like Storm and Magneto shouldn&#39;t be able to even have their powers? When it comes down to it, and in my own opinion regardless of anyone elses&#39;, It was just a pointless topic in which youuuu didn&#39;t consider every factor. But, you know, that&#39;s just me.

And that it can be a learned skill. OK, that said, here&#39;s my take on Legolas: \u00a0Elves are remote viewers. Just as we can see images with our eyes closed, scenes can be viewed at a distance by using a subtle part of the brain which can be developed and/or trained. Eyesight is really brain sight, eyes are the normal lens, but the brain can also summon its inherent imaging capabilities to see details outside of normal time-space parameters. \u00a0Thus, imo, it&#39;s highly probable that elves have inherited this remote viewing ability and also develop it through their acceptance &amp; recognition of it. You can call it magic but as Arthur C. Clarke noted in his third law:\u00a0Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. The video above is clever &amp; entertaining, but is using a physics that is bound by time-space.

However, it does not answer the point that Legolas is an ELF, not a human. ...Not to mention the fact that they could see the Dead quite clearly in Return of the King, until the Dead chose to be seen. I read a lot of the comments, and most of them pointed out many things that could affect how different an Elvish eye is from a human&#39;s, such as pupil/iris size and how the brain processes the imagery sent from the eye. The books make no accurate mention of eye size, etc. and the movies are an INTERPRETATION of the books, using real humans to play the parts. (What I&#39;m saying is that basing info off of actors and calling it fact is not really accurate. That being said, neither are the books). So Elves, in and of themselves, are more of a being of opinion and interpretation through what we see through the movies and books. They are primarily based off of fantasy and imagination.<br>I mean, looking back through time at the old stories, Elves were nothing more than wingless fairies that annoyed the heck out of everyone with teasing and rude jokes; they had no real definition until Tolkien came along and said &quot;this is how I see them&quot;. Since he wrote those four Ages worth of story, his interpretation of the old myths have become a structure for every Elf imagined today, spring-boarded by Peter Jackson who gave a picture to the words. Granted that even then, Elves are still shown in various ways outside of Middle-Earth.<br>So, it&#39;s best not to compare Elves 100% to humans, as you have in this video, because they are NOT humans. That being said, Elves are not anatomically or physiologically defined, thus leaving who they REALLY are up to the reader via imagination, so we won&#39;t truly know exactly what they can or cannot see, nor how much is enhanced with magic (which is not used in a scientific analysis). All we know is that they have powerful eyes that can spot men riding horses across an open plain.<br>I believe that what you could have done was compare a human to Legolas by saying what a human with perfect vision could see at that distance, and then show what would have to be done to the human eye in order to see clearly at that range. (Legolas would merely be there for moral support, since, as I&#39;ve said before, is scientifically undefined and living in a magical realm of imagination and opinions.)<br><br>I was also curious: at what point CAN the human eye see horsemen clearly at 24km? What sort of things would have to happen to the eye in order to see that range?<br><br>(Sorry for the absurdly long paragraphs.
