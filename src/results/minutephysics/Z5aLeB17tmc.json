I am a physics student currently working on a computational research project which requires the division of a sphere into equal area slices and I know for a fact that slice thickness has to change in order to keep area constant.<br><br>The proof that the video&#39;s claim is not true is fairly simple, requiring only single variable calculus to show. The claim is that the area of a slice (dA) is proportional to the thickness of a slice (dh) and independent of the height where the slice is taken (h).<br><br>Using Riemann sums, we can imagine slicing out a horizontal sliver from a sphere of differential thickness dh. Allowing dh to be appropriately small, this sliver would be cylindrical (in the limit) allowing us to write the surface area as dA = 2*Pi*r*dh.<br><br>At this point it is very easy to say &quot;aha, there is no dependence on h, so equal thickness slices will have equal area&quot;. But this logic has a slight flaw, it assumes that r (the area of our differential cylinder) is R (the area of our sphere).<br><br>It turns out, using right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem that r^2 = R^2 - h^2.<br><br>So really dA = 2*Pi*sqrt(R^2 - h^2)*dh<br><br>If we were to integrate from some arbitrary height H to H+t, where t represents thickness, the H terms would not cancel, and we would find height dependence.<br><br>So equal slices do not have equal area!<br><br>The area depends on where the slice is taken from in the sphere.", "comment_date": "2015-08-17T16:46:37Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Brandstetter", "comment_text": "Question though. wouldn&#39;t the important thing for land dwelling creatures (LDC&#39;s) be the horizontal projected area? \u00a0sort of the amount of area that would exist if you built a level platform of size X at the highest point in the area covered by your platform?<br><br>LDC&#39;s don&#39;t live perpendicular to the ground, they live perpendicular to the force of gravity, to avoid falling over. \u00a0So more surface area (say, on the vertical side of a cliff) wouldn&#39;t do a LDC any good, because they can&#39;t use it.", "comment_date": "2015-07-29T20:09:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ecen Cronzeton", "comment_text": "However, is it not so that if we wanted to build something on a mountain, we would (for relatively normal structures) need horizontal surface area?

It can be explained by the fact that as the sphere grow thinier at the bottom, it aslo get wider (from a diving point of view ). That seems logical.<br>But we can see a sphere as the gathering of an infinite number of co-centred circles, each one between two other, forming a pile. Since each of our X parts has the same height, it is composed of the same number of circles ( a infinity ). We aslo notice that the radius of the co-centred circles is growing smaller as we reach the poles. The surface being the addition of the perimeters ( I guess the math must be an &quot;integral&quot; ) of every circles of \u00a0the part, it should decrease as it get closer to the poles ?<br>Could you please explain me/us how it works, this part trully puzzles me.<br>Thank you, and I hope you will see and take time to answer my comment.<br>By the way, I apologyze for the bad quality of my english skills, this is not my native language, do not hesitate to correct me (anyone).", "comment_date": "2015-06-04T19:16:50Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Patrick Prichard", "comment_text": "Climate change is a farse.", "comment_date": "2015-06-04T17:15:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Erik Hartmann", "comment_text": "Still more area at the bottom.", "comment_date": "2015-06-04T12:47:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neha2906", "comment_text": "Shouldn&#39;t this have been in MinuteEarth?
