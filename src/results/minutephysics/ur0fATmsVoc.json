That is why you need to use a sun filter, to cut the percentage of light rays coming from the sun or else you would have more rays hitting the back of your eye then what the cells can handle.", "comment_date": "2016-03-12T06:30:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "First Last", "comment_text": "!?!????!??!??!!??!!?", "comment_date": "2016-03-12T06:17:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jane Weber", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur0fATmsVoc&amp;t=1m23s\">1:23</a> Why are we burning Glucose?...
