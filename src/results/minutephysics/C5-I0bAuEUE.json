The thing is, for you to end up in your number, you need to start at least after the 50th element of the 100-box-cycle. It is because of the same reason that you stated, that there is a single chain connecting all the boxes which have random dollar bills in it. It is hard for me to put in words, but imagine it in this way, there are 100 boxes, each connected with the number of the dollar bill, which means that in order for you to end up in the same box, it will take you a total of 100 moves. But we only have 50 moves, which means we need to start at least after 50 boxes to ensure that we will reach our box within 50 moves. So if we suppose that our end box is &#39;our dollar bill&#39; we would have to start after the halfay of the chain connecting the box with &#39;our&#39; dollar bill. And the probability of a box to lie in that half would be 1/100. So, for 50 boxes, its 1/2. But, the probability of you landing on the box is far greater by this &#39;chain method&#39; than guessing randomly because in the chain method, every box you open will have 1/2 of a chance to take you to your dollar bill, while guessing randomly gives you a probability of 1/(100-number of box previously opened). I agree that the chain rule is far more likely to get you to the dollar bill, while guessing randomly gives you very few chances to actually win, unless you are extraordinarily lucky. And as always, thank you for watching.

So here is how it works. First of all the 100 people must have a very good feeling for time and second they all have to see each other while waiting. Before they started, they all made sure, that they count the boxes in the same way (e.g. if it&#39;s a square, the first one is the nearest on the left and they count them going right, one up, left, one up and so on). Let&#39;s say using the technique of the video, the first person finds his dollar in the 34th box with respect to the counting strategy i mentioned. Then the first person makes sure, he stays in the room 34 minutes in total and then leaves the room, for the next person to take the turn. Each person in the waiting room counted as well, now knowing that the 34th box does not contain their dollar. This gives the second person one less box to choose from. The counting and staying in the room is repeated for each turn, revealing one more box to be not the right one each turn.

The formula is basically if you select 5 boxes from 10. 9 / 10 is the probability you fail to take the first box. The number of wrong options and number of total options decrease by 1 with each fail.

Take\u00a010 regular playing cards ( numbered cards 1 (the Ace) through 10,\u00a0all diamonds if you like\u00a0since we&#39;re simulating a money bet\u00a0), shuffle and deal all 10 cards face down from left to right. The left most card will be\u00a0considered\u00a0as being in position-location 1,\u00a0the next card to the right\u00a0will be\u00a0located\u00a0in\u00a0position-location 2,\u00a0etc.. Now assume you are\u00a0person_one and you&#39;re hoping to find the\u00a0&quot;1 card&quot;\u00a0 (the Ace).\u00a0So, as person_one, you start by turning over the card in position-location 1. If you\u00a0just turned over the Ace then your part is done (as persone_one)\u00a0 and\u00a0person_one can leave the room.\u00a0Now, ensure that all ten cards are\u00a0put\u00a0back to their\u00a0original starting condition\u00a0(reseted, all are face down again) without changing card\u00a0locations,\u00a0and now person_two can enter the room.\u00a0Otherwise, your still playing as person_one if the card you turned over was not an Ace. Now you (person_one) still\u00a0have four more turns (guesses)\u00a0remaining.\u00a0Each person(<i>x) \u00a0has 5 guess-turns apiece, since 5 (guess-turns) is half of 10 (people), just as 50\u00a0(guess-turns) is half of 100 (people). Now if you, as person_one,\u00a0turned over a 2-card (for example) on the first turn, then the next card you will turn over will be the card that is in position-location 2, if it was a 3-card then you&#39;ll turn over the card in position-location 3.\u00a0 ( Suggestion, placing small paper squares numbered 1 - 10\u00a0beside\u00a0each respective position-location helps quite a bit).\u00a0In either case, if\u00a0your\u00a0person_one&#39;s second-guess card\u00a0is an Ace, then person</i> one found his/her card, otherwise keep hunting for the Ace in this fashion\u00a0until you have used up all of person_one&#39;s five turns. If you found the Ace during this time then your done, mission accomplished for person_one and person_two will be up next trying to find the 2-card\u00a0 first turning the card over in position-location 2. That is, after the cards have all been turn back over face-down and person_one has left the room. If person_one did not find the Ace in 5 turns, then\u00a0the\u00a0game is over and\u00a0the\u00a0same 10 cards will be reshuffled\u00a0and you can start the next bet-game.

Since 5 card-choice-turns is half of 10 total cards, just as\u00a050 box-choice-turns\u00a0is half of 100 total boxes,\u00a0the Group Win Percentage results for a 10 member group should be comparable with the 100\u00a0member Group Win Percentage results, that is, for the purposes of deciding whether\u00a0to take\u00a0this bet on\u00a0or not. The main exception being that the\u00a0expected Group Win Percentage for the 10 member group (using\u00a0random\u00a0only guesses for\u00a0selecting which cards to turn over next)\u00a0would now be\u00a0about .098%,\u00a0that is\u00a01 out of (1/2)^(-10), or 1 out of every 1024 games played.

So wanting to test\u00a0the chaining method out manually, I shuffled the 10 cards (the number cards 1\u00a0through 10, any suit of course) and\u00a0dealt them out face down\u00a0and then proceeded to\u00a0play\u00a0the part of each one of\u00a0a 10 member group.

Their name points back to their starting pot, closing the cycle.\u00a0 Therefore the only way that a money chooser would not find their own name is if their name rested in a pot contained in a cycle of a length greater than 50.\u00a0 This means that if there are no cycles of over 50 pots, then every money chooser will find their name.\u00a0 So now we must determine the probability of such an event.<br>Let \u00a0the probability that there will be a cycle of length p(c)<br>Let \u00a0= the probability of there being a cycle of length .p(c[i])<br>In this case, we must determine p(50).\u00a0 Once found, we can determine the probability of there not being a cycle of length greater than 50 by finding 1-p(50) .\u00a0 To find p(50) we must find the number of ways that there can be cycles of length greater than 50 and divide it by the number of possible situations.

Of the 51 available names, 1 of the names cannot be used.\u00a0 This is because the pot containing its own name would create a cycle of length 1.\u00a0 When choosing a name for pot i&lt;51 , any name that hasn\u2019t already been used can be chosen except the name of the original pot.\u00a0 Unless i is 51, choosing the name of the original pot would create a cycle of length less than 51.<br>Once 51 names have been arranged in the 51 pots in the cycle, 49 names remain, which have to be place in the remaining 49 pots.\u00a0 These can be arranged in 49! ways.

That ones easy, the next concept is that everyone starts where their bill should have been. Ok? So if you were #1, you start at box 1. If you were #39, you start at box 39.\u00a0<br><br>Now. Why is the last concept so important? Well, as youre opening the boxes, you are going to go where the bill inside tells you to go. Right? You open a box and it has bill 5 in it, then you get your ass over to box number 5. And you repeat. And repeat. But, I havent hit the why yet. You might think you have only 50/50 still, but you actually dont! We have already decided that we understand what a chain is, it is a loop of bills that repeats. And, since you started at the box where your bill shooooulldddd have been, you have automatically guaranteed that you are in the correct chain! Because, for you to be able to start at that box, it means there must be some bill in this chain that sends you back to it, because chains are repetitive. And that bill that sends you back is the bill youre looking for!<br><br>So, nowwwww all you need to be convinced of is that it is likely that these chains are short enough for you to make it to your bill in 50 moves. Sadly, I do not have the knowledge to explain that, there are some in the comments that do, but, I dont think that part is so hard to agree with, that it will be fairly likely that a chain is less than 50 bills long. Remember though, as soon as a chain is more than 50 long, you lose. This is because you have to go COMPLETELY through the entire chain to win. You win when you are directed back to your starting point, where you bill should have been, so, if there is a chain longer than you have moves, you lose. Youre no longer betting whether you and everyone else can randomly find all your bills or not, youre betting that no chains are longer than 50 bills long, which is a much better bet!", "comment_date": "2014-12-09T02:57:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Kenny", "comment_text": "though even without that strategy, I&#39;d still make the bet. one dollar is worth virtually nothing to me, i can just rummage through my change box right now, but one HUNDRED dollars is somehow worth more than one hundred times one dollar.<br><br>this is mostly because of how hard it is to get one hundred dollars. i could easily just find a dollar on the street, or get it as change when buying something, but if i want one hundred dollars then i&#39;d need to work. given my current position as a university student i&#39;d need to get only part time work, and on average i&#39;d be getting paid ten dollars an hour(this takes tax into account), so it would take me ten hours to earn this, but then you take out the various other expenses such as rent, student fees, train fees, food, etc. and i have very little left over.<br><br>all that said, it would take me ages to simply earn one hundred dollars, but if i could earn one hundred in this bet i would be saving money in the form of time.", "comment_date": "2014-12-09T02:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Detahramet", "comment_text": "...It is still massively irrational to say yes to the bet, as you are still more likely to lose than not.", "comment_date": "2014-12-09T02:55:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tj gi", "comment_text": "So you shouldn&#39;t take the bet, since you only win a dollar.

If the process were fairly quick you could say that leaving on an odd minute corresponds to the nearest half when entering the room, and even minutes for the far end, although since the boxes get reset you might change the communication to minutes 0-4 to the near half and 5-9 to the far half to account for the time delay.
