Sure he was very human. So the Cosmological constant was his greatest blunder but of course we still need it today to describe dark energy. So what is dark energy? The atomic bubble and we know it is a bubble see Bose Einstein condensate, pulses in and out in an expanding universe that has a big suck and perfect elasticity and a big bang. It also has an ether and see Einstein and how his equations could not work at all without the existence of an ether, not a Luminiferous Aether of Michelson and Morley lets call it quantum foam, with a diameter of Planck Constant, absolute space of Newton, Absolute Space-time of Einstein. So another small bubble exists that is Planck constant and it too is pulsing in and out creating background radiation. So that superconducting superfluid is what the big bubbles move around in those atoms, so then as it pulses it sends out a wave lets use H and it is a spherical wave of course and it crests at the electron radius. But what is a spherical wave crest surely that is beyond our understanding as humans? It sure does appear to be. Need some help? The waves spherical coming off are magnetism, and dark energy in general and they go on forever at the speed of light. One quantum foam bubble pushes the next and perfect elasticity moves the momentum, waves are a imaginary construct remember? Em waves where the shells meet and send off a transverse wave as light for example, created by clashing spherical waves. What is a point particle?

It shows exactly what was predicted by the Halflec model and its experimental, mathematical, proof, which was documented over ten years ago, before the LHC was even commissioned! The Halflec model makes everything self-evident. It tells us what the universe looked like, the instant before the Big Bang. Not the instant after the Big Bang, the instant before. It tells us what Black Holes are. What magnetism is and how it works. Why electrons pair up in superconducting superconductors. What the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect is and what it means. It shows us why electrons have spin and why we can measure it. The Halflec model explains every  Physical anomaly. It is the answer to The Theory of Everything. <br><br>This experiment is based on the most accurate, trusted and scientifically accepted and verified data set known to modern science, the data of The Periodic Table. This mathematical experiment, uses only the most trusted, accurate and precise data known to man and only a mathematician can validate the experiment and its meaning, so theoretical Physics is irrelevant. The mathematical experiment defines the elementary subatomic particle, referred to here as the Halflec, the mass of which is exactly, one half the mass of an electron. The mass of the electron is the most tested and measure quantity know and is the most accurate and precisely known mass, imaginable. In this experiment, unlike that of the LHC&#39;s Higgs Boson which used quadrillions of data points and a plethora of experiments and for all that, they were only able to show a single example of a single anomaly, which was enough for them to claim success. This experiment uses only a little over 100 data points but shows almost complete agreement, in all points, except for a specific group, a single row of The Periodic Table, the Lanthanides. After this experiment was conducted, further research revealed that the Lanthanide masses had in fact been a controversial dispute, between two competing rationales regarding the method of calculation, so this Halflec model suggests that the wrong group won the debate.<br><br>Please try and understand that this was a, Real-Time experiment and this presentation was meant as a record of the experiment and was only meant to record the events and results as they unfolded and was never intended to be a professional internet media presentation and is therefor a little primitive but it is presented so an observer can stop the image of the spreadsheet and see the formulae of all the variables and columns and can thereby duplicate the experiment, easily, simply and quickly:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O47xBcrNJPs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O47xBcrNJPs</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXBOwZsqOkA&amp;t=56s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXBOwZsqOkA&amp;t=56s</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Twz0P2ZIk0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Twz0P2ZIk0</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVUVzZDvq0c&amp;t=1s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVUVzZDvq0c&amp;t=1s</a>", "comment_date": "2021-06-03T22:27:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brother Carver", "comment_text": "Einstein, the man who would sooner write a retraction than site his peers.", "comment_date": "2021-06-03T06:43:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "W Young", "comment_text": "Al &quot;The Hammer&quot; Einstein, greatest wrestler that never was.", "comment_date": "2021-06-02T04:26:30Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Zeff", "comment_text": "Coment section is really fun here \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2021-06-01T07:04:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lies damnlies", "comment_text": "Graciously admit when you\u2019re wrong, yes, but also don\u2019t use that you corrected someone to eviscerate and publicly shame them.

In addition, the presentation also includes a sequence of events claiming that while Friedmann had written to Einstein in December 1922, Einstein did not read it because he was traveling, and needed a May 1923 conversation with Yuri Krutkov, five months later, to finally understand that he had made a mistake.

The society where the book was revealed had nothing to do with biblical studies and they were just pagan, idol worshipers without any previous knowledge of previous scriptures. <br>- The book predicted future events that all came true. <br>- The book was revealed in a society that glorified their language (Arabic) where people then were famous for their mastery of the language in poetry yet that book stunned them in its superior linguistic form that they couldn&#39;t classify its style - they called it magic! It even challenged them to come up with one chapter like it but they failed - the shortest chapter in it is 3 verses.<br><br><br>That man was Muhammad \ufdfa peace be upon him and the book that was revealed to him is the holy Quran.

in 300 years ago the Newtonian mechanics was born<br>during the modern industry germination times, basically the gravity, explosive<br>force or trajectory force was primarily studied. The industrial science<br>develops up today, as the kinetic foundation the Newtonian mechanics should be<br>developed followed by dynamic, have a complete theory system to face all<br>dynamical phenomenon (including personal force). Such as\uff1aelectromechanical dynamics, hot dynamics or<br>hydrodynamics and so on , it is the most important part in all personal living<br>environments. There will have some questions if they are interpreted by the<br>Newtonian mechanics. The most basic reason is that the Newtonian mechanics<br>takes the disposable use of force as the object of research but the modern<br>mechanics mostly needs to face the situation of the long-enduring use of force,<br>and photo-electrical and the Big Bang Theory", "comment_date": "2021-03-09T20:25:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam Lipton", "comment_text": "Friedmann-Lemaitre please.

This necessarily represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy.<br><br>THE EYE is the body. (The DOME of a person&#39;s EYE is ALSO visible.) The BALANCE of what is BODILY/VISUAL experience is essential. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE. OVERLAY what is the eye in BALANCED relation to/with what is the Earth. Notice what is the BLUE SKY. (The Earth is ALSO BLUE.) Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. E=mc2 IS F=ma. SO, what constitutes the falling MAN (ON  BALANCE) feels no gravity; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Therefore, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL resistance; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Accordingly, the rotation of what is the Moon matches it&#39;s revolution. Moreover, objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; as E=mc2 IS F=ma. Indeed, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. So, A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is the Sun (as A POINT, of course); AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves (ON BALANCE) that E=mc2 IS F=ma, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Ultimately and truly, time is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper understanding of physics/physical experience, as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand.) It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. (Notice the black space of what is THE EYE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.) Indeed, the stars do twinkle in what is the night sky. THINK !!! THOROUGHLY consider what is A GALAXY. Great. In fact, stellar clustering proves that electromagnetism/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

I especially enjoyed your unabashed exposure of the flagrant mistake that EINSTEIN made and thought you may be interested in analyzing another such instance.<br><br>I am sending you a lengthy article I wrote challenging one of the sacred cows of conventional physics about the limitation on the SPEED OF LIGHT which I have published all over the place and on the Internet and which I submitted to STEPHEN HAWING when he was alive and to GEOFFREY BURBIDGE, of RED SHIFT fame, for their consideration and comment. <br><br>Hawking actually wrote back to me to indirectly tell me to &quot; keep my day job&quot; but without any actual counter argument  and Burbidge was deceased so I never really got a convincing answer or rebuttal from either one about the ALTERNATIVE theory I proposed.<br><br>However, since HAWKING was 100% wrong about the nature of the expanding Universe, I feel justified in speculating to my heart&#39;s content because I cannot be any more incorrect than he was. What a joy it is to be a &quot; theoretical &quot; physicist.<br><br>I would like to see what you think of my ideas and hope that with your far superior knowledge of physics and mathematics, you can FLESH out and elaborate on my theory and give it some additional support and validation....or NOT !<br><br>I look forward to your comments one way or the other, so here goes and I hope you read this;<br><br><br>EINSTEIN WAS WRONG ABOUT THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND THE UNIVERSE IS MUCH SMALLER THAN WHAT WE THINK...HERE IS AN \u00ab  ALTERNATIVE \u00ab  THEORY<br><i>_______________________________________________________________________________</i><br><br>What I do not like about &quot; theoretical &quot; physicists like EINSTEIN is that they work with equations and then try to have reality conform to their equations. This is a brain dead and preposterous nonstarter. Most of his &quot; theoretical &quot; predictions about the reality and the nature of the Universe, derived from his equations,  have been proven to be true, but many others have NOT. <br><br>I humbly suggest that EINSTEIN&#39;S  &quot; theoretical physicist&#39;s LIMITATION ON THE SPEED OF LIGHT and the way it TRAPS us in our own backyard is one such manifest failure.<br><br>On the other hand, &quot; experimental&quot;  physicists like TESLA first do laboratory and field tests, see the results and only then do they try to describe this REALITY in the form of mathematical equations or theories. TESLA reported that he had repeatedly conducted experiments where he observed and measured phenomena travelling at many times the conventional &quot; C &quot; speed of light propounded by EINSTEIN. He was just one of many such research teams around the world which have observed SUPRA-LUMINAL phenomena and which have been published in numerous journals such as the french SCIENCE ET VIE.<br><br> EINSTEIN never set foot in a laboratory nor did he ever do experiments to confirm his mathematical theories. It is true that others have subsequently done that and confirmed many of his suppositions...but NOT all. <br><br>EINSTEIN was once asked; &quot; what does it feel like to be the smartest man in the world &quot; and his answer was; &quot; YOU HAVE TO ASK TESLA &quot; ...he was right. <br><br>I prefer TESLA&#39;s empirical evidence to purely \u00ab  thought \u00ab  experiments and I do not accept blindly the conclusions of mere mathematical equations without experimental evidence and the many experiments with the speed of light have produced contradictory results. <br><br>TESLA is infinitely more important to the practical development of mankind&#39;s technological advancement than EINSTEIN. Our entire modern world is based on numerous patents and inventions developed by TESLA. In fact, we have only scratched the surface of his futuristic science. Most of his most important concepts and inventions still remain to be deciphered and implemented by mankind such as the WIRELESS TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICITY, the harnessing of FREE RADIANT ENERGY and my favorite, ELECTROSTATIC PROPULSION...UFO stuff. <br><br>For these reasons, I am a staunch advocate against what I consider to be the flagrant errors and mi-conceptions that EINSTEIN perpetuated about the limitation on the speed of light based on only &quot; equations &quot;. <br><br>As a trial lawyer of thirty years and as an amateur &quot; theoretical &quot; physicist, it means I can BULLSHIT to my heart&#39;s content because my hypotheses cannot be any worse than those of STEPHEN HAWKING, for example who was completely and 180 degrees WRONG about the expansion of the Universe. <br><br>So, I wrote a paper entitled EINSTEIN WAS WRONG in which the premise was that I would put EINSTEIN on trial to PROVE the limitation on the speed o light and I laid out the EVIDENCE that I would produce to support my arguments contesting his findings. But, more importantly, I did not just attack his theory, I also suggested and proposed an ALTERNATIVE theory about the true speed of light based on that evidence. <br><br>I cited the many researchers around the world have also conducted experiments where they regularly observed and measured faster than light phenomena. I cited the classical TUNNEL experiment which also demonstrates this possibility in a way which is difficult for &quot; theoretical &quot; physicists to discredit or dismiss. <br><br>In that TUNNEL experiment a light beam is divided and directed into two separate chambers towards a COMMON target. One chamber is a vacuum and the other chamber is filled with heavy CESIUM atoms to try to obstruct and slow down the beam . Counter-intuitively, the beam in the CESIUM chamber consistently WINS the race thereby and clearly travelling faster than the speed of the other beam, which is the conventional speed of light &quot; C &quot; and more counter-intuitively, it seems to EXIT the machine BEFORE it enters ! <br><br>Based upon these experimental facts and EVIDENCE , and as YODA would say; &quot; how simple the mind of a child is &quot; , here is my ... <br><br>ALTERNATIVE THEORY ABOUT THE SPEED OF LIGHT <i>_______________________________________________</i> <br><br>THERE IS PORTION OF LIGHT WHICH TRAVELS MUCH MUCH FASTER THAN THE CONVENTIONAL &quot; C &quot; but which we cannot detect or measure until it SLOWS DOWN to the speed of light.  <br><br>I propose that the reason the CESIUM obstructed beam seems to EXIT the apparatus BEFORE it enters is because it is this INVISIBLE portion of light, travelling much faster than our conventional  \u00ab  C \u00ab      which does in fact enter the apparatus before the other beam...but which we cannot see or measure until it slows down and EXITS...but it still exits faster than the rest of its own beam or before the other part of the beam in the second vacuum chamber.<br><br>I also argue against the MATHEMATICAL conclusions that EINSTEIN&#39;s drew from his use of the LORENZ equations. His entire &quot; theory &quot; about the limitation on the speed of light is based on what is arguably his improper interpretation and application of the LORENZ TRANSFORMATION EQUATIONS and the mass conversion equations in particular. <br><br>I contend that his whole theory is based on a self serving, circular and debatable reasoning and on his flawed application of that MASS TRANSFORMATION EQUATION. In that equation EINSTEIN says that when an object travels at the speed of light its final MASS would have to be INFINITE and since infinite mass, in his opinion, is IMPOSSIBLE...therefore no material object can travel at the speed of light. <br><br>I won&#39;t talk about the meaning or possibility of the concept of infinite mass but I argue that this whole conclusion is not a mathematical law but a mathematical hypotheses and philosophy because it is derived from the fact that this equation ends up with a ZERO in the denominator of the mathematical radical and EINSTEIN &quot; theorizes &quot; that a zero in a denominator of an equation equals INFINITY...but other physicists and mathematicians do NOT agree with this rule. <br><br>THEREFORE ALL BETS ARE OFF <br><br>If in fact my ALTERNATIVE theory is true that the speed of light is far greater than &quot; C &quot; , it would solve and resolve many of the lingering dilemmas of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics. It would explain the QUANTUM PARADOX . It would explain the DUAL NATURE of light and it would explain and support BURBIDGE&#39;S theory about the mis-calculation of the RED SHIFT and redefine our ideas about the size and dimensions of the Universe. <br><br>CONCLUSION<br><i>__________</i><br><br>To summarize the logic and genesis of this ALTERNATIVE theory for me as a layman, unburdened by knowledge or by the prejudices and pre-conceptions of conventional wisdom, it tortures COMMON SENSE to theorize that an object can travel at 99.999999999 % of the speed of light but that there is some invisible, impenetrable barrier which blocks it from travelling that extra 0.0000000001 % ...it makes NO sense. <br><br>Q.E.D. <br><br>More importantly, it means we are NOT trapped in our galaxy and that we can in fact one day travel at Captain Kirk&#39;s WARP 10 or travel in Hans Solo&#39;s Hyperspace without turning ourselves into human Popsicles  and we CAN visit the stars and other planets without being put to sleep for a thousand years...which is more convoluted PRIMITIVE science nonsense.", "comment_date": "2020-02-13T11:31:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jnbfrancisco", "comment_text": "I hope to see the day when scientists come to an agreement about catastrophic climate change.
