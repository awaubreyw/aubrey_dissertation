This is a bait and switch where they keep the idea of a word, use a different word, and then say the original is no longer valid because it&#39;s no longer used.  But the meaning of the original word is still implicit (I would actually say very much explicit).<br>To say that there are patterns is to admit there is cause and effect because it is from the relationship of cause and effect that the pattern &quot;arises&quot; so to speak.  To say that classical mechanics of isolated parts doesn&#39;t distinguish past from future doesn&#39;t negate cause and effect but acknowledges their intimate relationship.  It&#39;s precisely because of the nature of cause and effect that we can describe it so symmetrically.<br>Further, this is a very narrow, modern view of cause and effect that is being claimed to be overturned (or at best being claimed to apply only to entropic macroscopic systems).  Most forms of cause and effect don&#39;t even need to appeal to time at all.  On a hypothetical beach in a completely eternal, static universe there is a boot.  The boot has always been there and always will be and no grain of sand has ever moved or ever will move.  The boot print in the sand had no temporal beginning but we can still say that it was caused by the weight of the boot pressed into the sand.<br>Other examples:  If every atom in my body was replaced with silicon I would cease to be a living human being.  What I&#39;m made of is a cause to the effect of me being human and alive.  This cause/effect relationship doesn&#39;t appeal to time.  Similarly, if you isolated all the material elements that make me and separated them into piles, yes, you would have all the material that makes a living human being but you still wouldn&#39;t have a living human being.  The material needs to be arranged in a certain way to be a human being.  This arrangement is a cause that doesn&#39;t depend on time.  In order to be a living human being this arrangement of material needs to be engaged and interacting which is the only cause that requires time (and as we saw with the boot print above not all interaction type causes need to be temporal either).<br>To be a cause all one has to be is a feature that, if missing or altered in some way, would alter whatever it is you&#39;re observing.  A feature can be a physical object, an activity, an interaction, a motion, a relationship, etc.  To be an effect all you have to be is contingent, dependent, on some feature.  From this relationship regularities and patterns will arise (like, for example, what we call the laws of physics).

Sean Carroll just made this argument and tried to provide some silly examples only to at the very end of the video say&quot;  it only makes sense in the large scale through time&quot;. What&#39;s your point?<br><br>Yes, if you take out the dimension of time, then with any equation, you can predict any equation&#39;s path when you &quot;apply the dimenstion of time&quot; to the equation.. F=MA does not have time and has nothing to do with time. it is, as you say, a &quot;record&quot; of the instant state. But if you apply time, and the change in force, or mass, or accelation &quot;CAUSE&quot;, you will have an &quot;AFFECT&quot; on the other values. Its initiator of change which is the cause, and the delta and the change in time which is the which is the path, and the record at an instant of some later time which is the effect! Since the universe is in constant movement towards entropy which gives us the perception of time in one directio, is why we describe.<br><br>The numberline example is just ridiculous. the Number 42 does not cause 41 or 43.. ITS THE OPERATION, ACTION OF applying +1 or -1 to the state (42) which is the cause.<br><br>The explaination of the reverse explosion is stupid. Removing part of the explosion does not mean there was not a preceding explosion, but you left out that the state of the system would have to have been different at the cause to acceive the different effect. If you were able to now the state of every particile and their vectors of change, you can go backwards.<br><br>For the nuclear blast he is missing the fact that the nuclear blast causes the state of the pencil &quot;record&quot; to contain carbon14, which by the &quot;action&quot; of putting carbon14 into th pencil is the EFFECT. Again if you know the state of every particle and their vectors of change in a system, you can reverse back to determine the cause. But you would need to know that of EVERYTHING in the system to determine that. This is true for a small system and even a large system.<br><br>We cant predict the weather &quot;in the current year&quot; because we do not have all the data of the state and direction of change of every particle on our planet (or universe for that matter) to exactly calculate how the weather is going to change or has changed.
