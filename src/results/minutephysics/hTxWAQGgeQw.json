Because when A-B moves relative to the backdrop of space the field distance between the fixed A-B system actually increases - hence the reason c&#39;s elapsed time between them increases. Your Lorentz mechanism showed this - when the distance between A-B points on your mechanism increased the elapsed time of c between said points increased causing  time dilation. The reason this happens is because the emission of a photon is an event (which does not move) and if said emission takes place at point A in a moving A-B system then said A-B system is moving relative to the emission point (non moving event) of the photon. Thus, the field distance between A-B increases because as the system is moving, c is propagating across A-B trying to reach point B which is moving away from the emission point effectively increasing the field distance between A-B. If you look at your mechanism you&#39;ll see that the elapsed time of c between points is directly proportional to the field distance between the points.

Calculate carefully and draw your conclusions. For the sake of completeness suppose the or second ship S2 is moving in the beams\u2018 direction ( starting 300k km away).
