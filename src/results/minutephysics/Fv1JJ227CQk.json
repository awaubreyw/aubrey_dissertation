Googology is basically the study of very large numbers and the notations that is used to express them. When you study googology in depth, you can see that the so-called scientific notation which we usually use to express large numbers is actually incredibly weak in comparison to many of the commonly used notations in googology such as Knuth&#39;s up-arrow notation, fast-growing hierarchy, Bird&#39;s Array Notation and Bashicu Matrix System, although it may not seems weak at all to an average person. This is mainly because we don&#39;t need numbers much larger than those that can be made using exponents in real life. For example, the mass of Sun is approximately 2*10^30 kg and the number of subatomic particles in the universe is approimately 10^80. \r<br>    Below I will show you the formal definition and some examples of expression in Knuth&#39;s up-arrow notation:\r<br>a^^^^...^^^b with n uparrows = a^^^...^a^^^...^^a^^^...^^a... ...a^^^..^^a with (n-1) uparrows between each successive a&#39;s\r<br>Where a^b is the same as a raised to the power tower of b\r<br>First, we will take a review of addition, multiplication and exponentiation. We had all studied in school that addition is repeated counting, multiplication is repeated addition and exponentiation is repeated multiplication, mathematically:\r<br>a+b = a+1+1+1...+1 (repeated b times)\r<br>a*b = a+a+a...+a (repeated b times), and\r<br>a^b = a*a*a*a...*a (repeated b times)\r<br>Now, we will start with the double up-arrow operator, which is better known as tetration.\r<br>a^^b (read this as &quot;a tetrated to b&quot;) = a^a^a^a^...^a (b times) (a power tower of a&#39;s b terms high)\r<br>Keep in mind that exponents are always right-associative, so a^b^c^d is the same as a^(b^(c^d))\r<br>For example, 2^^3 = 2^2^2 = 2^4 = 16\r<br>2^^4 = 2^2^2^2 = 2^2^4 = 2^16 = 65536\r<br>2^^5 = 2^2^2^2^2 = 2^2^2^4 = 2^2^16 = 2^65536 = 10^(log10(2)*65536) using rules of logarithm = approx. 2*10^19728 (a number WITH 19729 DIGITS!!!!!!)\r<br>3^^3 = 3^3^3 = 3^27 = \t7,625,597,484,987 (approximately 7.6 trillion for short)\r<br>10^^^3 = 10^10^10 = 10^(10 billion) = 1 followed by ten billion zeroes\r<br>Now do you see how powerful tetration is in comparison to scientific notation?\r<br>But that&#39;s not the end of the story. Just like how tetration is repeated exponentiation, pentation is repeated tetration, which is normally denoted as triple up arrows (^^^) In summary, the n arrow operator is repeated (n-1) arrow operator\r<br>    After that, I suggest you to learn the definition of fast-growing hierarchy, which is basically like this:\r<br>f_n(a) = (f_(n-1))^a(a), when n is a successor ordinal, or in other words, \r<br>f_(n-1)(f_(n-1)(...(f_(n-1)(a))...)) (nested n times)\r<br>When n is a limit ordinal, f_n(a) is defined as f_(n[a])(a), where n[a] is the n-th element of the fundamental sequence of the ordinal n\r<br>    For the definition of successor and limit ordinals, you can search it yourself in Googology Wiki\r<br>    Now, here&#39;s an equation for you. Given that 1/f_x(100) is the amount of DNA I inherit from my mom, try to find the ordinal x. The ordinal x here is known as my DNA ordinal\r<br>    Here&#39;s the approximate value of x in Bashicu Matrix System: (0,0,0)(1,1,1)(2,2,2)(3,3,3)(3,3,0)(4,4,1)(5,5,2)(6,6,2)(7,7,0)(8,8,1)(9,9,2)(10,9,2)(11,9,0)(12,10,1)(13,11,2)(13,11,2)(13,11,1)(14,12,2)(14,11,1)(15,12,2)(15,11,1)(16,12,0)(17,13,1)(18,14,2)(18,14,2)(18,14,1)(19,15,2)(19,14,1)(20,15,2)(20,14,1)(21,15,0)(22,16,1)(23,17,2)(23,17,2)(23,17,1)(24,18,2)(24,17,1)(25,18,2)(25,17,0)(26,18,1)(27,19,2)(27,19,2)(27,19,1)(28,20,2)(28,19,1)(29,20,2)(29,19,0)(30,20,1)(31,21,2)(31,21,2)(31,21,1)(32,22,2)(32,21,1)(33,22,2)(33,21,0)(34,22,1)(35,23,2)(35,23,2)(35,23,1)(36,24,2)(36,23,1)(37,24,2)(37,23,0)(38,24,1)(39,25,2)(40,25,2)(40,25,1)(41,26,2)(41,22,1)(42,23,2)(42,23,2)(42,23,1)(43,24,2)(43,23,1)(44,24,2)(44,23,0)(45,24,1)(46,25,2)(47,25,2)(47,25,1)(48,26,1)(49,27,0)(50,28,1)(51,29,2)(52,29,2)(52,29,1)(53,30,0)(54,31,1)(55,32,2)(56,32,2)(56,32,0)(57,33,1)(58,34,2)(59,34,2)(59,34,0)(60,35,1)(61,36,2)(62,36,2)(62,36,0)(63,37,1)(64,38,2)(65,38,2)(65,38,0)(66,39,1)(67,40,2)(68,40,2)(68,40,0)(69,41,1)(70,42,2)(71,42,2)(71,42,0)(72,43,1)(73,44,0)(74,45,1)(75,44,0)... ...\r<br>For the definition of Bashicu Matrix System, you can search it up yourself in google\r<br>    So can you please help me to analyze my DNA ordinal?", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T23:24:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheOtherSteel", "comment_text": "First you say photons cannot directly interact.

And this requires both the change in the collective consciousness but it also requires that there are certain scientists who are willing to question what most scientists are currently not questioning, including materialism. Now, just as a concrete example here, you have the whole concept of free energy. This can be explained actually in terms of what is currently known by quantum physics. You have observations made by quantum physicists in bubble chambers, that you can have a state where there are no particles, suddenly one particle appears, divides itself into several particles, they collide again and then disappear. There have been some scientists who have been willing to speculate that, beyond what can be observed even at the subatomic level, there must be some kind of energy field, some call it a quantum field, some call it a ground state, whatever they call it, but it has basically been proven by quantum physics, that there is some state beyond the physical material realm. And in that state there is energy. And that energy can then enter the material realm and become physical matter. If you take this and put it together with a big bang, you can see that, is it actually logical that all of the matter and all of the energy that is now in this huge universe was compressed into something called a singularity? Whatever that may be. Is this really logical? Obviously, all of the matchup could not fit in there. But could the energy actually fit into a single point? Is it not just as logical to say that there was an event where energy from a different realm entered the material frequency spectrum. And this means that all of the matter that you see in the world today is actually created from energy. This was proven by Einstein. \r<br>And that energy must have come from somewhere, and what has now been proven for those who are willing to see it by quantum physics, is that that energy came from another realm. It entered the material world, the physical realm from another realm. Well, is that not free energy? Is it not thereby proven that the entire world is created by free energy? So does that not mean it is also possible that technology could be created, that would be able to, so to speak, channel the energy from a different realm into the material realm, where it could then be used to perform physical work or at least create electricity that could power machines that perform physical work. This is perfectly in line with what has already been discovered. See, what you have right now is, you have a state of technology, which is a reflection of the collective consciousness and the collective consciousness does not really fully accept the existence of another realm. That is why as we have said humankind has become a closed circle, a closed system subject to the second law of thermodynamics. That is why the technology you have today, the energy sources you have today, you think that the only way to provide energy is to either burn some kind of fuel, or split the atom, and free the energy that is already in the material realm. But this is simply a certain mindset that is based on an incomplete understanding of how the world works. As I said, quantum physics has already proven that the world is created by energy from another realm, and therefore, there is naturally much more energy in that realm and it is a matter of raising our view of the world, our understanding of the world, raising the collective consciousness until we can grasp what that other realm is like, and therefore be able to receive the technology that can make use of the energy that is there. \r<br>It may be not so constructive to talk about free energy, but it is free in a sense that there is no cost, there is nothing that needs to be burned or consumed in the material realm in order to harness this energy and therefore, we might call it a different name and many different names could be suggested.", "comment_date": "2020-06-10T13:26:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Karl Anthony", "comment_text": "This feels like chopping someone\u2019s legs of and then asking them is it their leg that hurts.", "comment_date": "2020-05-10T18:04:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adil Lagar", "comment_text": "the light is showing shadow, it doesn&#39;t make it, imo the shadow is a sort of energy or &#39;aura &#39; of things", "comment_date": "2020-05-01T22:32:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hydrocarbon", "comment_text": "This sounds very platonic", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T16:29:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bhargava Varanasi", "comment_text": "If a particle exhibits shadow then it would be covered by the diffracted light produced by other particle or the same particle thus shadows are not noticable...am I right @minutephysics ?", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T14:00:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eklavya Goyal", "comment_text": "Why don&#39;t photons have mass?", "comment_date": "2020-04-04T21:05:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rajeev TCO", "comment_text": "Light is not a moving photon or wave,. its just the instant of creation of space.. it is the creation of space and expansion of space that we call light.", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T05:28:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sternberg Jean", "comment_text": "But statistically, we receive about as many high energy photons which have been deviated by microwave photons than we &quot;lose&quot; by deviation of others, so in the end it&#39;s as there was never any shadowing ...?

It&#39;s like (a+b)^2=a^2+b^2+2ab, but the quantity 2ab is oscillating billions of times every second around 0, so in the time avarage it doesn&#39;t count.
