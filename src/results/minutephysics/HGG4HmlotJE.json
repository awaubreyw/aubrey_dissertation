He deconstructs complex concepts in Physics because naturally, some are difficult to visualize in our perception of reality. This video is posted as a sort of implicit slap against beliefs outside of science, and yet, there is a type of hypocrisy in doing so while believing in science just as blindly or implying that science is always correct.<br><br>For example, you can argue against quantum physics, relativity, and everything with the same argument used here against religion: &quot;if I can&#39;t see it, it doesn&#39;t exist.&quot; In the same way, where Physics explains a change in energy during nuclear beta decay as an antineutrino, religion can explain it as an act of God. People solely arguing in favor of religion could claim that Physics simply makes up arbitrary concepts, particles, constants, forces, laws, and other observations as it goes, without an absolute, consistent process or explanation for doing so. People arguing solely in favor of Physics will claim that religion is merely a collection of stories that is easily disproven today by our observations of the natural world. That age-old question: who is right?<br><br>Unless you&#39;re a hardcore Solipsist, it&#39;s pretty safe to say that the universe will continue to exist regardless of what explanation we give for its origin and if we all agree on that explanation. I&#39;m not personally arguing for either, because I think there are better things to argue. However, it is worth it to point out biases or fallacies in how we justify our explanations.<br><br>This minutephysics video suffered from a bit of Confirmation Bias in the argument that just because what we seem to find is explained by Physics that EVERYTHING we could possibly find could be explained by Physics. Much like when education was dominated by religious beliefs, we believe that what we currently know is true regardless of our history of constantly being incorrect about our explanations of the world around us.<br><br>People who believe blindly one way or another will continue to bicker over the debate of religion versus science without addressing the real issue of how we justify or validate what we &quot;know&quot;. With both, there are valid ways to prove and disprove them, and the ones that we find most reasonable or appealing, we choose. The problem occurs when people think we have to choose to believe one or another, especially when they are not even educated on either one. At that point, both sides are trusting in religion or science to dictate their beliefs. Instead of exploring those explanations for themselves, people are taking others&#39; mere words for absolute truth.<br><br>This is one of the primary arguments against religion, but it occurs extremely often with science as well. In general, there is always danger believing in absolute truth, because we often forget that just because something is proven by our scientific method, it&#39;s true. We&#39;ve been wrong many many times, precisely because there is no secret &quot;answer sheet&quot; to the meaning of the universe, and just because a claim is preceded by &quot;in a recent scientific study, scientists have found...&quot; doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s true, or that it can&#39;t be disproven. <br><br>Contrary to what minutephysics implies, there&#39;s no absolute assurance that any formula that we can come up with will always work (Newtonian mechanics, gravity at a small enough level) even within the realm of what we can prove. Similarly, our beliefs in religion don&#39;t outright equate to truth within the frame our lifetimes.<br><br>My problem with this video is the favoritism and lack of objectivity. I very much enjoy learning from this channel without the underlying agenda of having to pick science other any beliefs I may have. If this channel was meant to be purely informative, this predicament shouldn&#39;t be something to be addressed by this video or implied by other videos.

Religion will die out, though it will take several generations for some particular ones. You don&#39;t have to believe this, really. Do your own homework and draw your own conclusions. In this universe, everyone is free to think for themselves! I do not concern myself over other peoples&#39; beliefs, and none of you should either. You cannot easily change someone&#39;s faith, because faith by its definition is an irrational choice that people make with evidence that&#39;s basically &quot;good enough&quot; for them. Those people may think that they &quot;feel something&quot;, or believe that is has helped them throughout life in some way or another. Whether or not this sensation can be quantified and explained realistically (with our current technology let&#39;s say), is irrelevant to people who choose to have this kind of faith. So arguing against faith is a completely pointless and fruitless thing to do. Furthermore, it will certainly cause 99.99% of &quot;believers&quot; to go on the defensive. So don&#39;t poke the bear. Any bear. Not just a religious one. :)<br><br>Psychologically, the other critically important thing is - the degree to which humans are able to be convinced of something that has no tangible matter, is fantastic. That is to say, they can be convinced of something for 100.00% certainty, and in many cases will defend those beliefs with their lives. This is actually just another area of human psychology, and it&#39;s not limited to religion. It applies to many situations. People in North Korea have the same degree of &quot;undying faith&quot; in their ideas of reality as many religious extremists, for instance. There are many much milder examples too in everyday life. All humans are flawed. Welcome to humans 101.<br><br>Before you try to argue against religion guys, try to consider the following:<br>-Things that are obvious to you may certainly not be obvious to others. Your arguments carry a lot of assumptions with them, which are in fact not shared with the people you&#39;re trying to convince.<br>-People who believe in something strongly, aren&#39;t looking to be proven wrong. Think about it. But they ARE looking to shut down any perceived hatred directed at that which they believe (wouldn&#39;t you, purely instinctively?). There is no outcome, in which the other people will just say &quot;Oh ok, I see everything clearly now.&quot; Sounds stupid right? Because it is. It&#39;s not that simple.<br>-People who believe in something strongly, may have a totally different conception of the world. The things which you &quot;assume&quot; to be completely true, such as the earth being around, and the air being breathable can be directly compared to let&#39;s say religious tenets which those people have accepted with an equal degree of belief, and on which their entire worldview is built. Get it? You&#39;re not going to have any luck arguing because of that degree of conviction that underlies their entire mentality. Think about it, is it easy to say 1 sentence to some random person, and change their entire conception of life and existence? Of course it&#39;s not. Such mental changes take YEARS, not the few minutes that people spend reading long youtube comments such as this one.<br><br>Anti-religious sentiments will get you nowhere with very religious people. In most cases, you have neither the brainpower nor the detailed knowledge of those (or any) religions, which is required at minimum to argue effectively. Don&#39;t waste your time and do something more productive. You&#39;ll be much happier as a result.<br><br>As a final point - don&#39;t we all have something that may be important to us, but is in fact completely unimportant to other people? Would you like to have the right to choose which aspects of life are important to you? Or would you like to be forced to only accept some &quot;standard issue&quot; government-enforced sets of beliefs? Freedom of religion falls into this category. Yes, there are times when religious extremism causes big problems for others, but that is simply the kind of human insanity we&#39;ve always had on this planet. World War 2 didn&#39;t happen so long ago, and it wiped out 60+ million people. War may be war, but each of us is born alone, dies alone, and is personally responsible for all actions that we undertake. &quot;But the general told me to do it&quot; isn&#39;t good enough. You cannot justify that with basic logic without making and accepting a huge number of assumptions - just like with religion. Wiping out religion will not wipe out crazy people.

However, we are very prone to mistakes in the field of science. Look at all the theories that have been thrown out the door because they were later proven to be inaccurate. And soon enough, our current theories will be thrown out the door too. That&#39;s how science works.

But anyways, Of course there are certain rules that govern the existence of universe but it ain&#39;t all numeric. It is the universal language though, so are humans all language?

To me, mathematical properties include being prime, being divisible by three, and being odd. Having unit negative electric charge isn&#39;t a mathematical property just because it can be quantified. If the latter is all he means by mathematical properties, then his thesis is much less radical; it just means all properties are quantitative properties.<br>This video is very vague about what a mathematical property is. It sounds as though only the value of the property is being considered in describing a mathematical property. By that definition, any property whatsoever would have a mathematical property associated with it, e.g. number of hairs on a sheep. You could use something like this to push Platonic realism, but I think very little overall is accomplished in the video.<br>The video&#39;s presented idea seems vacuous, because it doesn&#39;t truly explain what they think sets a mathematical universe apart from a non-mathematical universe. They try to tell the wider audience that a theory is only mathematical if it&#39;s formulated in terms of small integers or fractions like \u00bd, which is just a confusing lie of the type that Minute Physics is normally debunking.<br>That&#39;s really the fundamental flaw in most every &quot;fluff&quot; paper I&#39;ve read by Tegmark. He basically does the same thing that a lot of arm-chair philosophers do; he presents an idea in colloquial language, using some words that are very loaded (eg, mathematical, information, integrated, structure) to appeal to our common sense, without rigorously defining his terms, and then makes (in my opinion the flaw in his argument) a really big jump to some math that the layperson can&#39;t understand, as if that could replace a proper semantic definition. Classic proof by intimidation. It&#39;s like if the Principia gave an intuitive treatise on &quot;motion&quot; and then immediately jumped to the Lagrangian formalism with no derivation and no statement of Newton&#39;s Laws as if that proved something.<br>I read a critique of his recent paper on consciousness, which pointed out that if you reread the paper, but replaced the terms &quot;information&quot; and &quot;integrated&quot; etc, which we all understand pretty intuitively, with meaningless strings of characters, it&#39;s pretty much impossible to see where the math arises from. Basically, he needs to state &quot;Tegmark&#39;s laws&quot; in a concise, exact form, without ambiguity, before these papers will be anything more than fluff.<br>Isn&#39;t mathematics merely a descriptor?

Statistics works with arbitrary things that apparently model the real world, and do so fairly well, but these things aren&#39;t derived from reality. Rather, they are a number of interesting numerical properties of functions defined from real numbers to [0,1] which follow certain laws (which I will not go into in detail here).<br><br>Importantly, there fundamentally is no way to tell whether the statistics actually maps to reality or not. You can&#39;t even say &quot;it is likely so&quot; because you are appealing to statistics- again a set of mathematics which may or may not have a real bearing on the world. As such, you need more than mathematics to model the real actual universe. You need to make an assumption that a link is there.

And imagine we used long, boring, unpractical sentences to describe the world in a logical analytical construct that was english. If we discovered something new, we&#39;d invent a new word for it. Now imagine over time this way of analyzing the world catches up to what we can now can know with math. Then we&#39;d call the world &quot;all English - because if we discover something new - we can either explain it with English or expand it and explain it with expanded English&quot;.<br><br>I know the difference between the tool we use (math) and the world might be philosophical but I think if we accept sloppy answers to trivial questions like these we might also unknowingly accept sloppy answers to something nontrivial that we just don&#39;t notice.", "comment_date": "2014-05-26T15:28:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Meme Town", "comment_text": "Math is just a language that we use to discribe stuff.", "comment_date": "2014-05-26T15:28:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A.
