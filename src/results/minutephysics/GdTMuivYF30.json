(which is commonly only atributed to entropy by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics). <br>But if instead the standard Drag Force:<br>F=b*(x&#39;)^2 <br>is used, the diff. eq. becomes time reversible, but its solution are never decaying!... so it is needed to modify the Drag Force in something like:<br>F=b*x&#39;*|x&#39;|<br>to recover the decaying solutions, so somehow, the condition of been non-time reversible is required!<br>But even with this improved drag force, solutions are never-ending in time, since the diff. eq. holds uniqueness of solutions due Picard-Lindel\u00f6f theorem... but, if I change the Drag Force by something like:<br>F=b*sign(x&#39;)*sqrt(|x&#39;|)*(1+|x&#39;|^(3/2))<br>which resembles Stokes&#39; Law at low speeds (non-near-zero), also resembles the quadratic version at high speeds, but introduce a non-Lipschitz component at zero speed, now the differential equation:<br>x&#39;&#39;+b*sign(x&#39;)*sqrt(|x&#39;|)*(1+|x&#39;|^(3/2))+a*sin(x)=0<br>will be having decaying solutions that will achieve a finite extinction time t=T&lt; infinity (so x(t)=0 exactly after t&gt;T), also with a diff. eq. is not-time-reversible.
