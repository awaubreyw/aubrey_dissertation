My driving instructor told me that during my driving lessons and we pretty much argue because I was saying that it doesn&#39;t matter if you crash into another car (of the same mass) or into a brick wall. But how do we prove this? I justify this to myself like this: 1) in the first situation, the energy equals the kinetic energy of the 1st car plus the kinetic energy of the second (which is the same, because of the same speed the cars have). Now after the crash the energy has to stay the same as before the crash. So the two cars after the crash actually exchange energy, that is why both cars get crumbled. 2) In the second situation, the energy equals only to the kinetic energy of the car (as the wall doesn&#39;t move =&gt; no kinetic energy). So, just like the first situation, the energy has to be the same before and after the crash. when the car crashes into the wall and provided the wall doesn&#39;t get destroyed, the energy gets mirrored back to the car. If the car crashes into the wall with double the speed the energy that is returned to it would be 4 times more, so the damage to the car would be way even bigger.", "comment_date": "2016-02-01T00:27:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uzair Saqib", "comment_text": "Can anyone please tell me which software can I use for making simple animations like these please ?", "comment_date": "2016-01-30T09:32:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fr0sTy", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9ML4GA47Rg&amp;t=0m32s\">0:32</a> <b>i dont think those are spoons................</b>", "comment_date": "2016-01-29T01:47:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Allen Natian", "comment_text": "Well hold on there not all cars run on petrol.

Older cars were better in some areas because their design wasn&#39;t bound to the same rules (seatbelts, airbags, A pillars, aerodynamics, fuel economy and horsepower) meaning they could have much prettier interiors, beautiful steering wheels, better vision because of thin A pillars, and a much more expressive styling than cars of today since aerodynamics were very seldom seriously studied like today to improve mileage, which is the main reason cars today tend to look very similar in each cathegory. Also, much more roadfeel and much more fun to drive.
