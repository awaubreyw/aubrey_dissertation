Indeed, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Therefore, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. Moreover, objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. (Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.) E=mc2 IS F=ma. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. (Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper understanding of physics/physical experience. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. SO, time is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. Thoughts are invisible. THINK. NOW, the INTEGRATED EXTENSIVENESS of THOUGHT (AND description) is improved in the truly superior mind. INDEED, the ability of THOUGHT to describe OR reconfigure sensory experience is ULTIMATELY dependent upon the extent to which THOUGHT IS SIMILAR TO sensory experience. I have explained the fourth spatial dimension, as E=mc2 IS F=ma; as this then also explains the significance of c4. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. It is proven. Again, BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Great !!!<br><br>E=mc2 IS F=ma. Very carefully consider what is the Moon. I have explained perpetual motion. The planets are not falling in what is &quot;curved&quot; &quot;SPACE&quot; in relation to what is the Sun. SO, a given PLANET sweeps out equal areas in equal times; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Consider the man who is standing on what is the Earth/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. OVERLAY WHAT IS THE EYE in BALANCED RELATION to/with what is the Earth. E=mc2 IS F=ma. LOOK at what is the translucent, semi-spherical, AND BLUE sky. The Earth is ALSO blue ! Great. It is ALL CLEARLY proven. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.

Without a relevant calibration curve it is not possible to draw any conclusions from a measured detector signal to the strength of an alleged gravitational wave.

They state in their discovery paper: <br><br><br><br><br><br>&quot;The detector output is calibrated in strain by measuring its response to test mass motion induced by photon pressure from a modulated calibration laser beam . ... the detector response to gravitational waves is tested by injecting simulated waveforms with the calibration laser.&quot; <br><br><br><br><br>Not only have they never published the required calibration curve, professor Karsten Danzmann of the Vigo Team confessed to Dr. Wolfgang Engelhardt (retired, of the Max Planck Institute), that the required<br><br>calibration curve does not exist [see 1,2,3,4]. For months Danzmann stalled. Only after he found himself potentially before a German court of law to provide the calibration data according to German law, did he confess that the necessary calibration curve does not exist.
