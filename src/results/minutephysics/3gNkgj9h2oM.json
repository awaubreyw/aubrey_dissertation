A subject traveling concurrent to the prior trajectory at 100 mph via untethered commute should by theory double the reduction of travel per hour stacked. Meaning 1st hour 100 mph. 2nd hour 200 mph 3rd hour 400,....800...by the 5th hour the speed should be 1600. In all honesty, it may be a squared number but then that&#39;s to scary. Let me ask another question....a bat swing at 75 mph hit a ball incoming at 75 mph what is the impact speed suggested if compared to a wall.? What rate of speed?", "comment_date": "2021-02-27T07:26:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "cymba729", "comment_text": "and winds flow west are they going against a current that is roughly 1000 mph?", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T10:17:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cymba729", "comment_text": "So when we have wind storms at a 100mph, The wind storm is actually gong 1100 mph. lol.", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T10:16:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cymba729", "comment_text": "that didnt make any sense", "comment_date": "2021-02-19T10:14:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Rajbar", "comment_text": "So how high up does the air still rotate with the earth&#39;s spin...?", "comment_date": "2021-02-10T05:56:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zaghani", "comment_text": "Air and clouds are fluid.flows in different directions.depending on temperature charges.not following earth rotation..Earth is stationary", "comment_date": "2021-01-15T03:25:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ton-v montana", "comment_text": "Earth is Not round", "comment_date": "2021-01-13T23:08:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Luc Borner", "comment_text": "The first statement in this video is actually wrong.

Please help me!<br><br>The earth spins at a 1000 mph only at the equator because there the circumference is 24000 miles(:24hr). The circumference gets less and less untill it&#39;s basically 0 at either pole. A helicopter hovering at the equator would make a 24000 mile loop in a day while it would not make any kind of movement while hovering above the pole except off course the motions of flying around the sun and simultaneously around a black hole at speeds i cannot imagine. Just ignore these last 2 motions for convenience since they are constant and we don&#39;t notice them anyway. <br><br>U could say it would have to automatically make a pirouette above the pole though because if it doesn&#39;t automatically align to the earth the world would actually spin beneath the helicopter :P And yes I understand that flying an actual helicopter requires constant manual adjustment. This thought experiment exists on a world without wind with a perfectly balanced state of the art helicopter with unlimited fuel.<br><br>Say this helicopter were to fly from the equator straight over the pole to the other side of the planet . At take off it is going 1000 mph sideways along with the planet. Then this speed would have to decrease untill 0 mph because the circumference gets smaller as it flies toward the pole. After flying over the pole the speed would increase again but.. not only that! The direction at which it goes along with the earth actually changes to the opposite after flying over the pole. <br><br><br>The helicopter went from a sideways 1000 mph loop toward a 0 mph pirouette and then changed &quot;sideways&quot; direction after crossing over the pole to then accelerate to 1000 mph again untill it&#39;s destination on the other side of the planet. Besides this it went from a 90 degree angle to 0 and back again. For the helicopter &quot;down&quot; is always the center of the earth and regardless of it&#39;s own speed, direction and location the earth always seems stationary. Seen from space however it has to make all these movements to stay aligned with the earth.<br><br>Objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. This makes sense to me. What I don&#39;t understand is how <br>the speed relative to the earth gets automatically adjusted. According to Newton&#39;s law there has to be some force acting upon the helicopter so it can stay alligned with the earth. If there were no force acting on the helicopter it would keep going sideways at a 1000mph and after just a couple miles toward the pole the allignment would be broken and the helicopter would literally start moving sideways(relative to the earth) as well as forward. I know air friction is not the answer because that would be deadly. Gravity also doesn&#39;t answer my question. <br><br>So in short: <br>-How does the speed at which flying machines move along with the earth get automatically adjusted in relation to their position along the meridian?<br>-How is it possible that we don&#39;t feel the change in speed?<br>-How can a helicopter hover above the pole without seeing the earth beneath it spin? What makes it allign with the earth so the earth seems motionless?<br><br>If you&#39;ve made it this far I thank you for reading. I would love some respectfull answers to these questions burning on my mind. I have believed the earth is spherical all my life but I can&#39;t wrap my head around this! In fact I never even thought about it until I heard a believer of the flat earth mention it.<br><br>To those who don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m asking here I say : <br><br>If someone decides to smack u with the end of a broomstick. Would you rather he made the same movement with a stick of 10 cm(0.33 feet) or 100 cm(3.33 feet)? <br><br>The earth is a sphere. It spins around its axis. From the axis to the outside of the sphere is the &quot;radius&quot;. The radius is longest in the middle of the sphere. From the middle to the top and bottom(poles) the radius gets smaller and smaller. If u measure the sphere in the middle u get the length of the equator. If u measure it at any point at a 90 degree angle to the axis u get the circumference. The radius and circumference are directly related to each other. Because the earth revolves around it&#39;s axis once every 24 hours the time is set however the radius and circumference are variables. The longer the circumference the more distance is travelled in these 24 hours and so we get the 1000 mph at the equator of 24000 miles. The closer you get to the poles the smaller the circumference which means that the speed at which u move along with the earth gets lower and lower untill u are at 0mph at the pole.", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T10:04:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Henry Loeser", "comment_text": "Then why do video feeds from rockets show the earth rotating below?", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T10:55:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tik tok mirchi", "comment_text": "\uc720\ud29c\ube0c \uc544\uc774\ub3cc\ub2ee\uc740 \uaf34 \ucd1d\uc54c\u314c\u0142\ube44\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4\uae38\ub798 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac00\ubd24\ub354\ub2c8 \uc61b\ub0a0 \uc804\uc5ec\uce5c\uc774 \ubc971\ubc29\ud558\ub354\ub77c...", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T13:39:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Black Gawds", "comment_text": "\ucd1d\uc54c\u314c\u0142\ube44\uad11\uace0 \ubcf4\ub2e4\uac00 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac14\ub294\ub370 \uc640 \uc5ec\uc790 \ubd841\uc218\ud558\ub294\uac70 \uc9c0\ub9ac\ub354\ub77c \ub3c8\uc548\ub0b4\uace0 \ubd24\ub294\ub370 \uca50\ub2e4...", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T13:39:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "# let's Innovate", "comment_text": "\uc0ac\ucd0c\ud615\uc774 \ucd1d\uc54c\ud2f0\u3142\u0142 \ubcf4\uae38\ub798 \ub098\ub3c4 \ubd24\uc5c8\ub294\ub370 \uc640 \uc9c4\uc9dc \uc88b\uae34\ud558\ub354\ub77c...", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T13:39:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RAHANUM CHOWDHURY", "comment_text": "\ucd1d\uc54c\ud2f0\u3142\u0142\ub294 \ub300\ud559 \ub2e4\ub2c8\uba74\uc11c \ud63c\uc790 \ubcf4\uae30\ub3c4 \uc88b\uace0 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubb34\uc5c7\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc5ec\ucea0\ub4e4 \uc139\uc2dc\ud558\ub2e4", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T13:39:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Talya \u062a\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627", "comment_text": "\uc778\uc0dd\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc12f \uae00\uc790\ub9cc \uae30\uc5b5\ud558\uba74 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ucd1d\uc54c\u314c\u0142\ube44", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T13:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mia katrin", "comment_text": "\ubbff\uace0 \uc815\ub9d0 \ucd1d\uc54c\u314c\u0142\ube44 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac14\ub294\ub370 \u3139\u3147 \uac1c\uca54\ub354\ub77c \ud2b9\ud788 \ubc24\uc5d0 \uc5ec\ucea0\ub4e4 \ub2e4\ubc97\ub294\ub370 \uaf41\uc73c\ub85c", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T13:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "look it", "comment_text": "\ub313\uae00 \ubcf4\uace0 \ucd1d\uc54c\ud2f0\u3142\u0140 \uc798 \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac14\uc2b5\ub2c8\ub2e4. \ub108\ubb34 \ud589\ubcf5\ud588\uc5b4\uc694", "comment_date": "2020-12-05T13:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AHMAD PAZIL MD ISA", "comment_text": "If earth is moving, so how come plane can go to any destination with slower speed than earth, does plane need to be faster, and why dont just wait in the sky and wait for earth to move<br><br>If earth is moving, how come the bird also need to move and birds need to fly faster than the earth<br><br>How about the satelite, are satelite also moves like earth, does satelitte just there dont move", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T16:19:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ayaw hilabti ako youtube account", "comment_text": "NASA.

The atmosphere spins with the earth, which explains why going east and west is relative, but the Coriolis effect makes flying in a proposed straight line, north or south, impossible on a rotating earth. At the equator, the earth (and atmosphere) spins 1000 mph, but halfway to the pole, the earth (and atmosphere) only spins at 500 mph. As demonstrated on a merry go round, objects should miss the target to the right in the northern hemisphere. Why do so many pilots say the Coriolis effect only effects the wind. This is false. Pilots should have to make obvious corrections for this change flying north and south (and northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest). Do pilots not know this? My only guess is that the majority of flights are autopilot and the pilots don\u2019t know what is going on and on manual flights they use a compass and constantly steer to the left (in the northern hemisphere) to offset the Coriolis effect. I\u2019ve also watched school physics videos (saying the opposite) showing the Coriolis effect marking planes fly left in northern hemisphere.

If we reach the point of traveling 1000 miles per hour according to this guy who clearly has a PHD but sounds like he is 19, states we would be going 1000 miles per hour minus 1000 miles per hour, IE 0 miles per hour, that means we would literally be standing still, and the reverse is also true in the statement when going the other direction going 100 miles per hour + 1000 miles per hour, is simply not true, this also hits a paradox when you hit 1000 miles per hour + 1000 miles per hour, then you would be shooting around the earth against gravity, the sheer of it and your airplane would be ripped apart, but this doesn&#39;t happen.<br><br>Needless to say this nineteen twenty something kid making this video, has zero clue what he is talking about and likely read it some where online and threw together this cute little illustration and wanted to sound smart on the internet.

To create a stable orbit around the earth, we have to speed up perpendicularly to its center of mass, in order to counteract it&#39;s gravity. The more speed you have, the larger your orbit gets. Inversely, the slower you go, the more you will feel the effects of gravity and fall back to earth. So to summarize, a plane that ads up more perpendicular speed by going east (let say about 1100 mph) will be under <i>less</i> gravity pull than a plane going west (say 900 mph).

If we stick to the image explained, we need to assume the air as a relative to earth non-moving medium in which the plane travels.
