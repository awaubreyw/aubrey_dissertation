Furthermore, any point on a given longitude will reach relative highest noon at the same moment, so the viewer&#39;s latitude i.e. the narrowness of the slice they&#39;re in is irrelevant isn&#39;t it?

For observers on the Earth, the Sun appears to move eastward along a path relative to the background stars called the ecliptic; this path is due to the Earth&#39;s orbit around the Sun. 2. The Sun appears to move eastward along this path, partially counteracting the Sun&#39;s apparent westward motion due to the Earth&#39;s rotation and making the day take longer. 3. At noon during the solstices, the Sun appears to move exactly eastward along the ecliptic, maximally counteracting the westward motion and making the day take the longest. 4. At any other time of year, the Sun&#39;s motion along the ecliptic is not only eastward, but slightly diagonally up or down in the sky as well. 5. This up-down motion means that there is less eastward motion available to take away from the westward motion of the Sun. 6. During the equinoxes, the ecliptic is the most tilted at noon compared to any other time of the year, which means that there is the least amount of eastward motion available to counteract the westward motion of the Sun, making the the day the shortest.<br><br>Viewed from the Sun: during the solstices, the rotational movement of the sunlit portions of Earth is antiparallel to the orbital motion of the Earth, while at any other time of year, the motion is at an angle and counteracts the orbital movement less.", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T07:40:58Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Video Starts At", "comment_text": "Science bitch.", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T07:39:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mladen Mili\u0107", "comment_text": "It is Milankovi\u0107, not Milankovitch. \u0106 is read &#39;ch&#39; in word &#39;chesse&#39; , and it is slightly softer than regular &#39;ch&#39; .", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T07:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sketchy Noob", "comment_text": "my childhood geography classes were a lie!!!", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T07:09:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fanta fan", "comment_text": "lol what ?", "comment_date": "2015-12-23T07:03:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "GUY HILLIS", "comment_text": "Cool.
