The link is an IP address which means they may not have registered a domain name for it.The ~ that comes before what looks like his username to his backend is a short cut that tells Apache where the files are located. Also if you want to see who owns that ip just do a whois lookup on it which I will post a link to. Another thing, they are using wordpress and from it looks like they simply made an email page look like a login, think of it as a disguised contact me page, whatever you type in the boxes it will send whoever an email from the server. The bad part about these sites is they cant stop emails from being sent to themselves so I made a javascript bot that continually clicks login over and over so they should have somewhere around 10,000 emails but the server most likely stuck them all in the mail queue.

And the victim will keep trying to login but nothing will happen. because the page isn&#39;t made to log you on. just saves what&#39;s entered. The best possible thing for you to do when you figure out is to quickly change your password then log out which will automatically kick the other person out.. It will literally be a race to see who can do it first.<br>the best thing to avoid and save yourself from being a victim of this is to better fortify your account with security questions and etc. read and pay attention to detail. first being youtube never asks for your pass or none of that crap via email. they always say it up front. second, If you&#39;re already logged into Gmail, you don&#39;t have to re-login for no reason, Gmail doesn&#39;t kick you out, unless you didn&#39;t check the &quot;always signed in&quot; box. either way, you shouldn&#39;t have to spontaneously log in again.", "comment_date": "2014-05-09T08:12:55Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Ali Syed", "comment_text": "LOL it&#39;s so easy to create a phishing attack, i though everyone knows about it. you can even hack facebook, tweeter and gmail accounts with it.

Also notice the way in which it has been written, sometime s the email can be strangely informal.

Probably nothing with your youtube account information. It&#39;s easy to mess with someone&#39;s youtube account, but it&#39;s much harder to actually profit from it, since most youtube accounts aren&#39;t monetized, and don&#39;t have anything of value.<br><br>My experience with World of Warcraft definitely showed me what usually happens with these attacks. The passwords are sold in bulk to people who actually want to use them. THOSE people tend to use these passwords to break into other accounts, because people tend to use their email password for everything.<br><br>In world of warcraft, these passwords were used to hack into people&#39;s accounts so that those accounts could be stripped of all their belongings and maybe even used to farm gold with bots. Everything would be transferred to another compromised account, which would then sell the gold to other players. If any of these accounts were caught by Blizzard security, they would be shut down, but because there were a multitude of such accounts, a few account closures wouldn&#39;t hurt anything.<br><br>In this case, I don&#39;t know what the purpose is. Compromised accounts could be used to spread spam. They could also give access to other accounts like facebook. Someone&#39;s facebook account could then be used by a program to generate clicks that are paid for by other users of facebook who need likes or views... or by advertisers who want money from facebook which they get through clicks.<br><br>Even scarier is the possibility that someone&#39;s paypal and bank accounts could be compromised. This is less likely since it carries <b>much</b> steeper penalties and can even involve investigation by government agencies. However, the possibility does exist.<br><br>Bottom line: every account you care about needs to have a different password. If it&#39;s just a forum, it can be ok, but not your email and NOT your financial accounts.
