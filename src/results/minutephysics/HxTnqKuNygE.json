And then even more puzzling, why photons of visible light are considered low entropy in comparison to photons of infrared light which are considered to be even higher in entropy.<br><br>I think maybe I understand why this is when considering the hydrogen nuclei\u2019s relation to the photons of visible light. The hydrogen nuclei are very orderly compared to the light in the sense that the energy within the H nuclei can be fairly easily stored almost like a battery. Whereas the light will certainly be more disorderly as it bounces all over the place and can\u2019t be stored or contained in one spot. But why is the infrared light considered higher in entropy/disorder than the visible light? That I have a significantly harder time grasping and trying to justify that claim to myself.<br><br>If anyone has things they could add or say to help me understand all of this better I would appreciate your help and effort in explaining.

What somebody ultimately considers to be &quot;living life&quot; is absolutely subjective. For some it means being successful, maybe for the other one starting a family. From the objective view of nature, we have only one reason to exist, and this is existence itself. By having made it to a real existence in the universe as a species of human, we have already accomplished the ultimate goal. We are only an intermediate step, a link in the  evolutionary chain. With our existence, no goal has been reached, but in the further development, Say: In the creation of something new is the meaning of all life. At least that is what we can observe so far. We probably never know what life is all about, as we are part of this system. We are the goldfish in a fishbowl for which the world outside the fishbowl is unknown. In addition a beautiful parable of Franz Kafka: Where the philosopher catches the roundabout, he suddenly becomes part of the system and manipulates it at the same time. <br><br> We humans are a complex system with a sense of self that has evolved through evolution from an interplay of order and chaos that is accidentally perceived on planet Earth. The theory of evolution describes how the interplay of chance and order takes place in nature. Randomness is created by mutations, and order by selection. Nature does not steer towards a given goal, but develops itself further and further, and in the further development, ie in the creation of something new, the meaning lies. What comes out in the end is altogether random, even if chance plays a short role only in certain moments. Our existence fulfills the purpose of representing a high degree of complexity and possibly representing an intermediate step on the development to an even greater complexity. Perhaps there will be no more humanity in a few million years, but then beings will liven up the Earth, which have emerged from man, but which are far superior to us. With our existence, no predestined goal has been reached, but in our existence lies the meaning of being a link in the long chain of development to even more complex beings. The &quot;meaning&quot; of life is in life in and of itself. What one makes individually from the existence during the short lifetime, that is the crucial question, which one must face as a human being. Many people seek refuge in a phantom world of gods, religions, spirituality, which helps them to cope with life more easily.

Simple physics and chemistry, but done over so many times it seems complex to us. If the idea that life started via chemical reactions in primordial soups is true, then life didn&#39;t start for a reason - Therefore it can&#39;t HAVE a reason. Perhaps, on an unimaginably complex scale, every thought and action we do creates a chemical reaction in our brains that causes another to happen, but so many are happening at once and in such rapid succession, that it SEEMS like we have free will.<br>Take this for example: Someone asks you if you want Cereal A or B. It seems like you have a choice, but due to some minor differences in the order of neurons in your brain, perhaps, just maybe, the signals sent into your brain by your sensory organs picking up the question trigger a complex series of signals, that were predetermined to cause you to respond with Cereal B. It SEEMS like you had a choice, but maybe you didn&#39;t? And maybe, because I watched this video, the signals sent into my brain caused an incomprehensibly long series of firing neurons that made me type out this theory.<br>Then we ask the question if, if all free will isn&#39;t real and it&#39;s all just cause-and-effect on a scale too great for us to imagine, is this theory even real? Or just the result of neurons firing in predetermined directions? Which would create a paradox; That being, if the theory is false, we do have free will. But if it&#39;s true, then this theory is false.<br>Perhaps I&#39;m thinking too deep, but just ponder for a minute if everything, evolution, your birth, and your decisions up until now were already set. What if our brains are just wired to act a certain way to certain stimuli? I mean, energy can&#39;t just MOVE on it&#39;s OWN, can it? That would be the only way real free will could work, right? Choice just doesn&#39;t exist in our universe, according to literally everything we&#39;ve learned.

This is also probably the case with other worlds harboring life. Therefore, to say that the purpose of life is to increase the entropy sounds grossly exaggerated. If that were true, then it is a terribly slow and inefficient way to do this, whereas stars that can do the job much better already exist, and are being formed continuously.

That&#39;s the end result, but not the goal.   In the examples of tree absorbing energy from the sun and other life forms absorbing energy from the ocean thermal vents, entropy would have increased much more efficiently by not involving life.  Let the sunlight strike bare rock and be re-radiated back into space.  Let the thermal vent energy dissipate into the ocean and ultimately radiated to space.    In both cases, life serves to slow down the rate at which entropy increases.   If I dump water on top of a mountain (high energy state), it&#39;ll flow to the ocean at the bottom (lowest energy, highest entropy).    Life is like a series of reservoirs on the way down, which temporarily store that energy and find a way to do work with it.   The end result may be all the water at the lowest energy state and highest entropy, but life made it happen as slowly as possible.", "comment_date": "2016-10-26T17:34:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Catherine Elizabeth Halsey", "comment_text": "Yes!

Nothing in itself has any purpose at all. The fact that life contribute to overall entropy says nothing about the purpose of life. Only intentional designs have a purpose, not the results of the laws of physics. One can even argue, that what we call &quot;causality&quot; is also intentional category (due to space and time not being completely objective categories) , however it would be difficult to understand universe without this model.

The meaning or point of something is the positive value it adds. A car exists toward the purpose of moving people and things around more quickly than walking. On planets where there have never been people or things people care about, cars will generally tend to not exist--even accidentally... On planets where there are people or things people care about (Mars rovers for instance), something to fill that purpose is reasonably likely at a density proportionate to the density of people or things people care about.<br><br>The meaning of life, if such a thing isn&#39;t an easy to articulate incoherent thought (along the same lines as the concept three-sided rectangles, but harder to recognize absurdity in) has to take a similar form.

We can describe a lot of the mechanics of how life works and how it is fueled, but it&#39;s hard to imagine what the destination we are driving toward might be, and all the more so when we can&#39;t actually be sure we are making a coherent thought by asking the question of life&#39;s meaning in the first place. <br><br>I like Aristotle&#39;s take on the purpose for human life--to learn and know things, and appreciate beauty.
