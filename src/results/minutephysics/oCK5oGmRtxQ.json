For example, I have seen many which state directly that the observable universe is a sphere. Ok, then how can the universe in its entirety be flat? Also, as in this video, the speaker stated that in a closed universe, were we to plot a triangle, the lines would curve and the angles add up to more than 180 degrees. BUT THAT IS TRUE ONLY if the triangle were drawn on the surface/outer periphery of a closed universe. Within the observable universe, why would it not plot out to appear as if flat and the angles only add up to 180? Are we to believe that the space/time is curved by the presence of the mass of all the existents in a closed universe BUT NOT a flat one? He himself stated that space/time is curved in all of the possible universes. So if the triangle would plot the same, why are we to gather that the universe is flat? Are there not galaxies and typical matter distributed throughout space/the observable universe even within the sphere we are told it forms? When we look out at the sky in all directions, i.e., 360 degrees, do we not see the same sight, galaxies in every direction? So what do they actually mean by a flat universe? If it is 3 dimensional, would this not mean it was expanding in only two? If we were to consider otherwise, i.e., that the universe is expanding in three dimensions, just at a greater rate in two, this is still a closed universe, just possessive of an odd shape. Does anyone understand this that he could explain it in more &quot;mechanical/physical&quot; terms? Thanks.", "comment_date": "2021-02-27T15:16:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P.

What we really need is the reference points taken FROM other celestial bodies that are far away (not just their position, but also their perspective) to calculate a stellar triangulation on a grand scale.  The notes taken from two distinctly different places in the cosmos would be akin to two great mathmaticians from two different fields coming together to compare their respective works<br><br>And third, there seems to be some indication that things can operate in an &#39;as below, so above&#39; and vice versa pattern in the universe.  The things that happen or exist in our universe do so on the simple basis that that seems to be the most efficient way for them to happen, given the energy and materials involved.  So, bubbles, planets, stars, and all things rounded are so because this is the best they&#39;re ever going to get.  If we accept that Event One was an act which caused all matter and energy to expand to its current state from a singlular locus, then with gravitational forces being what they are and celestial forms ending up mainly the way that they are, we could conclude that the expanding area which makes up our universe is rounded in roughly the same manner that our planets and bubbles are.  Nothing restricted the flow of the Big Bang that we can really conceive of, so it is reasonable to accept that the blast was roughly potato in nature and continued to be so.  This is only my theory, of course, taken from observations and alot of free time.  See, as far as I can tell, while planets do rings around a star because the star is only rotating one direction, the thing is that it&#39;s still not all flat, just that the spin causes orbits to be the way they are.  Go to the North or South Pole and look at what is objectively &#39;up&#39; and &#39;down&#39; in the universe.  If you still see stars, then the plane in which the universe operates is still basically 3D.  This is just how the universe has flung it out from the middle point.  We&#39;re still far too tiny and isolated to appreciate the curve from where we stand, which is at the edge of a galaxy that may be nowhere near where the universe began.  I imagine, though, that from that center-point, you could see that each direction has as many stars falling away from it as every other, give or take some astronomical events.  As we are now, though, we are as fleas trying to perceive the whole of Earth.

Assuming time is only a construct of the mind. This would mean that all of &#39;time&#39; is happening instantly. If, within this universe, there was the any possibility of life sentient or not, then it would exist as first the pure energy that is holding the superposition, as that. The moment in which that energy interacts with itself, be it observation, or movement, it just started a chain reaction, where the Superposition collapses, and the faster than light particle abosorbes this energy and begins moving backwards through time to the time of its creation, at the same time matter the other half of this energy pair releases energy into being, slowing it down just below the speed of light, giving it mass. And that mass goes and interacts with another one and since it&#39;s traveling just below light speed, it releases a TON of energy, and begins expanding into the infinite, slowly losing more and more heat over time, till it eventually collapses the entire superposition. Where something real crazy happens, the particle that was created at the beginning of this universe, pops into existence, releasing the initial energy added to it into the void that is everything now, but to slow down from FTL travel to back down to lightspeed takes as infinitely much energy as it does to accelerate to lightspeed from no velocity. This causes a similar explosion, the the first, except the energy is flowing backwards to the beginning (it&#39;s not necessarily have to return the energy the same as it released, it just has to interact with all of the matter that no longer has energy, adding the same energy back in, that was initially released, adding energy infinitely, until all the matter returns to light, and the moment the last matter turns back to light, the FTL particle returns to lightspeed where time collapses, it rejoins the other half of the pair, in the timeless superposition, at the beginning and end of the universe Causing a universe that will never die, nor exist, have no total mass when calculating the entire thing, and all life, matter, and existence would be one connected by the same energy and this energy would hold the knowledge of all things that are possible. This energy would (to the life it in which it is) have every experience of the life in it.  But it will never disappear. And to those who don&#39;t know they&#39;re made of this energy, would view themselves as separate from it, thinking it created them.

If I understand correctly the only way to change that mass amount would be by either tweaking the difference between matter and antimatter at the time of the big bang; which too probably averages out at 1:1 meaning probably a largely empty and thereby irrelevant universe, so what matters are the more probable distributions around the 1:1 ratio which are similar in probability to one another. We can probably safely assume that more extreme density mass at the time of the big bang will always mean more energy playing into the expansion force of the new universe and thereby more mass that could potentially contribute towards a curved universe incidentally would also make the universe bigger. Now as far as I am concerned the expansion force of the universe deplets across time teaching at some point an end at which it can be definitely determined what the curvature of a universe is. All in all I would say probability plays towards either a slightly or non curved universe and the only real coincidence in ours happens to be the fact that no one considered our ongoing expansion and extrapolated the final curvature of our universe (It should be said though that chances are it doesn&#39;t suddenly turn into a potatoe\ud83d\ude09)", "comment_date": "2018-06-06T09:16:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azeez", "comment_text": "As the space is expanding, making the matter more diluted over time.

Based on this, I think the best visualization of space-time in 3 dimensions is a torus. Since space-time is 4-dimensional and consists of 3 space and 1 time dimension, it basically means that if the universe is spherical (which would be logical if it expanded from a single point), it has to be spherical in all 4 dimensions. We can&#39;t see bodies in 4 dimensions, but 4-dimensional bodies have projections in 3 dimensions, just like 3-dimensional bodies have projections in 2 dimensions and so on (For example, the 2d-projection of a sphere is a circle). 3d-projections of 4d-bodies are called Hyperbodies, the projection of a 4d-sphere is therefore called a &quot;Hypersphere&quot; and mathematically it so happens to look similar to a torus (some error included). This torus-shape would also explain why we can&#39;t determine the center of the universe or where it expands from, because that point would be the radial center of the torus, which is outside of the body itself.<br>Bear in mind, this is all my personal hypothesis. I can&#39;t remember where i first heard about hyperspheres, but I believe it connects very well to the theory of a hyperbolic universe, where the hyperbole is so heavily bent by its own gravity, that it closes in all three planes and becomes a torus.<br>Like, imagine you take a square sheet of cloth and connect two and two corners together, so it forms a tube and then connect the two ends of the tube into a ring, you&#39;ll notice, that you bent a flat sheet until all four corners touched and it became a torus.

Every atom that your body is made up of has existed on earth since it&#39;s creation, unless you&#39;ve got a couple carbon atoms from the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs in you.

This part is in astronomy/cosmology called the&quot; local universe&quot; and has a diameter of roughly 92 billion light years (yeah, thats more than two times 13,8 billion light years, due to the Guth Inflation). Nobody knows how big the universe (so everything) really is. We see just a part of it and don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just a tiny part of it or practically all. If we assume that the size of the universe is much larger than the size of our local universe, than this automatically means that our local  universe must appear to be pretty flat to us, simply for geometrical reasons. An example: take a blown up ballon. Obviously this entity is strongly positively curved, right ?  But if you just look at a tiny part of it&#39;s surface, than this part will appear to be pretty flat and not curved at all, although the balloon is obviously not flat at all. The bigger the balloon the flatter it will appear when just looking at a small part of it&#39;s surface. This means the measured curvature depends on the length over which curvature is measured and high the ratio of this length to the circumference is.  Although I here use a 2D analogy, this is of course also generally valid for curved spacetime.<br>BTW: the error of margin when measuring the flatness of out local universe from the cosmic background radiation was around ~3%. This means if the overall universe would be just 33 times bigger, than out local universe is, it would appear that flat to us,  not matter what the real curvature of the universe would truly be.", "comment_date": "2017-07-21T02:19:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Seabert", "comment_text": "How do you measure the distance of things that aren&#39;t there when the measurement is taken.

It creates an impression that if you add matter to the universe (increase density) it will become positively curved while taking matter away will make it negatively curved (which is not the same as less curved, btw, contrary to what you say). In reality, the critical density is defined in terms of the Hubble parameter. If you add matter to a flat universe the energy density will increase, but so will the Hubble parameter (by Friedmann equation). So the ratio of density to the Hubble, which is the measure of flatness, would be unchanged.

One point to clarify: in general relativity, the phenomenon of gravitation itself isn&#39;t really the result of space curving, but of time curving. One can show that the geodesic equation applied to a Minkowski metric containing only a small perturbation to the time-component leads to that perturbation being the Newtonian gravitational potential, i.e. the Schwarzschild metric. In other words, the overwhelming contribution to the gravitational field we experience in Newtonian-like systems (slowly moving, not too massive) is due to the time-like component of the metric deviating from flatness. The spatial curvature only shows up in minute details like gravitational waves or the geodetic effect, unless the curvature is large such as in a lensing cluster or near a black hole. I stress this point so because it is an easy topic of confusion when trying to understand relativity and why it explains so much. Most people forget the importance of space-time being four-dimensional in relativity, and the paradigm shift from space and time being static to being players in the game of physics.
