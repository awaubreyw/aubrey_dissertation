I think people are just confusing right-handedness with  the horizontal (left-right) direction. This is the heart of the problem. But left- or right-handedness is agnostic to directions (left-right, up-down directions).

Like for example in this video your left hand appears to be your right hand in the mirror. A really enlighting experiment can be done by making a little dot or mark in one side of your face (which you would know if it&#39;s left or right) and then watching a mirror and seeing where the mark appears to be in your reflected image (it will be on the opposite side).<br>I guess the explanation is exactly the same. A light beam casted towards the mirror at 90\u2070 will bounce at the same angle (straight) so you&#39;ll see your right eye in front of your right eye, your left eye in fron of your left eye which means in the image created in the mirror it would appear as if your left eye is your right eye and your right eye is left eye which we could legit call it a flipped image so we could say mirros actually &quot;flip images&quot;.<br>Am I wrong? \ud83e\udd14<br>If I&#39;m not I guess it would be cool to make a video explaining the difference just to clarify it or at least explain this phenomenon as an isolated phenomenon.
