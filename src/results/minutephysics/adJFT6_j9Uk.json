Every puzzle was intended to be completely different than the last and using some sort of clever mechanism that the player had to, of course, figure out. They were all timed so that you had to KNOW what to do before doing it, but failure to accomplish the task before the timer ran out gave the player no consequence but to restart.<br><br>Some people who played them claimed that the time aspect was too difficult for some puzzles, so I remade all 8 with various modifications to fit inside of a 7x7x3 space where each corner was a puzzle. The exits lined up with the entrance of the next puzzle, so it was like doing one after the other.
