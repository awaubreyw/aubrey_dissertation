I said I know baby, call your mother and tell her. So she did and her mother says, umm little lady, go to your room and I want you to think how you made your father feel. She starts to get up and my wife can NOT even talk at this point. I just said baby we are playing with you. Lmao!!! I said baby you spent all that money to dye your hair blonde. How much money did it cost you to have you brain swapped with a blonde? With this dead look on her face, she says I didn&#39;t spend any money for that, why did you ask me that? My son that was supposed to be doing his homework in the corner busted out laughing and then my wife and I started laughing. This is probably the moment when it went a little to far. Oh my baby girl was so mad that she was almost crying. I said baby let me make it up to you. She HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THAT NOW DAD!!!  How about you take the car to the mall and you can spend $200 on whatever you want!!!  Now I had been teaching her how to drive for a year at this point but never alone. She said awe dad thank you so much. I said ok baby, go get my wallet off my night stand. She takes off and my wife says I can NOT believe you. You going to let her take your car to the mall with a credit card!!!! I said oh hell no. I&#39;m just trying to see how many things I can make her fall for. Lol. She came back in to the room and says, I know what I&#39;m getting. I said yeah baby, you are getting a serious prank done to you right now!!!

You can&#39;t shout at a rock falling and say it&#39;s wrong for not going up, and in fact if it DOES go up, you need to figure out why.  There are a number of statements and such that have a decided flaw.  How so?  Well...<br><br>Find someone who is mathmetically-inclined and ask them about Square-Cube Law.  If they&#39;ve looked into it, ask them about the creation of giant robots, like a Mobile Suit from Gundam or a Veritech from Macross/Robotech or whatever.  The nice ones will discuss it normally.  The anal ones will say it&#39;s impossible because the Square-Cube Law would make it too heavy to move or operate or the ground to hold it up or some shit like that.  I&#39;ve heard all this before.  The problem with those people is that they&#39;re assuming some sort of constant in the object or that you can&#39;t simply make something stronger and that it&#39;s just impossible when they can&#39;t really test it, and they&#39;re wrong.<br><br>The first flaw is that when people design and build something, they can decide on the materials and the construction to overcome physical limitations.  We didn&#39;t use to fly, but birds do.  Now, there are these huge jets that move people across the world.  Giant mobile vehicles on legs are possible, just that the construction is difficult, like all new things.  Fortunately, the better and more glaring flaw in Square-Cube Law and the people who cling to it so tightly is that they forget the past: Prehistoric Earth.  Dinosaurs roamed the land, alive and in all shapes and sizes.  They lived, they moved, they acted, and they did so with great gusto.  Frankly, the study of dinosaurs would make the easiest template for a giant robot to follow.  It&#39;s an already-existing giant body that functioned on land.  Much like studying why birds work, studying why dinosaurs worked can allow us to create...well...basically, Zoids.  It&#39;s a start.  Humanoids will follow.<br><br>Still, this is why knowledge must grow and change.

The first principle he talks about is \u0394G, or Gibbs Free Energy, in regards to \u0394S, entropy, and \u0394T, temperature in kelvin. None of these terms need to be defined for me to describe what he\u2019s talking about. Basically, things in nature tend to occur spontaneously, that is, they occur without needing energy to occur. For instance, Wet metal sitting in the sun will undergo a chemical reaction automatically \u279d rust. This is spontaneous. In regards to the raindrop, he\u2019s stating that nature constructs raindrop size in a way that, mathematically, should require energy to do so. However, nature constructs their size spontaneously which means zero energy is needed. <br><br>2. The discussion about the radius of the raindrop and the math variables to determine the size was just a set of proofs for why principle in number 1 should not occur. Forget the graphs and the x variables. All he\u2019s saying is, the amount of energy needed from nature to construct these raindrops a certain size is proportional to the radius cubed. For instance, if we had a rain drop with a radius of 5 millimeters, then the energy to construct its volume can be calculated by doing 5^3. For those who are unsure what this means, it\u2019s 5 x 5 x 5 = 125. Now, anything raised to the 3rd power is giving us volume because 3 dimensions of Space are needed to get a volume. A length, a width, a thickness. For the most part. 3 dimensions means ^3. However, if we take away a dimension, say thickness, then we only raise the radius to the 2nd power. So this will be 5^2, or 5 x 5 = 25. The number decreasing from 125 to 25 makes perfect sense in regards to energy required. Smaller number means smaller size which means smaller energy needed. BUT, this concept gets completely flipped on its head when you consider objects with a radius less than 1, like 0.5 millimeters for instance. According to the physics in regards to energy consumption, the math needed to answer this question is done the exact same way... 0.5^3  would be the volume (3 dimensions) and 0.5^2 would be the surface area only (2 dimensions). Well what happens when you cube and square 0.5? <br><br>0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.125   :5^3<br>0.5 x 0.5           = 0.25.    :5^2 <br><br>This is showing just the opposite. The number that corresponds to the energy required to make the 3dimensional object is SMALLER than the energy required to make the 2dimensional object. <br><br>To paint an analogy that illustrates this contraction, that\u2019s like a store charging $5 to buy a single candy bar yet also charging $1.25 for 4 of the same candy bar.", "comment_date": "2018-01-02T02:26:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gangsta Mann", "comment_text": "I understood until the word &quot;there&quot;.", "comment_date": "2018-01-01T07:21:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Independent Mind", "comment_text": "This guy challenges the laws of physics by talking faster than light speed.

Yes in a very small drop the surface energy increases faster than the volume energy, but you have to remember that we are not just talking about 1 surface and one volume. We are essentially talking about the destruction of two smaller droplets to form 1 larger one.<br><br>Individual water molecules or very small small clusters of water molecules are in an even higher energy state because they have even fewer bonds per molecule than a small droplet they might join. You move to a lower energy state by teh destruction of those two smaller droplets.<br><br>So essentially instead of\u00a0 the energy change being R^2-R^3 it is\u00a0 more like (for two equal sized drops) R^2-R^3 - 2((R/2^(1/3))^(2)-(R/2^(1/3))^(3))<br><br>Where (R/2^(1/3)) is the radius of a sphere with half the volume.<br><br>This simplifies to.<br><br>(1-2^(1/3)) R^2.<br><br>Which has a maximum at zero and is negative monotonically decreasing for R&gt;0. That is any joining of water cluster to water cluster releases energy.<br><br>I think we see problems with condensation below the dew point, due to the presence of contaminants which act as surfactants and lower the surface energy of smaller droplets. This effectively forms a barrier to disruption of the surface in forming new droplets. It might even be atmosphric gases like oxygen acting as a stabilizing surfactant.<br><br>I don&#39;t\u00a0 think minute physics explantion of high surface areas in small droplets providing more opportunities for water molecules to get knocked off small droplets is correct either. That kind of explanation works frine of the erosion and rounding of pebbles because the loss of material from jagged edges is irreversible. The stone was formed at high temperatures at which teh erosion does not occur.<br><br>The addition and loss of a water molecule or droplet, OTOH is entirely reversable at ambiant temperatures. Each newly formed pathway or degree of freedom for removal of a molecule or droplet corresponds to a pathway for addition of a molecule or water droplet.<br><br>Now think about this.
