But this leads to the problems of how to pay bills, how to obtain food or clothing, how to have a water supply that\u2019s not being monitored, how do you light the interior without having an electronic meter outside or having candles delivered seeing as windows allow others to see in. As a single individual you could go to some very remote area build a cabin grow food or hunt for food make your own clothing from what you grow or hunt find a water source be a hermit. The problem is there\u2019s not enough room for everyone to do that. A better way to start protecting peoples privacy would be to update our Social Security cards from 1820s technology start using smart ships that include information like year of birth so that no one could just take your ID without being The right gender the right age group in the right location and have enough knowledge of family history and other places family may live and work history. The idea that somehow no one can see you know who you are know what your gender is what you like to buy what style clothing you wear and somehow be protected is foolishness the second you step outside of your house you give up your privacy. You are now in public you can be seen you can be heard you can be observed. Our founding fathers had a better understanding of this but some foolish people have decided that no one that I don\u2019t want to know anything about me shouldn\u2019t ever be able to know anything about me and that\u2019s impossible. A good example I\u2019m your brother it\u2019s your birthday you don\u2019t want anyone to know I walk in and say happy birthday bro everyone now knows who is in this area and could hear me or who talks to anyone of those people.
