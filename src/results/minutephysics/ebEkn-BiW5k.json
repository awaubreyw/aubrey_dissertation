Just a bit of a slap in the face, if not a nice subtle way to call them racist too.<br><br>Where did all the money and privilege come from to begin with anyway? From an advanced species of aliens who preferred white people? And why can&#39;t any brown countries seem to duplicate what every white country has even without all the systemic oppression that we&#39;ve been told is the problem here in the west? Is Haiti held back by white privilege too? Or Sub-Saharan Africa? Or just pick any predominately brown country, things aren&#39;t going well in any of them.<br><br>Next explain why democratically controlled cities like in Chicago, still don&#39;t send enough funding to inner city schools when they&#39;re the ones claiming the entire problem hinges on funding? That makes sense. I thought they cared? Then explain why asians no matter their socioeconomic condition still tend to do quite well in school? Perhaps culture plays a role or their different values? Higher standards of personal responsibility and self accountability?<br><br>It&#39;s easier to find solutions that work when you recognize the actual problem. We can start by holding blacks more accountable for poor lifestyle choices. Like having 5 kids with 5 different baby daddies who don&#39;t stick around to help raise those kids, or expecting those black men to raise their own kids, or maybe not committing so much crime would be a good start, or maybe expecting Jamal to finish his homework before he goes out to spend 8 hours working on his jump shot because ending up in the NBA is a terribly unrealistic goal that&#39;s more likely going to continue the cycle of poverty in the black community than not. Just as there can only be so many rappers who make it big. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23NotAll\">#NotAll</a><br><br>It&#39;s called priorities and having realistic expectations and goals. But due to the lefts soft bigotry of low expectations, they don&#39;t exist in the black community. Just a state of perpetual victimhood, endless excuses, and a monolith that votes democrat 95% of the time. Yep I can&#39;t figure out why things never get better in the black community. Will blacks continue to vote democrat at a rate of 95% if their lives suddenly improve and they&#39;re no longer convinced systemic racism is holding them back? Hmmmmm.<br><br>I mean how is it possible that the democratic party is still claiming to be the champions of the black community while problems for blacks not only never get better, but continue to get worse after all these decades? If only this were a clue or something. Is it gross incompetence or intentional? Or maybe a better question is, how does nobody see it? Blacks, still on the liberal plantation, and still convinced it&#39;s the republicans keeping them down.

If you asked me about this paradox now, all I would be able to say is that &quot;it&#39;s a statistical paradox: grouping data in different ways can lead to different conclusions, and that to know how to group the data is a matter of interpretation&quot;, which isn&#39;t as enlightening as it could be. For instance, is there a formal definition or criterion for recognizing it? I wiki&#39;d the paradox and found that they <b>define</b> it to be in terms of the visual trends you drew at the end, which to me made a lot more sense. Next, I didn&#39;t catch any details about the interpretation. Which interpretation is best? Wiki has opinions on that too.

Stop pretending.

But believe me when I say no one believes you when you claim that the you censored comments on that video because of &quot;uncivil behaviour.&quot; which obviously wouldn&#39;t have been an issue in any of your other videos since <b>NONE</b> of them are about gender politics. It is your actions that determine your desires, and people who desire the belief that they&#39;re right and can&#39;t face whether or not they&#39;re wrong <b>ALWAYS</b> have to censor discourse. They <b>ALWAYS</b> have to invent some ridiculous excuses to explain away why they had to shut people up. And there&#39;s <b>ALWAYS</b> people who can see through your obvious deception and who will point it out to you to why you <b>ALWAYS</b> have to deal with only with two ways. 1. You can admit error and undo your mistakes. 2. You can continue to lie and be deceitful throwing out canned excuses and censoring discourse further doubling down which will only make it worse.<br><br>So you can continue to block comments and delete comments and be dishonest about this doing what I call &quot;The only way out is through&quot; fallacy where you continue to act as if you&#39;re correct no matter what because it&#39;s easier than admitting fault and undoing your mistakes (and nowhere near as rewarding). Or you can QUIT PRETENDING and take some accountability for your actions! I can guarantee you more of your fans will respect you <b>IF</b> you start being honest about this issue!

This is because women are far more likely to apply for humanities and social science degrees than STEM degrees). In the second half of the video, the narrator proceeds to argue (without presenting any evidence), that it&#39;s not the universities that are biased, but rather the entire world that is biased (this effectively deprives women of agency. He implicitly suggests that women who, by their own volition, choose lower-paying humanities degrees are being subconsciously &quot;shunted&quot; to these lower-paying degrees, thus are making choices against their better interests). Towards the end of the video, he throws in a line about &quot;equal pay for equal work,&quot; even though his OWN method of statistical analysis shows that the the &quot;women earn 70 cents on the dollar&quot; narrative is based in faulty reasoning, because it doesn&#39;t account for the fact that many women choose lines of work that pay less (and many women choose to take time off from work to have children). Women and men have equality of opportunity. A greater proportion of men choose STEM careers that pay more. A greater number of women choose &quot;caring&quot; professions like teaching and social work, careers that pay less.

The percentages of 40% and 60% aren&#39;t based on equal weights so the logic is flawed. Assigning equal value to the percentages should be based upon the weights being the same. In this instance, there&#39;s 1 mark in one grid and 4 in another. However, the aggregated percentage is then equivocated to the total marks, which is in essence comparing apples to oranges (if you will) rather than apples to apples. The proper weighting would have 4 marks per grid to ensure equivalence.<br><br>If the percentages are held in equal weight, the above percentage would be 125 / 2 = 62.5 ( % ) and the bottom percentage would be 75 / 2 = 37.5.

So not going there. <br>I&#39;m guessing there is little genetic difference when it comes to intelligence. Not saying there is none, after all human populations have been separated for thousands of years after leaving Africa, to which evolution states that they will develop different from one another. But this is at most a few tens of thousands of years, probably not enough for extreme change. <br>Say in some dystopian world newborns wouldnt see their parents or any other people and be raised by a computer in the same way, then at the same age take an IQ test. The results would likely fit for all races. <br><br>But this difference being purely socioeconomic? Give me a break. Its a question of attitude amongst subcultures I think, when approaching the subject rationally. Speaking in very general and simplified terms of course so no SJW nonsense, the Asian community in the US was very much discriminated against in the old days. The difference is that after a few generations the Asians kicked their kids to school (often literally) while the Black community pretty much stayed put in the ghetto&#39;s. One subculture worked on pushing their way out of the low end of society, while the other did not. One now has high numbers of doctors and academics, the other does not. A matter of attitude and personal motivation. Asian people aren&#39;t less not-white than black or hispanic people are in the eyes of 18th century whites. <br><br>But it&#39;ll likely never be resolved because such racial studies are stricktly taboo so that the only &#39;research&#39; outcomes will be short-sighted and biased SJW nonsense that is poorly researched and manipulates contrasting data, or racist blog posts that are even less researched and just look at simple data with way too many variables in it. A shame, because from a scientific point of view this would be rather interesting if we could only interpret this as purely an evolutionary study without any effect on our daily lives.

There&#39;s a chance that you selected a billionaire with huge assets, and your average will explode, you&#39;ll say the average revenue in America is 2 million dollars a month. Is it invalid though ? The method isn&#39;t incorrect. What you can also do is ask people about their status in society. If a participant is a billionaire, take the proportion of billionaires and weigh their answer accordingly. You will get a much &quot;better&quot; average, still with an equally valid method.<br>You can also divide by state (stratified survey) and in each state you do the same as above. Is it even better ? It&#39;s more accurate. More mathematically valid ? No, just the same.<br>That&#39;s why statistics are a great defense, you can always say that you were just unlucky or that your method was mathematically solid, and it will be true. Texas Vs Wisconsin looks juste like that : you&#39;re not the best anywhere at school, you&#39;re always 2nd or third. So if we look at your results separately, you&#39;re just not the best.

Being white doesn&#39;t make you socio-economically advantaged, and being black or hispanic doesn&#39;t make you disadvantaged. Socio-economic status is not derived from skin color or ethnicity. The #1 correlation for socio-economic advantage in students (both in Wisconsin and Texas) is children who are raised in a home with both their mother AND their father. If you correct for that, the socio-economic status of blacks, whites, hispanics, asians, etc., all end up the same.<br><br>The underlying cause of the Wisconsin-Texas thing is not that there are more &quot;advantaged&quot; students in one state, and disadvantaged students in another state. It&#39;s that in Texas, you have to teach material to students from all kinds of different cultures, opinions, and backgrounds, whereas in Wisconsin, the culture is pretty much homogeneous. When everybody is pretty much the same, and all come from the same background, it&#39;s easier to find teaching methods that make sense to everybody. In Wisconsin, you don&#39;t have to worry about tons of Hispanic students who grew up in a house that didn&#39;t speak English, and therefore has a harder time with tests written in English. <br><br>This is the same reason why nations like Japan have high test scores and seem to have great education systems: because everybody is exactly the same. There&#39;s no diversity of thought, opinion, culture, or background.<br><br>This was written about and studied extensively in the 1990s, but it was widely ignored because it seemed to imply that racial purity increased test scores (which it does).
