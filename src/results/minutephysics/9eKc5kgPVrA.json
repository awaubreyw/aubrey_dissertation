Philosophical redefinitions aside, we have two things:<br><br>A) An unstoppable force<br>B) an immovable object.<br><br>Think about A, now. Any force\u00a0is\u00a0unstoppable in that it carries on - whatever energy the force carries is merely transported from one object to another. If a force does not &#39;move&#39; an object, it will surely raise its temperature. But though this is physically correct, it&#39;s clearly not in the spirit of the question. The question wants us to break our brains in overcoming a paradox. So let&#39;s define an &#39;unstoppable force&#39;, as per the question, as something that will move something else, regardless of the second object&#39;s state, mass or size. Right. Now we have an unstoppable force. In order for such a thing to exist, so that it could move absolutely anything, it will require infinite energy. Bear with me for a second...<br><br>Let&#39;s consider B. An immovable object. That&#39;s to say, something that won&#39;t budge an inch, regardless of whatever force is applied to it. The only thing that would make it unmovable would be infinite mass, in order for it to have infinite inertia. It doesn&#39;t matter how much energy you apply, you will not be able to overcome the inertia of infinite mass. Staying with the spirit of the question, our immovable object won&#39;t collapse upon itself to form the biggest black hole ever. It will just sit there, immovable.<br><br>Now we apply A to B...<br><br>What happens?<br><br>Absolutely sweet-blue nothing. Can&#39;t be done.<br><br>The only way for a &#39;force&#39; (as per the question) to be &#39;unstoppable&#39;, would be for it to have infinite energy. And the only way for an object to be &#39;immovable&#39; would be for it to have infinite mass. Now, we know that mass and energy is the same thing, right? They are interchangeable. Think of mass as &#39;condensated energy&#39;. If there was an unstoppable force, it would require all the energy of the universe. Every last bit of it. That would include all the energy from all the radiation as well as all the mass of the universe. There would be nothing left with which to assemble the immovable object. If you start with the immovable object, it would require all the mass of the universe, plus all the energy from radiation converted to mass. That would leave nothing for the unstoppable force.<br><br>In other words, an immovable object and an unstoppable force would both require every scrap of energy and matter in the universe, and thus would be the same thing.

I&#39;m going to propose that two infinitely massive objects colliding would bounce of each other. Now hear me out:<br><br>The part with F=ma I agree with. If you have a finite force you cannot accelerate the object.<br>However:<br>An infinitely massive object with a velocity will have an infinite kinetic energy. (By E=(1/2)*m*v^2)<br>That means it can do an infinite amount of work. (W=F*d)<br>=&gt; inf = F*d = inf*d; provided d is finite (it&#39;s negligible then).<br>Therefore we can apply an infinite amount of force on an object.<br><br>Now the question is if an infinite amount of force can budge our object(s). (F/m = a =&gt; inf/inf = a)<br>So really the question is what infinity divided by infinity is. This is where I start with Hilbert&#39;s Hotel:<br><br>Hilbert&#39;s Hotel, as I&#39;m sure you know, has infinitely many rooms. So if an infinite amount of guests arrive, we can stuff all in an individual room. Question: Is Hilbert&#39;s Hotel full?<br>Assume we get another infinite amount of guests. We can then tell everyone with a room to double their room number and take this new one as their room. Then we will have a new infinite amount of rooms to fit everyone in.<br>Therefore: Hilbert&#39;s Hotel wasn&#39;t full the first time.<br>This means for every guest there must be more than one room =&gt; inf/inf &gt; 1.<br><br>That&#39;s enough to prove my point, but we can go further.<br>The thing is that this process is infinitely repeatable, meaning I can stuff an infinite amount of infinite guests in there. =&gt; inf/inf = inf<br>(Incidentally we also proved now that inf^2 = inf and therefore that inf^n = inf)<br><br>So after F=ma: inf=inf*a =&gt; inf/inf = a<br>and inf/inf = inf<br>The acceleration is in fact infinite. This even means that the objects should shoot themselves away at an infinite amount of acceleration meaning they will pass the speed of light instantly.<br><br>All this to say, we shouldn&#39;t have infinite mass and not do calculations with infinity in the first place.<br>But it was fun most certainly!<br><br>PS: Thanks for reading, have a good day!", "comment_date": "2021-06-21T18:26:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Accurate Misfire", "comment_text": "God this was stupid", "comment_date": "2021-06-21T15:55:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fugens", "comment_text": "So i guess we have an answer to the Tusk act 4 vs GER arguements", "comment_date": "2021-06-20T13:41:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A White Moustache Raccoon With Glasses", "comment_text": "Too many unnecessary explanations.

The end result is akin to saying that the unstoppable force goes &quot;around&quot; the immovable object, and the exact same thing happen for the immovable object it also goers &quot;around&quot; the unstoppable force, but none of them are actually deformed in any way. Rather, it is the spacetime around them (in fact right at their surface where the collision occurs) that gets so extremely warped out of normal proportions, that for the far observers both seem to pass through each other.<br><br>Probably along with visuals showing that the spacetime near those objects is super extra deformed.

So in the end we don&#39;t talk about large object but actually small objects. Because if the un-acceleratable property comes from the fact that it&#39;s just infinitely large we have several issues. First an infinitely large object requires infinitely amount of space. Apart from that if those objects would collide and they are composed of &quot;normal&quot; atoms, the objects would simply disintegrate and spread the collision energy in all directions.

is immutable?<br><br>How often was the vernacular immutable?<br>Never.<br><br>So, why is it, despite all the countless years, we as humans STILL resist the outside opinion?<br><br>Instead of looking at the the cultures of the past as a purely anthropologic perspective, how many look at the past with the scrutiny of a psychological perspective?<br>What were they thinking?<br>What drove their thoughts, their patterns?<br>What made the people of the time resist information that was ultimately the more correct information?<br><br>Why is it the higher one thinks of themselves, the greater their refusal to admit oversight?<br><br>How many physicists understand human behavioral sciences?<br>How many psychologists understand physics?<br><br>Having worked in medicine, you would be aghast to understand that are scholastic establishments, instead of teaching true understanding of the grasp of concept, have pre-packaged information in segments.<br><br>A Cardiologist, therefore, will be specialized with the Heart, but may not have barely higher than the basic grasp of Neurology.<br>A Pharmacist may understand how all the medicines interact within a patients body, but what do they know about Archeology?<br><br>&quot;But that isn&#39;t their job.&quot;<br><br>Yeah, way to sound like the Brawndo segment of Idiocracy.<br><br>Let me clarify:<br>The understanding of the quanta is the pursuit of understanding the subatomic particles that comprise the atoms that form the chemicals, the same chemicals that formed biological components of which fauna and flora consist of, we, as humans, consist of these same chemicals.<br><br>Just as all that is tied together, so, too, are the functions of all of reality.<br>The pursuit of a unifying theory is misleading, as the Universe is ALREADY unified.<br><br>It is our understanding that does not correlate with reality, not reality that does  not corelate.<br><br>&quot;The universe is weird, janky.&quot;<br>No, the current ideology is janky.<br>It is like long division, parts may be right, but the product is still wrong, so we must go back and revise.<br><br>It is the ideology that needs to be viewed with skepticism and possibly readily dismissed, not the new ideas.<br>Even if the new ideas are WRONG, it allows us to rule out what it isn&#39;t, which therefore reduces the pool of what it actually is.<br><br>Yet, why is it we do not do that?<br>Why is it we must adhere to a fallacious established belief until forced, with humility, to admit something or someone else was right?<br><br>Oh, and wouldn&#39;t the example of Neutrinos passing through matter be a case of an unstoppable force meeting an immovable object, as it just passes through with no sign of intertia?<br> <br>My contention is this historically futile and phyrric adherence we humans exhibit to the established belief of our time.<br>This is literally the epitome of being closed minded.<br>Yet what closed minded person literally helped pioneer the understandings we have today?<br>None.<br>Rather, they were the hurdles that prevented such.<br><br>Just as we look back and think, &quot;Oh, what fools they were&quot;, will the future people not think the same of those unwilling to open the door for new concepts?<br><br>I have a saying, <br>&quot;It is better to give someone the benefit of the doubt or believe they are possibly more capable

They cant change direction and as they get further it would stretch the universe and most likely separate and it would be infinitely shrinking but what happens when it gets smaller than the object it would be breaking the borders they would have to leave the universe which again is the theoretical border of existence, well at least of matter (all of this is to my knowledge of YouTube science/physics videos and 6th and under science class) so would it transform to energy which is also confined to the universe I dont think anything we know of is outside of the universe.

If SA goes at 10kmh and the stoppable moves at 9kmh then MA will move for a slight bit and stop because of friction.  If let&#39;s say there&#39;s no friction or air, like space, Then the 9km from SA will get transferred to MA, And because of this transfer, MA will still not move because I never referred to what exact speed it needs. SA will need 9kmh + the smallest amount of force (at least) to move. SA Will probably transfer lets say 9.1km. Making MA go at 100 meters per hour. Ok, so now the question is here. Let&#39;s say MA needs 10kmh to move and  MA goes at 10kmh, This is really hard to answer because of the math needed. I theorize that MA Will either move or not move. SA Will definitely come to a stop. We have 2 options, MA Either doesn&#39;t move or moves the smallest length possible (1 Planck Length) Or even shorter, As the Planck is a theory and isn&#39;t officially known.

Thus an unstoppable force is an an even larger force, i.e. an infinite force, which cannot be stopped by any finite mass &amp; friction. In F=ma terms, F is infinite. What is the effect of applying an infinite (unstoppable) force to an infinite-mass (immovable) object? F=ma, so infinity = infinity * a, or a = infinity/infinity.

Acceleration can never be 0 because 1/infinity no matter how big infinity is, never actually hits 0. The limit of 1/x as x approaches infinity is 0, but if you see the graph of 1/x, you&#39;ll know that y=0 is an asymptote. So as much as you&#39;d like to approximate, this phenomenon will never mathematically happen because it&#39;s simply impossible for acceleration to ever be 0 no matter how infinite the mass is! Bonus: You can prove 1/infinity is not equal 0 because if you multiply it by infinite, you get 1/ But if you multiply infinity by 0, you get 0! Also, you can prove it by thinking of division conceptually as if you were in elementary school. Think about it ok, dividing something is breaking something into a certain number of pieces. Dividing 1 by infinity is like dividing 1 piece of cake into infinitely small pieces. These pieces, however, still exist. 0 is a sign of non-existence so no matter how much you break these objects into smaller and smaller pieces, they&#39;ll still exist! (Don&#39;t take this cake analogy super seriously, I know you can&#39;t split elementary particles or even strings if you believe in that since that&#39;s what you&#39;ll get to eventually when splitting a cake but nevertheless, it&#39;s something cool to think about conceptually) So to answer the paradox, what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object? We don&#39;t know because, by our laws of physics, that phenomenon can never happen. The greatest mistake any physicist can make is approximating that value of 1/infinity of 1/0 through limits.

You can&#39;t have two contradicting laws/set up to exist in one medium governed by uncontradicting laws. So, in this mathematically illogical case, either the unmovable will overpower the unstoppable, or the unstoppable force  will overpower the unmovable.

Other wise, if you&#39;re speaking metaphysical, or metaphorically, then both outcomes will be satisfied: The unstoppable force won&#39;t be stopped and the unmovable force won&#39;t be moved. How? Easily,  ..the two forces would change the laws of that physical universe, where the unstoppable force simple goes through the unmovable force like two ghosts, one force standing like a ghost and the other force flying unstoppably also like a ghost.  The unmovable object remain unmoved,  and the unstoppable object remains unstoppable.  The last illogical (theoretically scientific) argument is that both outcomes will create two time line in which both laws will happen.  One timeline the unstoppable force will remain untapped. And the other timeline the unmovable force will remain unmoved, creating two di-universes simply to satisfy both contradictions, one universe favors one law, and the other will favor the other law.

The only way that an object can be immovable is if it is of an infinite mass so its size must therefore be infinitely large.\u00a0An unstoppable force must also have infinite momentum. I conclude that the\u00a0unstoppable force\u00a0and the immovable object are the same thing by default as they both occupy everything all at once every where leaving neither the room to exist away from each other in the first place. It would be silly to say the object moves since something of an infinitely large\u00a0size cant have relative movement as it already occupies everywhere at once, there is nowhere to move to. The infinite force means it wont be stopped by the object because by definition it will never end.\u00a0 Also since there cant be anything outside an infinitely large object then there&#39;s nothing for the unstoppable force to be transferred from so it must all exist in the object simultaneously. So I say that an unstoppable force and an immovable object are actually\u00a0a single\u00a0thing being very large and full of energy but never amounting to anything at any point of itself in proportion to the rest of itself. I believe that it is both doing nothing and everything at the same time.<br><br>What is interesting to me to\u00a0think about is an infinitely large object would have an infinite gravitational force, but since an infinitely large object cant have a center then the gravitational force must be spread out between\u00a0each point\u00a0and equal 0\u00a0Gs\u00a0at each point. So infinite gravity is the same thing as no\u00a0gravity at all. This also further proves my\u00a0answer of both the object and the force being the same thing and doing\u00a0both nothing and everything at the same time as\u00a0by default one should know that\u00a0an infinite mass would have infinite gravitational force acting everywhere at the same\u00a0time. The fact that the\u00a0mass must go in every direction\u00a0forever to be infinite in mass means that\u00a0the gravitational force of each point cancels itself out.<br><br>Well its the answer I&#39;ve been going by since tenth grade at least, I&#39;m no expert.", "comment_date": "2017-01-31T02:05:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JayR 5mitty", "comment_text": "Loved!!!", "comment_date": "2017-01-31T02:02:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IncredaGaming", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t the boxs just bounce off in the opposing direction at the same velocity", "comment_date": "2017-01-30T01:45:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Best Paper Towel In Town", "comment_text": "It&#39;s unmovable, not unbreakable, right?", "comment_date": "2017-01-29T18:36:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kerotex", "comment_text": "Superman vs Goku", "comment_date": "2017-01-29T10:51:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pathfinder", "comment_text": "surprised you didn&#39;t bring up the whole &quot;by definition these two objects cannot exist in the same universe&quot; argument but whatever works for you", "comment_date": "2017-01-29T05:41:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jdsantos_02", "comment_text": "so this explains gta 5 trains?", "comment_date": "2017-01-28T11:47:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NicwithnoK", "comment_text": "You know what people mean by immovable object and unstoppable force you don&#39;t have to spend the 1st 2 minutes talking about it", "comment_date": "2017-01-28T10:50:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ric o", "comment_text": "Seventh grade science teacher simply stated, &quot;If there exist an unstoppable force in the entirety of the universe; then it stands to logic that there can not also exist an unmovable object&quot;.

Assuming that both of these items are made up of properties that makes both the object and force physically exposed to one another, and if they where to vary in durability, these options may be possible to occur:<br><br>1). Neither subject matter has an accurately appointed title, therefore &quot; Unstoppable&quot; and &quot;Immovable&quot; does not, and may never, exist .

This would suggest that both bodies would completely destroy each other and all mass would become energy, similar to a matter-antimatter annihilation. The products of an exothermic reaction for example have less net mass than their reactants, and similarly a nuclear reaction produces energy in proportion to a mass defect given by E=mc^2. This situation is also a physical reaction, and should therefore produce heat, sound and light energy. The amount of mass that becomes energy should equal 100% of all the mass that was involved, which was infinite.

Let&#39;s look at the example you gave at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eKc5kgPVrA&amp;t=0m10s\">0:10</a>. <br><br>If the Mt. is the Observer, then the man in the rocket is moving while it is perfectly still; if the man is the Observer, then the Mt. is moving while he is perfectly still. In both of these situations someone is not moving. There is a third situation where they are both moving. However, they must be moving relative to a third party, who is the Observer. No matter what, the observer exists. Now that the mistake is corrected, lets return to the question.<br><br>The Observer is defined as the only object that is immovable. Lets assume that an object of infinite mass is moving toward the Observer and this object cannot pass through the Observer without effecting him. When the object touches the observer, a gravitational field will instantly appear and pull everything in The Universe in the direction opposite to that which the object was moving. This gravitational field will be infinitely strong because it will stop the object of infinite mass. To properly understand how the object can create an universal gravitational field in this manner requires basic knowledge of the Theory of General Relativity, which I do not have.", "comment_date": "2016-06-27T19:55:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harris S", "comment_text": "Couldn&#39;t the two exist in the same universe, just at different times?", "comment_date": "2016-06-27T06:27:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Leetare", "comment_text": "Immovable Object vs. Unstoppable Force?

It&#39;s so dense that a spoonful of it on Earth would weight loads of metric tons. You can only imagine how hard this material is, given its density. It&#39;s so hard that it&#39;s impossible to even imagine. Thus the surface of a neutron star is <i>almost</i> an immovable object.<br><br>On the other hand we have the gravity on the surface of a neutron star. The gravity is so strong that it quite visibly bends light. Any object, or even particle, near the surface will be slammed by gravity onto the surface so hard that it will break into its constituent subatomic particles and fuse into neutrons. While this is of course not &quot;infinite&quot; force, it&#39;s so many orders of magnitude stronger than anything we know that it&#39;s difficult to even visualize.<br><br>Where these two things come into play is when a rotating neutron star slows down due to loss of energy.<br><br>Neutron stars typically rotate very fast (even thousands of revolutions per second). This speed of rotation is so fast, in fact, that neutron stars are not spherical but spheroids. They are just so slightly squeezed so that their equatorial diameter is slightly larger than their polar diameter.<br><br>When the rotation of a neutron star slows down over millions of years, the gravity will start acting more and more strongly on the surface, pushing it to become more spherical. But as said, the star is so incredibly dense that almost no amount of force would be able to do that.<br><br>When the star slows down enough, however, gravity becomes too strong for the surface to withstand, and it gives way, even if so slightly. What happens here is that the entire star rearranges in a slightly more spherical shape in a tiny fraction of a second. Because of the forces involved, and the size of the star, and the speed at which this happens, this event is so energetic that it sends an enormous flash of energy to outer space.

I know minutephysics is running on the logic of how physics mechanically work because he is stuck on the relative but if you were to just take this stuff as literal as possible I could see that happening, because Minute Physics already discounted things like the interaction indifference between electrons and glucons. So imagine like, a perpetual speeding quasar ramming by a mega black hole. The quasar slows down and spins faster, or changes course because it can&#39;t stop, but the immoveable black hole doesn&#39;t have to go anywhere! But that doesn&#39;t even make sense! Black holes don&#39;t bounce things away and quasars are just dense black holes so whats the deal here? they&#39;re both black holes!\u00a0wouldn&#39;t one suck up the other? but what if they were of absolutely equal mass?\u00a0WHAT EVER! its not like that ever really happens anyway.

Oh dear, I seem to have switched the roles of immoveable and unstoppable. Whatever. You guys get what I mean. Anyway, lets say the hammer hits the green, what happens? I think what happens is if its not allowed to stop, it immediately picks the next available path and any part of it that slows down is equally accelerated in another part of proportional value to match the curving as it changes direction, while maintaining the original velocity. So you would end up with a snap of force from its surroundings being disturbed by its unchanging movement. Kinda like throwing a baseball at bullet proof glass, only theres no reduction and the glass doesn&#39;t go blopk~ Or how a rushing flood that can crush cars and people is redirected by a valley of hills.

In this case, we must know what an immovable object is, as well as what an unstoppable force is and make this concepts clear.<br><br>Like this video perfectly explained, an immovable object is an object that no matter what force you apply on it, you will never be able to accelerate it. An unstoppable force on the other hand, is a force that no matter what object it&#39;s applied on, it will always cause it to accelerate. Seems like we have a discrepancy here. By definition, the immovable object cannot be accelerated by this unstoppable force. However, also by definition this unstoppable force will always accelerate the immovable object. This doesn&#39;t make much sense...<br><br>So here&#39;s Asimov&#39;s conclusion:<br><br>A universe in which there exists such a thing as an irresistible force is, by definition, a universe which cannot also contain an immovable object. And a universe which contains an immovable object cannot, by definition, also contain an irresistible force.

That is what I was thinking when I first started writing this... But hold on, if F=ma, and a = 0, then it would have no force at all? If this were the case according to newtons third law (basically: forces come in pairs) any object colliding with it would have no force against it, as \u00a0it (the un-acceleratable object) has no force against the object. So if this is the case, my question is, why does an immovable object with infinite mass moving at a certain speed have no force? OR, does the object have no force, because it is so infinite that no other object in existence is able to counteract the force (newtons third law).
