It is &quot;right&quot; because it is what is called analytic continuation of special functions. As an example, think about the Euler Gamma function. The Gamma function has a series representation (where it is represented as an infinite sum), that within a certain range, converges to a number (for the real part of the argument being greater than zero). It also obeys properties such as the reproductive property (Gamma(x+1)=x*Gamma(x)). Thus, one can analytically continue the Gamma function by simply saying that, if Gamma(x) is defined for Re(x)&gt;0, then, it is also defined for Re(x)&gt;-1, and it is simply given by Gamma(a)=Gamma(a+1)/a, where Re(a+1)&gt;0, etc... The same kind of trick can be used with functions that have a series representation within a domain of convergence, like f(x)=1/(1-x), which can be represented by f(x)=1+x+x^2+x^3+... If one encounters the infinite sum representation of f(x), then, by &quot;recognizing&quot; the series expansion (by proving that within a certain domain, it corresponds to the series expansion of a certain function that it is also defined outside the domain), one can &quot;call&quot; the infinite sum function f(x) as simply f(x)=1/(1-x), and then, one can &quot;evaluate the sum&quot; outside the domain of convergence. Of course, all of this is &quot;wrong&quot; in the sense that, although the underlying function (which in many situations may be unknown) does exist outside the domain of convergence, it is no longer represented by the infinite sum (in the sense that its value cannot simply be approached by summing the terms of the sum in a sequential way). Thus, I would say that the explanation by minute physics is &quot;morally correct&quot;, in the sense that there is such a thing as analytic continuation and it works in precisely this way, but &quot;semantically incorrect&quot; in the sense that the meaning of calling the series representation still a representation of the function even outside the range of convergence is unclear.", "comment_date": "2014-04-25T19:53:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gerardo Mongalo", "comment_text": "that makes sense thnks", "comment_date": "2014-04-16T08:43:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gerardo Mongalo", "comment_text": "Thanks for clearing that up, i was geting a headache trying to figure out what happend", "comment_date": "2014-04-16T08:41:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "daniel satterberg", "comment_text": "I thought the divergent series added to negative one twelfth?", "comment_date": "2014-04-05T05:23:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Hedning1390", "comment_text": "An economics teacher at my university like to write arguments like this: 2+3=5*4=20.

In your video where you prove that there is more numbers between 1-2 then there are integers you prove this point wrong, with your example. The 2 and the -2 don&#39;t line up, the -1 and the 2 line up. It is the first value, and they go together. If you kept adding the series together to attempt to keep your -1 you will find that you always have one more integer from the bottom series. You may have 2 4 8 16 the first 4 numbers of the top series, but the corresponding first 4 numbers of the bottom series is -1,-2,-4,-8. You still get a positive number, and as you continue to add the integers from each series you will find that the new number (x). Follows the formula (x)(2)+1. As you continue to add the series together you will continue to form a larger and larger number, it will continue to grow infinitely. So you are still just saying that this series of infinitely large numbers is equal to those two infinitely large series together.
