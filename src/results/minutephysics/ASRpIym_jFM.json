They are constructed of vortices moving through the spacetime fabric which is an actual physical transparent lattice (dark matter) and we can only measure the energy vortices that are moving in harmony with us. The energy is propagated in constant spherical waves out from every dark matter particle at the Planck acale and from every percieved &quot;particle&quot;. So Noethers Theorem only holds because it is limited to measurement in one dimension of space and one of time. The double slit experiment reveals that energy is propagated out in waves in every direction, the real measurement problem is not that the wave collapses but that we can only measure in one dimension so when we narrow the focus of the measurement parameters when detecting for which way we get twin band marks from single wave crests on the back screen not twin bands from particles. The inequality which proves this is correct is that ALL the waves get through the slits when we detect for which way but only a FEW get through when we don&#39;t detect and we get the interference pattern on the back screen. This is because the parameters of the focus on time have been narrowed from all waves that are detectable between the back screen and the particle gun (hence why some wave crests are hitting the front screen which is also within this range) to all waves that are detected passing through the slits.  This inequality is impossible and incompatible with the SMOPP and one dimensional time. They must be waves and time must be multidimensional at the quantum level. The 1st section in the Theory of Everything that solves, explains and Unifies Everything in physics explains the inequality and how it shows the SMOPP is the wrong interpretation, it should be the standard model of wave, vortex and manifold physics. (The fact this acronym spells SMOWVAMP which is much more melodic and funky than SMOPP should be evidence enough in itself that God the creator of the Universe is funky beyond belief \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude09 and therefore must be true, however luckily the maths and peer reviewed evidence is also there to sway anyone who doubts \ud83d\ude1d).<br>Doubleslitsolution dot weebly dot com/springtimetheory dot html <br><br>All the energy that is not detected escapes in all directions at every moment. To understand why it is not detected imagine releasing a billion rats from a pit in the middle of a playing field and trying to shoot one from above in a helicopter, (I&#39;m fruitarian, the scenario is purely fictional, no rats are harmed in the writing of this comment)  getting locked onto one as they run away in all directions is difficult enough, when focusing on one the rest become a blur, in our consciousness they barely even register. Or in 3 dimensions imagine trying to film a single spark fly out as a firework explodes, the focus would have to be extremely precise and all other sparks would be a blur surrounding the spark that we focus on. Many core concepts are summarised in short videos on my youtube channel. Just click the icon, I think the one on Bells Theorem perhaps covers the basic mistake of why Einstein and everyone else made the mistake of going for the particle model rather than the wave model.", "comment_date": "2021-10-07T09:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dialectical Monist", "comment_text": "Do &quot;particles&quot; like the Higgs Boson have to slow down to change direction?<br><br>If so, does this slowing down, play a part in conferring the property of &quot;mass&quot; upon them?", "comment_date": "2021-05-25T11:45:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brecht Bosteels", "comment_text": "Does that mean that the faster you go the less mass you have i would think not but If I&#39;d follow the reasoning ins this video I do?", "comment_date": "2021-04-16T19:32:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "StJukes", "comment_text": "The fact that we know this is incredible.", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T14:43:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "yuval maharshak", "comment_text": "I want to know if I understand it correctly, the higgs field make as bounce in the speed of light between spaces so we have the illusion of not moving?", "comment_date": "2021-03-01T08:37:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fox", "comment_text": "&quot;... and since only things with mass are allowed to not move our massless particles now have mass&quot; That doesn&#39;t really explain anything as to why it gives mass, especially not how mass is given", "comment_date": "2021-02-16T12:03:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atul Kumar", "comment_text": "Make a channel for dark mode users, I&#39;ve been continuously watching your video at night which causes eye strain", "comment_date": "2021-02-10T18:53:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vipul T", "comment_text": "If particles interact with the Higgs field and like get mass, why is a photon massless.
