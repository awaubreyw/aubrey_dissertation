ERROR: At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pfqIcSydgE&amp;t=1m09s\">1:09</a> ... There is no such thing as &#39;Zero Gravity&#39;. People confuse weightlessness and &#39;zero gravity&#39; up. But they are very different. Gravity permeates every single corner of the Universe. Because gravity is the manifestation of any and all matter. Matter&#39;s existence creates gravity. You don&#39;t notice your own gravity or the gravity from, say, Mt. Everest, because in relation to the gigantic Earth, it&#39;s too insignificant to notice. But gravity doesn&#39;t magically go away. People think astronauts floating in a spacecraft are not experiencing gravity. Wrong. They&#39;re in orbit. So they feel &#39;weightlessness&#39;. It counters the gravitational force of Earth, but only because such astronauts are also hurtling sideways at fantastic speeds (technically called &#39;escape velocity&#39;, or over 17,000 mph) or around the Earth. <br>You know gravity is always present because you can see the Moon. It&#39;s Earth&#39;s companion because it&#39;s stuck within Earth&#39;s gravity well, if you will. The Sun, Mars, Venus, the other planets and stars... they&#39;re all in their own orbits, too. And it&#39;s all because of GRAVITY. <br><br>That said, the further one gets from Earth&#39;s center of mass, the less their gravitational bond will be. But astronauts in Space never are far enough away from Earth to truly escape Earth&#39;s gravity.  For Example: Last week when William Shatner went into &#39;Space&#39;, he was only above an arbitrary line we define as &#39;Space&#39;. But it was barely 60 miles up. At that distance, you&#39;re still feeling 96% of the Earth&#39;s gravity. <br><br>FLAMES IN SPACE: So... A flame in space would not have a circular plume. It would be pointing toward Earth or whatever large celestial body it&#39;s nearest. For a flame to have a circular plume it would have to be in ORBIT. And that&#39;s where all flames in space were filmed: They were all shown while an astronaut was in a spacecraft orbiting Earth. If the flame was alone and not in orbit, and lit, it would have the same plume we see on Earth&#39;s surface, except instead of pointing up, the flame would point down. Down toward Earth&#39;s huge gravitational mass.", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T02:50:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vinod Khobragade", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pfqIcSydgE&amp;t=0m16s\">0:16</a> he literally end up the statement of why fire \ud83d\udd25 lights by using the name QUANTUM MECHANICS \ud83d\ude02(this means that fire is still mysterious and a hard concept\ud83d\udd25)", "comment_date": "2021-07-27T14:28:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "MinutePhysics & MinuteEarth - \u10e5\u10d0\u10e0\u10d7\u10e3\u10da\u10d0\u10d3", "comment_text": "RESPEKT!", "comment_date": "2021-05-14T21:19:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "smart art", "comment_text": "Why doesnt earth&#39;s pull pull the flame downwards?", "comment_date": "2021-03-23T17:41:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "code 913", "comment_text": "How did the graveSTONE at the start spontaneously combust?", "comment_date": "2021-03-02T17:46:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K1r0n m2hm4d", "comment_text": "when we burn something &amp; turn it to ashes, it loses weight.
