Theres no 5th force, there&#39;s only one force, energy!!! free flowing as radiation or caught spinning in vortices as matter (dark energy) the other 3 (gravity, strong force and weak force) are the geometrics of the field dictating the path of energy. Physicists just found more of the mounting evidence that says the current models are wrong, excellent mathematics and predictions but they fail to understand the missing link and the hidden variables, the idea of a 5th force is &quot;spin&quot; trying to make terrible news sound positive in the hope ordinary Joe doesn&#39;t  understand because the muon makes the crisis in science much worse and more complicated, most physicists if they are honest are not &quot;excited&quot; they are very frustrated and saddened by the new findings some even embarrassed because it destroys everything they were sure was right. The truth is much much simpler than any physicists realise, the inequality that solves the double slit experiment is explained in 4 sentences and illustrated in an experiment diagram right at the start of the Theory of Everything that works, it shows that it is always waves travelling through the spacetime fabric/dark matter lattice that is alive and communicates with us. It has Lots of new experiments to further verify the findings. The ToE that unifies Everything into one force, one field, one model, that Unifies Relativity with Quantum Mechanics and physics with metaphysics is linked in every video in my channel. It is here For anyone with the ability to think outside the box and nimble minded enough to rethink everything that they have been taught is fact, that was in 1 dimensional time, in 13 dimensions of spacetime (not as complicated as it sounds) energy is created all the time and the future is unlimited. We can live forever if we are smart and strong enough for love.  <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2-dLxdxlTBA\">https://youtu.be/2-dLxdxlTBA</a><br>It seems physicists want to find new physics but only if they can keep the big bang and standard model of particle physics too but we cant have it both ways, they are wrong, the numbers are clear, the maths don&#39;t lie and this time the maths are so simple that primary children will soon be learning quantum physics, it is so intuitive and simple once put into the model that works, it&#39;s been done. Now we are just waiting for physicists to admit and accept they were wrong and embrace the model that works. I just saw an apt meme, &quot;Don&#39;t hold onto a mistake just because you spent a long time making it.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-04-29T15:27:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sharad nair", "comment_text": "which kind of decay is carried out my muon", "comment_date": "2021-04-18T16:59:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Johnny Cash", "comment_text": "So how did they sustain the muons in the latest g2 experiment?", "comment_date": "2021-04-14T08:45:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azzan Qais AL-Kindy", "comment_text": "Here after the great Muon discovery", "comment_date": "2021-04-07T18:09:51Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "FUG Slayer Nominee", "comment_text": "But how to capture that particular muon?", "comment_date": "2021-03-24T11:53:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sci Cat", "comment_text": "what about the ultradense deuterium (rydberg hydrogen) fusion pathway?", "comment_date": "2021-01-29T13:31:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Krzysztof Lenart", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBr9YiSwdzM&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a> The best thing i heard today.
