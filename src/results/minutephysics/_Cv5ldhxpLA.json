You are forced to play around with the newly introduced concepts, which will then have some level of familiarity once you are in the lecture, rendering it more engaging.<br>2) You go to lecture. The professor spends 5-20 minutes talking about the newly introduced concepts, and then goes through graded problems (answered via online software) where the students are in groups of 3 and have usually around 2 minutes. Again, this forces you to be engaged, and he then explains the problem after everyone submits an answer.<br>3) At some point after each lecture is a discussion class with a TA, where you work in groups doing more graded problems and can ask questions to the TA (the difficulty of the problems usually increases with each step). There are two lectures and two discussions per week (and therefore also two lecture videos preceding each lecture).<br>4) You have a problem set due at the end of the week, which contains longer more complex problems and is formally written up (versus being on the online software). These homeworks are individual, although you can work with friends. <br><br>I learned much more in this course than in my courses that had a traditional format. The &quot;flipped classroom&quot; was far more engaging, and the forced repetition of material helped solidify my understanding of the topics (it was a good amount of work, but no so much that it left me completely burnt out). There was also an online forum where students can ask/discuss questions with teachers as well as other students. This gave the course a comprehensive feel, as there was always a steady discussion going on and you were never limited to a single resource. It didn&#39;t hurt that the professor was very smart, had a good sense of humor and had a good control of the class. I would love to see more universities shift toward this format of teaching.", "comment_date": "2016-12-18T06:56:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NeedsEvidence", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Cv5ldhxpLA&amp;t=39m00s\">39:00</a> Beautiful moment!
