Tuning a piano is not impossible or a science... it&#39;s an art. The fundamental pitch (usually middle C)is achieved using some type of tuner. every not above is slightly sharper and every note below is lightly flatter in equal temperament except the octaves. To achieve the best sound the intervals like fifths fourths and thirds are fine tuned to each other using your ear to discern resonant frequencies called beats when the pitchs clash against each other... octaves are the most tuned to each other so that they produces overtones when one note is struck... and each side string is tuned to the middle string so that the note when struck sustains the frequency of the pitch over a time chosen by the person tuning the piano. No two pianos are exactly the same and each sound produced through tuning is a work of art!", "comment_date": "2021-04-02T13:37:55Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Molo", "comment_text": "Well not like it was rocket science", "comment_date": "2021-04-02T04:47:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clara Sys", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t play piano.

You are confusing &quot;frequency&quot; with &quot;sine wave.&quot; All instruments have different timbres, a function in part of the irregularly distributed overtone amplitudes (as well as the envelope and other parameters.) you are presenting the concept of equal temperament correctly but have botched timbre and the term &quot;sine wave.&quot; And, pianos do NOT produce sine waves. Pianos have complex overtone structures, and the attack envelope of the piano contributes to the piano string timbre. Some acousticians, like myself, consider the clarinet sound to be fairly sinusoidal though it is not actually a pure tone, as in the sine wave, and has increased relative amplitudes on the odd harmonics.

They tend to make the octaves get slightly wider (or &quot;stretched&quot;) as you go up or down from the middle of the keyboard, since this makes the piano sound more in tune.  The extremely low strings, for example, are so thick and stiff that dissonant harmonics sound sufficiently loudly so that has to be taken into account.

There is one point which had me confused on first-watching though, so I&#39;d like to clear it up.<br><br>When you say that you <b>can</b> tune a guitar (as opposed to a piano) by harmonics, I think this is misleading, because it depends on what you mean by tune. I think there is a danger of confusing this as an instrument specific issue, rather than a general mathematical property.<br><br>The fundamental issue that you explained so well is that no equal tempered scale can give both a perfect octave and a perfect fifth (and a fourth etc.). The reason the chromatic scale is so nice is that it does such a good job of <b>approximating</b> those simple harmonics (cf. @3Blue1Brown&#39;s comment and wonderful video). Your piano illustration does a great job of explaining this, but I don&#39;t think there is anything special about the piano here, compared to any other instrument, and the same problem will persist for the guitar, say (assuming you also want it to follow the same equal tempered chromatic scale).<br><br>Indeed, you may proceed to tune your guitar by starting with the low E-string (for example, equalizing it with the E on your piano) then equalizing the 4th harmonic on that E-string with the 3rd harmonic on the A-string (cf <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hqm0dYKUx4&amp;t=1m40s\">1:40</a>). That will give you a perfect fourth, but now your A string is no longer actually an A (according to the definition of the equally tempered chromatic scale, at least). To see this, all you have to do is compare it with the A on your piano! They will be out of phase, because of the very issue you just described for the piano!<br><br>Again, let me stress, this is an awesome video, and I learned a lot.

Uncle Joe taught Dad how to tune pianos about 1970 and Dad said it was the most difficult thing he had ever studied. Later in that decade, Dad taught me how to tune pianos. <br><br>Did you ever mop a floor? If you used only one bucket of water, the part of the floor you mopped last was only as clean as the dirty water, right? <br><br>Learning to temper the scale (so the piano would sound equally good in any key) was challenging but tuning a piano is similar to mopping that floor. Pianos are made partly of metal and mostly of wood. If the average pitch of the piano is significantly below standard pitch (A-440 = C-523.3) - which was the case for many of the pianos I tuned in people\u2019s homes - tuning the hundreds of strings actually compresses the piano frame. If you start by tuning one string of each note of an octave near the middle of the piano and then tune the other hundreds of strings, the first strings that were tuned are then below the pitch to which they were first tuned. (The same thing happens when tuning a violin that is badly out of tune.)<br><br>If you go dump out the dirty water and get clean water in your bucket and mop the floor a second time, the floor will be cleaner than it was when you finished mopping it the first time. But if the water is even slightly dirty after the second mopping, the part of the floor you mopped last is still slightly dirty. How many times should you repeat the process?<br><br>Same with tuning a neglected piano that is measurably below standard pitch before you begin. If you tune it twice, it will be closer to standard pitch than if you tune it only once. <br><br>You might think, why not raise the pitch on the first tuning a specific percentage of a semitone so the average pitch will be very close to standard pitch before you begin tuning the piano a second time?<br><br>Problem: Different pianos - even different models from a given manufacturer - have different coefficients of compression of their frames as tension is added.<br><br>Of the various things I have done - printing, managing a factory, etc. - piano tuning was the thing (for which I was paid) that I liked the most and did the longest but, by 2007, I couldn\u2019t hear the pitch of the highest treble notes well enough so, when my wife and I moved away from where our son lived, I gave him my piano tuning tools to keep as keepsakes. <br><br>If anyone is interested in the \u201ctheology in a piano\u201d, let me know.", "comment_date": "2020-09-29T22:28:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Henry Green", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hqm0dYKUx4&amp;t=3m25s\">3:25</a>...Yikes...

And you can&#39;t tune with harmonics because it has so many different strings (Not 4 like a violin), and the octave will always be off if you attempt to tune with harmonics (ie, tune based on perfect fifths being a ratio of 3/2, etc) which is the way we tune other instruments.

In reality, every material and instrument has its own properties that effects the numbers displayed in this video. Piano tuners realize that every single piano has different string tensions and specific required adjustments to take proper tunings.

If the instrument, e.g. a harpsichord, is only required to play in a more limited range of keys, a temperament best suited to that range of keys is used, e.g. Valotti. A harpsichord can be tuned to satisfy the tonality of the limited range of keys, and is therefore more &#39;perfectly&#39; tuned than an equal temperament piano would be for that range of keys, but the harpsichord would sound more &#39;out-of-tune&#39; than a equal temperament piano in the more obscure keys.

I\u2019m here to tell you Henry is spot-on correct.<br><br>We are a dying breed us aural piano tuners.  I can argue that there are fewer than 2,000 people on the planet today that truly know how to tune a concert piano by ear.  Every single one of us is in demand like never before due to software.  Software tuning is getting very good compared to what it once was, but all professional piano tuning software STILL must pIt itself against an aural judge before it is released.  Aural piano tuning is a learned skill that requires years of practice- no matter how \u201cperfect\u201d you think your pitch is. <br><br>I\u2019m going to make several statements below about western tuning in general, and then some specific statements  about the  industry of piano tuning itself.  Stay with me:<br><br>1) It is not possible to tune all 12 notes of the western scale simultaneously. (That\u2019s the point of Henry\u2019s video)<br><br>2) The history of Western composition itself is deeply rooted in the limitations of 12 notes being in tune.  Until recently, composers simply avoided the out of tune notes.  Right up until the late Baroque.  Check out Chant to hear what 800 years of music sounded like before Josquin des Prez and the Renaissance.<br><br>3) IMPORTANT!  All instruments of the (professional) modern orchestra or choir constantly alter pitch flat or sharp as they perform so as to be in tune at any given moment.  They talk and teach amongst themselves as to how to be in tune when they play any interval at any moment.  This is the price of 12 note equal temperament. It\u2019s the reason why skilled youth orchestras are always out of tune.  Position and embouchure are only learned with experience.  And don\u2019t you dare argue me percussion section that has some pitched bells and stuff.  Those instruments are out of tune and it\u2019s not your fault.<br><br>4) Pianos are a unique exception from #3.  Pianos are the ONLY instrument in the orchestra who\u2019s pitch is fixed.  As a pianist, you are stuck with the notes the tuner gives you and that\u2019s it.  You can\u2019t alter pitch as a pianist.  Everybody else can.<br><br>5) Pianos are almost impossible to a physicist.  High notes are played by small instruments such as the piccolo for a reason.  Low notes are played by big instruments such as a bass.  Here the problem:  <br>\u201cI want one instrument that plays higher that a piccolo and lower than any bass at the same time.  Plus everything in the middle must also be in tune always.\u201d <br><br>6) Pianos have an incredible disadvantage that most instruments don\u2019t.  It\u2019s called Inharmonicity. Henry didn\u2019t delve here in this video, but it\u2019s only because he must limit his scope of a short video.<br><br>7) Pianos are never, ever, EVER, tuned by pitch.  That\u2019s the barrier to you musicians that think you know how to tune.  Whether or not you tune pianos by ear or software, you simply don\u2019t care about the fundamental (note).  You only match coincident partials and forget about the note. Always.<br><br>8). There is no such thing as a perfectly tuned piano for all scenarios.<br>I am called in to tune the same piano 4 days in a row because a solo piano tuning is different that a chamber tuning that is different from a pop recording that is different from jazz.

Then of course modern pianos are usually tuned to even temperament which  has two notes that are very far from true or &quot;just&quot; intonation..(the perfect third and perfect fifth in particular are bent to fit the scale of equal intervals that allows for unlimited modulation). It is possible to use a compromise intonation like Bach&#39;s &quot;mean tone&quot; (often used in pipe organs) but that only allows a certain number of keys to be played in, as modulating too far away from the home keys creates unacceptable dissonance.", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T23:14:56Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "ImmaChiaotzu1", "comment_text": "But can you tune a fish?", "comment_date": "2018-12-03T22:32:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James", "comment_text": "insert tuna jokes", "comment_date": "2018-12-03T11:17:19Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Bekiteru", "comment_text": "Well with all the numbers and equations/unequations? <br> I believe ya", "comment_date": "2018-12-02T10:28:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "foster scoot", "comment_text": "your voice sounds.. too... many HIGHS.. .. saliva sounds.. and makes me don&#39;t want to watch your video.. don&#39;t like this Kind of videos only for that.. have it in mind.", "comment_date": "2018-11-30T07:49:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BruhMomentHD R", "comment_text": "me, an intellectual: why piano tuners are a scam", "comment_date": "2018-11-30T07:03:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nils B17", "comment_text": "What is the Name of the Song at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hqm0dYKUx4&amp;t=1m14s\">1:14</a>.

Because otherwise you would have the same problem, having to re-tune the guitar if you wanted to play in a different key. The guitar is permanently tuned to equal temperament via its the fret placement - when you tune a guitar you are merely adjusting the fundamental note of each string, so that the guitar is in tune with itself. The number of strings has nothing to do with; it&#39;s a problem of instruments with fixed-pitches vs instruments where the pitch can be slightly adjusted through technique/intonation well playing (fretless stringed instruments, for example). Even then, you might end up with slight tuning errors when playing open strings. On a guitar, equal temperament also allows for the moving of chords and scales around the the fretboard.

But the octave, like all other intervals, must be stretched by a fraction of a cent in the middle of the piano, and by 30 or more cents in the topmost octave more than the C below highest C (for instance).  <br><br>A simple test of Cs in octaves will show that if the piano octaves are not each stretched more and more the higher in the scale we go, then playing high C with middle C will result in the inescapable impression that the high C is flat.  When in fact it may be considerably stretched.  I tune the highest note of the piano 50 cents (a quarter tone!) sharp of its theoretical pitch.  The lower note, the less the stretch needed, because until we get down into the lower bass notes, the inharmonicity, the stiffness that causes upper harmonics to all run very sharp, is not so acute.  But to test a piano for adequate stretch, deliberate distortion from the equally tempered scale that would serve perfectly (for instance, a pipe organ, because a pipe organ has no inharmonicity of stiff strings), play a middle note with, say, three octaves above.  Does the trebled octave sound good?  If so, it is definitely, whether aurally tuned or machine tuned, very much stretched!  IF the highest notes of a piano are insufficiently, &quot;&quot;deliberatelly&quot;&quot; distorted sharp, the arpeggiated chords of the pianist when s/he reaches the highest notes will sound terribly flat: and nothing is worse than being flat when reaching for a high note.  The segments of a vibrating piano string are ALL shorter (therefore higher in actual pitch) than their simple divisions would lead you to think.  The Octave Harmonic segment of a piano string is not half the string&#39;s length. It is LESS than half the string&#39;s length because the piano wire is stiff and the non-moving node has a sensible length.  And this node is well understood to cause the remaining moving portions of the string to vibrate faster than mere twice the frequency.  Thus, stretch is required for every note of a piano.", "comment_date": "2018-05-29T00:23:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "broccoliblood", "comment_text": "String is made out of cat gut!!! <b>takes out ukulele string out of mouth</b>", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T23:23:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kevin Nguyen", "comment_text": "How about tuning with quarter tones", "comment_date": "2018-05-28T22:44:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Feona Lee Jones", "comment_text": "not bumps, CYCLES~", "comment_date": "2018-05-25T23:26:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gamina Wulfsdottir", "comment_text": "Best explanation I&#39;ve seen of this.", "comment_date": "2018-05-24T22:11:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blah Blahsen", "comment_text": "see...this is why i play bass and guitar. tuning takes 40 seconds, everything is simple. i dont have to call a professional to fix my tuning and a wall of math to confirm it.", "comment_date": "2018-05-23T17:46:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shadowfax", "comment_text": "Tuna can but a piano?", "comment_date": "2018-05-19T18:19:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "le Hoarderz Al-Shekelsteins", "comment_text": "1.2k shitty millennial dubstep lover teens disliked this video", "comment_date": "2018-05-15T16:22:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "~Blackpink Is The Revolution~", "comment_text": "Then why there are piano tuners", "comment_date": "2018-05-14T16:46:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NippleNinja2", "comment_text": "Wait, I thought the strings in violins were made out of horse hair", "comment_date": "2018-05-11T20:44:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kuromori", "comment_text": "Can u read a audiobook?", "comment_date": "2018-05-10T16:29:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kimon Froussios", "comment_text": "The same applies to all equal-temperament-based instruments, not just the piano.

Just tuning pre-dated Equal Temperament. J.S. Bach solved this problem with yet another tuning: Well-Temperament. In fact he also wrote 48 musical pieces (24 in 2 volumes) to demonstrate all major and minor scales can be used with his tuning and not sound out of tune, something impossible to do with Just or Meantone tuning. In band/orchestra, you learned Bb is C#, or an &quot;enharmonic&quot; note, meaning this note is the same, just has two different names. True in equal/well temperament, but not true in Just or Meantone. The situation was so bad before better tuning system that some historical keyboard instruments (mostly pipe organs) have two keys for the &quot;black key&quot;, one which is actually Bb, and another which is C#, and when played together, are obviously not the same note. I&#39;m not sure how this topic could be succinctly covered by minutephysics, but it would be genius if it was. This whole area of music theory/history is practically lost because of the dominance of equal temperament. Perhaps starting with the cover of Das wohltemperierte Klavier, and looking at the decorative &quot;swirly line&quot; at the top of the page. Some historic tuning scholars have theorized that is a visualization of how many &quot;cents&quot; you must tune each note up/down to obtain well temperament. Some people attribute no meaning to the swirls other than decoration. <br><br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Well-Tempered_Clavier#/media/File:Bach-wtc1-title-ms.jpg\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Well-Tempered_Clavier#/media/File:Bach-wtc1-title-ms.jpg</a>", "comment_date": "2018-04-01T18:26:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dafterwho", "comment_text": "that&#39;s annoying", "comment_date": "2018-03-31T17:07:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "albertlagerman", "comment_text": "You can&#39;t tune a piano but you can tuna fish!", "comment_date": "2018-03-30T14:20:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Joseph", "comment_text": "its music, not math.", "comment_date": "2018-03-30T07:48:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jackurokawa", "comment_text": "Or you could just play on an electric keyboard", "comment_date": "2018-03-27T13:34:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stephen Su", "comment_text": "Fourier\uff0c you again", "comment_date": "2018-03-24T05:54:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Chloe Roestel", "comment_text": "Hush!<br>Your ruining everything ;-;", "comment_date": "2018-03-23T15:13:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ingrid Ka.", "comment_text": "C&#39;mon, stop mix the beutiful music with maths!!", "comment_date": "2018-03-23T14:23:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kyogeo", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t want to use music again", "comment_date": "2018-03-22T18:44:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "drizzleRomanceGirl", "comment_text": "can&#39;t you just use an electronic tuner to check every string?", "comment_date": "2018-03-20T01:13:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doug Gwyn", "comment_text": "A good professional piano tuner is well aware of the fine-tuned compromises needed to ensure that the piano sounds best for performing in the most likely keys.

Partially for the reasons shown and partially because the actual harmonics a string carries are sharp of the mathematical whole number ratio anyway. Only a pipe instrument or electronic instrument is slightly out of tune but with perfect octaves as they demonstrate. On a string the fundamentals might follow that model but the harmonics will cause much more interference than they explain. It&#39;s beneficial to use your ears to minimize the resulting dissonance. It is of benefit to create some stretching to the scale so that the higher octave is sharp by a small amount. A common method for this rather than just trying a whole bunch of diads up and down the scale wasting a ton of time is to use a fifth plus 1 octave so rather than 2/3 you tune 1/3. This would cause the scale stretch of a circle of fifths to extent over a wider range in a perfect world. But it also forces you to hear the interference of the harmonics and not just the fundamentals so the actual results vary as the strings characteristics change. It&#39;s still not perfect but no music is. Electronic instruments could potentially gravitate notes towards a certain frequency if played with other notes to keep harmonies. But for the musician it&#39;s important to just understand these problems are there and if they have to fudge a tuning to get a certain feel from a song that&#39;s ok because not all harmonies can be true on any instrument.

The notes being equally the same across the keyboard is nowhere close to as important as this, a .02% alteration in pitch is insignificant compared to the 14 cents needed to lower the third for a major chord, or the 16 cents needed to raise the third for a minor chord.

Chords made from integer ratios of frequencies sound (and are) much more static - like a sawtooth or square wave with notch filtering.", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T12:52:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The gaming ninjas", "comment_text": "great vid dude love it!", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T00:25:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The gaming ninjas", "comment_text": "its 2017 people are still watching", "comment_date": "2017-06-21T00:25:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rrrrrr", "comment_text": "Does anyone know, what dictionary is shown on the 2nd second of the video?", "comment_date": "2017-06-18T07:17:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Puro", "comment_text": "Music is science, science is beautiful.", "comment_date": "2017-06-17T17:02:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ajax khan", "comment_text": "did you really discovered it??????", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T21:15:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jens Zamanian", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railsback_curve#The_Railsback_curve\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railsback_curve#The_Railsback_curve</a>", "comment_date": "2017-06-15T07:48:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Will Miata", "comment_text": "ehhhh?

If I&#39;m not mistaken, you can correct me, but I remember reading about how Medieval Italian violin makers used SHEEP intestines instead of Cat intestine as killing a cat back the was bad luck. The Medieval Italian musicians making the instruments said they used catgut to protect their invention. So until 1750 all violins used sheep gut with people who thought of it as catgut. Back then a guy named Erasmo who lived in the village of Salle near Pescara, Italy, noticed dry sheep gut blowing in the wind and remarked on how well it sounded. And he recommended sheepgut to some unknown instrument makers near the village and with his help they introduced the Fiddle. Or allegedly. If someone can fact check that last bit that&#39;ll be great. Otherwise I am defiantly sure Violins were never made of CAT-gut. Just sheep-gut back then.

Beyond what was said, the notes on pianos go slightly sharp as they are sustained in time. I believe all plucked and hammered strings have a tendency to do this, and it is one of the reasons they seem to have a certain sweet sound or lilt. The notes on a piano, until you get to the very low bass, are sounded on three strings, which are slightly detuned from one another. One important reason for this, they say, is that it gives a piano a longer sustain; that is notes don&#39;t fade as quickly. Close-ups of the strings in slow motion show that which of the strings is vibrating the most is exchanged among them, the net effect of which is that the note takes longer to fade. It could be that the blurred tonality reduces the effect of the equal-tempered tuning and makes it not sound as discordant.<br><br>\u00a0It seems to be that when playing most instruments at the highest regarded skill level there is a lot of vibrato (which is vibrating the frequency of the note rapidly.) Which means the impression of a note&#39;s precise frequency (if there is any such thing), since that only exists only in the human mind, is what people hear, not a real frequency. Instrumentalists will often say the effect of vibrato and other note-bending is to give the instrument expressiveness more like the human voice, which is often considered the most expressive of all sounds. (Surprise!)<br><br> Physicists, to give a better impression that they know what they are talking about when they talk about music, prefer to skip right over the human voice. The most notable (pun!) characteristic of the human voice is the suppression of the fundamental frequency. The harmonics drowned out the fundamental. Yet somehow that faint fundamental frequency is the note. In fact, small, junky speakers will sound as if they are producing low notes that they are incapable of producing (as a fundamental) because of a severe distortion at double the frequency. So the last thing people want if they only have a small speaker is one with low distortion.

But let&#39;s say instead of using the approximation method of 12th roots of 2, you just added extra keys. Lots of extra keys which are <b>not</b> &quot;evenly spaced&quot; by a geometric series. You have a set of keys that go up by whole steps, and you have a set of keys that go up by major thirds, and you have a set of keys that go up by fourths, and fifths, and half steps, and every other set you need to complete any possible perfect set of pitches. The goal is that you can start at any key on the board, and from it find another key whose frequency is exactly 9/8 what the one on the first key is. And from that one, you can find a tone that is exactly 4/3 what that key&#39;s is, and so on (leaving out the &#39;non-musical&#39; ratios so we don&#39;t have to calculate to arbitrary precision: we don&#39;t need 108/107 for example, but I don&#39;t know how which ratios Western music theory traditionally uses). To keep it finite though the board has well defined ends at say, N/2 octaves above and below 440. (So if you want N=6 octaves your highest note is 3 octaves above = eight times 440 and your lowest is 3 octaves below = one-eighth of 440).<br><br>So for any of you with both the music theory and the mathematical sophistication (Want to waste an afternoon on this, Henry?) to solve this: first, is it possible to create such a board with a finite number of keys (I&#39;m worried about the requirement that you can do any interval from any key already on the board, then any other interval from that one ad infinitum), and if not, what sacrifices must be made to keep the board to a finite number of keys? Further, how many keys will this setup require for a piano of N octaves (or at least an order of magnitude estimate, or at least a solution for N=1 with 440&lt;=f&lt;=880)? <br><br>In any case the problem sounds ridiculous and a bit abstract but it&#39;s certainly not unreasonable to create such a thing with any number of already existing programs for someone who was either a perfectionist or hardcore audiophile (even though barring the result that the number of necessary keys is reasonably small a simpler pragmatic solution  would be to make your program just calculate the ratio associated with the interval you wanted and multiply your current frequency by it to within the precision allowed by your software and repeat this separately for each new tone...

Of course it&#39;s possible to tune a piano; people do it all the time.  But the problem the videographer tries to discuss is an ancient one, and it applies to any keyboard instrument, since they are complicated and time-consuming to tune, and they can&#39;t have enough keys to play all possible notes.  I&#39;ve been reading some of the comments and would like to stick my oar in:<br><br>The problem is not harmonics in and of themselves; it&#39;s that if you tune a keyboard instrument so that any one key sounds good, related keys will sound passable, but the more distant you get, the more awful the keys will sound.  This is because the enharmonic notes (C sharp/D flat, D shapr/E flat, etc.) are actually not the same frequency, a fact which is disguised by the fact that the keyboard uses only one key to accommodate them both.  If you tune so that C sharp sounds good in the key you are tuning for (A major, let&#39;s say), then D flat is going to sound awful in the keys that use it, and so on.  Not to mention the fact that you will have problems even within the key for which you are tuning, since theoretically not all half-steps are the same size.  The point of all temperaments is thus to tune all intervals but octaves somewhat sharp or flat, so that all the discord is spread out more or less inaudibly to the ear.  Otherwise, you would need to have <i>at least</i> some 420 separate keys to cover five chromatic octaves.<br><br>Since you can&#39;t retune your average harpsichord, pipe organ, or piano between pieces in a concert, you need some kind of system to adjust the tuning, if you want to be able to play in more than one key.  How you will tune depends on what system you choose (the designer of my parish organ decided on Kirnberger III, because most of the hymns in the hymnal are in keys that sound good in this tuning), and there are probably a couple of dozen systems that were evolved over the centuries.  In all of them, octaves are pure, but thirds, fourths, and fifths are adjusted to be more or less in tune in some or all keys, and the other pitches are interpolated from there.  The equal temperament in general use today makes it possible to play in any key, but many musicians consider it flavorless.  Other tuning systems have more flavor, at the cost of reducing the number of keys in which you can play and sound good.  To learn more, go to the Web site of the music department at any good university; they will go into great depth about the various known tuning systems and the issues involved.", "comment_date": "2016-01-22T22:51:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Spencer Gibson", "comment_text": "whats the song at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hqm0dYKUx4&amp;t=3m45s\">3:45</a>?", "comment_date": "2016-01-20T03:32:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aaron Balke", "comment_text": "Love the video.

Okay, that&#39;s exactly five time, since five half-waves fit perfectly.  (Even this far, this physics isn&#39;t quite exact, but never mind.)

Of course, steel or catgut (my cat cringes as I write this) it isn&#39;t stretching much, but then the fundamental wave isn&#39;t much, but the string is indeed longer.<br><br>Therefore, the 5th harmonic, the 5xf wave, is fitting five half-waves on a longer distance than the distance between the usual endpoints.

Despite equal temperament the physics of a tensioned wire will not allow the wire to vibrate perfectly.  If a string is vibrating at 440 cycles (hertz)(middle A4) per second and you divide the string into two, the two halves will be vibrating at maybe 881...not 880 (which is mathematically twice the number of 440).  Even though mathematically the two halves of the strings should be vibrating at double the frequency of the entire length of the string (fundamental) they cannot physically due to the fact that the very PINPOINT small center of the two vibrating halves (the NODES) act like hinges.  And since hinges, like on a door, have length and take up space they are not part of the vibrating length of the two halves of the string.  So if a string is 4 feet long vibrating at 440hz then the two halves will be \u22481.99999999999 feet long (not 2 feet which is halve of 4) each vibrating at 881hz (not 880).  THIS TERM IS CALLED INHARMONICITY AND IT MEANS THAT EVEN A STRING VIBRATING BY ITSELF IS NOT MATHEMATICALLY IN TUNE.  SO STRINGS DON&#39;T EVEN VIBRATE HARMONICALLY PURE IN PIANOS.  That means the next octave up will have to be tuned at 881 (not 880) and the octave below 440 at 219 (not 220).  The more octaves away from 440 you get the further the discrepancy adds up to where mathematically the bottom note of a piano should vibrate at 27.5hz (low A0), but it probably vibrates anywhere below that number such as 27 or 26.  And to make things worse a single string vibrates at 440, its half at 881, it&#39;s quarter at 1764 (not 1762 which is twice 881) and so on with numerous harmonics.  So, which harmonic do we decide to use as a reference when tuning the next octave (A5) higher than A4?  Do we tune using 881 or 1764?  Piano technicians have to compensate and tune either between 881hz and 1764hz.  What&#39;s more is that short vertical pianos (spinnets) have thicker strings.

This is why piano tuning is as much art as it is science. Another factor not listed here is that the different harmonics in one string itself are often slightly out of tune with themselves. In the days before equal temperament became the standard; different keys would have different &quot;natures&quot;, in other words using the same scale degree combinations and chords in one key as you used in another would produce a different effect. Combine that with the well known tendency for human ears to perceive theoretically perfectly tuned intervals as sharp or flat as they get farther apart leads to necessity of &quot;stretch&quot; tuning. The high end of your piano needs to be tuned a little sharp and the low end of the piano needs to be tuned a little flat in order for it to please your ear. While the piano cannot be tuned perfectly according to sound wave physics, it still can be made to sound pleasing to the majority of listeners. Finding that &quot;sweet spot&quot; is the true skill of the piano tuner. It&#39;s moot anyway since every piano begins falling out of tune as soon as the tuner is finished.

In theory a piano with strings longer than the biggest pianos never made could be have all the A keys tuned at 440Hz,  220, 110, 55,27.5,  880,1760 etc but it doesn&#39;t work like that in practice on ordinary instruments, and it would not sound quite right  to our ears.   So in aural tuning what happens is the bottom notes are tuned even lower and the top notes two or three octaves above the middle of the piano are stretched even higher.  This is due to other physical aspects of vibrating strings, wood and metal framework comprising the piano, which is the &quot;inharmonicity&quot;. Good electronic tuning devices also take account of octave stretching    Compared with a concert grand a small upright piano which is tuned to usual standards will sound the same only around the middle of the keyboard.  Its bottom note is actually lower than the same note on a concert grand..........   The innocent ear might not notice,  good pianists would be aware fairly immediately, but  anyway I cannot think of a situation where a spinet piano would accompany a huge grand piano!

However, in this case, it is impossible to keep the 2:1 ratio among the octave. <br><br>On the other hand, chromatic based music theories, Turkish Music, is the most advanced one, there is a ratio of 4 to 5 between sharps and flats.

For anyone who got lost in the over-explanation..<br><br>Pure harmonic frequencies (i.e. pretty chord tones as nature intended :P) are ratios of waveforms\u00a0which are relative to the fundamental/base note, and not their neighboring tones in a musical scale. This is why the 3rd harmonic note in the key of A is not quite the same as the 2nd harmonic note in key of B, despite intuition suggesting that they should be. But they are close enough that musical instrument builders in medieval times decided to split the difference by making 12 equal steps between two octaves. In order for a pianist to play in perfect harmony in all 12 keys, he or she would need 12 different pianos, each calibrated just right for the fundamental note. He or she would also need to swivel around to play a different piano in the middle of a song if the song asked for a key change!

If you try tuning two guitar strings so that their harmonics match, as illustrated, your string frequencies won&#39;t be quite correct.  To get the 2^(1/12) equal temperment, you should tune like this:<br><br>A--to A440 tuning fork<br>low E: tune up until the harmonic almost matches the A.  You should hear it beat about every 3 seconds.<br>D: tune up until it perfectly matches the A... then go just a bit farther until you hear it starting to beat again (about every 2 seconds).<br>G: tune vs. D, again going just a bit farther until you hear it just starting to beat (about every 1 second).<br>B: fret it at D and match to the D string&#39;s octave.  This should match exactly.<br>high E: match harmonics with A, but tune up to the point it still beats about twice a second.  In other words it should sound just slightly flat.

Historically they were often used as chord instrument so they were tuned to a Just Temperament or a Compromise Temperament, but they can also be bought or retuned to ET.<br><br>Of course, diatonic harmonicas (also called blues harps or just harps) are both simpler and more complicated with their arrangement than a piano.  Being diatonic instruments they are designed to play in just one key.  (If you compared that to a piano in the key of C that would be just the white notes) but if you are a beginning diatonic harmonica player you have it a little bit easier than a piano player- while a piano player has to learn which black notes to hit for the other 11 major keys.  A harp player will carry around a box of all 12 keys (or at least the more popular keys, which varies from genre to genre).  Where the harp gets complicated compared to the piano is that instead of hitting the keys on the piano to make a note the harp player either blows or sucks (yes, there is a joke there- all harp players blow or suck) air through one or more different holes (a harp has 10 holes, a blow and draw reed in each hole).  Because it&#39;s virtually impossible to play both a blow note and a draw note at the same time (it is possible with some weird tricks, but not very practical) and because the harmonica was designed to play chords they had to lay out the notes in a pattern that put the chords together as either blow or draw, at the expense of what would be a more straightforward progression of just having all the notes in order.  This Richter tuning (in this case tuning is which notes are in which hole, not how many cents sharp or flat a specific note is from being dead on on a tuner) is used on most diatonic harmonicas, but people are always playing around with different tunings.  Some harmonicas are laid out to make playing minor chords easier, some to play harmonic minor chords, some to play Irish music better, or others to be able to play more chromatically.  On a regular Richter tuned harmonica only the middle of the three octaves has all the notes available without more advanced techniques-<br><br>But it gets even more complicated, because it turns out that you can use the resonance of the two reeds in the same hole to bend a note to a pitch that is not the natural sounding frequency of either reed, and that involves all sorts of crazy physics that isn&#39;t even that well figured out in the harmonica community.  There are draw notes and blow bends, where the reeds sound a pitch in between the pitch of the two reeds and overblows where they sound higher.  It involves all sorts of technique to get them to sound right.  In general, and there is debate as to why this is, you can color the tone of draw notes better than blow notes, to the point that blues guys (as opposed to folk guys like Bob Dylan or Neil Young) don&#39;t usually play their harmonica in the key it was designed to play in.  Instead, they play in a key a fifth off, so to play in G they would play on a C harmonica and bend some notes to make it fit.<br><br>All this, and unlike a lot of instruments, it&#39;s virtually impossible to see what you are doing.

In such a system E sharp is NOT F flat and there would be no enharmonic equivalents at all. The 12 tone equal temperament system allows all keys to overlap each other and &#39;nudges&#39; the tones that would be close but not the same into equivalence. The result is that the semitone intervals from the next key either land on the same tone as the last key or exactly split the difference in the whole tone intervals and the player would simply skip those tones if not playing in that key.<br><br>An instrument like a violin can be played in either system (in theory) by a skilled enough player, however to play guitar in just temperament (the harmonic system) most frets would have to move sharp or flat, but only on some strings and you would have to move the frets (like on a sitar) or make a new instrument for each key you wanted to play in; something like the guitar shown here: <a href=\"http://www.billalves.com/porgitaro/porgitarotuning.html\">http://www.billalves.com/porgitaro/porgitarotuning.html</a><br> with multiple fretboards, although I&#39;m not sure if those pictured there are all for the different keys in a just temperament system or if he is branching out into even more diverse tuning and temperament systems<br><br>Musicians from the medieval times forward were tweaking the tuning systems until we stumbled on the 12 tone equal temperament system, so if you really dig there&#39;s all sorts of stuff out there, all just a bit different by not enough to really care about for most folks.<br><br>I may have some bits wrong, but it&#39;s an interesting subject to investigate.", "comment_date": "2015-09-19T02:10:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rezneba101", "comment_text": "Title isn&#39;t quite right.

As a result, a well-tuned piano diverges slightly from well-tempered towards the high and low ends. That also means that the harmony gets worse as the distance between tones increases.

If you listen to a top bbshop quartet like Vocal Spectrum or Ringmasters you can audibly hear when they switch within a chord from equal to just tuning, it makes the chord really leap out and ring much more clearly, same with bands like Foden&#39;s. It&#39;s only possible to do this if you have access to a continuous spectrum of tuning, which is why (I think) it&#39;s much easier to get an orchestra, choir or band to sound &#39;perfect&#39; and most pleasing than it is to acheive the same consonance with a piano, harpsichord, or organ. On the other hand, tuning a keyboard instrument justly then playing in a different key makes for really interesting sounds, a fact taken advantage of by Renaissance composers, for example if a harpsichord is tuned justly on C, then playing it in A minor results in a very &#39;cold&#39; feeling, and G major feels quite uncomfortable and restless.
