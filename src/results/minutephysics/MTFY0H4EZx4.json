Our DNA contains a vast amount of information (and also complexity). The important difference is that a random DNA mutation would likely increase complexity but would almost certainly not increase information.

I&#39;m not saying evolution and the spontaneous generation of life didn&#39;t happen or isn&#39;t possible, I&#39;m saying that the odds are so astronomically unlikely (even with all the time in the universe) that other, seemly absurd, options almost seem more plausible.

I think about the first example of entropy I learned of; air in a closed container. The air molecules are in equilibrium and are evenly spread out, but they are not. Due to gravity there are more molecules at the bottom of the cup. In the most spread out universe there are black holes and spiraling galaxies. Why is it that these forces cannot over come  the randomness of the universe and bring every thing back together or is the expansion of space and time just too rapid?", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T03:13:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AVINAASH NIDASALE", "comment_text": "The cat has got entropy!", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T03:10:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Boson", "comment_text": "It is all in meaning of words - your complex!", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T03:06:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Frank", "comment_text": "I love the music!", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T03:05:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BCOE BVOE", "comment_text": "The most interesting part of this video,  was the simplicity of being able to go to a different video and not listen to anymore of this complete nonsense.....what a bafoon....", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T02:58:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "17inchcorkscrew", "comment_text": "&quot;And after the end of all, alone He will rule in awe.  <br>And He was, and He is, and He will be in glory.&quot;", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T02:47:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dafrandle", "comment_text": "you had to remind me of the heat death", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T02:42:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Milwaukee Atheists", "comment_text": "Sean Carroll?? fuck yeah!", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T02:37:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "StarScremerZ", "comment_text": "this is really unsettling.", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T02:31:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "theultimatehunt", "comment_text": "THANK GOD!!!", "comment_date": "2016-10-13T02:24:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WooferJr", "comment_text": "So if one day all of the human will become extinct anything that cant think would not think about the universe?

Entropy is defined over the probability distribution of the states or properties of the system. The more skewed the distribution (i.e., the more order), the less entropy.
