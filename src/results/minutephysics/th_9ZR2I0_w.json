And I postulate that gravity is a function of everything being pushed out from its tiniest form of mass. That is why all matter possesses gravity, and for this to happen the expansion of the tiniest particle has to be accelerating. <br>    If you have read this far, clear your mind and let me take you further.<br>    The old surface of a balloon with galaxies painted on it is so close yet so far from the truth.!<br>Imagine with me, not a Single balloon, but 1 million balloons, all inflating at the same time at the center of a room each balloon pushing against the balloon next to it, as they all inflate at the exact same rate. (really, take a few seconds and visualize the singularity of first uninflated balloons expanding out filling the room.)<br>Now add a second cluster, perhaps 100 or 1000 uninflated balloons a few feet away from the 1 million uninflated balloon. Run the thought experiment again, having all balloons expand at the same rate and see how the large cluster overtakes the small cluster, and if this does not describe gravities Force to you, I will take you further. (this theory came to me 30 years ago, I&#39;ve had a little time to mole it over\u2026 stick with me, I will even tell you how to arrive anywhere in the universe instantaneously, or maybe even a few seconds before you left). You have to let go of physics as you know it to make the leap to what I&#39;m about to tell you, and even if you&#39;re a string theorist you may see a tiny contrail collapsing out of sight behind every particle in the universe.<br>    Whether the vacuum of space is pulling and accelerating us, or an ancient big bang is propelling us, imagine every particle of the universe is moving and accelerating at a speed sufficient to cause it&#39;s mass to expand (why would its mass expand?: &quot;E equals MC squared&quot;). <br>I could be wrong here, but if the earth is spinning in space, why do I not flight off? Maybe I do, but as the particles of my body expand like the cluster of balloons, and the earth&#39;s particles expand like the larger cluster of balloons, then as I fly off, the gap between earth and myself is immediately overcome by expansion. (wouldn&#39;t physics be easier if we did away with gravity, and only had to calculate the acceleration of expansion between two objects.) <br>Between getting tired of writing here and the worry that no one will take me serious I am not going to explain how this affects quantum physics, black holes, and space travel unless I get a response.<br>    But, briefly:, <br>          a black hole is where expansion has stopped. Things are not being sucked in as you believe but rather we are expanding pass the non-expanding space.<br>    I like to use what I called the &quot;helicopter effect&quot; to explain quantum behavior. It has to do with the rate of speed forward and the rotational speed of the blade. If an electron is spinning about Is nucleus while moving near the speed of light it is like the blade of a helicopter, if the helicopter moves forward faster than the blades One side will stop, or even move relatively backwards. You can figure it out yourself I&#39;m sure!<br>    And instantaneous space travel, forget wormholes and curved space. Forget the sheet of paper folded to make the points meet. I wish I had more patience to explain in greater detail, but imagine the universe is expanding so rapidly that a second ago the entire universe was smaller than your hand, and in a second from now you will expand to a size larger than the current size of the universe.

Every documentary I&#39;ve ever seen explains a star in space as a marble on a sheet held tight in the air (the marble makes an indent in the sheet if you place something much smaller next to it say a an air soft pellet it will get pulled in towards the marble). Well with space stretching I imagine the star would be making a bigger impact on space because it is stretched thinner. I&#39;m sure the simple explanation is that the marble and a sheet is simply an analogy and spacetime is actually very different but I still think this deserves an explanation.
