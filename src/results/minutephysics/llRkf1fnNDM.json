I was being dumb and speeding down a curvy hill while the roads were wet and one turn I got to my bike just wouldn&#39;t turn. Luckily I saw some bushes I would crash into if I continued course and mentally braced for impact. My large gear in the front sliced my leg open in two spots all the way to the bone about one inch long and the other an inch and a half long. Needless to say I now have permanent scaring for this. It was the middle of the night though and strangely for some reason, I didn&#39;t feel it at all. My guess is that it was due to adrenaline. On the way home I was riding under some street lights and noticed my leg had some blood on it. Didn&#39;t have a great view though and thought maybe I just got a couple small cuts. Even after getting in my house and taking care of my bike, still didn&#39;t notice pain at all. Finally sat down decided to look at my leg and wow, I finally noticed it and how deep the cuts were. Luckily my girlfriend had butterfly stitches and gause to put on, or I would have had to go to the hospital. I didn&#39;t want that because I don&#39;t have insurance and can&#39;t afford that haha. Wore butterfly stitches and gause there changing them out every so often for a few weeks. Luckily it was enough to hold the skin together during the healing process.

Hence, when the steering is straight but leaned right (along with the bike) the steering will swing clockwise to drop down (close to the ground) as a result of gravity causing a clockwise torque on it resulting in the front wheel turning to the right. As a result of which you restore your balance ( i.e. a force towards the left ) which is easily understood as simply a result of your inertia (or)  the centrifugal outward force which you SEEM to experience as you are unable to provide the large centripetal force needed for you to stay in the short radius path created by the turning of the front wheel. This is just one reason for the wheel to turn right.  Interestingly, the wheels will turn right even if you have a straight handle or don&#39;t have a handle at all. The logic comes from the gyroscopic effect ( considered on only the front wheel for simplicity ). Just talking about the conclusion in brief: wheel initially rotates in a plane perpendicular to the road; the bike leaning right applies a a torque on the wheel such that the wheel should also have leaned right ( had it not being rotating ); but the rotation induces the gyroscopic effect whose conclusion says that the rotating body when acted upon by a torque will not have a tendency to rotate/turn in the same direction but it will have a tendency to turn in a direction that lies ahead of the expected direction in the sense of the rotation. Simple example/- a clockwise spinning top/beyblade touch it from the upside gently so that it should tilt/fall towards you, you will find that it will actually tilt towards your left ( this tilt will cause it to tilt on the left of itself ) each time lessening the magnitude of the tilt; so the tilted beyblade will rotate clockwise and stable itself. To learn why it happens Watch the video on GYROSCOPE by VSAUCE. Hence, rotating bike wheel leaning right will turn in a direction that lies ahead of its turning direction. I.e. Instead of the top of the wheel leaning right ( because of the torque ) the front of the wheel ( which is lying ahead of the top in the rotation sense of the wheel ) will turn right .", "comment_date": "2017-07-15T07:02:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Vince Noir", "comment_text": "Many people seem to resist the idea of countersteering.", "comment_date": "2017-07-09T12:46:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "james skinner", "comment_text": "For those that aren&#39;t closed minded, there&#39;s a motor cycle video that shows this pretty well.\u00a0 It&#39;s by a guy named Keith Code, who started the Calif.

I never really paid attention to how I was steering the bike. Though when moving at really slow speeds I primarily use the handlebars to keep balance. This I think is where I actually notice this consciously. The bike at slow speeds wants to tip over faster. My bike leans to the left, I steer the bike to the right and the opposite for the other direction. The bike quickly reverses the lean once I steer this way and this happens faster then if I try shifting my body weight instead. I don&#39;t know when I started doing this. it just happened naturally (and probably pretty early on once I really started riding bikes a lot). So if I&#39;m going really slow this is pretty much how I&#39;m keeping the bike upright.<br><br>I see others in the comment section seem to disagree or seem to think they haven&#39;t been steering bikes this way. I&#39;ve been riding a bike 20+ years now (as I don&#39;t yet drive and this is my only mode of transportation) so I&#39;ve become experienced riding bikes I would think. :P<br><br>The major factor that this video seems to not mention is speed. Yes you can lean first to start a turn and that is fine and dandy if you are riding fast (and very much so with motorbikes). But the handlebar steering this video describes becomes a bigger factor when you are not going as fast and need to correct the balance of the bike faster. Simply leaning at this point won&#39;t do it. You have to actually steer the bike as this video describes to get the bike to go where you want because the bike will begin to tip over at a faster rate then you can fix by just leaning without disrupting your turn and going off balance and possibly falling off your bike. I haven&#39;t ridden a motorcycle before so perhaps the rules for them are different.<br><br>But I&#39;m just going by how I&#39;ve been doing things for the past 20 years. I definitely recall that I&#39;m already steering my bike this way as the video describes. The only difference is speed determining if leaning first is priority to handlebar steering. Perhaps at speed I do both simultaneously.  Even at speed I might be doing the turn on the handle bars like the video shows, but perhaps because at faster speeds the amount of time I spend doing that is very quick and I don&#39;t consciously notice it.<br><br>So yeah speed IS the determining factor in how quickly you perform these actions. At faster speeds the adjustments are much smaller because the bike is traveling a greater distance and the wheels can impart more force on the bike. But at slower speeds you have to spend more time doing those movements to achieve the same thing. Perhaps I&#39;ll pay closer attention to this next time I have to go out. :P", "comment_date": "2017-04-21T20:14:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miles Jando-saul", "comment_text": "Or you can just lean and then steer the way you want to go.", "comment_date": "2017-04-08T05:41:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "D.

Must of the information is the same for both. <br><br>The reason most people do not think they countersteer is because it is ingrained into us when we learn and becomes so second nature that its like breathing. The movement is so miniscule that you barely notice it. <br><br>One way to think about it, is that you are changing linear motion for circular motion. To keep it simple and without a bunch of big words here. When you ride, you are moving forward, and all force is working to keep that bike straight up and down without any lean to either direction. In order to change that linear motion into circular motion, you have to create an oscillation or a &quot;wobble&quot;. In order to start a wobble, you must start small. The countersteering basically creates a small &quot;wobble&quot; in one direction to start the disruption of the linear motion, so that you can use that wobble to break free from the linear motion altogether and turn the direction you want. Because we only need two oscillations or &quot;wobbles&quot; to achieve our goal, we only use two. However, you could continue the &quot;wobble&quot; if you wish. <br><br>This &quot;wobble&quot; also works because of centrifugal force. It is a good and a bad force. Without countersteering, centrifugal force would actually cause our bodies to be thrown off the cycle because they want to continue the linear motion. However, by starting the &quot;wobble&quot; you use it to your advantage. <br>For example: If you want to turn right, you make a small steer to the left which puts centrifugal force on you. When you then steer to the right,that centrifugal force works with you. Initially, that small turn to the left aids you in leaning. As you turn to the left your body wants to continue forward which is now more towards the right side of the cycle than the left, which displaces your weight and body position to be heavier on the right side of the cycle. As you then turn to the right, you are correcting, at least part way, for the small steer to the left and the bike helps you because by you turning to the right you are countering the first turn to the left which the centrifugal force wanted to counter anyways. So, when the centrifugal force aids you, you actually use that addition force to continue turning to the right <b>past</b> the straight line that the bike was trying to use force to return to, and you get more power to continue turning, and use your leaning to balance the remaining centrifugal forces.<br><br>Another thing is that cars can be subject to the same fates as cyclists who do not countersteer. The reason cars do not need to countersteer is because their center of gravity is so low, that they dont need the shifting of body weight to aid them. However, if a car is going fast enough or tries to &quot;overcompensate&quot; they can roll the vehicle because of the same centrifugal force.", "comment_date": "2015-10-27T03:27:38Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "ewrc", "comment_text": "who tf actually uses the handlebars", "comment_date": "2015-10-26T22:37:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason", "comment_text": "If I turn right I turn right, I don&#39;t turn left a bit first.", "comment_date": "2015-10-22T05:17:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "P K", "comment_text": "Yikes", "comment_date": "2015-10-18T15:22:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tilted Tesseract", "comment_text": "did someone say centipede&#39;s dilemma?", "comment_date": "2015-10-09T22:38:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Faires", "comment_text": "What if i just lean into my turn, causing my bike ti turn right without turning left first? xD", "comment_date": "2015-10-09T14:29:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "cameron koehler", "comment_text": "I just lean", "comment_date": "2015-10-07T02:19:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonathan Pierson", "comment_text": "I&#39;ve been wondering this for a long time.", "comment_date": "2015-09-29T12:37:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "eamon moroney", "comment_text": "Here in the Southern Hemisphere, we lean left to go left", "comment_date": "2015-09-29T11:56:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian", "comment_text": "im fairly sure i just lean and then catch my self by turning the handle", "comment_date": "2015-09-29T03:57:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "th3biga4827", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who noticed the two words &quot;at last?&quot; pop up at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llRkf1fnNDM&amp;t=0m42s\">0:42</a>?", "comment_date": "2015-09-26T21:46:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rodrigo Bragan\u00e7a", "comment_text": "Most awesome is that most of us learn to ride bikes and without realizing that is need to countersteer to turn.", "comment_date": "2015-09-25T18:15:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark A", "comment_text": "Is it bushing forward, downward,  or down and forward.
