Because it can be acted upon vis-a-vis an outside force (gravity) acting upon its speed and direction, it is not actually a constant.  Gravity lensing has made a sun appear brighter in the night sky to us.  This is due to the information reaching us faster and more abundantly than it would have normally.  Black holes themselves draw in light, and they regularly spew out materials that have approached at the wrong angle to stay in the black hole.  Everything that can go in a black hole gets flung out faster than it can suck them in, including light, and at a much greater speed because that is necessary to escape at all.", "comment_date": "2020-03-15T12:35:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "us rajput", "comment_text": "If photons have no mass.

Give it a swing at a normal spinning pace. The close end (the one facing you) might go very slow, but if the stick is long enough, the other end will travel the speed of light and possibly faster! Confused? If you turn the stick 90 degrees (sorry I don&#39;t have that sign on my keyboard), then the end of the stick has to stay with all the other bits of it down to you. Think of a circle with a smaller one inside the exact core. Now draw a line between the two circles, and another one at another angle. Measure the ends further away from the radius of the smaller circle, and then the two closer to the radius. The ones further away will show a bigger measurement on the ruler. Back to the stick. If you think about it it&#39;s EASY. But since I cannot show pictures in comments, it&#39;s hard to explain. Also, as you may have read on my channel about, I won&#39;t upload ANY videos. Here&#39;s my new theorem: &quot;The circle that has a line from the centre to the edge can swing the line faster away from the centre and slower closer to the centre.&quot; Try drawing a circle with a compass, then join two lines\u00a0to the centre and measure them...<br><br>Anyways, when you swing the stick, the bit of ultra force that swings it (you) will power the other end to go at an angle faster. Don&#39;t let go (I really HATE the Frozen Let it Go song anyway) of the stick or centipetral force will fly it away like a bolas. Think of it easier this way: Draw an angle and measure the in-between the two lines away from the corner and the in-between closer to the corner and the one away from the corner will be longer. (Just don&#39;t draw a reflex/180 degree angle or it won&#39;t work!) If you swing the stick, then if it&#39;s longer than the distance light goes in a second, it&#39;s very likely the end can go faster than light because the end goes your angle of spinning in a second times the length of the stick in a second!<br><br>I bet Microsoft Windows Sam, Microsoft Windows Anna, Microsoft Windows David AND Apple Macintosh Alex can never figure that out!

This is so obvious that every science fiction writer has ignored EINSTEIN&#39;S conclusions this being a limitation on our speed capabilities since the start of the 20th century.<br><br>Now, besides the observations that alien propulsion systems must have obviously enabled them to travel MUCH faster then the speed of light to get here and that they are using a propulsion system which cancels the effects of inertia and/or gravity, we have a much more powerful ally; the greatest real scientist of all time, whose inventions are thousands of time more important to mankind then EINSTEIN&#39;s &quot; ideas&quot; \u00a0ever were...NIKOLA TESLA... disagreed with almost everything of importance that EINSTEIN had to say.<br><br>TESLA said that he conducted many experiments where he observed supra-luminal speeds and when a man with 178 of the most important inventions in history says so...I BELIEVE HIM. He also completely disagreed with EINSTEIN&#39;S theory that GRAVITY was \u00a0only a distortion of space. He said gravity was a FORCE.<br><br>This &quot;DISTORTION&quot; theory also makes no sense intuitively because even when you look at the usual &quot; bowling ball on a mattress &quot; analogy, it represents space as only being distorted in ONE plane...what would this DISTORTION look like if, as it would have to be, the distortion takes place in ALL directions at all times ?<br><br>I SAY THAT THERE IS AN &quot;INVISIBLE&quot; PORTION OF LIGHT WHICH WE CANNOT YET MEASURE BECAUSE IT TRAVELS FASTER THEN &quot; C &quot;<br><br>My own theory, which I included in a satirical piece called EINSTEIN PUT ON TRIAL and where I presented the arguments that I would raise to attack EINSTEIN&#39;S theories, presented an ALTERNATIVE argument that the theories of the DUAL nature of light and that the puzzle of the PARADOX effect and the TUNNEL experiment would all be resolved, and QUANTUM mechanics would be reconciled with classical PHYSICS inertial models \u00a0if we concluded that there is an INVISIBLE portion OF LIGHT which travels much faster then what we accept as &quot; C&quot; but which can only be measured by our current instrumentality when it slows down to the speed of light.\u00a0<br><br>This would also confirm BURBRIDGE&#39;s idea that the RED SHIFT is far smaller then what we think and that therefore the UNIVERSE is much smaller then we think and the stars are much closer.<br><br>TESLA created a patent for electrostatic propulsion which he theorized would allow us to greatly exceed the speed of light,...consistent with the observations and theories about the capabilities of ALIEN propulsion systems.<br><br>If we don&#39;t already have such systems...something I hope is wrong...C&#39;MON you engineers...let&#39;s complete TESLA&#39;S work and get this done already.\ufeff", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T23:18:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Budhu", "comment_text": "This is disproven in Veritasiums video &quot;Will this Go Faster Than Light?\u00a0EPsG8td7C5k", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T22:12:59Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "TheCh0senOne1", "comment_text": "What about two gears with 20 and 50 teeth with the second one moving at the speed of light?", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T17:40:09Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Majora SkullKid", "comment_text": "You fell for the same illusion as my cat.", "comment_date": "2014-02-17T22:07:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Guerrero", "comment_text": "I&#39;m getting a little sick of these cheap gimmicks.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-02-17T07:14:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Liam Bury", "comment_text": "The photons from the laser are not themselves moving across the moon, when the beam travels, entirely new photons are hitting the new area.", "comment_date": "2014-02-17T05:43:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dennis Rot", "comment_text": "Yeah!

Example being in the bible u believes because Jehovah called the structured Geno manipulator as a tree it is but the human mind could not at the time understand the technology at the time one giving u knowledge of HI or gods the other giving u immortality. It may state this is on earth but at the time the bible was wrote humans had no knowledge of the planets let alone the solar system. Now I give you a gift for refuge. Gold is created in a super nova it come from 2 missing elements Gr - Kp they must bind from a great distance one being a + the other a - as in a magnet but greater force. What is faster than light? Gravity because not even light can escape a black hole. Gravity is faster than the speed of light. Now gold can be separate into the 2 elements and one attached to a docking station and one to the craft when ionized they will bind back to each other from an infinite distance. I will never give the equation for this because man will use it for destruction. This is how to harness gravity to have think you can put a solid mass into an light photon stream it across space is impossible. Time is not real it is a human way of archiving there Existence. Example think of walking to the nearest wall an ant might take 5 minutes to achieve this but you only need 1 mass will affect your pull on what you call time and I call Existence. \u201cAurum aliquant accio aditus appareo&quot; This can be used to help advance the human race or to destroy it. Human fear what they do not understand. Fact is your geno was programed to abstract Au &quot;Gold&quot; from the planet it is more than just a &quot;shinny rock&quot; it has immense electrical prop for conduction think of how it was formed in a super nova it had to fuse from great distance to make gold due to the sun being a large mass. It is actually created at the time of implosion in a super nova explosion gravity is naturally harnessed like this because the core of the sun is so dense it bends the fabric of space. But the +Kp is still in gas form where the sun was originally at. The <del>Gr is in the core of the dead star but balanced by the 2% contamination of sum of each - and + particles in each other and acts like a magnet when trying to touch N to N they repel. This slight imbalance is enough to cause a recycling motion of the two points and this is a harness of gravity. The center of galaxy\u2019s contain an Alpha Black hole eventually all matter inside will expand through the fabric an create another dimension another &quot;big bang&quot;. With every explosion is an implosion think of it all as blowing bunch of bubbles on a table the expand an pop or deflate in a webbing of unstructured alignment that is what is Space is or what I call &quot;EmVerseinfinity&quot;. Think of this the first language was geometry, words are used to manipulate if the human could not speak they could not lie. Words cause chemical reactions in the brain. Voice tone and the way the word s stated can make 1 single word have different chemical effects. EXP</del> If I say to a friend forget you man in a calm playing tone it would cause a playful reaction. But if I say the word in a direct angry tone then it will impose anger in a chemical reaction. Think of the triangle a square and a circle a square has 4 sides a triangle 3 and a circle is one constant singularity 4+3+1=8 &quot;8&quot; turned sideways is the Value of INFINITY. Human want to control/reduce population by means of eradication this can give the solution needed to be able to leave this planet. Imagine a planet where the sun is new and burn blue this would affect colors through the optical organ seeing water as purple. Mars at one time when the sun was new in ages burned hotter making mars in the same threshold earth is now. Mars is red because the soil comp. is iron. Water is there how else could the iron oxidize and rust to give mars a red surface. Theory can be validated with simple EQ.
