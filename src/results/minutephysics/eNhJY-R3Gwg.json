As gravity increases the object pulls in more fabric (dark matter/spacetime fabric/cosmic web) this reduces the radius of gravitational spheres which increases the magnification in the gravitational lenses that we look out through to view the Universe, giving the appearance that distant galaxies are moving apart faster than the speed of light. The acceleration is naturally because with more gravity comes more pulling power, the ability to pull in more dark matter. That is the logical solution with no need for assumptions, science fiction nor violations of the speed of light, it explains redshift, more gravity more redshift.<br>* Any celestial body with a black body at it&#39;s core which is so dense that the energy it creates cannot escape so it propagates and grows within. Such as Sag-A, our own sun which has a much smaller black body perhaps the size of a mountain and most surprisingly but obvious once we think about the separation of continental plates our own planet which has a black body perhaps still only the size of something like a wrecking ball. But which is obviously growing all the time, greating more matter/energy forcing the continents ever farther apart. Energy creation of course proven by the solution to the double slit experiment which reveals that matter is created by propagation but is only measurable in one dimension in any discrete act of measurement.<br>If one dismisses all that which is logically consistent, verifiable, testable, with no violations of QM or Relativity in favour of what is popular: the outwards expanding universe model then you must go with assumptions, science fiction, theories which are not logical nor testable. Even then when the assumptions and science fiction are introduced the data shows the model is not credible and it is a violation of Occams Law. Data from the Indian astrophysicist team in 2021 [ref 108 in my TOE] showed that the redshift is not just accellerating but that it is in fact speeding up and slowing down in cyclical timing and at different rates in different regions further indicates it is due to passing closer and nearer to gravitational zones. <br>Einstein always began with common sense, it took him from 1907 until 1915 to come up with the field equations for the common sense. I do the same start with common sense, unfortunately because I dont have a good grounding in complex math it takes me a long time to translate the common sense into maths and the pressure/urgency forces me to make woeful errors along the way which doesnt help. If I had help from someone who can see the logic and has the grounding we might get science back on track faster. As for the Earth thats why t-rex and buddies could grow so large, the Earth was much less massive so they were larger but in relative terms lighter. Our planet is going to keep on growing and eventually melt the crust to become a star, first a brown dwarf, then red dwarf and keep growing. There is no mass gap in the model that makes sense out of everything, everything just keeps growing incrementally. <br>As for Jean&#39;s &quot;stars from gas clouds collapsing&quot; theory it makes no sense.  It calls for an enclosed sphere which to my knowledge doesnt exist in space it only exists within black bodies. It also assumes that the collective mass of gas particles have influence collectively which is not true, gravity has a finite cut off point as does any coupling.

Explanation lacking in old theory of gravitational attraction of masses is that why two masses not collide in long course of time if there is attraction between masses, it is like there is low ground then nearby water flow towards it and eventually there remain no water.<br>In planetary system, pressure from sun causes nearby matter to push further. For this to happen, it is assumed that space is not vacuum but some subtle space matter. So pushing of matter radially expand space nearby sun causing low concentration of matter.

At the time of newtonian gravitation, it was known that speed of astronomical bodies could affected by relative speed of earth as distance of bodies are varying. About speed of light, they were using classical relativity. So speed of light depends upon speed of source, this was relativity. But mostly motion is in transverse direction thus no changes due to relative motion.<br><br>Newtonian gravity account for equilibrium force for orbits and calculating work done but not account for how this motion is perpetual, what energy keeps them in motion because if there is constant force than either mass disintegrates and comes equilibrium, no more motion or orbits continuously shrinking and merge into centre. These effects are very common with forces obeying inverse square law including gravitational and electrical forces. These forces are given by potential gradient and which have source. Their strength or intensity of force is given by law of divergence, inverse square of distance. In spatial coordinates it looks good but as orbits introduce temporal part, there comes play of power instead of energy and this makes orbits collapsing in centre or disintegration of mass into space and eventually equally distributed in space, which is also known as heat death. Detection of other mass&#39;s presence and act as force is possible at exoense of energy.<br><br>It doesnt matter that force is positive or negative, divergence is source or sink. If there is divergence then either source expands and vanishes or sink contracts constituting matter. Any way process halts and there is no flow. There are two types of energy to do mechanical force through matter, heat and electricity. But with every system doing work has tendency to come to halt, that is known as entropy which ceases motion as tends to come to rest. Theory of relativity accounts for gravitation in present is flawed as it account for things in transition. It is equivalent to Rayleigh-Jeans ultraviolet catastrophe, here it is continual expansion of universe. Amount of work done by expansion is calculated then it is infinite in comparison to finite energy source at beginning, and that is impossible. If Rayleigh-Jeans&#39;s relation is combined with Wein&#39;s law then that account for stable or constant power source of radiation. Similarly force behind gravitational space expansion or contraction is thermal and there should be some thing which is opposite or independent of space and stop the chaos or disorder in universe, that thing is time, similarly electric force is countered by magnetism and gives stability to matter. Ultimately heat is source of energy in universe and at smaller level it is manifested in electric form. So law of entropy is unification of interacting forces in nature.<br><br>We seen that realtivistic gravity could be given by Planck&#39;s radiation law, which is Maxwell-Boltzmann molecular speed distribution law and that further derived from combination of galilean inertial law and aristotlean law of motion given by drag force. Now comes to how realtivistic theory given by Einstein and its team account for gravity with whatever modification do on it to explain the phenomenon of gravity with energy and mass. Space-time is 2 dimensional vector having space and time as independent coordinates but constitute hypothetical space-time which account for how change in space causing change in time or how they counter each other.<br><br>Three independent basis of space consitute volume having source or sink. Length of space in radial direction is one dimension of space-time surface whose direction is along radial direction to centre. Second dimension of space-time is time which comes from motion of matter about centre, it is in plane of motion of bodies and directed perpendicular to motion. Now at centre there is body which either act as black or white hole, so sun is black and whilte both hole. For planets sun acts as white hole emitting energy in light flux and heat, for milky way galaxy it acts as black hole by draining their energy. So energy radiating from sun cause expansion of space that dilating time causing slow down of universe, also expansion. To counter expansion of space in terms of radial length, bodies of mass moving transverse to expansion causing stress to space-time and thus limiting expansion. To counter crunching of space and leads to annhilation of matter at centre, sun needs to absorb energy and irradiate so time is not concentrated and moves fast. Time dilation is observed as low frequency of distant planets.

Yes i managed somehow through school but only by imagination and making it feel right or just practicing but always each step learned why I do that. But now I can&#39;t solve equations and how could I do physics and leave law at almost 30 years old.<br><br>Why Am I telling you this? Because I was always a kid with lots of imagination. And what I saw now what Einstein found out I had exactly this in my mind why objects move through space around other objects.<br><br>I even had this imagination that objects fall down with elasticity  to break trough the &quot;atmosphere&quot; of space what I think is dark matter over all.<br>My English is not native but I will try to explain.<br><br>The universe is flat plat and it&#39;s material is dark matter with dark energy.<br>there are other universe and each of them are below the other.<br>This flat universe is elastic. So if something is in it, it falls constantly down. It stretches the universe. Here comes the clue: If the objects falls down and sinks into the abyss of universe it also stretches into the other below universe flat plat. And it sinks and sinks for like trillion and more years.<br>And Then it breaks and all the content from universe 1 comprehends into a small drop which contains all essence of the universe with all information and it drips into the next flat universe plat causing the big bang which is not Bang or explosion, it&#39;s just this small drop intrudes in a new blank universe plat causing to enhance and activate the universe plat and the information in the small blob (like a tear which falls from you eyes) causing to begin processes which led to almost same creation and developing of past universe.<br><br>If you ask why? I can explain too. The universe which I think is flat and already a system in itself. It&#39;s content is blank because nothing introduded so far. But his material is pure dark energy fields and dark matter which have properties. Properties like a straight system of almost eternity small points of energy fields which wait content to drop into the playing field to activate and work. The universe and is small particles are all connected like you pixels on the screen. Exactly that&#39;s how I would describe it. The universe and is particles are like the pixels of your screen. And each pixel is a worker and creator. It only waits for orders and commands. The dark matter and energy is the fuel for all these pixels to work and create all together simultaneously something which you see as objects and atmosphere.<br><br>And when this drop comes into the next universe it&#39;s like sperm giving life and content to a blank clear system. Then everything will arrange in billion or trillion years and will develop with trial and error a perfect system because each pixel is working while each pixel always connects and communicates with each other pixel and all pixel together in the whole universe as an overall super entity pixel.<br><br>Like I sad I see this for the first time but I always thought that we are sinking and falling. And that&#39;s why we think we expand but in reality we only fall constantly down and stretch the universe which is elastic. Causing to stretch many other universe flat plates under our universe to stretch.<br><br>Think of a elastic something gathered above the same elastic thing. If you put a heavy weight on top all level of the elastic thing will fall stretch down and object will fall.<br><br>But then there is a limit were the first on top universe rip apart and all content information of this universe will comprehend back into a single drop which will now fall down and enter a new under neath universe causing to give it live with the informations from the old universe how it is gonna have to work and the pixels which activate because they get information and the dark matter fuelling the dark emergy to work and giving them maybe somehow of consciousness because every pixel like I sad is communicating each mili second (in reality it is real life and it can&#39;t be described with a number because it&#39;s love without a single delay) and each pixel of full knowledge of each other pixel which is trillions of lightyear away and connected to the whole system as a whole.<br><br>We are falling not expending!<br><br>And that is why light is always everywhere and for as humans always faster than everything. Because it&#39;s everywhere 100% of the universe. It is the light from the energy exchange and interactions from all the pixels which work and the dark energy giving them fuel to work and energyze. That&#39;s why it is so fast because it was always everywhere. It&#39;s like the ocean contains water and if we humans thought that water=light, we would measure the speed of the water and see that it&#39;s faster than anything else when in reality it is not fast its just everywhere before now and after.<br><br>And what I forgot each pixel knows over time how to work due the information of the past universe and each pixel will give each atom and particle orders how to work and react and how to behave. Like a switch from a DNA which can&#39;t turn on our off. Every little pixel in the universe has orders and properties and behaves like he has too.<br><br>So basically the future is always written when we live in the present. The present is the future and there is no time like we humans invented. It&#39;s just we are living life and simultaneously with the universe.<br><br>And I think if some of pixels get failures and malfunction that&#39;s why sometimes we get sick or other accidents happen because some particles failed or got desynchronized and can&#39;t connect live without a delay with the other particles in the universe.<br><br>I don&#39;t know what how I do it but sometimes I can see future events to occur like a soccer game where I know that a team will wijj exactly 5:1 or will winn first halt 3:1 or the bar team will win 2:0 and so on or know which persons I will see next in the next day Whig I didn&#39;t see in years.<br>and other stuff.

So length comes out as 6 nanosecond but as it is supposed that relative length is contracted so boost it with lorentz factor to calculate actual length of an object.<br><br>As seen above length is expanded and not contracted in relative motion as per theory of relativity. Question is then why they used contraction. Answer for that beguile one, historically special theory of relativity known to world first than general. But they had knew the general relativity first. In 19th century there was came spherical geometry and they modeled universe as some sphere. In sphere, orthogonal unit vectors in angles for surface is not constant but varying in direction which is okay but also vary in magnitude. Means one unit of length near equator is contracted at pole. From this they got idea of length contraction. As speed is slower at pole due to curvature if part of sphere, so that become region of high gravitation causing slower clocks. Now in differential geometry, length of curve is given by scalar multiple of speed with parameter. So they need some constant speed so they can relate it with surfacial model of universe, and light became their ideal choice. To have constant speed of light near poles, they need change in unit of time, so time is dilated in high gravity. But these concepts of change in relative length and time is introduced through special relativity. Why, because they want to show that these changes are not due to gravity or accelaration but intrinsic property of motion or say relative motion. But for special part they need some exponential multiple to produce effect of curved surface equivalent to spherical surface, so they introduced concept of ultimate speed of light and that became essential constant of speed for spherical surfaces and lorentz factor for logarithmic multiple effect of curved surface in inertial relative motion.", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T03:39:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ese Ukey", "comment_text": "This is how I understand the shape of the Earth, in as simple a language as possible - Look at the Planet Earth as a sphere from outside, from inside it&#39;s a diameter...we&#39;re in the middle, the sky is the top, the bottom is the ground level area....the Earth goes round but easily seen moving in a straight line but somewhat curvy (if that makes sense).

How this is free from coordinate choice when its itself bounded by shape.<br><br>Second thing as 3d is represented by 2d surface, and area of surface depends upon angle between base units, thus unit vector is not constant which is changing angle.

I&#39;m reading his book now (translated by Robbert W. Lawson, <a href=\"http://d.sc/\">D.Sc</a>. and you can really see how he came to the making of the theory. Not by trying to connect everything together like lines in a plane in a certain co-ordinate system, but instead by asking something like (am I even in a plane? Why am I so certain of the concept?). Question literally every concept we adhere to as true (like how he goes on about the different coordinate systems throughout time that largely base their &quot;truths&quot; on made up preconceptions), he talks about it literally in the first couple of paragraphs. As he says, &quot;The important thing is to not stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.&quot; The moment we accept whatever truths we&#39;re given by authorities or others, we succumb to its limitations instead of the limitless power that is our own imagination.<br><br>&quot;Imagination is more important than knowledge.

Combining the SM of particle physics and GR assuming asymptomatic safety, it is even possible to predict the Higgs-boson within surprisingly accurate limits. There are further implications like an dark-matter-free explanation of the flat galaxy rotation curves.

The most interesting thing about such a Theory of Everything, to me (given my limited understanding of the physics involved), is the philosophical implications of it. Quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic, where predicting the future is fundamentally impossible and the best that can be done is predicting the probability distribution of all possible events. On the other hand, general relativity is inherently deterministic, where if you know all the starting conditions, you can predict with 100% accuracy the state of a system -- including the entire universe -- at any point in the future. General relativity would imply the concept of destiny or fate, where the future is predetermined and there&#39;s no way to change it. Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, implies at least some measure of free will, where there are many possible futures, some more likely than others, but which actually will occur may not be out of our control. So any theoretical framework that manages to combine these two would have serious implications for understanding whether the universe is, at its most fundamental level, fate-driven or manipulable.", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T18:49:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blood's thicker", "comment_text": "It&#39;s a nice story for people that believe they live on a giant water covered space rock.", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T18:33:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jayvee Valdez", "comment_text": "okay, time to sleep zzzz", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T18:28:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "munir issa", "comment_text": "i got lost 2 minutes thru the video lmao", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T18:01:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zab Bronola", "comment_text": "I can hear the saliva in your mouth", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T17:19:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "pokio55", "comment_text": "What about gravy?", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T16:02:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "neko", "comment_text": "After level 4 i didnt get a thing , level 14 might be god level", "comment_date": "2021-02-23T14:12:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "i0zone", "comment_text": "Great stuff.

And all objects in our solar system are moving in the same speed along with the sun through the universe. And there is no gravitaional differences on other bodys in our solar system as far as we know. So they all redirect the angular momentum of traveling through the univers to their center of gravity. To why do we have different ammounts of gravity on the different bodys in our solar system?

Luckily the atomic clock on satellites are designed to tick slower for the general relativity effect, and your phone solves special relativity equations to compensate for time dilation due to speed of both you and the satellite.", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T19:08:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheDivineWinds", "comment_text": "You had me in the first minute.", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T19:05:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Adiabadic", "comment_text": "Nobody:<br>Twistors at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNhJY-R3Gwg&amp;t=4m44s\">4:44</a> : I&#39;m just vibing bro", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T19:05:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GeGe", "comment_text": "I&#39;m on 2.5 Pog", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T19:05:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Isaac Lawson", "comment_text": "I understood at least four of these words", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T19:03:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pizza Time", "comment_text": "Amazing!", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T19:02:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sergiusz Stasiolek", "comment_text": "Ok, I didn&#39;t get anything", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T19:02:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Walker", "comment_text": "As a mathematician I was surprised to see that after describing spacetime as a 4 dimensional manifold which is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold with Lorentzian signature the video was not even close to being over.", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T19:00:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Anonymous", "comment_text": "What if our entire Solar System is an another Atom?", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T18:58:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Pettier", "comment_text": "this is incredible, from level 4 i start to be in &quot;hey, i understand some of these words&quot; mode, but it&#39;s still very englightening, though less and less meaningful :D.", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T18:58:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mubasshir Akhtar", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNhJY-R3Gwg&amp;t=3m42s\">3:42</a> <br>Wasn&#39;t it the image black hole at the centre of M87 and not milky way?", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T18:57:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sobha KS", "comment_text": "if Einstein was never born physics textbooks will be halved", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T18:56:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Royal Kenny", "comment_text": "This is the ultimate video to confuse flat-earthers even more :-D", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T18:54:03Z", "likes_count": 148}, {"comment_by": "Cracked Emerald", "comment_text": "That&#39;s why it&#39;s called general, not complete", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T18:52:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joo Brothers", "comment_text": "finally! after many months of waiting!!!", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T18:51:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KeanYl", "comment_text": "How smart are you?<br><br>Me: level two \ud83d\ude05", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T18:51:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Todd Boothbee", "comment_text": "?, &#39;.&#39;, !", "comment_date": "2021-02-18T18:50:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Leon", "comment_text": "Yup.
