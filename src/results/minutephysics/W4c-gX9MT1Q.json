The measurement problem is that we can only measure between 2 points in one dimension of space and one of time time in any single act of measurement, so we cannot measure the total value of the energy we can only deduce it. What we must do is use our understanding to apply the result from one dimension and extrapolate what the total energy generated within the system must be. We must also apply the very fundamental law of physics (and karma) cause and effect (for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction) and combine it with the reality of what the inequality that solves the double slit experiment proves, that energy is CREATED and propagates out in waves. This shows that it is not in fact that energy is conserved but that the initial value of energy detected along one dimension is conserved. It is always propagated with the same value in all directions but detected along one dimension which for total E (TE) is TE=E.\u039b the \u039b is \u039b=13.2521402919^2t also linked to the number of dimension (13 like a rubik&#39;s cube) 13 to the power of time by 2 gives us the wave propagating out in all possible directions in positive and negative time, time cannot be 1 because time only becomes detectable with separation or stretch in the fabric and that minimum stretch is \u0127 so we have 4.pi.\u0127. To twice the power of time because the energy detected is also propagated back into negative (antimatter) time from the initial source of the wave (and again backwards from every point/particle that is passed in the field but this propagates inwards so is immediately cancelled out). In summary: The fundamental building block of spacetime has 13 spacial dimensions (like a rubik&#39;s cube) so with every increment in conscious time the oscillation emanating from the centre of that block is propagated out in 13 directions to the power of twice the measured time.<br><br>This is also consistent with the proof of the Reimann hypothesis s=-tx.+tx=0 the total value of energy E at any point x is always the total energy arriving then propagated in positive time and negative time.<br><br>At the quantum point 0 the spherical field particle is the source of the wave and every propagation out from that point in dimensionless numbers has time as 1 which is the radius. That is until another force acts upon some part of the wave, in the field that force is \u03c0^p otherwise known as curvature and p being the total pressure caused by the angle at which energy hits curvature.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps now physicists can start to embrace the new physics revealed by the double slit experiment and understand the urgency. The first law of thermodynamics is wrong, it is a mistake made due to the measurement problem (we can only measure between 2 points in one dimension of space and time)\u00a0 Einstein&#39;s Relativity predicted white holes that generate their own energy and matter, yet 100 years later after almost every other prediction of Relativity has been verified physicists are still using an old model of stars as using up a finite supply of energy, models that do not add up (multiple anomalies).<br><br>New mathematics and evidence show OUR SUN IS A WHITE HOLE generating it&#39;s own energy as heat/light and matter (ejected as solar winds). The inequality that solves the double slit experiment proves what the interference pattern suggested, that energy is created all the time, the 1st law of thermodynamics and the measurement problem has blinded physicists from the reality. The full Genuine Theory of Everything has been solved but it is facing a wall of silence and/or misunderstanding. It is backed with the highest quality peer reviewed experiment data and robust mathematics.<br><br>Elsewhere, Scientists have found evidence that the sun goes nova (mini supernova) every 12,000 years usually causing mass extinctions, the evidence indicates the last one that happened 12,000 years ago wiped out the woolly mammoths and Neanderthals.

When physicists use the word Big Bang to describe the beginning of the universe, they do not do it in the same way a comic book author does. It is just a name, a catchy word to describe a process we are only studying. Just like a black hole is not really a hole at all. It&#39;s a collapsed star.Physics, especially astrophysics, uses these names to make them more digestible.names as Big Bang, Big Crunch, dark matter or heavy bombardment era are more user-friendly ;)", "comment_date": "2013-08-24T12:48:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bolita12345", "comment_text": "WE ARE ALL SPECIAL!!!", "comment_date": "2013-08-24T12:48:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nadi106", "comment_text": "So....
