Do you not even remember whhen you yourself said that while traveling ahead on a train does not simply add your speed to the train&#39;s speed to make the total speed, but that there was still a positive acceleration?  The Given in this equation you put forth is incorrect.  You don&#39;t KNOW how the universe actually works because you cannot properly TEST it.  Experiments up until now have been too small and too much supposition to get anything definitively true, and things in nature fly in the face of conventional knowledge, leading one to the inevitable conclusion that we do not actually understand enough.", "comment_date": "2020-03-16T02:12:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheBlade996", "comment_text": "Once again, this explanation, like so many others, gives the impression that &quot;relative&quot; velocity is a &quot;real&quot; velocity. And this is where these explanations always go wrong. Firstly, to get a more logical understanding of the subject, start by replacing the word \u201crelative\u201d with the word &quot;perceived&quot;. From the beginning, the narrator is already talking about the velocity \u201cperceived\u201d by an external observer as if it is the \u201creal\u201d velocity. But don\u2019t forget, the \u201creal\u201d velocity of the person firing the pellet is still 0.6c, the \u201creal\u201d velocity of the pellet is still 0.6c. That didn\u2019t miraculously change. It is just the \u201cperceived\u201d velocity that \u201cappears\u201d different to the external observer. Secondly, ask yourself why the Lorentz Transformation incorporates the speed of light? Because the equation is meant to be used by an external observer to measure or predict the \u201creal\u201d state of an object in a moving frame of reference and light is what that observer uses to \u201cperceive\u201d the object from their own frame of reference. It should not be used to conclude that the \u201creal\u201d velocity of an object can never exceed the speed of light, as the video seems to purport. On the contrary, the correct conclusion should be that the Lorentz Transformation can only be used for measuring objects with a \u201creal\u201d combined velocity less than the speed of light, because the observer is limited by the light needed to perceive them. Other equations, perhaps using red and blue shifts, may permit to extend that limit.

Going by that logic, though, it would seem that it&#39;s not possible for any material thing to achieve speed greater than 50% the speed of light, or else it would be possible to surpass it, by propelling another on top of that. In other words, nothing able to propel another thing can at the same time be able to go at more than 50% the speed of light?

You regularly refer to speeds of 0.6c which on the surface might seem like an arbitrary value, but is itself rooted in being the speed for which you stretch one diagonal by a factor of 2, and squeeze the other diagonal to 1/2. If you apply consecutive identical shifts to your spacetime globe, these factors of 2 combine multiplicatively. Equivalently, the logarithms of these scaling factors combine additively. <br><br>This logarithm is the rapidity, and relativistic rapidities combine exactly the way you expect classical velocities to combine - simply by addition. Where you say that combining the speed of light with something slower is like adding to infinity, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on, just that it happens with rapidity rather than velocity. The rapidity of light is infinite, which you never get to combining finite rapidities.<br><br>It\u2019s easy to show that the velocity of an object is the hyperbolic tangent of the rapidity - just walk through getting from the scaling factor of 2 to your velocity of 0.6c (specifically, its (2-1/2)/(2+1/2) c) and putting an exponent in place of the 2. <br><br>Then to get the equation for adding velocities, you can convert from velocities to rapidities (by taking hyperbolic arctangents), adding them, then taking the hyperbolic tangent to get back to a velocity. Or better yet, just point out that the rapidity is the more fundamental concept in relativity, and the velocities we\u2019re used to thinking of are an abstraction of them.", "comment_date": "2018-06-12T15:48:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Altamash Parwaiz", "comment_text": "Everything went above my head", "comment_date": "2018-06-12T15:46:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sam", "comment_text": "does he really need to say \u201cdeath pellet\u201d instead of bullet to avoid demonetization?
