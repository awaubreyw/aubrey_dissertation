First the author equates increased velocity to hardship (&quot;getting one mile east in a minute is a lot harder than getting there in a day&quot;), then in the same sentence he equates distance to time (&quot;so one mile east and one minute in the future is way more DISTANT than one mile east and a day in the future&quot;). So in one fell swoop he equivocates distance, time, distance&#39;s time derivative velocity, and the energy (hardship) required to accelerate to a velocity in order to cover the distance more quickly. The author then implies that because it&#39;s impossible to instantaneously change position, then all positions other than one&#39;s present position are &quot;super DISTANT&quot; in the instantaneous present (now). This statement is partially true in the sense that distance (delta x) is a non-measurable entity in the present, and one can only measure distance by travelling there, and the rate of this travel is limited by the speed of light. But just because space is a non-measurable entity in the instantaneous present, it&#39;s a non-sequitur to imply that space is a non-existent entity in the instantaneous present. Space still exists, it&#39;s just that you can&#39;t get there without time. This doesn&#39;t give you leave to arrogantly claim that the only space that exists in the instantaneous present is you. Space exists, but you can&#39;t travel faster than the speed of light to get there. No, the volume occupied by the Washington Monument doesn&#39;t cease to exist just because you are not physically there. The author then concludes that a minute is &quot;farther away&quot; (distance) than an hour, another non-sequitur. His equivocation of terms between distance and time essentially renders velocity as a non-entity. In other words, how can velocity (delta x divided by delta t) ever even exist if x and t are the SAME THING (which the author calls &quot;distance&quot;)? The author then caps off the nonsense by claiming that things travelling at the speed of light cover zero distance, which is empirically false.", "comment_date": "2019-12-09T17:39:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Nebesny", "comment_text": "WHAT!?", "comment_date": "2019-10-23T12:12:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GLASSY", "comment_text": "Speed playback - 0.75<br>Then watch it 3 times u ll understand", "comment_date": "2019-10-19T22:35:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gayathri Shylesh", "comment_text": "It would be so great if you extended beyond the 1-minute time constraint you operate in to explain this to us.
