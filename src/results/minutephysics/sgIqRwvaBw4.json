This results in r = 0 being equivalent to the Schwarzschild radius once\u00a0the Schwarzschild radius\u00a0is reached. This is, of course, an impossibility, no less impossible than accelerating mass to luminal velocity.<br><br>Gravitation cannot increase the density of mass. Only external pressure can compact a mass which in turn curves spacetime thereby increasing the gravitation. Spacetime cannot curve itself to make the mass curving it more dense. That would be perpetual motion.<br><br>The test for whether or not an object is a black hole is gravitational waves.<br>Gravitational waves\u00a0propagate at luminal velocity from the edge of a volume of mass.<br>Nothing at luminal velocity can propagate away from a Schwarzschild radius.<br>Black holes cannot have gravitational waves.<br><br>Whether it be the Lorentz factor or the Uncertainty Principle\u00a0&amp; Zero Point Energy, mass cannot be compacted to a state in which the velocity of causality and the motion of quantum particles can be suspended.

When black holes were first presented as existing around 1965, nothing\u00a0had been\u00a0known of gluons in the general physicist community as chromodynamics had only just been revealed. Thus, matter degeneracy beyond a neutron star was never considered and the degeneracy of a quark-gluon plasma is only a matter of speculation.

An object of infinite density and 0 volume cannot combine with another object of infinite density and 0 volume to result in an even larger object.

I think they act as the scavengers of the cosmos by slowly drawing in &quot;dead&quot; galactic matter like burned out star systems.  But,  as they continue to grow in size, there is a point reached at which they become unstable and some mechanism kicks in that temporarily shuts off their super powerful gravity field.  When that happens, the entire black hole detonates and releases all of the energy and matter that was formerly trapped in it and the result is the birth of a new local universe.

Answer: it most likely doesn&#39;t. We produce x-rays on earth every second, in a hospital or clinic near you, and not by collapsing a star into a &quot;black hole&quot;, or slamming gases at high speed into other gasses, simply by using a little electricity! We live in an electric universe, no black holes, no dark matter, no dark energy required. Astrophysics is dying as a science and has become what is more like a religion. There&#39;s no need for all of the mystical mathmagics to explain the standard model or the solar model when substituting electricity for gravity as the governing force in the universe, it just works and there&#39;s no need for any relativistic nonsense.

It might sound naive and juvenile at first but to answer it, it requires careful thinking. on to the question. Is radiation not considered a thing? I mean nothing can escape the event horizon or closer to the blackhole however we can observe x-ray radiation from it? so something can escape blackhole which renders the sentence &quot;nothing can escape blackhole&quot; untrue. Hawking radiation which is simply put, Stephan Hawking&#39;s theory that blackholes evaporate will also violate this rule. all im saying in, its looking like alot of things or stuff that we names for are escaping blackholes. I mean just consider a quasar or a giant super nova that is about to collapse further into a blackhole. All that gamm burst and further radiation of the stuff centrifugally out of a blackhole are all good candidates to violate the rule &quot;nothing can escape blackholes even light&quot;. I mean does light even want to escape it? is light considered a particle having a velocity meaning it emits from source and moves towards destination and having a sense of direction or are we talking about light as in its essence in terms of field theory? <br>This is as simple of a question as general relativity. how do you imagine a 3 diremsional space being warped? the trampoline analogy makes sense if you have a 2-dimensional surface with an active already-existing gravity that pulls down on the trampoline to even create the curvature needed to demonstrate &quot;gravity&quot;? This is a falacy. first course of upper division math in analysis teaches you to never assume what youre trying to prove. The only way general relativity appears to make sense is if you assume gravity exists and we all live in a planar universe. Ive been battling my own thoughts since i was in high school and im recently hearing theories of how Einstien may have been not fully correct in his idea of special and general relativity to explain gravity. like it or not, accept it or not, we are still not fully sure what gravity is and how its caused. anything with mass has a gravitational pull is a generalization more than an explanation. the strongest of the gravitational pulls exists between the lightest of particles. so mass does not proportionally explain gravity.

The fact of the matter is, objects heavier than a neutron star are identified as being black holes simply because they&#39;re heavier than neutron stars. The fact that gravitational waves are produced from the edge of a volume of mass and that objects said to be black holes have produced gravitational waves proves that they&#39;re not black holes as a gravitational wave, just like light,\u00a0would never be able to escape\u00a0the event horizon that lies outside of the edge of mass of a black hole. Physical principles such as the Uncertainty principle that reveals that a particle must have infinite momentum to have 0 motion and the Lorentz factors that require infinite energy/mass to obtain 0 time dilation prove that black holes can never come into existence. Where there is 0\u00a0time at the event horizon, there must also be 0 length and therefore a two-dimensional object of no depth that cannot exist in the universe. The only reason black holes are said to exist is because of John Wheeler stating that no force was known that could prevent the total gravitational collapse of mass beyond that of a neutron star. Not identifying a preventive force is not sufficient grounds for declaring an object to exist especially when the preventive factors from both quantum mechanics (Uncertainty principle) and relativity (Lorentz factors)\u00a0had already been known and have never been addressed in how they can be ignored to allow a black hole to exist. Even the concept of falling through an event horizon is based upon the concept of a black hole being a gravitational singularity which only comes about through changing the coordinate system of space to get such a result. The Schwarzschild coordinate system that is in accordance with general relativity shows that there is no space beyond the Schwarzschild radius to fall into. This, in itself, agrees with the Lorentz factor of length contraction that must be 0 at the Schwarzschild radius. Thus, general relativity has never predicted the existence of black holes as is often falsely claimed. Relativity in fact prohibits the existence of such objects. Massive objects heavier than neutron stars are just that, super massive objects. Currently not knowing what they are no more makes them black holes than it\u00a0makes them\u00a0tooth fairies, especially when we already know\u00a0the principles of physics that\u00a0prevent them from being black holes.", "comment_date": "2018-01-11T18:52:27Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Manu Dwivedi", "comment_text": "I have a question, might be stupid but I&#39;ll ask anyway, I thought the accretion disk of black holes because of the tremendous amount of heat produced in it would end up emitting a lot of heat in the form of light, so shouldn&#39;t they be quite bright instead, or do they only emit light in the X-ray spectrum.", "comment_date": "2018-01-11T18:50:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lars Ahrens", "comment_text": "I have heard that you can see sometimes 2 identical Stars or Galaxis next to each other because some object between the earth and the Star/Galaxi have so mutch Mass that the Light geht&#39;s bent around the Object so we can see them 2 times.
