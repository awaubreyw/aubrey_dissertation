For example, a laser is a high density collection of photons fired from a single source towards a single destination. There is no way to observe the light without photons interacting with the laser. However, if photons interact with the photons inside the laser, the photons in the lasers would be knocked out of path and continue on a different path. That means one can never directly observe a laser, but we do. ????<br>                                                 <br>                                       *       * <br>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII                       \\\\      \\\\<br>                  <b>*************</b> <b>*</b> *<br>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII                         *          *<br>                                           \\\\         \\\\<br>i know this might be very confusing, but it is very hard to explain for me, so sory in advance<br>Read more<br>REPLY<br>1<br><br><br><br>View all 3 replies<br> The opposite of a winner<br>The opposite of a winner<br>2 years ago<br>That was a Canadian dollar at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dRr-fnPCwM&amp;t=0m02s\">0:02</a> .<br>REPLY<br>1<br><br><br><br>Jyotishka Ray Choudhury<br>Jyotishka Ray Choudhury<br>9 months ago<br>The topic is amazingly interesting.

And the SMARTEST person alive today, Sir WALTER LEWIN, the physicist&#39;s physicist at MIT.. When the speaker CONTRADICTED the KNOWLEDGE gained from these GIANTS who allowed me to see further, said NEWTON with his statement &quot;LIGHT passes over LIGHT without INTERFERENCE &quot;at 14 seconds in, that&#39;s when the RED FLAG went up with this not being KNOWLEDGE, but simply INFORMATION, perhaps a SMART man&#39;s OPINION, but still simply an OPINION.. then he went on to add that &quot;just like ripples of WATER&quot; no INTERFERENCE, the waves pass right on by each other?  This is incorrect.  WAVES of AIR WATER and yes LIGHT can CONSTRUCTIVELY and DESTRUCTIVELY interfere and RESONATE in HARMONY.. alas LIFE said our CREATOR.
