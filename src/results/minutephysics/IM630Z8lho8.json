Presumably basing it on the distance across the Earth&#39;s surface (as I always had until seeing this video). Here&#39;s the quote, because you can never go wrong with a Douglas Adams quote, and context is a nice thing to have. Which, for those unfamiliar, this is taking place moments before the Earth is destroyed by alien construction workers to make way for a hyperspace bypass: <br>&quot;The barman looked at it and then looked at Ford. He suddenly shivered: he experienced a momentary sensation that he didn&#39;t understand because no one on Earth had ever experienced it before. In moments of great stress, every life form that exists gives out a tiny subliminal signal. This signal simply communicates an exact and almost pathetic sense of how far that being is from the place of his birth. On Earth it is never possible to be further than sixteen thousand miles from your birthplace, which really isn&#39;t very far, so such signals are too minute to be noticed. Ford Prefect was at this moment under great stress, and he was born 600 light years away in the near vicinity of Betelgeuse.&quot; (3.29)", "comment_date": "2022-07-17T17:29:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Physics Parth:-Easy Explainer", "comment_text": "Very nice explaination.... 1 week class in just a minutes awesome", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T03:48:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rosenberry", "comment_text": "POV: you listened to your math teacher but still doesn&#39;t understand anything<br><br>btw are imaginary numbers to us is like fractions to the ancient egyptians?

As explained in verses 4: 163-164, for all 313 Messengers from Noah to Muhammad, Lord\u2019s Book Adhikr was revealed. Adhikr revealed to Messenger Muhammad contains all the 312 previous Books and their upright Explanations as explained in verses 5: 48 and 16: 44. Whoever testifies and follows It, he will enter Paradise. The Arabic Quran reading hypocrites and their blind followers who hide and reject even the 40 names of Adhikr are the Fujjar who will enter Hell.<br>Islam is the natural way of life satisfied by the Creator Lord to all creatures from the first man Adam till the Last Day as explained in verses 3: 19 and 85. Every creature takes birth in Islam. Only the one who accepts Adhikr as the Guidance, Mercy, and Herald will become a true Muslim who submit wholly to Lord as told in verse 16: 89. And such one will only die as true Muslim as explained in verses 3: 101-102.<br>But today Islam is comparatively reflected more among Jains, Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Christians, atheists, etc. who belong to the Messenger Muhammad\u2019s community than his people who are undeservingly claiming that we are Muslims. They are the kafirs as told in verses 4: 150-151. The entire mankind from the appointment of Muhammad as the Messenger till the Last Day belongs to his \u2018community (Ummath)\u2019, whereas his \u2018people (Qoum)\u2019 includes addressees of Messenger\u2019s time, as well as the Arabic Quran reading Fujjar till the Last Day. The Fujjar are mentioned as the worthless people in verse 25: 18, the worst people in the land in verse 98: 6, and the worst creatures near Lord in verse 8: 22.<br>From among the last Messenger&#39;s people, only those who become believer utilizing Adhikr as the Ticket can only return to Paradise. The wrath affected hypocrites and their strayed followers mentioned in verse 1: 7 who are reading the Arabic Quran will return to Hell as told in verses 2: 39; 9: 67-68; 18: 101; 25: 34, 65-66, and 48: 6. No one can make anyone a believer. Adhikr is the Insight mentioned in verse 6: 104, Guidance mentioned in verse 17: 15, and the Truth mentioned in verses 10: 108 and 39: 41. So whoever transforms his/her Jinn soulmate mentioned in verses 43: 36-39 into a believer with Adhikr and changes his decree from ledger Sijjeen of Hell (83: 7) into ledger Illiyeen of Paradise (83: 18) can only become a believer who will only prosper.<br>On the Day of Judgment, mankind will be separated into three groups. (1) Companions of Right hand-those who will receive the Recording Book in the right hand and will enter the Paradise after Trial. It is told in verses 56: 38-40 that they are a portion from the early era (from Adam to Messenger Muhammad) and a portion from the last era (from the period of Messenger Muhammad to the Last Day). Today anyone from the community of Messenger Muhammad can include in this group if he/she is forming a belief in the Lord and Hereafter utilizing Adhikr and doing good deeds beneficial to 1000 communities of Lord\u2019s creatures. For that, there is no need of converting religion or costumes as seen today among Fujjar. From the people of Messenger Muhammad only one in a thousand as explained in verse 4: 118 who testify and follow Adhikr will be included in this group. (2) Companions of the left hand who will receive the Recording Book in the left hand include the hypocrites and their blind followers. The hypocrites and their blind followers are coming only from the people of 313 Messengers in all periods. Among them the hypocrites will enter Hell without Trial as explained in verse 4: 145 whereas their followers will enter Hell after Trial as explained in verse 39: 71. Today from mankind people of Messenger Muhammad are only included in this group. (3) The forerunners (Sabiqs) who will enter Paradise without Trial. Such are those who will be sitting nearest to Lord Allah in Paradise as told in verses 54: 54-55. Lord has explained through His Messenger that the number of forerunners to Paradise is 70,000 from among whole mankind. They are a large number from the early era whereas a few from the Last era. From the people (Quom) of Messenger Muhammad, there are only two Sabiqs (forerunners to Paradise). One is Ukkasha who was one of the comrades of Messenger, and the other is the Three-Time-Knower mentioned in verse 25: 59 who is the author of Adhikr which is the Best Interpretation of Lord\u2019s Book. The other Sabiqs from the last Era is from the other people belonging to Messenger&#39;s community (Ummath) who live here remembering the Lord with their soul and having no sexual passion as told in verses 56: 7-14. See explanation 3: 7-10; 4: 140 and 150-151.<br>Since today there is no group of believers anywhere in the world to witness Messenger\u2019s life upon other people belonging to Messenger Muhammad\u2019s community as explained in verses 2: 143 and 22: 78, they will not enter Hell. Instead, they will be sent to any other world than Paradise or Hell after drinking from the \u201cKouther lake\u201d, a drink with which no thirst will be felt ever after as explained in verses 108: 1-3. See explanation 4: 123-124 and 16: 97.<br>None can become a believer without the Permission of the Lord Adhikr as mentioned in verses 10: 99-100. Also, none has the right to select nation, religion, caste, parents, sex, the era of birth and death, color, etc. Therefore, the harmony of mankind is only advised. It can be only fulfilled by learning and propagating Adhikr which is the Food, Cloth, and Sight of the human soul.<br>There are 1000 communities of creatures including mankind on earth. Out of them, 400 communities are in the land and the rest 600 are in the water as explained in verse 6: 38. All the living, as well as non-living things in the universe, are praising and glorifying the Lord as told in verses 17: 44 and 24: 41. So it is the responsibility of mankind endowed with intelligence as the vicegerent of Lord to act for the wellbeing of whole creatures in the universe. For this, he/she has to involve, help and promote others in planting trees and organic farming.<br>The leaves of plants absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and excrete oxygen and water, thus they reduce air pollution due to carbon dioxide and thereby regulate atmospheric temperature. By absorbing the polluted water and fertilizers, the roots of plants help to maintain hygienic surroundings. The roots of plants also prevent soil erosion and help to maintain the fertility of the soil. The water vapors evaporated from the leaves cool the atmosphere and form the clouds which lead to rainfall. That is why rainfall over the forest areas is greater than that of other places. For all creatures both in the land and water, oxygenated atmospheric air is crucial for maintaining a healthy life. Therefore, we should plant trees and encourage others to do so (especially trees with fruits) anywhere as far as possible testifying Lord\u2019s teaching through His Messenger: \u201cYou plant trees even though you knew that tomorrow is the Dooms Day\u201d. Lord also taught through His Messenger: \u201cDuring the Last period you have to involve in cultivation and farming\u201d. The one who purified his soul with Adhikr which is the Book for Purification will only eat wholesome foods. Today, as wholesome foods are not available in the markets, we should involve and encourage others to do organic cultivation and farming intending not only for our own sake but also for the sake of whole creatures. We should discourage cultivations using artificial fertilizers and pesticides which are harmful to all creatures. Remember that all creatures excluding Jinn and mankind are always praying and glorifying Lord with their soul. So, it is the duty of mankind bestowed with intelligence to maintain the climate and ecosystem by utilizing Adhikr.<br>We should also aware the mankind about the hazards of hybrid genetic crops that cause cancer, blindness, and all such genetic disorders. We should discourage cutting down trees, demolition of the mountain (since mountains are the anchors and nails to keep the earth in its equilibrium), and construction of huge buildings especially in fields as well as in seas. It is a fact the proportionate presence of natural resources such as petroleum, coal, minerals, metals, etc. are maintaining the gravitational force of the earth. So, the unlimited mining of these resources will result in losing the magnetic power of the earth and thereby leads to Pole-shift. Today, the countries which are blessed with crude oil are rigging it without any restriction aiming their financial gains without considering the miserable consequences testifying verse 30: 41 which says: \u201cMischief is appeared on the land and in the sea because of what men\u2019s hands have earned, so that Lord may let them taste something of what they have earned so that they may turn back to the aim of life\u201d. The burning of petroleum products in vehicles and industries is causing air pollution which increases atmospheric temperature as well as decreases the magnetic field of Earth. Therefore, oh man! You try to be a man and not be a Kafir.

You&#39;re 1:00am is another person&#39;s 7:00pm. Therefore the twin that leaves on the Rocket in the Twins Paradox would actually be the same age as the twin that stayed on Earth and vise versa. WHY? Because we&#39;re only looking at this &quot;paradox&quot; from the Earth&#39;s POV. In the Rocket&#39;s POV, the Earth is moving at the speed of light because, again, what people call &quot;time&quot; is subjective.<br>In reality, Time is not bound to anyone and moves forward regardless of who is under the Sun and is therefore equal to all. A fundemental fact of the universe is that everything is in motion because the universe itself is spinning. We are actually moving at a 1000+ miles an hour in space and across the galaxy. <br><br>Einstein only came up with his &quot;theory&quot; after he observed a clock while heading home on a trolley. To him, the clock seemed to stand still as trolley gained speed and moved further away, thus he concluded that time moves slower for faster people. This is conclusion is Philosophical NOT Scientific because if someone else were put in the same position the clock wouldn&#39;t stop moving. IT&#39;S SUBJECTIVE. This phenomenon is similar to seeing clouds move if you stand still enough eventhough the car you&#39;re on is being driven at 40mph because, surprise surprise, clouds are actually moving and some move faster than cars.

So, use the model that is best suited to your purpose. As for teaching, you have to walk before you can run. General relativity is built on the back of a Newtonian theory of gravity.

And that\u2019s what this is, really: lying. There aren\u2019t three states of matter, there aren\u2019t five senses, etc.<br><br>But on the other hand, part of the challenge of teaching is breaking a complicated subject down into understandable packets that students can get. You don\u2019t start teaching math to an elementary student by saying \u201cnot only are there positive numbers, but negative numbers as well. Also, some numbers are just straight up not perfectly representable. Also there are imaginary numbers. The set of numbers is infinite, but in some circumstances countably so.\u201d You don\u2019t teach a seven year old the axioms of set theory and the set of all real and imaginary numbers. You say \u201cnumbers are things we count. 1, 2, 3...,\u201d and so on until they get that. Using their understanding of counting numbers, you can introduce zero, and negatives, and decimals, and irrationals, and so on. Knowledge is gained by expanding up knowledge that\u2019s already BEEN gained, it\u2019s recursive like that.<br><br>Similarly, saying things like \u201cgravity is affected by mass\u201d and \u201cthere are three states of matter\u201d and \u201cthere are five senses\u201d is, in my opinion, somewhat forgivable. No ten year old is gonna be able to understand special relativity, hell most adults can\u2019t. If a child doesn\u2019t even know what a gas is, how are they going to understand plasma? Or a Bose-Einstein Condensate? If a kid doesn\u2019t understand that sight is a sense, how could they ever understand the vestibular sense, or proprioception? Energy isn\u2019t really all that visible and concrete, but \u201cbig things are big\u201d certainly is.<br><br>The basis of all knowledge comes from things we can observe. That\u2019s why we HAVE to start small and concrete: counting numbers and base senses, solids/liquids/gas, etc. Once we\u2019ve gained a base understanding of this, we can use that knowledge to assess something else. Then, once we\u2019ve gained an understanding and acceptance of THAT, we can use it to gain more knowledge, etc. It builds upon itself.<br><br>Throwing someone who can\u2019t swim into the deep end will drown them. Teaching someone that 2+2=4 under the condition that you\u2019re working with base10 scalars in standard arithmetic will confuse them.

Hell, aren&#39;t you the guy that also released the video about how &quot;ignorant&quot; it is to apply the universal law of gravity on everyday objects with comparably tiny masses?? How is applying special relativity at a speed &lt;&lt; 0,1c any different from that? You can&#39;t measure ANY relativistic effects at your &quot;sheep on a train&quot; example.

The way you talk about it makes it seem you believe that for example special relativity is some kind of &quot;absolute truth&quot;.

Light or better to say a photon if it wouldnt move would have no mass. But light or photons are always moving, thats the reason it can archive the speed of light. If it would have a state where it wouldnt move it wouldnt be possible to archive the speed of light because a object with mass wich has a state of rest and is then accelerated cant reach the speed of light because it gains more and more energy, therefor it gains temperature and mass. At least thats the most logical theorie einstein has come up with and until yet no one can prove him wrong. So in a moving state a photon has energy, and temperature but also mass.

How far away are the objects we see in the sky? To determine how far away a star or galaxy is we use a principle called red shift, as I recall. It has to do with the shift of light waves over great distances, but if I have the name wrong, my apologies. If so just correct the name but don\u2019t just dismiss my point. Now that assumes a straight line, but what if the light you\u2019re seeing is not where you think it is? Remember that if gravity bends light then it\u2019s traveling in an arc past the source of the gravity and that if you put enough arcs together you can make a 90\u00b0 turn or greater. Also the closer the light is as it passes the gravity source and how strong that gravity source is will reflect how much the light is turned or bent. Now if you\u2019re not quite sure what I\u2019m getting at here is a simple experiment you can do. take a piece of string about 9 inches long. Place a piece of paper on the table. make the string tight and straight on top of the paper mark where the two ends are now holding the one end with one finger take a finger up from your other hand and nudge the string about 1 inch from the end then hold that point And with the figure from the other hand nudge the string about 1 inch from that point keep doing that down the full length of the string now it doesn\u2019t matter if you push the string One Direction or the other just nugget every inch just a little the full length and don\u2019t let that first movement be altered by the second movement. What you\u2019ll find is the other end of the string is now nowhere near it\u2019s starting point. all those little nudges created arcs and as we all know an arc is longer than a straight line. Now make a mark where the new position of the end of the string is and measure between the fixed end and the two different marks and you\u2019ll find the second Newmark for the other end is closer than the original mark for the second end. Now imagine the fixed end of your string is earth and the original point at the far end of the straight string is the perceived location of a star but in reality it\u2019s location is that new closer point from after moving the string. So if you use red shift to determine that a star on the other side of the Milky Way is 100,000 ly away wouldn\u2019t that star actually be closer and if so isn\u2019t the milky way smaller than we think? And what of those galaxies we see at the far reaches of the universe? If they\u2019re closer because the light has been bent and twisted and curved then wouldn\u2019t that mean the universe is expanding slower than we think? One other thought. the only experiment I know of to prove gravity bends light was to look at the shift of a star during an eclipse, but did they take in account that there could be gases around the sun and that the intense heat of the sun could\u2019ve altered, giving us the effect of refraction?<br><br>PLEASE consider this as food for thought. I do not wish to have a massive debate here in the comment section. This is just one of the issues that I find difficult to understand in physics. The other being how gravity affects time. Personally I believe gravity affects the way we measure time but not time itself. Think about the length of the year on mercury versus when you\u2019re on earth. Mercury being closer to the sun moves faster so a year there is shorter then here on earth. Also consider a pendulum clock will change speed depending on its altitude. at sea level it runs at one speed at the top of the mountains it will run at another. You need to change the length of the pendulum in order to get a Clock to run accurately at the two different altitudes. So here\u2019s my thought if gravity can affect this time measuring device what else could it affect that we might use to measure time? So Einstein\u2018s theory that gravity changes time, which was supposedly proven, leads me to question did it change time or affect the time piece, that device we used to measure the time? Just more food for thought.", "comment_date": "2019-01-17T04:55:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Esteban Quito", "comment_text": "Kids want the truth?<br><br>THEY CAN&#39;T HANDLE THE TRUTH!", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T20:32:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ayush Kumar", "comment_text": "You opened my eyes\ud83d\udc40", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T13:06:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "crazyshorts%", "comment_text": "POOR SHEEP", "comment_date": "2019-01-13T10:35:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "bbsonjohn", "comment_text": "All theories are false.

The problem with that is that energy and mass are identical which means we can always think of mass as the source of gravity and the attraction between two objects as due to their masses *only*.  Yes, photons are deflected by gravity fields, but we can consider that as due to the attraction between two masses, that of a celestial body and a photon.  As long as a photon has any energy, it will always have a mass associated with it and that mass will also have a tiny gravity field associated with it. But, one might object, if a photon has mass, then it&#39;s not supposed to be able to travel at light velocity.  Well, apparently, &quot;associated&quot; mass can!

The reason for this is that for many engineering problems, these kind of estimations are &quot;good enough&quot; to solve the problems (which is certainly true).  However, in my opinion, every time you shorten an equation for students, those students miss an opportunity to learn the TRUE equation which reveals the TRUE nature of the physics they are dealing with.  In my mind, this way of teaching is counterproductive because, while it may make it easier to solve some easy problems which thousands of engineers have already solved, it makes it impossible to think effectively about NEW problems, or to eventually solve more complex problems if your entire physics background has been nothing but a talked-down version of the truth!

The example of the 2 mph train and the 2 mph sheep on top not actually adding up to 4 mph is flawed, in that the acceptance of 2 mph being the speed at which either is moving inherently implies that the surface which both are moving along is genuinely flat. If not accepting that the terrain of this environment is flat, then the premise, that the train and sheep are moving at 2mph, is False, for the same reason why, as the video pointed out, if a person walks 20,000 kms across the Earth&#39;s surface, then they are not actually 20,000 kms away from their starting point, but only 12,000 kms from their starting point. So, there is a difference between distance travelled, and distance from original point, and clarifying whichever is meant, resolves any issues in the example of a train, and a sheep on the train, both moving at 2mph. In the end, it does add up to 4mph, if the surface is flat, or if the measurement is total distance travelled, and not final distance from the point of origin.<br><br>So, I think this is kind of a bogus video. It would be the same thing, to say that a person who walks 10 ft forward, and then 10 feet back to where they came from, did not actually travel 20 feet, because they&#39;re 0 feet from their original starting point.

The result is: c&#39;=c0(1+phi/c^2) where phi is the gravitational potential relative to the point where the speed of light co is measured. Simply put: Light appears to travel slower in stronger gravitational fields (near bigger mass). (...) You can find a more sophisticated derivation later by Einstein (1955) from the full theory of general relativity in the weak field approximation. (...) Namely the 1955 approximation shows a variation in km/sec twice as much as first predicted in 1911.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s6-01/6-01.htm\">http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s6-01/6-01.htm</a><br>\u00a0&quot;Specifically, Einstein wrote in 1911 that the speed of light at a place with the gravitational potential phi would be c(1+phi/c^2), where c is the nominal speed of light in the absence of gravity. In geometrical units we define c=1, so Einstein&#39;s 1911 formula can be written simply as c&#39;=1+phi. However, this formula for the speed of light (not to mention this whole approach to gravity) turned out to be incorrect, as Einstein realized during the years leading up to 1915 and the completion of the general theory.

ITS SPEED INCREASES AS IT IS FALLING. Hence, if we were to associate a frequency with that object the frequency should increase accordingly as it falls to earth. Because of the equivalence between gravitational and inertial mass, WE SHOULD OBSERVE THE SAME EFFECT FOR LIGHT. So lets shine a light beam from the top of a very tall building. If we can measure the frequency shift as the light beam descends the building, we should be able to discern how gravity affects a falling light beam. This was done by Pound and Rebka in 1960. They shone a light from the top of the Jefferson tower at Harvard and measured the frequency shift. The frequency shift was tiny but in agreement with the theoretical prediction. Consider a light beam that is travelling away from a gravitational field. Its frequency should shift to lower values. This is known as the gravitational red shift of light.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/redshift_white_dwarfs\">http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/redshift_white_dwarfs</a>\u00a0<br>\u00a0Albert Einstein Institute: &quot;One of the three classical tests for general relativity is the gravitational redshift of light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation.

A combination of Newtonian gravity, a particle theory of light, and the weak equivalence principle (gravitating mass equals inertial mass) suffices. (...)
