NO ONE KNOWS WHY OBJECTS WITH ENERGY AND MOMENTUM ATTRACT GRAVITATIONALLY!!!! But we will say resolutely that magnetism and gravity cannot be related. I may be wrong that they are related, but those who attempt to say authoritatively that gravity is not a force, do so without real evidence.  <br><br>If I drop iron, it hits the ground. If I drop helium, it hits the sky. Why is helium repulsed by mass until it gets to a specific level in the atmosphere? Like it is repulsed by a field. Repulsed with a force we can measure.  I would argue that each element has a gravitational balance it is trying to achieve. Helium at a specific energy level freely bonds to other helium. But it doesn&#39;t freely bond with all other elements at the same energy level that it freely bonds with other helium. We use energy to change the attraction between elements so they  bond with each other, but each element has a energy level where it best bonds with itself. I believe that is is caused by the force of gravity. Gravity seeks a neutral position where everything around it is gravitationally in balance with everything else around it. At different energy levels we overcome what the gravity of a specific element can bond with. <br><br>Because mass demonstrably bends time, we accept Einstein&#39;s theory that there is no gravitational force, making magnetism and gravity unrelated (if you choose to believe his conjecture).  He didn&#39;t prove that there is no gravitational force. From a science perspective this is basically magic that we accept as science because we can see and demonstrate that it works. There is strong reason to believe that the relationship between time and mass exist as he theorized, but he never demonstrates how mass bends time.  We accept, that because the larger principle has been shown to consistently predict things we can observe throughout the universe,  his entire theory then must be true.<br><br>I only know of a few instances where we can do work without the consumption of energy. Gravity and magnetism are two of them, and the more I look for evidence that I am wrong, the more I am convinced that Magnetism and Energy are two presentations of the same force. Magnetism being a unique state of gravity, where the positive and negative polls of gravity are visible and can attract or repulse matter with opposite disposition. What if the normal presentation of gravity is to attract, but with small imbalances across groups of mass, you get both a negative and positive presentation of gravitational forces. Not enough to break physical bonds, but enough to generate fields of gravity / magnetism that we view through the interaction of other objects?<br><br><br><br>I am interested in why I am wrong.", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T15:43:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian Buchan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAOXdXZ5TM&amp;t=0m26s\">0:26</a> Is there something moving along those lines that have arrows on them?", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T10:47:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sujal Timalsina", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96", "comment_date": "2020-11-01T07:07:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "krish :]", "comment_text": "thanks for veritasium and minute physics <br>behalf of explanation , the virtual animation is awesome and funny too \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-10-30T05:27:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alex Lo", "comment_text": "No explain on rare earth compound magnet.", "comment_date": "2020-10-29T21:02:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "She knows ", "comment_text": "just came from veritasium", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T00:37:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "One Man Orgy", "comment_text": "I have an easier time following explanations when I&#39;m not distracted by frozen foreheads.", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T00:34:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thaias", "comment_text": "<b><i>H E N N R Y ?</i></b>", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T21:33:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ravi yadav", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0c_YjWtcOZ8g6ANeHqMZywMcUXvEfM8c\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0c_YjWtcOZ8g6ANeHqMZywMcUXvEfM8c</a>", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T14:24:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Saulsbury", "comment_text": "Wow, this is amazing!

But metaphysical waves travel at near-infinite speed but not instantaneous. <br><br>When the metaphysical waves hit the barrier of physical dimension, some cruder waves bounce back while some subtler waves pass through. The cruder waves that bounce back hit the waves expanding out, forming metaphysical &#39;standing waves&#39; in the spacetime of physical reality. This creates pockets in space time that &#39;snags&#39; physical energies into single spots where they &#39;meet up&#39; or combine with other energies. <br><br>Some energies cancel their expansive momenta to settle in the pocket and block the energies that want to keep on expanding. The former energies are then called (or acquire) a &#39;negative&#39; charge, while the latter energies are called (or acquire) a &#39;positive&#39; charge. These opposing energies &#39;marry&#39; in the pocket to create particles. <br><br>If the pocket is big, a lot of particles form, creating matter. The concentration of energies in matter is also a concentration of metaphysical waves, since energy itself is a very crude version of such waves, just as the original standing wave that created the pocket in the first place was a combination of 2 waves -- one expanding and one bouncing back. This concentration of waves in concentrated energy then snags in more energies and particles and is called &#39;gravity&#39;. <br><br><br>Since metaphysical waves are the foundation of gravity, then it can be countered by making an object emit an opposite wave. This is done by yogi monks to levitate without using any external energy sources, and by UFOs which are small and do not need to carry huge fuel tanks or energy supplies. <br><br><br>So, why are particles charged?

So I hope I can do all of us a favour( including myself) by giving all of you a summary of this video. To make is relate as much as possible, I did it in the manner of question-answer:-<br>             THE FUNDAMENTALS OF MAGNETISM:-<br>Required Knowledge: <br>1. What are magnets?<br>2. Behavior of magnets?<br>3. A basic(even if it may be limited) understanding of quantum mechanics.<br>Summary:-<br>Magnets behave as they do due to the fact that they extend magnetic fields out beyond the object. <br><br>Question 1: Where do magnetic fields come from?<br>Answer: Magnetic and electric fields are different aspects of the same thing( two sides of the same coin; especially as a result of an ingenious solution in special relativity[in Veritasium\u2019s video]) i.e. they can be transformed into one another by way of motion causing electric fields to turn into magnetic fields for moving charged particles. <br>This explains many things we see in nature but something is still not quite good in our understanding.<br><br>Question 2: Iron and other metals are pieces of metal, what causes them to behave \u2018magnetically\u2019?<br>Answer: This is the first part of quantum mechanics helping us. Atoms have electrons moving in them. This is a particle with a property known as intrinsic magnetic moment which is a technical term for explaining that particles also behave as very \u201ctiny magnets\u201d. The reason behind why this happens is unclear(we don\u2019t know it). <br>Atoms consist of protons with electrons revolving around them. So we have another question from this observation(a subpart to this the answer of this question).<br><br>Question 2.1: Are atoms also tiny magnets? <br>Answer: Yes. Atoms generate magnetic fields called orbital magnetic fields. But these don\u2019t contribute due to the overall nature of magnetic fields in an atom. This is the second point where magnetic fields help us. Electrons are described in 4 sets of \u2018objects\u2019 in quantum mechanics-Principal shell, angular quantum number, magnetic quantum number and spin. We are interested in the last 2 for answering this question. We can use these 2 \u2018objects\u2019 to justify reasons for atoms  <br>1. In filled shells, electrons move around in all directions causing current to cancel out thereby not generating any magnetic fields. <br>2. Electrons come in pairs(Pauli Exclusion Principle) with their intrinsic magnetic moment(remember \u2018tiny magnet\u2019) pointing in opposite directions( have opposite spins) thereby cancelling out each other. <br>But this is only the case for fully-filled shells(having electron pairs and opposing spins). In half-filled shells, electrons are unpaired. This intrinsic magnetism in the outer shells which gives atoms a majority of its magnetic field. <br><br>But chromium(having a half filled shell) isnt magnetic. This is another question!<br><br>Question 3: Why isn\u2019t chromium magnetic?<br>Answer: This is due to the fact that there is a bigger scale to look at when considering this special case:Crystals. When atoms get together, they can either align their magnetic fields with each other or in the opposite direction. This is decided by whichever is the most stable. <br>This gives rise to the final piece of information to understand the nature of magnetic fields. <br><br>Question 4: Isn\u2019t is possible for a group of atoms to have a set of atoms lining one way and another set another way?<br>Answer:Yes but one can apply magnetic field/force/pressure strong enough to create a sort of control over the other group of atoms causing sort-of magnetic behavior. <br><br>Conclusion(TL;DR): Magnetism is a fundamental( and beautiful) result of quantum mechanics. <br><br><br>This was a summary, I hope it helped you all out. If it did, I\u2019m happy. But you can make me ever more happier by answering this question. Something I got out of natural curiosity. <br> Question BONUS: Is the behavior of magnetism and the intrinsic magnetic moment a reason for opposite spins and the existence of the Pauli Exclusion Principle?", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T03:42:34Z", "likes_count": 18}, {"comment_by": "theMetal973", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFAOXdXZ5TM&amp;t=0m06s\">0:06</a> But what if you put a piece of granite next to another piece of granite?", "comment_date": "2018-12-03T06:35:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Zuhair Mehdee", "comment_text": "What about neodimiyum", "comment_date": "2018-11-29T14:02:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DamnStupidOldIdiot", "comment_text": "Minutephysics&#39;s video:<br>Explains magnets.<br>Go to Veritasium&#39;s video.<br>Veritasium&#39;s video:<br>Explains elecromagnets.<br>Go to Minutephysics&#39;s video.<br>Help me I am stuck in a loop.", "comment_date": "2018-11-28T01:58:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ShadowBane", "comment_text": "Put in ft.

Faraday was highly dubious regarding Newtons conclusions about force. The fact is that the \u201cmissing three-fourths of the force\u201d is not lost whatsoever, the loss of mutual acceleration is in counterspace and mediated between both dielectricity and magnetism, both impelled by and \u2018lost\u2019 therein; this is a natural attribute to dielectricity, either as found in the so-\rcalled \u201cmagnet\u201d or in its aggregated form as found in mass/matter. Newton\u2019s equation is not about force, or as argued by others, tension, rather dielectric voidance. In which case we have the equation of Newton corrected: D.V. = M1 x M2/ Distance^2. All acceleration of bodies via gravity or \u201cmagnets\u201d are undergoing dielectric voidance, or magnetic (so-called) induction and resultant acceleration is the simplex process of dielectric voidance. The presumed increasing or decreasing \u2018force\u2019 is merely a field attribute necessitated by which spatial voidance is enacted to mediate the dielectric field voidances which eliminate space in their accelerations towards pressure voidances created by magnetism. Absolute acceleration is zero empirical movement, or perfect Ether inertia.  F=ma is correctly pertaining to \u201cmagnetism\u201d and gravity: Voidance = dielectricity as measured in mass x acceleration. As stated, magnetism cannot, has never attracted or accelerated anything, rather only causes dielectric coherency and resultant acceleration by means of dielectricity in voidance. Both gravity and so-called \u201cmagnetic attraction\u201d operate off the principle of shrinking spheres of dielectric voidance in which, as found in the case of both, the decreasing spherical area is proportional to the voidance and resulting acceleration. Faradays \u201cmissing three-fourths of the force\u201d is not missing, it is and always has been a \rtranslational exchange between increasing or decreasing space in which both magnetism and dielectricity mediate field pressures. -KEN WHEELER", "comment_date": "2017-09-21T17:10:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Collins", "comment_text": "Well, that didn&#39;t really explain magnetism.  It was a basic explanation of what&#39;s going on in a magnetic material, but what is going on inbetween two magnets that are separated?  I asked on a web forum what a magnetic field is made of, and I was told it is made of pseudo photons that jump in and out of electrons.  Now, I have never actually done this experiment on account of the limitations of my car, but if I were to take two magnets into inter-galactic space, where there are relatively few electrons for pseudo photons to jump in and out of, my understanding is that the two magnets would attract or repel each other the same as on earth.  Am I wrong?  Also, it seems likely to me that a magnetic field must distort the structure of space, which is trying (quite hard) to get back to its rest position.  Gravity does that too, and the distortion bends light.  Does a magnetic field do that?  If so, do the equations of relativity specify by how much?

A magnetic field is an ether vortex; a whirlpool in spacetime. Time flows, therefore space flows. Fluidic spacetime creates and UNcreates atomic matter at the same time. The universe flows into and out of matter constantly. NEGATIVE is where it flows in, POSITIVE is where it flows out. When the atoms or their magnetic domains line up, the flow is less impeded and reinforces into a toroidally rotating magnetic field which attracts with UNlike poles and repels like poles. Try putting the ends of two garden hoses together; the repelling effect is similar. That&#39;s because you&#39;re trying to reverse the overall flow of spacetime against itself. Conversely, the unlike poles will suck the magnets to each other. Spacetime is like a flowing river. The faster you travel to the speed of the river (the speed of light), the slower time travels relative to you. GRAVITY is also caused by the flow of spacetime.

Why?\n\nThanks", "comment_date": "2013-09-29T17:16:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OphiucusIncendia", "comment_text": "Who would have guess the internet meme magnets how do they work would one day teach people something about quantum mechanics. :) ", "comment_date": "2013-09-29T16:16:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Buckler", "comment_text": "Lets all face it.
