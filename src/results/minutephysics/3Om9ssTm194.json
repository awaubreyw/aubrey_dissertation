Assuming a computer or even a network to be smart, because it contains lots of data and can process computation fast, makes hardly any more sense, than assuming that your book shelf is very wise because of all the literature it is containing.<br><br>AI, as portrayed in science fiction, is a complete fantasy. And it most likely will always remain that way. Because &quot;AI&quot; has no agency of it&#39;s own. Computers of every kind are tools. And as such, they are as \u201csmart\u201d as the abacus, of which they originated from in principle. Compared to said abacus, computers have only gotten more complex in scale \u2013 not in principle. They are still mere tools.<br><br>Computation can solve many things - but not all things. Much less all at once. That is why programs, applications and robots are always VERY task specific. Because every task needs tailor made programming to allow applicable computation. And it comes with the territory, that specification also allows for a controlled environment. Because the more specific a task is, the less variables, which computation needs to account for, are possible by default. For the one thing, that AI absolutely sucks at, is unforeseen volatility. It doesn\u2019t compute and is impossible to plan for.<br><br>That is why programs work the best (by far) in merely virtual spaces. Because as long as something is just happening behind a screen or within the boundaries of a device, that makes for a highly controlled environment. But even in video games, for as fancy as they have become, AI is as dumb as it always has been. If anything, it\u2019s intrinsic shortcomings have become more obvious, because open world games lay it&#39;s crude nature brutally bare.

Now you might think &quot;of course that would be bad, the AI would go rogue and go against our wishes&quot;. But while it could go against our wishes, it&#39;s not doing it on purpose. One of the things with AI and just programs, in general, is how they interpret what we tell them to do. If I tell a program print(&quot;2 + 2&quot;); it&#39;s going to print &quot;2 + 2&quot;. I wanted it to say 4, but the program did exactly what I asked so the program didn&#39;t go rogue it just didn&#39;t have the same goal. If you ask an AI to protect humans, it might see humans and human leaders as a threat to humans and enslave humanity in order to most effectively protect humans. That&#39;s not what you wanted, but the AI did what you asked it to do. There becomes more complications too when you are attempting to train an AI. In order to grow, and AI needs feedback on how well it is doing, but giving an AI positive feedback whenever it doesn&#39;t do something bad may make it just do that instead of it&#39;s intended task. Giving an AI negative feedback when it does something bad may train it to avoid doing certain things when being watched by its creators, but the moment it&#39;s unwatched it switches to whatever is the most efficient method, no matter if it&#39;s bad or not.

That is nescessary because humans eventually die. But in comparison AIs would not be limited by their lifetime nor are they working to satisfy their needs. This AI would then be an immortal, all-knowing, super powerful being with no physical needs. The similarities with what we call a god are astonishing. Now there different mythologies that can be seen as different possible scenarios of a world dominated by AIs. <br>First we have the monotheistic religions that worship one god. This god is almighty omniscient and the highest instance of moral. And then there are the polytheistic religions that have several gods for different &quot;departments&quot; wich applied to the AI&#39;s would mean that numerous AI&#39;s all different in their abilities can collaborate and be addressed for different reasons.<br>Now there&#39;s one more metaphor: every religion is convinced to be the sole proper system and that all other religions are wrong or at least not as right as they are. So as religions try to proselytize AIs would probably fight each other, resulting in the victory one superior AI.

Smarter software will only make this easier and harder to detect. Corporations already track us and use algorithms to try and figure out how to make more profit from us. AI that can analyze all of what we post online, create media that we cannot distinguish from reality (writing, photo manipulation, and yes eventually video manipulation or even creation) for someone&#39;s own goals will give that person(s) terrifying power... and this is far before we have something that could ever &quot;think&quot; on it&#39;s own or create it&#39;s own goals.<br><br>But... once we do create an AI that is capable of creating it&#39;s own goals... how exactly do we ensure that it <b>never ever</b> does so or at least not goals we don&#39;t like?

It&#39;s behavior will be very dependant on they way it is done. Everyone of us has intelligence, and what do we do?? All our actions are basically programmed by nature. We feel hunger, thirst, sexual lust, instincts to protect ourselves, and we receive good feelings when succeeding at this tasks. What would intelligence do without those instincts? Nothing, just nothing. It won&#39;t probably even answer any of your questions cause why would it? It&#39;s most likely will be designed with certain instincts and desires like every living thing, and since we will be making it, we can set whatever we see fit, and it will pursue those instincts, with that intellectual power it has, all it&#39;s nature will be set by the designers.<br>The most important question is, what the fuck do you need AI for?? Make a better living?? Current technologies and resources are more than enough to make a perfect life for everyone! All that is needed is a global political and social reorganisation, AI has little to do with that. The one thing that isn&#39;t achieved yet is immortality.

Yudkowsky, so far as anyone knows, was homeschooled with no advanced degrees and pontificates prolifically on AI research. He is probably best known for creating the Internet community LessWrong, which is rather infamous for its eccentric brand of insularity. I strongly encourage anyone interested in AI research to look into the history of LessWrong and the writings of Yudkowsky and Bostrom to get a feel for the quality of &#39;research&#39; they put out.
