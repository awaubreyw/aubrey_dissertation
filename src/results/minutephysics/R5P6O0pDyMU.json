When I was in elementary school I remember the teacher showing us a prism and identifying the seven colors to us. I asked what that 8th color was and pointed at it. She said it was blue. I said, &quot;no, that really thin line right past blue.&quot; And she gave me a funny face and then ignore the question and moved on. It wasn&#39;t until years later that I learned that it wasn&#39;t normal to see 8 colors in a rainbow. It just so happens that I can see a wider range of colors than other people can. Whereas some people are tetrachromatic, having an additional cone oh, I&#39;m not. I just have a larger frequency range. One benefit of this is having Perfect Color acuity. Because I can distinguish a wider frequency band I can see differences in colors that other people can&#39;t. So in short, yeah, it is possible to see purple without mixing with other colors. It&#39;s just not a common ability.<br><br>I can&#39;t always differentiate between the blue and purple in a rainbow in the sky though for some reason. It is a really thin line to me, so sometimes it&#39;s just seven colors. Although, sometimes I even see 14 to 16 color rainbows, as I can occasionally see the colors blending together.

Today when we look up at the night sky all we hear is the distant sound of automobiles and we see the faint shine of the stars. The best way to see these plasma masses burning bright in the distance is to get as far away from civilization as possible. The lights of all the cars, buildings, and houses ruin the ambiance of the night sky. I wonder what the humans in the past heard, the chatter of friends and family along with the faint howling of wolves and dogs reaching out to the moon. Or did they hear nothing just the breeze as it gently blows across the dark silhouettes of trees and valleys of nothing but grass and a tree here and there. But complete silence fills in the empty spaces of when the breeze grows calm. They gaze up to see the brightness and colorful stars. They can feel the earth rotating under their feet and realize the size of the darkness that is space. The distant galaxies and planets across the vast abyss with no bridge long enough to span the chasm. It almost seems the darkness is infinite. With the earth being a spec floating in an endless room with no walls or floors. A tiny part of space. Would the darkness care if one planet disappeared, or will the vast space be enough to fulfill it and not even care, maybe not even realize that it was gone. Many questions have been brought to the attention of space, but we can not grasp the infinite darkness and endless rooms that we revolve in. There are really no definite answers to this topic. What we do know is this, we never had the intention of taking it all in at the same time, time is what we need, take things in a little at a time. This arouses the question of time. Does time really exist? Does it matter to the outer darkness of space, or does the darkness just revolve around nothingness? These questions can never really be answered so soon. We must take time to find out. Or will we find out? These questions need time to answer and i&#39;m sure a million years from now there will be an answer. Sadly humans probably will not be around to hear it. Maybe a different life form will exist doing what i am exactly doing, asking questions. We will never find out. This is just something that we will have to keep asking questions about. The answer will surface when the time is right and we have waited long enough. But sadly today is not that day these questions will be answered.

Also, what about people with tetrachromatic vision, how do led monitors look to their eyes?

Althought I imagine they were &quot;seeing&quot; only monochromatic IR light of that frequency, and it must have been a very intense light, but they saw just some dim, very dark red and hard to recognize outlines. If they were looking at the full visible light spectrum, the IR fequencies would be effectively blocked by the processing of visible light.
