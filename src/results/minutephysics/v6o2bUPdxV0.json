Yes, distant galaxies appear to be accelerating away from us ever more with distance and this is all based on the Doppler shifts to lower frequencies of photons of EM radiation from them reaching us.  BUT, are these decreases in photon frequencies really <b>all</b> due to Doppler shifts?  Maybe as those photons from distant galaxies travel toward our telescopes, they occasionally hit into the very tenuous concentrations hydrogen and helium gas atoms found in intergalactic space as well as occasional molecules and even microscopic dust particles.  That then causes them to lose a little energy and lowers their frequency which would then be giving our scientists the illusion that they were Doppler shifted more than they actually are and that the galaxies we see then <b>seem</b> to be accelerating away from us ever more with distance.", "comment_date": "2018-07-23T08:40:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M.
