If tide is caused by sea level changing the laser beam will always parallel to sea level. <br><br>Tide is an illusion of moon\u2019s gravity rising sea level. <br><br>Tide is coastal seabed moving up and down due to earth crust thermal expansion caused by sunlight energy.<br><br>Earth radius is 4000 miles. Thermal expansion causes crust bending up and down 50 feet in some coastal is easy to understand. <br><br>Think about momentum conservation. If the moon causes tide on earth, it will lose momentum constantly and falling to earth long long ago.<br><br>Why all scientists are so stupid? Simple phenomena as tide they cannot understand and created false theory to explain tide mechanism? Why all of them? <br><br>Water on earth is constantly falling to the lowest level. How can moon attract sea water to rise 50 feet high? How can moon make two water bulges moving around earth at thousand miles per hour at the equator? Why this kind of lie is in all textbooks?<br><br>If moon and sun gravity can rise water to produce tide, at solar eclipse matters will be less weight under the eclipse and heavier at the other side of the earth. Fact is matters always have the same weight no matter sun and moon position. <br><br>Scientists said they can measure moon\u2019s orbit decays few centimeters per year or volcanoes grow few centimeters per year, if true, surely they can measure Scotts Bay up and down 50 feet daily to produce the illusion of Fundy tide.u", "comment_date": "2022-06-18T07:15:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ng\u1ecdc Tu\u1ea5n Ph\u00f9ng", "comment_text": "But the Moon is flowing away from Earth, can it still be crack by Earth gravity ?", "comment_date": "2022-06-14T05:01:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vernon Hedge", "comment_text": "Sorry, the sheep analogy is not helping.

Everything has to be clearly defined and understood. Outer \u201cspace\u201d is not to be referred to as SPACE. Gravity, as it has been written, is an interaction. It is fundamental. The term inertia is now redefined as \u201cinertia/inertial resistance\u201d. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental. Einstein never nearly understood physics/physical experience. Here are the facts.<br><br>PRECISELY WHY AND HOW THE BALANCED, TOP DOWN, COMMON SENSE, SIMPLE, EXTENSIVE, AND CLEAR MATHEMATICAL UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS/PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE IS PROVEN BY (AND CONSISTENT WITH) F=MA AND E=MC2:<br><br>The following also CLEARLY explains why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution.<br><br>c squared represents a dimension of SPACE on balance WITH the fact that the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Indeed, the sky is blue; AND what is THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE (on balance) !! Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light (c) (ON BALANCE); AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is (CLEARLY AND necessarily) proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).<br><br>General Relativity is directly taken from Special Relativity. E=mc2 is taken directly from F=ma. CLEARLY, gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE); as the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) ON BALANCE. I have exposed Einstein. Beautiful.<br><br>Note: Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Think carefully about the black \u201cspace\u201d AS WELL. Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. THE EYE represents a two dimensional surface OR SPACE (ON BALANCE) that is consistent with F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN/ON BALANCE. Consider what is necessarily, CLEARLY, logically, and by definition the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE ON/IN BALANCE. GREAT !!! Think about what is true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY !!! Great.<br><br>Consider what is THE SUN. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GREAT. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This explains the fourth dimension AND the term c4 from Einstein&#39;s field equations. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental.<br><br>The gravitational \u201cfield\u201d is E=mc2 as F=ma. Consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider TIME (AND time dilation) on balance. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE. I have explained why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH/ground is ALSO BLUE. Carefully consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Consider what is the balanced MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE. E=mc2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE. That&#39;s the answer. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be gravity (ON/IN BALANCE).<br><br>Get a good LOOK at what are the fully illuminated (AND setting) Moon AND the orange AND setting Sun. Consider what is the blue sky ON BALANCE. Lava is orange, and it is even blood red. THINK !!! SO, ON BALANCE, consider what are the tides !!! Excellent. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Accordingly, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense; as BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Consider what is THE SUN ON BALANCE.
