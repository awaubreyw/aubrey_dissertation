You may have noticed at take-off leading-edge slats are extended downwards.  This causes a situation where the air is unable to get out of the way quickly enough (at take-off speed) so it gets bounced upwards.  It soon comes back down again however with the weight of the atmosphere pushing down on it.  This has the effect of creating a vacuum along the top of the wing,  otherwise known as a &#39;shock wave&#39;. Vacuums go where vacuums belong,  to the top of the atmosphere taking the plane with them.  At higher speeds the air can&#39;t keep up with the aircraft and creates drag so designers angle the wing back into the dragging shock wave cancelling much of the drag out.  By the &#39;sweep angle &#39; you can estimate the operational speed of a plane often.  When it crosses the sound barrier the bang is caused by the explosive collapse of the shock wave.  I&#39;ve seen these shock waves above aircraft wings when condensation formed along them.

Assume a wing is flying through the air at a constant horizontal velocity in stationary air.<br><br>The curves in the streamlines diagram around an airfoil indicate that there are four main acceleration zones.\r<br>\r<br>1.There is a compression accelerating zone even ahead and on and above the upper front part of the leading edge.\r<br>2. There is a suction accelerating zone after location (1) existing along the upper surface to the trailing edge.\r<br>3. There is a suction accelerating zone just behind the lower part of the leading edge. \r<br>4. There is a compression accelerating zone existing from location (3) going all the way under the lower surface to the trailing edge.\r<br>\r<br>All these four zones are easier seen on a highly cambered airfoil section. The practical meaning of these pressure suction zones could be interpreted as follows. Let us use the diagram shown at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg0TXNXgz-w&amp;t=0m53s\">0:53</a>.  Assume the mass of a stationary air/ fluid particle consists of a fat man holding an opened umbrella to create a piston effect. <br><br>\r<br>One fat stationary man, with an opened umbrella, located above the mean horizontal line, is hit ( compressed) and pushed   and vectored  up and accelerated up through action ( 1)  and the oncoming upper leading edge  angle will  vector and shoot the man up, but with him holding the open umbrella, a partial vacuum will be created behind the man, between the area of the umbrella and the surface of the wing, and so this partial vacuum will pull down the man and suck up the wing as it passes under the fat man to dump him later on over the trailing edge using  Action (2) <br><br>\r<br>A second fat stationary man, with an opened umbrella, located below the mean horizontal line,  is sucked up by action ( 3), and then the compression zone through action ( 4)   will push the fat man down and the reaction would be a push up on the undersurface of the wing, to later dumping the second fat man behind the trailing edge to join the first fat man being dumped from the upper surface behind the trailing edge. Both fat men can be regarded as having flown up and down in a quasi vertical manner as the wing slid horizontally.  Note that in real flying action, the two fat men with the umbrellas are operated upon by the actions indicated in zones 1. 2. 3. 4. and from the physical logic and time sequence of the actions/ reactions in these four zones, the upper-fat man will result in having a higher backward horizontal velocity than the lower fat man, due to the fact that one man was moving into an upper vectored suction zone and the other moving in an undersurface vectored compression zone, before both of them were dumped behind the trailing edge, not exactly vertically in actual wing behavior.  It is the summations of these quasi vertical accelerations of lumps/masses of fluid be it air or water, that make an air wing and a water foil fly., where the vertical accelerations contribute to lift and the horizontal acceleration causes drag.<br><br><br>These acceleration actions and dumpings are repeated on the massed fluid particles  existing  ahead of and distributed  <br>within a fairly large voluminous zone around the wing.", "comment_date": "2021-08-17T01:17:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Hughes", "comment_text": "Your so smart", "comment_date": "2021-08-16T01:31:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FullmoonEffects89", "comment_text": "Im still amazed at how its able to lift because of its weight and proportion.

Please help me!<br><br>The earth spins at a 1000 mph only at the equator because there the circumference is 24000 miles(:24hr). The circumference gets less and less untill it&#39;s basically 0 at either pole. A helicopter hovering at the equator would make a 24000 mile loop in a day while it would not make any kind of movement while hovering above the pole except off course the motions of flying around the sun and simultaneously around a black hole at speeds i cannot imagine. Just ignore these last 2 motions for convenience since they are constant and we don&#39;t notice them anyway. <br><br>U could say it would have to automatically make a pirouette above the pole though because if it doesn&#39;t automatically align to the earth the world would actually spin beneath the helicopter :P And yes I understand that flying an actual helicopter requires constant manual adjustment. This thought experiment exists on a world without wind with a perfectly balanced state of the art helicopter with unlimited fuel.<br><br>Say this helicopter were to fly from the equator straight over the pole to the other side of the planet . At take off it is going 1000 mph sideways along with the planet. Then this speed would have to decrease untill 0 mph because the circumference gets smaller as it flies toward the pole. After flying over the pole the speed would increase again but.. not only that! The direction at which it goes along with the earth actually changes to the opposite after flying over the pole. <br><br><br>The helicopter went from a sideways 1000 mph loop toward a 0 mph pirouette and then changed &quot;sideways&quot; direction after crossing over the pole to then accelerate to 1000 mph again untill it&#39;s destination on the other side of the planet. Besides this it went from a 90 degree angle to 0 and back again. For the helicopter &quot;down&quot; is always the center of the earth and regardless of it&#39;s own speed, direction and location the earth always seems stationary. Seen from space however it has to make all these movements to stay aligned with the earth.<br><br>Objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. This makes sense to me. What I don&#39;t understand is how <br>the speed relative to the earth gets automatically adjusted. According to Newton&#39;s law there has to be some force acting upon the helicopter so it can stay alligned with the earth. If there were no force acting on the helicopter it would keep going sideways at a 1000mph and after just a couple miles toward the pole the allignment would be broken and the helicopter would literally start moving sideways(relative to the earth) as well as forward. I know air friction is not the answer because that would be deadly. Gravity also doesn&#39;t answer my question. <br><br>So in short: <br>-How does the speed at which flying machines move along with the earth get automatically adjusted in relation to their position along the meridian?<br>-How is it possible that we don&#39;t feel the change in speed?<br>-How can a helicopter hover above the pole without seeing the earth beneath it spin? What makes it allign with the earth so the earth seems motionless?<br><br>If you&#39;ve made it this far I thank you for reading. I would love some respectfull answers to these questions burning on my mind. I have believed the earth is spherical all my life but I can&#39;t wrap my head around this! In fact I never even thought about it until I heard a believer of the flat earth mention it.<br><br>To those who don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m asking here I say : <br><br>If someone decides to smack u with the end of a broomstick. Would you rather he made the same movement with a stick of 10 cm(0.33 feet) or 100 cm(3.33 feet)? <br><br>The earth is a sphere. It spins around its axis. From the axis to the outside of the sphere is the &quot;radius&quot;. The radius is longest in the middle of the sphere. From the middle to the top and bottom(poles) the radius gets smaller and smaller. If u measure the sphere in the middle u get the length of the equator. If u measure it at any point at a 90 degree angle to the axis u get the circumference. The radius and circumference are directly related to each other. Because the earth revolves around it&#39;s axis once every 24 hours the time is set however the radius and circumference are variables. The longer the circumference the more distance is travelled in these 24 hours and so we get the 1000 mph at the equator of 24000 miles. The closer you get to the poles the smaller the circumference which means that the speed at which u move along with the earth gets lower and lower untill u are at 0mph at the pole.", "comment_date": "2020-12-28T10:12:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gregory Chalenko", "comment_text": "This understanding of physics behind the airplane wing is drastically different from how it&#39;s explained in every single pilot&#39;s textbook I&#39;ve read.

Typical wing design forces air passing over the wing to travel a further distance than air passing under the wing in the same amount of time, therefore making it move faster on the top than on the bottom. With the Bernoulli principle we know that when we increase velocity of a liquid or gas, we also decrease pressure. This is what creates the low pressure on the top of the wing and produces lift. You could have mentioned the equation used to calculate lift, and note that in the equation velocity is squared, making it a huge factor in the lift produced. Double the speed, and you quadruple the lift. That&#39;s why airplanes need to change the &quot;coefficient of lift&quot; of their wings to fly at slower speeds by lowering the flaps. <br><br>The air doesn&#39;t smash into the wing and bounce away like in your animation. If it did, the wing would stall. Look up videos on &quot;laminar flow&quot; vs &quot;turbulent flow&quot; to see. If the air didn&#39;t slide smoothly over the surfaces of the wing, it wouldn&#39;t be moving faster on the top than on the bottom and the lift would be significantly reduced, replaced by massive amounts of induced drag which the engines thrust would have to overcome. When the flow over the wing becomes &quot;turbulent&quot;, the wing stalls and the plane falls like a rock.<br><br>Love your videos!<br>Since this is a subject of which I have some knowledge, I figured I&#39;d share it.<br>Must have been an amazing experience seeing the A350 being built.

The thing to realise here is the increased collisions below is an increase in pressure on the wing from below.

they are sucked up.\u00a0 Look outside the next time you&#39;re in an airliner and see the lovely puckering of the wing skins.\u00a0 This is not because of the bending the wing is going through, that&#39;s the skin of the plane getting sucked off the ribs.\u00a0 Why this happens gets bantered around and people with scrambled letters after their name constantly go back and forth, taking credit every time as to why it works.\u00a0 How, is not really an important matter.\u00a0 What matters is that it is known how to shape an airfoil for the most efficient shape for the job at hand and let the phd&#39;s deal with the minutia.\u00a0<br>Prop planes are not thrust forward by their propellers.\u00a0 Again, correctly identified as wings, they SUCK the plane forward.\u00a0 While having nothing behind the propeller is ideal you can fairly much block off the area behind a propeller and yet still have propulsion.\u00a0 This is because the propeller is sucking the air in front of it and pushing it back just anywhere.\u00a0 Jet engines work differently though the high bypass ducted fans essentially do the same.\u00a0 Jet aircraft like fighter jets do not work on the suction of air into the engine they work off the expansion of that air by superheating it.\u00a0 Heating the air increases the volume of it dramatically.\u00a0 Easy to remember, Props suck what Jets blow.<br>It is a balancing act.\u00a0 Lift has to equal weight, thrust equal drag to maintain a static condition of the aircraft.<br>Airfoils for Civy air are generally optimized for upright flight.\u00a0 Many can be flown inverted by increasing the angle of attack to a point where the curvature of those airfoils is compensated for.\u00a0 Aerobatic airplanes tend to have an almost symmetrical but they commonly are optimized for more lift in the upright condition because that is the condition they land in.\u00a0 Modern Fighter aircraft, airliners and others have variable geometry wings.\u00a0 You&#39;ll see the leading edge of the aircraft move down, the trailing edge of the wing moved out and down increasing the camber of the wing (the curve downward of the wing) AND increasing the area of the wing dramatically as well.\u00a0 This increases drag greatly but also greatly increases lift allowing the plane to land at a much lower speed.\u00a0 At higher speeds you don&#39;t need that much camber or wing to balance lift and weight, it&#39;s a remarkable improvement over fixed shape wings.\u00a0 If you have a chance to watch F-16&#39;s or F-18&#39;s (more modern fighters) drop ordinance you&#39;ll usually get to see the wing vary geometry as the load is let go of.\u00a0 The flight computers compensate automatically on these aircraft, both upright and inverted, it&#39;s really cool.<br><br>But it&#39;s not the force on the bottom of the wing that generates the majority of the lift.\u00a0 A cooler video would be the demonstration of the fact that it&#39;s not the vaccum on the top of the wing that makes the plane fly-it&#39;s the propulsion of air from above it downward that makes the plane fly.\u00a0 I know it SOUNDS like a mixture of what I said and what he said but it&#39;s just a variation of what I said.\u00a0 Capture a picture of an airplane flying over a cloud bank and you&#39;ll see the downwash of the aircraft in the clouds.\u00a0 The mass of air is equal to the force needed to hold the plane up.\u00a0 Proponents of that theory say it isn&#39;t the lift on the top of the wing, the pushing from the bottom but the movement of the air only.<br><br>Trying to divine which force is the one responsible for the flying of aircraft is again and tug of war between phd&#39;s, a glory land of chest beating and hand shaking.\u00a0 The methods used to modify airfoils and wings for effect remain the same.\u00a0 Having run wind tunnel tests on many airfoils once factor also remained the same, up to shearing (the loss of flow over the top of the wing) the low pressure on the top of the wing is always more then the pressure on the bottom.\u00a0 Four to even higher.\u00a0 Loose that flow (called stalling) and the plane falls out of the air even with the pressure on the bottom of the wing.\u00a0<br><br>And why the premise of this video is incorrect.", "comment_date": "2015-04-08T21:58:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andres Gelrud", "comment_text": "Cool",

The famous stunt loop done at the unveiling of the 707 prototype comes to mind. As an airliner it was never meant to fly upside down and that loop did not actually do so, as it maintained light positive pressure on the underside of the wing throughout the maneuver the way that rollercoaster loops do to riders. But for stunt and fighter aircraft, true upside down flying can be done, but not very efficiently.<br>Take a look at one doing it in the next airshow you go to: it will have a much higher angle of attack during that phase. If it goes sideways at a level for a while(wings vertical to earth) the pilot will have put it into a slight climb first, and then the aircraft will be falling as fast as the inertia of the climb can counter that motion, or the fuselage angle of attack combined will allow it to remain level.<br>Bernoulli lift is more about the subtleties of the recombination of the two flows after the wing has passed through. Good differential wing curvatures can make this a quite efficient(lower drag) process.
