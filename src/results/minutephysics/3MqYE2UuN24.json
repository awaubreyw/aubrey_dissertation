I would say that safety wise, running may not be best. Instead, as mentioned, physics, or mostly just math, tells us we should go home as fast as possible. In practice, that means fast without falling into puddles, slipping and falling, causing an accident etc. Walking quickly is usually best, but not if the roads are really slippery. Just walking would be better. However, one doesnt need any engineer or scientist for that. Intuitively, we know all of this and take it into consideration. In more complex problems, this is less intuitive and we should think practically about all other problems. Not just the science. I have a tendency to get bogged down in the science sometimes. Many of my engineering colleagues get frustrated because of that. sometimes, thinking simply is much more useful than very accurate scientific analyses", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T08:45:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R Garlin", "comment_text": "Yep, makes sense!", "comment_date": "2022-07-07T16:54:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "magnus sir", "comment_text": "Instructions unclear, i dodged every drop of water on my way home", "comment_date": "2022-07-04T21:44:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZOXOXOXOXOZ", "comment_text": "\u8d70\u3063\u3066\u96e8\u306e\u4e2d\u3092\u901a\u308a\u904e\u304e\u3066\u96e8\u306e\u964d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u306a\u3044\u6240\u306b\u77ed\u6642\u9593\u3067\u8fbf\u308a\u7740\u3051\u3089\u308c\u308b\u306a\u3089\u8d70\u3063\u305f\u65b9\u304c\u6fe1\u308c\u306a\u3044\u308f\u3051\u3067\u3059\u304c<br>\u3067\u3082\u3082\u3057\u540c\u3058\u6642\u9593\u9577\u6642\u9593\u306b\u6e21\u3063\u3066\u96e8\u306e\u4e2d\u306b\u5c45\u308b\u306a\u3089\u8d70\u3063\u305f\u65b9\u304c\u30b9\u30ea\u30c3\u30d7\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30e0\u306b\u3088\u3063\u3066\u96e8\u3092\u5f8c\u65b9\u304b\u3089\u5f15\u304d\u5bc4\u305b\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046\u306e\u3067\u5c11\u3057\u6fe1\u308c\u3084\u3059\u304f\u306a\u308b\u3089\u3057\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d", "comment_date": "2022-07-02T11:56:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joris", "comment_text": "This reasoning neglects wind.

In very simple english. :)<br><br>The amount of rain that lands on your head purely depends on the amount of time outside in it.  therefore spending less time outside gets you rained on less. therefore you should speed up to spend less time outside.<br><br>The amount of rain you run into depends on distance travelled, assuming straight rain.  This mean speed doesn&#39;t matter for those purposes. it seems that you get more water in your face when you run, but the amount doesn&#39;t actually change.  The less time spent in the rain directly counteracts that effect.<br><br>Complications.<br><br>1) If you are travelling with the wind, you can reduce the amount of rain impacting you by moving at the speed of the wind.  But that may not be enough to overcome the time difference.  And that may be walking or running speed. and the wind may change direction or blow the wrong way.<br><br>2) If you are going to get completely soaked regardless (it&#39;s a long walk) then moving faster will cause more of a chill, due to wind chill effects.  So you may be better off walking at that point, depending on air temperature.<br><br>3) this changes completely if you have an umbrella. if you have one, it will keeps the rain out of your face. in this case, slower can be better, as if you go too fast the umbrella will block less.

In the opposite limit where you&#39;re the one who&#39;s effectively standing still, you can get hit by an unlimited number of drops.  While that argument alone isn&#39;t enough to prove there&#39;s no optimum speed in the middle (there isn&#39;t, for the reasons explained in the video), it&#39;s at least enough to convince you that while it may not be possible to run too fast, it&#39;s definitely possible to run too slow.<br><br>The advantage of focusing on limiting cases is that often they simplify the problem in ways that make it quicker to reason about, and easier to avoid making mistakes.  In this case, it&#39;s easier for me to compare &quot;running while the raindrops stand still&quot; vs. &quot;standing still in the rain&quot;, than it is for me to evaluate the situations of walking and running at various speeds through moving rain.<br><br>This sort of approach is useful in practical situations, and is a good trick for multiple choice questions, too.  E.g., if someone asked: &quot;Which keeps you driest? (A) running in the rain, (B) walking in the rain, or (C) they&#39;re the same&quot;.  By offering you only those choices, they&#39;ve ruled out the possibility that it depends on exactly how fast you walk vs. how fast you run.  And since we can quickly say that walking at tortoise speed is worse than running as fast as the Flash, we can conclude that the only viable answer is A.", "comment_date": "2021-05-26T21:21:45Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Mona lisa", "comment_text": "Basically... remember your umbrella", "comment_date": "2021-05-26T19:46:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bones", "comment_text": "Enough Internet for today", "comment_date": "2021-05-26T18:26:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rovver _", "comment_text": "If we add wind ?", "comment_date": "2021-05-26T16:56:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jemimah Rajakumar", "comment_text": "Lots of ppl are saying this is complicated and confusing but I honestly understand this better now.

Using the scientific principles derived from physics and retracting all known information from the science of precipitation, these brave scientists take into account any type of rainstorm that is bestowed upon the Earth. Calculating the utmost precise angle of every water droplet, broken down to the molecule, and taking into account the anatomy of the human body, they can finally come to a hypothetical theorem that indisputably describes the greatest efficient method of human movement through precipitate weather. Vessels will be thoroughly maintained with their findings, reducing the astronomical levels of humidity in a human being.

Dont forget that despite the evil in this world, God is full of justice, mercy and love. <br><br>Justice said we broke His perfect law - causing the world&#39;s previous perfection to be destroyed - and therefore we deserve Hell (like a punishment in any legal system but this is eternal as His perfect law is eternal too). Don&#39;t think you fit in that category? Ever done one of these?: lying, stealing - regardless of how small the object EVER, hating others - which is murder in God&#39;s perfect law, lusting (plus God sees our entire thought life). Justice says &quot;the soul that sins shall die&quot;.<br>BUT, mercy said &quot;I dont want to give them what they deserve. I don&#39;t want them to be cut off from Me. I love them despite all they have done/will do against Me. I want to give My children another chance. I want them to come home and live in My love again&quot;. <br><br>And love said &quot;Jesus, God&#39;s Son, came down as a Man, our representative, suffering every temptation, pain and struggle we have ever faced, yet without sin. He took all our sins (past/present/ even future) to the cross and then crucified EVERY ONE on our behalf. Justice was paid on the cross so that we can be free from Hell&#39;s punishment, experience Gods mercy of forgiveness of sin and live in His love. If we turn from the sins we have committed and repent (turn away from our sin and pursue the opposite direction of love through Christ) He will, overtime, recreate us back into that previously perfect image through The Holy Spirit which Jesus sends to all who accept Him as their personal Lord and Savior of their life.<br><br>He is in Heaven right now preparing a place for us so that He can take His faithful, believing children home with Him when He returns. He will ressurrect us from death when He returns, giving mercy to those who accept His love, instruction and teachings in their life, and give justice to those who refuse it.<br><br>He doesn&#39;t want ANY of us to go to Hell and die for continuing in evil and rejecting His way to life, thats why He died FOR us. He wants us to be His and begin to follow His life of love and service through Him (not ourselves as it&#39;s impossible without depending on His power and instruction). So long as we keep our hearts near to Christ through His strength, strive to obey His will of perfect love revealed in the Bible, and ask Him to help us in the midst of (very certain) pitfalls and struggles, we will, in time, win the victory over sin, pain and DEATH through Christ. Even if you are willing to be made willing, or struggling or doubtful, simply be honest and tell Him that. He is not intimidated by ANY sin or struggle you are facing. ANY. He hears and will answer. If we pray for Him to come in, regardless of the condition, then He will. <br><br>NOTE: You are NEVER too sinful or messed up that God cannot turn your life around through Jesus.

You are requested to make a video on this:<br>1.  When does the sun&#39;s magnetic polarity get reversed?<br>2.  What impact will it have on the Earth?<br>3.  Recently in 2020, the sun&#39;s polarity has been reversed, for the 25th cycle. When was the first cycle occurred?<br>4.  Approximately when will the 48th (final) cycle occur?<br>5.  What will happen, when the final 48th cycle occurs? Any disaster?<br>6.  Whenever the first cycle had occurred, before that had no polarity reversal cycle ever occured on the sun?<br>7.  Will the sun never ever change its polarity, after the 48th (final) cycle?<br>8.  If the answer to question 7 is that the polarity will stilll be changed even after that, then why is the 48th cycle considered as the final cycle?<br>9.  If after the 48th cycle, any new fresh cycle starts, then what will be different in the cycle? Why will be a fresh new cycle and not the 49th cycle?", "comment_date": "2021-02-15T01:15:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mi mizu", "comment_text":

You can see it in just the stick man drawings you have made in the video.  <br><br>I opened this video bc I\u2019ve been baffled about this ever since watching the myth busters episode where they try to actually test this, and despite attempts to control as many variables as possible and doing repeated runs to reduce noise, they kept finding that walking yielded less total moisture absorbed than running. <br><br>I am still confused as to why this discrepancy occurred\u2014not to mention the fact that the \u201cmyth\u201d exists in the first place (if the physical solution is so simple, why does the advice come about in the first place?).  I must admit, my own subjective, nonscientific, non-proofworthy anecdotal experience does actually jive with the \u201cfeeling\u201d that when I run a certain distance in the rain I end up \u201cfeeling\u201d much wetter than when I walk the same distance.

Since it is falling.<br><br><br>Thus, if we move instantly from point A to B, the quantity of rain will only be that present in the volume crossed. <br>Now if we stay 2 hours under the rain before moving instantly to point B, we will have the same amount of rain as in the other case, plus the amount of rain for 2 hours without moving below.<br><br>Now we can take into account the inclination of the rain in our calculations. The idea is to summarize a human to a series of simple parameters that describe him enough to be faithful to a real case. <br><br>We can reduce a human to its total surface, or rather its exposed surface. Its speed and exposure time, which mainly determine the amount of rain received from suspended rain (in L/m3) or the volume of water arriving on a given surface in a given time in L/s.<br>The two types of water measurement are related, but one is more practical than the other depending on the context. <br>It can be noticed that the higher the speed, the less important is the quantity of water arriving on the ground. If the speed is infinite, only the water in suspension matters. Conversely, if you are stationary, the water in suspension makes no difference: only the volume of water reaching the ground (on you: your surface) matters. <br><br>However, when taking all this into account, we always forget one thing: the water absorption capacity. Because once it is completely soaked, there is no point in avoiding water. But it&#39;s so difficult to soak your clothes, there is always an undergarment that is a little dry. <br>However, if you&#39;re going to face a tornado that has just crossed a lake... you might as well tell yourself: water is no longer your main problem. <br><br>You might wonder how fast you have to go to neglect the falling drops. -&gt; Too fast for a human. But technically it&#39;s better.<br><br>The calculation should look like this:<br>(Your speed divided by the distance to go) = time underwater <br>V / D = T<br><br>So, <br>Your speed multiplied by the time in the rain (or the distance travelled in the rain) multiplied by the amount of water suspended in 1 cubic metre. Plus, your exposed surface area multiplied by the volume of water arriving on 1m2 of floor, all multiplied by the time you remain exposed.<br><br>Se = exposed surface area<br>V = the speed <br>T = the time in the rain <br>D = V*T<br>Dw = density of water suspended in 1m3<br>Vw = speed of water<br>Qw = Dw*Vw<br><br>D(m)*Dw(L/m3)+T(s)*(Se(m2)*Qw)<br><br>So if you are under a heavy rain with 0.2L of water in 1m3 in suspension, where the water is going at 5m/sec. It arrives on 1m2: 1L/s<br>That you go at 2m/s (7km/h~) and that you run 10m: you will stay 5s in the rain. <br>And you will have taken 7L. Or 7 bottles of water of 1L.<br>While going at 20m/s (70km/h) you will receive 2.5L and a nomination for the world record.<br>More realistically going at 4m/s.<br>You will stay 2.5s, which brings us to 4.5L.<br>4.5L&lt;7L<br>Note that you cannot take less than 2L with and example. <br>So we have something like :<br>2L&lt;XL&lt;inf<br><br>Assuming you are 1m2 and the rain is falling straight. Or that your exposed area is 1m2 in total and the rain falls at any angle.<br><br>This explains why running is of real interest. Note that if you look at my equation, you can see that what matters most is the time you stay in the rain. Running also reduces this time. Of course you take more water per second if the rain doesn&#39;t come from above, but you reduce the time when it comes from the side and ultimately the total amount of water received.<br><br>Translated with <a href=\"http://www.deepl.com/Translator\">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a> (free version)", "comment_date": "2020-12-02T20:07:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pix3lus_", "comment_text": "Me an big brain<br><br><br><br><br>Bibbedy bobbedy rain go hoppedy", "comment_date": "2020-12-02T20:01:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheRandage", "comment_text": "Easy, get a fucking umbrella.

Also worth considering is the fact that raindrops hitting your sides are more likely to roll off, rather than make you wetter. Consider the extreme case, covering the distance to the building in a fraction of a second - the equivalent of a sheet of water hitting you all at once at a great speed - clearly going to make you wetter than the same water dipping against you over the course of several seconds and mostly rolling off. Getting gradually more ridiculous, an incredibly tall and thin person, or one with a small umbrella that only covers their vertical cross section might be better off waiting for the rain to stop than moving and incurring a greater wetness.", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T19:31:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PNXDA", "comment_text": "Honestly I just like to stand there in the rain", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T19:24:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Seydou Dia", "comment_text": "unless the wind is blowing in the direction you want to go", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T19:12:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Star Wars Tairique", "comment_text": "YouTube recommends videos like they haven\u2019t had new content since dropping the first trailer for Iron Man 1", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T19:10:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Henry Rowden", "comment_text": "This already got recommended to me like 2 years ago but I had to watch it again because I forgot the answer", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T19:08:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brado Pitto", "comment_text": "So no matter what you doing you are wet then", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T19:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrDomino820", "comment_text": "Me explaining to my teacher why im late:", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T18:58:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "mAson YE", "comment_text": "\u041d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043d\u044f\u043b", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T18:57:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eke", "comment_text": "Is it just me or has somebody else also wondered this when they were younger? oh just me..", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T18:44:25Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "vivek shiromani", "comment_text": "Hey creater of the video do you still get paid from this video", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T17:57:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marvel King", "comment_text": "When you actually had the answer before watching the video<br>\ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T17:26:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "3Clod", "comment_text": "lol that was nice, I always run in fact cause I prefer stay 1 second than 10 under the rain<br>but watching the windshield when on a car, and seeing thst the faster one goes the wetter becomes the glass, I wondered if I was doing right lol", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T17:17:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Left", "comment_text": "i slipped", "comment_date": "2020-09-28T17:01:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Voice Crack", "comment_text": "So run?

There is also water kick-up as I will call it, which is when you drag water off of the ground with your feet and into the air, some of it landing on the elevated or grounded leg. Since force = mass x acceleration and your leg has most upward acceleration while being lifted off the ground while running, the water-kickup factor is maximised while running. This will result in more water landing on you. The creator also didn\u2019t account for splashing, and since force = mass x acceleration, obviously downward and forward acceleration of the leg is greater while running, but your knee is bent to a more acute angle while running, meaning more rain falls on it from the top, making it more massive. This results in a much stronger splash force, which only wettens yourself more. This also applies to your arms. Although your arms don\u2019t come into contact with the ground, they will rub against your body more frequently while running, only spreading water faster. Since they are going back and forth so quickly, they are moving more distance horizontally - one could say almost double. This only gives them more time to run into or back into water. The arms are also at a more acute angle, meaning more water will land on them from the top.<br><br><br>Just one more thing - falling. Since balance = center of gravity/base of support, you are more likely to fall while running. This is because your center of gravity moves faster, not just because you are moving faster but because of your body leaning, and your base of support is moving faster and is less steady and supportive. While falling, you will come into contact with much more rain, and you come into contact with your height x width of rain area on the ground.

The rate of rainfall on your surface area changes as your speed changes because the angle of rain contact changes.<br><br><br>Your speed affects the angle at which the rain hits your front, which also affects how much rain hits your front. This is the same reason direct sunlight causes summer and angled sunlight causes winter. If you are standing still, the angle of rain contact on your front is zero, so no rain hits your front. If you run the same speed as the rain is falling, the angle will be 45. If you run run like the Flash, rain will hit you near 90 degrees and you will dodge any new rain falling from the sky. This is also why snow (without wind) looks like it is falling at an angle when you are driving in a car. Winter is cooler because the same amount of sun is spread over more surface area because the angle is smaller, like standing still or walking slow. Summer is hotter because sunlight hits the earth at 90 degrees or some other steep angle, like running in the rain. So, running faster increases how much rain hits the front of you. The rate of rain, such as ounce per second per square inch increases as surface area increases (due to the speed of the runner). As this rate increases, however, your travel time will decrease. Think about it like this: If you stand still, all the water above you will hit you. If you run light speed, none of the water above you will hit you, but all of the water in front of you will hit you, and it will hit at 90 degrees to your front surface. The only reason this would get you more wet is because your front has more surface area than your top.", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T22:10:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Carvajal", "comment_text": "Mythbusters did an episode on this...", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T22:04:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ilanit Dorani", "comment_text": "I am dumb AF", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T20:58:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EasyFinnish", "comment_text": "2020 no one gets wet", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T20:45:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chicle- _", "comment_text": "Let&#39;s be real, you did search for this..", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T19:58:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nnnn_9", "comment_text": "Youtube 2:30 am in 2020", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T19:31:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "A Fox With a Hat", "comment_text": "Is better to stay in home", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T17:56:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "coffee", "comment_text": "calculating<br><b>W E T N E S S</b>", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T17:46:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kuan", "comment_text": "Youtube: wanna know if you run or not during rain?<br><br>Me: hold up...

Your velocity relative to the velocity of the raindrops as they fall is important.  The rain is moving faster than you are, so the relative vectors change as your velocity increases.  More raindrops will hit you on the top of the head if you are moving slower than you could ever run into from the side.   The vectors balance out at approx. 10m/s, or the estimated terminal velocity of medium to large-sized raindrops.  It&#39;s only at THAT point that a change in your velocity, plus or minus, can be described in terms of limits.  <br><br><br>Think of it THIS way -  If you stood perfectly still,  every raindrop falling in your vertical column would land on you for as long as it was raining and for as long as you stood there, regardless of whether you have a destination or not.  As you move forward, if you&#39;re moving slower than 10m/s, every raindrop you dodge at the back is replaced by the one you run into at the front ONLY because you&#39;re moving slower than the raindrops are falling.  Once you exceed that speed, you&#39;ll hit raindrop from the side, but ONLY on the front, and only in the horizontal column for as far as you travel.  In fact, if you move at an infinite speed, you will only hit the raindrops that are directly in front of you, which would obviously be fewer drops than if you stood perfectly still or moved REALLY slowly.  If the two scenarios are going to be equal, then they must be equal at the extremes as well as the limits approach infinity or zero.  <br><br><br>It&#39;s actually even more significantly complex of a calculation than what&#39;s being described here, as it&#39;s not about the raindrops that hit you, but the rate at which they miss.  As you approach the velocity of the raindrops, you will get hit by fewer.

In other words,  <br><br>wetness = &quot;# of drops intercepted by both surfaces&quot; = (rain density)[A_1*d + A_2*v_rain*(distance/v_run)]<br><br>so the faster you run, the less wet you will get because the second term will shrink.
