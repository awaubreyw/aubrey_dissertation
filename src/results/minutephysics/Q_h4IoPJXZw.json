It is absolutely impossible to separate gravity, inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, and ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Einstein never nearly understood F=ma AND E=MC2 on balance. Here is the proof. Here are the facts and the fundamentals in FULL reply to your question.<br><br>UNDERSTANDING TIME (AND TIME DILATION) PURSUANT TO THE BALANCED, THEORETICAL, AND CLEAR MATHEMATICAL PROOF THAT E=MC2 IS F=MA (OF NECESSITY):<br><br>Stellar clustering ALSO proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy, AS E=MC2 is clearly F=ma IN BALANCE !!! This explains the fourth dimension AND the term c4 (from Einstein&#39;s field equations). Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that E=MC2 IS F=ma IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. Accordingly, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. So, it makes perfect sense that the planets will move away from WHAT IS THE SUN very, very, very SLIGHTLY. Carefully consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE !!! (Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. (Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE, AS E=MC2 IS clearly F=ma IN BALANCE.) Carefully consider what is the speed of light (c). A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light (c); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS clearly F=ma ON BALANCE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky !!! Indeed, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Carefully consider what is THE EARTH/ground AND what is THE EYE ON BALANCE !!! The sky is BLUE, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. THE EARTH is a BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE form in relation to the speed of light (c) AND what is THE SUN (AS what is a linked AND BALANCED opposite) pursuant to the universal (and CLEAR) fact that E=MC2 IS F=ma ON BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. E=MC2 IS clearly proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE. Carefully consider what is THE EARTH/ground !!! Great. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Accordingly, objects (AND WHAT IS the falling MAN) fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course); AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma ON BALANCE. Gravity is clearly ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy, AS E=MC2 is clearly F=ma IN BALANCE !!! It all CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=MC2 is clearly F=ma ON BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE !!! (Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is fundamental.) I have mathematically unified physics/physical experience, AS E=MC2 is CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE !!! GREAT !!!

Now we know that light as a wave because just like waves in water, if you run it through two slits it creates bars on the back wall equivalent to the shadow lines of wave tanks where the waves either amplify each other or cancel each other out. Now sometime in history, and I\u2019ll be honest I forget who it was who came up with this theory, said that light was acting like a particle by knocking electrons loose when it hits certain objects. But what if instead of being a billiard ball knocking the electron loose we look at the electrons as surfers and the light as waves. As the light wave of sufficient energy strikes the Object certain electrons in the proper orbit around the atom can take this energy wave and ride it like a surfer. No impact, no collusion, no particle.<br><br>Now consider if you release one photon of light, the smallest amount of light we know of. As it goes through the double slits it will hit the back wall but It will only be detected at one point. That point though will always comply with the rules decreed by wave theory. So why is it that it is only detected in one spot? Let\u2019s go back and look at water waves. If you look at waves in water you\u2019ll come across what is known as a rogue wave. A rogue wave is simply the amplitude of several waves amplifying each other. I theorize that this light wave is so weak that as it goes to the double slits there is only enough energy to create a singular Rogue Wave that is strong enough to be detected by the sensors. <br><br>Can I prove my theory? No. However if you think about it you will see that it eliminates the need for both waves and particles when it comes to light and the fact that light travels in waves is undeniable. Everyone excepts it. It has been proven over and over. I understand this goes against what most people have been taught or they just don\u2019t care and have never seen this information before, but remember, all science is theory so consider this theory without bias and see where it takes you. A simple theory where light is a wave and only a wave.

The double slit experiment makes perfect sense if light is a waveform because of the interference patterns. The reason people believe its a particle and wave could be partially due to the assumption that what they are emitting is light. If an electron is emitted, it will create an electromagnetic field around it much like a wake from a boat or when it impacts other matter. The electron itself is not light. This theory is very testable. perform the double slit experiment in a total vacuum, there should be no interference pattern.<br><br>Another reason why people believe light as it&#39;s particle form is because of the way it behaves in space. For example, how could light travel through space if its a vacuum, or why does a black hole or massive objects cause light to change direction.<br><br>This could be answered the same with sound waves. Does sound travel in space? No. Does Light travel in space? Actually no. Electrons striking the atmosphere impact create the electromagnetic wave which we see as light. If you were to put a camera in space, the electrons would contact the CCD on the camera and create the electromagnetic wave directly on the camera. But technically by this theory the light doesn&#39;t exist in space until it contacts matter. This makes perfect concerning black holes. black holes have a lot of mass, electrons have mass. The same could be said about sound in space, an object traveling in space hits your space helmet, you would hear it as the object would create the wave when it contacts you. So the sound doesn&#39;t travel in space, but you will hear it when it hits you.  black holes effect the trajectory of electrons, problem solved. According to common scientific belief, &quot;photons&quot; have no mass. How does gravity effect the path of light then? <br><br>My theory has huge consequences on the way everyone views the universe. Speed of light is not constant, just like sound. Sound travels slower or faster depending on the propagation medium just like light.  In fiber optics, this concept is known as refractive index, because light waves travel 1/3 slower through fiber optics.

Bubbles are often much larger than the particles they contain, and will pass through other bubbles of spacetime fabric without colliding. Upon impact with particles (matter) that are dense or fast moving enough to disperse the bubble (or more importantly the density of the spacetime fabric surrounding it), the bubble will break and the particle will be free to integrate with or bounce off the impact material.
