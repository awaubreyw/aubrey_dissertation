As time is in progress, moving forward every moment, then, space must be same, for spacetime to be. If so, then space is not absolute, as we currently think so. It can be considered absolute only when refered at a given time.<br>At zero time, space was also zero. At 1 second after beginning, space was absolute at 300k km across. As energy was the first substance of beginning and is bursting out at 300k km per sec. So, space is growing in tandem with time at the speed of light. <br><br>Space is to be taken as the volume of expanse that&#39;s engulfed by light or em energy. Or, we call this space, lighted space. And lighted space is that relevant component of spacetime. This engulfed volume, lighted space, grows by 300km across  per second. Such that, the current expanse of lighted space now is 14 b light years across, if the universe is taken to be 14 b yrs old. <br>Unlighted space is yet to be a component of space time. It s a domain yet to be occupied by light. So, space is of 2 parts. Lighted space and Unlighted space. <br><br>This is not to be taken as same to the expansion of the universe.

I have a question but a bit complicated for the comment section, I will try to summarize. Your idea of time dilation is you just think the other persons clock is moving slower because their light photons are moving slower towards you from your perspective. So time itself isn&#39;t changing, the same could be said of two blind people moving apart who use echolocation. Their time slows infinitely around 700mph STP, but that isn&#39;t the idea of special relativity. Light photons always move relative to you at the speed of light. For example a twin flies away at the speed of light and flies back in a year they should have aged less than you but if you use your graph they will be the same age. In fact with your graph there is no time dilation at all from an objective perspective, and gravity time dilation could be attributed to the same principle of light slowing when fighting gravity. Having searched the internet and only that, I find two different interpretations of special theory of relativity. Yours and the one popularized by interstellar in which when someone goes to an area of high gravity and comes back they have aged differently. So to summarize summarized please either respond or post in a video about what would happen if someone were to partake in a time dilating activity and return to their original position(for example the space traveling twins).

The Lorentz contraction \u02e0 represents the time dilation of Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity. We have energy \u2206E slowing the rate that time \u2206t flows as a universal process of energy exchange or continuous creation. Mass will increase relative to this process with gravity being a secondary force to the electromagnetic force. The c\u00b2 represents the speed of light c radiating out in a sphere 4\u03c0 of EMR from its radius forming a square c\u00b2 of probability. We have to square the probability of the wave-function \u03a8 because the area of the sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere multiplied by 4\u03c0. This simple geometrical process forms the probability and uncertainty of everyday life and at the smallest scale of the process is represented mathematically by Heisenberg\u2019s Uncertainty Principle \u2206\u00d7\u2206p\u1d6a\u2265h/4\u03c0. In such a theory we have an emergent future unfolding photon by photon \u2206E = hf with the movement of charge and flow of EM fields. This gives us a geometrical reason for positive and negative charge with a concaved inner surface for negative charge and a convexed outer surface for positive charge. The brackets in the equation (E=\u02e0M\u02f3C\u00b2)\u221e represent a dynamic boundary condition of an individual reference frame with an Arrow of Time or time line for each frame of reference. The infinity \u221e symbol represents an infinite number of dynamic interactive reference frames that are continuously coming in and out of existence. At the smallest scale the Planck constant \u0127=h/2\u03c0 is a constant of action in the dynamic geometrical process that we see and feel as the passage of time.", "comment_date": "2018-05-29T12:54:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "samarendra chandan bindu Dash", "comment_text": "I learnt relativity in my 12th .
