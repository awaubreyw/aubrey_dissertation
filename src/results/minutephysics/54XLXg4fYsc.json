In my comprehension that is impossible, because there is no controll-group or second try to test. And every wave meets different conditions. And if you confront the cases with size and density of the population, then there must be different progression. If the populationsize is great, then there  are to abide either higher cases per time or longer increase of cases. <br>With regard to east asia, there must be some special factor that cause such different progression. And that this is caused by the managemend, maybe did not fit with the fundamental principles of spreading viruses, where ther is even an increase to an maximum, where it must be decreasing, because of strucutral conditions in populations in their enviorment. It\u00b4s a typical infektion-progress in Populations, that it builds a waveform with a maximum and decreas. And you cannot explain with management, why in east asia only such less cases happend, where this wave declines much earlier and with much lesser cases, as in the rest in the world. This contradicts the usual theory of virusspreading and did a very significant different progres to the rest of the world.<br>But: The civilisation may must himself persuade, that it can do something, because if there is nothing to do against, then the civilisation runs out of controll easiest. The  Managemend-theory is only politics and therefor a lie.<br><br>And maybe there is a link to geneticaly differences. Because if you plott the geneticaly cards onto the causes-statistics, then you can identify some regularity relating to phylogenetic lines, where older phylogenetic groups are lesser affected then younger groups. And so you can explain the strange progres-difference between eastasia and north america. Or the less counts in india, because the population of india is realy great, but the cases are unexpected low (indeed for india you  must count a bigger dark figure to it).", "comment_date": "2022-02-24T16:44:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\ub0a8\uc54c\ub0a8NamRNam", "comment_text": "Ah...

However, I just checked the graph for South Korea with latest data and my theory being based on biology instead of physics seems to be true: Your development represents just an outlier. Each development should not be rated before it reached is stable state and unfortunately, South Korea faced a next wave which brought the country bakc to the satndard of all other countries. It would be nice, if you could update your plots in order to avoid false interpretation. Thank you very much! A general remark: I like your way of presenting the data and leaving out the timescale and plot the mechanism that&#39;s going on in a more pure way. Regarding the interpretation, we should keep biology in mind. Only almost full immunisation of population is a foundation for a stable state and an insurance to be protected from the virus. Even if an unprotected country should not face infection, it may be more vulnerable in similar infections in the future (which can be 100 years +). The people from Japan seem to have a protection of their immun system, as it looks like they were facing a similar thread many years ago in their evolutionary background. Regarding virus pandemia, it&#39;s better to overcome infection instead of getting not infected. Aside of vaccination (which should be a vaccine ending up with true immunity) a well founded immunesystem (good healthy condition of body and mind with good food, enough sports and without fear) is best way to lead population to crisis like this.", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T13:25:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Namos", "comment_text": "iran looks like a missle", "comment_date": "2022-02-20T11:30:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gimpinatoro", "comment_text": "Well, you have really nice content, but if you want to appeal not just people in the US, you should really stop using the imperial system when showcasing your information even if its not of your making.

If you&#39;re interested as to the reasoning behind this I recommend continuing your fascination with epidemiology and virology. The crux of this pandemic is the PCR test. Assuming every &quot;positive&quot; is indicative that the individual is infected with Covid-19 at the moment of the test is where it falls apart. This is scientifically not a true statement and why this test has not been used to determine other viral infections in the past. Additionally, the more you test, the less accurate the results become. This is a major factor in why we tested more in America and saw a higher rate of &quot;positive&quot; cases. <br><br>So yes, good study but much, most of your data is not scientifically sound. This sounds like conspiracy theory because it is. The news and media are pushing a narrative to deceive us into accepting a viral pandemic in order to impose mandates, print trillions of dollars, and embrace a vaccine that has killed thousands. The truth becomes obvious when you look into it and see the massive effort to hide these points and much more. <br><br>You&#39;re a smart person and I hope you can see that a single story is being forced through main stream sources while a massive amount of contrary data is suppressed and deleted. Every effort has been made to convince you that Covid-19 is a very real viral pandemic killing millions on a global scale. The truth is the numbers are so erroneous and conflated that we will probably never know the real extent of the virus. What we do know is that based on the data; shut downs, distancing, and masks appear to have very little to no affect on viral transmission (again based on erroneous numbers). And that the virus is over 99% survivable - much more than dozens of other virus&#39;.

The nonsense about vaccines for Covid-19 is Just that, Nonsense. \r<br>\r<br>Covid-19 is a Corona Virus. The same type of Virus as the common cold.\r<br>The common cold has killed 80,000 people a year, or more, every year, for over 200 years. Yet, despite this they still can&#39;t cure it because of the traits of the Virus.\r<br>\r<br>The same traits Covid-19 has, thus Covid-19 can&#39;t actually get a vaccine, ever.\r<br>Any vaccine they make would be nothing but a placebo, or only immunize you to one strain. Thus, it would be completely useless.\r<br>\r<br>Alternatively, it would require a brand new vaccine every 20 days or more just based on the number of strains we know already exist in just over 12 months. Namely, at minimum 16 in America alone.\r<br>As they can&#39;t get any working vaccine in over 12 months if they finally say they have one it would be a lie unless they completely reinvented the way they worked.\r<br>\r<br>As of now we would need no less than 16 different vaccines for Covid-19 as well as a brand new one every 20 days. This would then have to be sustainable forever.\r<br>That Mind you is the minimum.\r<br>\r<br>For the Cold they opt to treat the symptoms because it isn&#39;t that deadly.\r<br>\r<br>Here are the traits of a Corona Virus;\r<br>1. It is super contagious.\r<br>2. It is very quick to mutate especially when it is under siege. \r<br>Namely, exactly what we are doing with it. Hence why there is already more than 16 strains in America alone.\r<br>3. It is not very deadly. \r<br>\r<br>To prove this Point of Covid-19 not being very deadly, I will use the official numbers as of the moment of this post for America because America is as bad as all of the EU combined.\r<br>15,159,529 Total cases\r<br>288,906 Total deaths.\r<br>To find out what the mortality rate is you would divide the second number by the first and move the Decimal point 2 spaces to the left for the %\r<br>\r<br>This puts the Mortality rate at Just under 2%\r<br>1.9% to be exact\r<br>That is just above the normal common cold\r<br>At 1.3%\r<br>\r<br>The only Risk that Covid-19 poses that the Normal Common cold hasn&#39;t already posed for over 200 years is the slightly higher risk of secondary infection due to a slightly higher load on the immune system.\r<br>\r<br>In short, as long as you treat it like the common cold then you are likely fine even if you get it.\r<br>!. boost your immune system. IE Vitamin D and Vitamin C.\r<br>2. Treat the symptoms. \r<br>3. Then stay home if you are sick and get bed rest and eat chicken noodle soup. \r<br>You stay home and get bed rest so you can fight it off and So that you don&#39;t get sick with something that isn&#39;t Covid-19 while you have Covid-19. \r<br>\r<br>Covid-19 is Barely more dangerous than the Normal Common Cold.\r<br>In fact this panic and nonsense actually makes the risk it poses higher for a number of reasons.\r<br>1. It mutates faster when under siege.\r<br>2. Less outside =  less vitamin D, thus weaker immune system\r<br>3. The fact people are panicked they are not thinking clearly thus are acting in a way more likely to spread the virus not less likely.\r<br>\r<br>For just one example of us not thinking clearly leading to us actively increasing the spread.\r<br>We keep using Anti-Bacterial hand sanitizer to kill A Virus.\r<br>All While That doesn&#39;t kill viruses and it says it right on the Label.\r<br>&quot;Usable for killing Bacteria on the hands.&quot; \r<br>A Virus is NOT A Bacteria.\r<br>People who tell you otherwise would Fail a middle school level biology class.\r<br>\r<br>For a virus you would use soap and water. This is something you can acquire in any bathroom in most nations. This is also something we learned in Elementary school.\r<br>\r<br>The worst part is this is something that America&#39;s Top doctors have clearly Proven they Don&#39;t know with their own words.\r<br>Namely, Jerome Adams Surgeon General of the United States and Anthony Fauci American Doctor and high ranking member of the WHO.\r<br>They were the Idiots who started the Hand sanitizer nonsense, when we should be using soap and water.\r<br>Thus, they have both Proven that they are not capable of properly passing middle school level biology let alone capable of practicing medicine.\r<br>\r<br>Any illness can be a threat if we do what amounts to running around like headless chickens, and Not even our top doctors are capable of a middle school level understanding of Medical science.\r<br>\r<br>We should deal with this smart Not panic like we did with every illness until now.\r<br>\r<br>This is what Normal people can actually do that would actually work;\r<br>1. Wash your hands with soap and water regularly. NOT Hand sanitizer.\r<br>2. Do not touch your face after touching a potentially infected surface until you wash your hands.\r<br>3. Give people an arms length personal space.\r<br>4. get lots of vitamin D and Vitamin C. That means carrots, oranges, sun, milk and cheese\r<br>5 If you get sick stay home and get bed rest.\r<br>6. Treat the symptoms with the proper medication. Anti Fever medication for fever. Cough medication for cough, and so on.\r<br>7. Don&#39;t cough on people.\r<br>8. Some exercise to be healthier so you can more easily fight off illnesses.\r<br>9. Don&#39;t Panic!\r<br>10. A mask perhaps.\r<br>However, if even most people could do even some of the before mentioned 8 we likely wouldn&#39;t need them. Masks are only needed as an anti-idiot measure.\r<br>To pretend other wise shows you don&#39;t know the first thing about illnesses, nor history. \r<br>Sadly, most of our nation including most of our doctors are apparently total idiots. So for now a mask helps.\r<br>\r<br>These are all things we learned in elementary school.\r<br>\r<br>As for our leaders here is what they should do on top of those average people things;\r<br>1.  Fire Jerome Adams Surgeon General of the United States and Anthony Fauci American Doctor and high ranking member of the WHO.\r<br>2. Do not leave those positions vacant.\r<br>Actually replace them with people who could pass a middle school level biology class at the minimum.\r<br>The prior 2 is because their advice has actively made this problem worse consistently for months. Due mainly to their clearly complete lack of basic medical knowledge.\r<br>\r<br>3. Look at this as a common cold that is 1.5x to 2x more serious, that has a somewhat Unique trait of lowering a person&#39;s immune system.\r<br>This results in them being more at risk from other illnesses while they are sick with it, like aids does but on a lower level and for only around 2 weeks or so.\r<br>Mainly, because that is exactly what Covid-19 is.\r<br>\r<br>4. Give up on a vaccine, It will NOT happen, unless the vaccine is completely re-invented from the ground up.\r<br>5. Instead of a cure to prevent it as that won&#39;t happen, Come up with New effective treatments that can treat the illness or symptoms once people are sick.\r<br>Taking a double dose of the amount of Tylenol used fighting a normal cold, to lower fever, isn&#39;t sustainable.\r<br>Mainly, because Tylenol kills the liver.\r<br>That is actually far more deadly long term, than Covid-19 could ever be as Liver Failure tends to have a 70% death rate vs the less than 2% from Covid-19.\r<br>So, we need methods to deal with Covid-19 that doesn&#39;t increase the risk of death with prolonged use to 35 times the death rate of Covid-19\r<br>\r<br>6.

Since the beginning of April to the 12th July, the cumulative number of infections in South Africa has doubled about every 14 days. On 12 July 2020, 264,184 cumulative cases have been recorded, slightly more than double the 131,800 on 28 June, 14 days before. South Africa was firmly on track to record half a million cumulative infections by 25 July. Community spread appeared unstoppable. At that rate of increase, 1 million would have been infected by 8 August, 2 million by 22 August, 4 million by 5 September, 8 million by 19 September, 16 million by 3 October and some 32 million by 17 October 2020. That would represent 53% of the population of over 59 million people. The daily number of new infections should then have dropped off steeply.  On that trend, over the first two weeks of October, between one and two million new infections were likely to occur daily. The growth of new cases in adjoining areas, such as Zimbabwe, Namibia, Eswathini, Botswana and Lesotho was much, much slower.<br><br>However, on 13 July, the number of new cases in South Africa dropped significantly by about 1,440, or about 11%. The day before, the 12 July 2020, sales of alcoholic beverages were prohibited in South Africa, creating a false impression that the ban was the cause of the drop in numbers. However, this is false, because the normal lag period of some 5 to 10 days between the introduction of a new measure that is effective, and a reduction in case numbers, was completely absent, clearly identifying it as fake. This trend of a reduction of new cases continued daily and became progressively stronger. The result was that, today, 19 September, the official cumulative number of cases in South Africa stands at 657,627 instead of about 11.63 million, had the &#39;trend&#39; of doubling every 13 or 14 days continued. There is no rational reason for a ban on liquor sales to cause such a sudden, steep drop in new cases. Hence the conclusion is that, over the three-and-a-half months before 12 July, the numbers have been manipulated up, as were the numbers on recoveries. Death numbers, on the other hand, were manipulated down: <a href=\"https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-07-29-excess-deaths-soar-to-more-than-four-times-official-covid-19-toll-mrc-data-shows/\">https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2020-07-29-excess-deaths-soar-to-more-than-four-times-official-covid-19-toll-mrc-data-shows/</a>. <br><br>The question is, why have the case numbers been manipulated up? <br><br>Early this year, South Africa applied for an IMF loan of US$4.3 billion at a very low interest rate. On 27 July, the IMF publicly announced that the loan was granted -  <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/27/pr20271-south-africa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-billion-emergency-support-covid-19-pandemic\">https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/07/27/pr20271-south-africa-imf-executive-board-approves-us-billion-emergency-support-covid-19-pandemic</a>. Most likely, South Africa was informed of the grant earlier than the public announcement, perhaps around 12 July? Clearly, the numbers in South Africa have been manipulated up to impress on the IMF an urgent need for funds to fight the epidemic in the country. Most of the funds are likely to land in the pockets of corrupt people in positions of power and their family.<br><br>A further question is, what is the real motive for the ban on liquor sales? <br><br>The answer is that the ban on liquor sales will most likely drive many liquor stores out of business. The liquor trade is seen as lucrative, easy business. White owners of such businesses are exempt on a racist basis of financial assistance to weather the covid storm, including the IMF funds. Many of these businesses are likely to go bankrupt and be bought up at bargain prices by black politicians, their family members <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-31-ace-magashules-sons-each-bag-a-free-state-covid-19-contract/amp/?__twitter_impression=true\">https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-31-ace-magashules-sons-each-bag-a-free-state-covid-19-contract/amp/?__twitter_impression=true</a>, and other black business people, perhaps using some of the IMF funds paid for other contracts where contract prices have been loaded - <a href=\"https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sahrc-set-to-probe-gauteng-health-spending-amid-corruption-claims-20200730\">https://www.news24.com/news24/southafrica/news/covid-19-sahrc-set-to-probe-gauteng-health-spending-amid-corruption-claims-20200730</a><br>And <a href=\"https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-30-province-to-disclose-ppe-procurement-details-to-avoid-corruption/\">https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2020-07-30-province-to-disclose-ppe-procurement-details-to-avoid-corruption/</a><br>And <a href=\"https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-08-06-the-ppe-scandal-that-the-treasury-hasnt-touched/\">https://mg.co.za/coronavirus-essentials/2020-08-06-the-ppe-scandal-that-the-treasury-hasnt-touched/</a><br><br>Fraud and corruption assume many a guise.

And according to the news most of that is just from a single meat packing plant. Not community transmission, not gatherings, not from stores. So with that data why would the leaders here consider a total lockdown? they wouldn&#39;t because community transmission is almost nil and it&#39;s places where physical distance is impossible. After the original outbreak before measures were taken only 7 in my town got it. But once contained those recovered and there has not been any active cases for almost a month. And more towns and cities are near to being outbreak free. So one can see why the Alberta Government is considering relaxing restrictions on some things. perhaps on a local level as long as some kind of &quot;locals only&quot; plan can be followed. It will save small towns from oblivion and it&#39;s already at a point where some communities may never recover and end up ghost towns", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T04:10:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K M", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc&amp;t=1m31s\">1:31</a>  yes hey hello, fellow space enthusiast here :)", "comment_date": "2020-04-20T00:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James L Dickson Jr", "comment_text": "My apologies -- your link <a href=\"http://aatishb.com/covidtrends\">http://aatishb.com/covidtrends</a>  does exactly what I needed.

So why should we conclude that the Chinese government is \u2018hiding\u2019 numbers when it can only be assumed that they too didn\u2019t, and likely still don\u2019t have testing available. Second, if the Chinese were hiding numbers, why would they have released numbers after changing the diagnostics that caused a one-day jump of over something like 14k cases? Third, China was extremely aggressive in both quarantine and treatment early on. They built massive hospitals to treat anyone with symptoms in dormatory-style settings - whereas americans claim a lack of hospital beds because we demand private rooms for every patient. I recently saw footage from a makeshift hospital in NYC where each space could easily house at least three patients. China was in a unique situation, politically as well as culturally to address the crisis in a way that could not be replicated elsewhere. There is literally no reason to suspect the Chinese numbers are misrepresented intentionally, aside from wild speculation driven by anti-Chinese sentiments rooted in cold-war era bias.", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T02:36:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julien Cohen", "comment_text": "What if China lies on the figures?", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T00:05:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dmitry Levin", "comment_text": "Coronavirus Theme: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHNPP6hCgyA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHNPP6hCgyA</a>", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T23:02:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ill Uminate", "comment_text": "You are a brainwashed moron and I can prove it . 1)You believe that<br>(on 911) some cave dwellers with muskets were able to outsmart the<br>planets most sophisticated defence system and two planes made 3<br>buildings (dont forget building 7 like the commission report did)<br>collapse at free fall speed and dustify everything , leave pools of<br>molton steel and have a paper passport magically found in the dust .<br>2) You believe Bill Gates is a good guy who gives millions to charity<br>( that is peanuts to him and it pails against the billions he is<br>going to make from his magic vaccine that by the way not only<br>contains aborted human fetal tissue , toxins , but as a free bonus<br>this time will contain HYPER GEL with sensors to track and monitor<br>c/o D.A.R.P.A. ) Here\u2019s a fact : NAUGHTY<br>BILLY forgot to tell you what the vaccine insert 13 says for every<br>vaccine :&quot;THIS VACCINE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED FOR CARCINOGENIC<br>POTENTIAL , MUTAGENIC POTENTIAL AND IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY &quot; In<br>basic English If you get CANCER , TERMINAL ILLNESS THROUGH GENE<br>MUTATION OR CANNOT HAVE BABIES as a direct result of Billy&#39;s little<br>vaccine .

If this makes your brain hurt thinking about this reality, welcome to the world of long incubation, highly contagious novel bugs.<br>b.  this bug will mutate over time and we cannot predict when or how rapidly (or not) that happens.  For all we know, this specific c-19 virus was transmitted by a bat 40 years ago into the human pool and it has taken that long for it to change to become a disease causing bug.  or it may have taken just one day?  we just don&#39;t know that information.  And the reason we don&#39;t know this leads to the next discussion point<br>c.  The means to perform a field test relies on the sensitivity (accuracy) of a highly tooled focused PCR type test kit.  Even if the test is 100 percent accurate (they aren&#39;t and never can be)...it means that over time, as this virus changes even slightly there is a reality that yesterday&#39;s PCR sensitity is useless or possibly even worse, does not register a sufficiently accurate result....is it positive, or negative.  This means that every single field test performed, whether it is negative, positive, false-positive, or false-negative MUST be confirmed by a much more time consuming labratory level test that looks for new strain features..AND that correlates those strains with any new disease features...which leads to discussion point next<br>d.  the amount of logistics and time consumed and resources to test every single person daily with a field test is ridiculous to imagine possible.  Even more ridiculous is to imagine confirming daily all of those fields test by a CDC level (or it&#39;s equivalent lab)...and even more ridiculous is to imagine re-tooling the field PCR tests each time the strain mutates to maintain sensitivity levels sufficient for reliable clinical purposes of diagnosis on the ground...it&#39;s a non-stop loop of iterative work that will eventually fail for all of the most simple predictable reasons:  it&#39;s just not sustainable.  <br><br><br>okay...I go dream now.  <br><br><br>no...wait...one more line of thought.<br><br><br>there are 13 specie of bats known to carry a galaxy level number of unique corona virus...we KNOW of three that have been capable of zoonological transfer to humans and then human to human.  That we KNOW of.  (understand the implication here)...what does this really mean?<br><br><br>eventually, not if, but when, we will be doing this all over again at some point in time.  <br><br><br>think of this as our practice run.  in the big picture, our plans have to consider what we are going to do if we cannot fix our global pandemic controls properly.    Because right now, as people are at home isolating..you know what that RNA virus is doing ?  It&#39;s dealing with how to live among the domestic pets, birds, mice and rats.  And it&#39;s demonstrated efficiency in a way that should really be terrifying about the risks.  We are literally creating almost ideal conditions for this virus to find new paths, with results that are probably not going to work out very well for the human species.<br><br><br>all that brain mass...and this little rna bug is still winning.  huh...that&#39;s pretty interesting.", "comment_date": "2020-04-05T06:55:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TDM MCL", "comment_text": "there is other realities that disconnect regional outbreak data.<br><br><br>a.  social and age and gender demographics.  We KNOW this novel c-19 virus affects differently for causes that are not very clearly defined, but the empirical data shows these differences DO exist.  This means literally, that different geo-locations, populated differently and diversely will have different outcomes.<br><br><br>b.  each region will attempt different strategies.  mitigation, testing, suppression, isolation, distancing, controlled and uncontrolled therapies and experimental &quot;vaccines&quot; and &quot;therapies&quot;...We have to assume that this means data gathered from one place to another cannot seriously be compared one to another without understanding these implications and their results to the data.  This is one of many problems with developing &quot;remedies&quot;..no country is willing to sit idle as &quot;control&quot; to compare.  We are literally examining data that is attached to different trajectories for totally different causes.<br><br><br>c.  this c-19 virus (like so many other virus, and particularly corona type) is mutating ....the rate is not well established, but the KNOWN strains of significance are two major &quot;branches&quot; (L and S), with 19 known strains.  This means the effects of this virus is dynamic and not widely well documented with no serious means to predict how this will affect specific features going forward such as incubation period, lethality, asymptomatic spreading, maximum range of contagious state after first infection, re-infection (immunity) features, seasonal (heat) features (will this virus take the summer off, as SARS did, or will it continue year round in the summer as MERS has proven capable?<br><br><br>d.  where this get very uncertain is the nature of what happens when we introduce a host of experimental &quot;remedies&quot; into a large human pool in our attempt to &quot;cure&quot; this disease causing virus.  One of the reasons why seasonal flu &quot;comes back&quot; each year and requires a new vaccine type is directly related to how it dynamically responds to vaccinations.  And that is DNA based virus.  C-19 is an RNA based virus.  (yes, it&#39;s time to start studying to understand the implications here...spoiler:  not good!)...what happens when we challenge this virus with a cocktail of vaccines...plasma anti-virus.  Now, you might be thinking...of that&#39;s ok...it will be limited and controlled and if we get a undesirable result, we will halt the experiment.  That really nice to contemplate..but that isn&#39;t the reality.  Remember, we are dealing with a very highly contagious bug....and if we spin the clock back ...we will find (in theory and in reality) that patient zero happened..But there is clearly no evidence that this zoonological virus established all of its features in the animal vector before leaping.  It may have worked that way...Perhaps it may have performed that little magic trick in patient zero.  We DO NOT KNOW THIS.  and IT&#39;s EPICLY important.  But I doubt we will ever truly know this information.  The reason this is important to respect, even is because, we are going to be presented this virus with a certain pool of human who will be presenting a challenge for this virus to change again.  It could very well happen that way.  This is exactly what happens with &quot;seasonal&quot; flu.  We are going to be playing a high stakes game of whack-a-mole AND hoping that the controls are there to limit any possibility that any undesirable outcome is immediately KNOWN and that those &quot;new&quot; virus breeds are isolated from transmitting.  Anyone want to take a bet, there are no serious isolation methods being developed to prevent this?  Please don&#39;t take the bet.  The kinds of test being performed are no better to achieve the limit of the spread of any new &quot;frankenstein&quot; virus that may be created incidentally, than what actually exist right now.  These experiments aren&#39;t being conducted in some mine, or far away in antarctica ...nope...these experiments are being conducted like all trials before ...in rather sloppy very loosely controlled ....collecting the data might be easy..but there is a very real risk, we just may be about to create the super bug ...I&#39;m not a fearmonger..This IS a risk worth discussing.  I am not against experiments.....we just have to be EXTREMELY more diligent and conservative about what we are proposing and to have level 1000 tight controls.  This bug in its existing form has traveled globally in record time in modern history..and a rather high mortality rate, with a long incubation period...and the economic globally is in the tank.  there is a desperation level enthusiasm to ignore the wisdom of moving slow.

It is highly infectious because it infects by air-borne.<br><br><br><br>2. If the body temperature is below 36C, it grows very fast.<br><br><br><br>3. The destructive immune reaction will take some time (? 7-10 days) to<br><br>develop. Patients then start to have high fever.<br><br><br><br>4. During this period, if the body temperature is above 36.5C, and better<br><br>still, above 37C, the virus is attenuated or killed. Body will develop a<br><br>milder immune response and recover.<br><br><br><br>5. Patients with high fever can kill the virus. That is why CDC advocates<br><br>some patients recovered without anti-viral therapy.<br><br><br><br>Supports of this hypothesis are :<br><br><br><br>1. The victims usually stay in a cold environment for a reasonable time<br><br>after being infected, eg. in ward, hotel, aeroplane cabins, air-<br><br>conditioned offices.<br><br><br><br>2. This year, the climate in HK and Canton is extraordinarily cold and<br><br>persistent.<br><br><br><br>3. The weather in Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia is hot, so their<br><br>outbreaks are easily controlled. The air-conditioning in HK and Singapore<br><br>are too cool, so control is difficult. Canada ia again too cold, so the<br><br>outbreak is serious.<br><br><br><br>4. Children (especially under age of 8 years) in China are much less<br><br>affected because they have higher metabolic rate and they are more active<br><br>(eg. travel a long distance to school and many other physical activities).<br><br>Children in HK are very sedentary, their homes and schools are air-<br><br>conditioned. Therefore the infection incidence of children are same as<br><br>adults in HK.<br><br><br><br>5. Elderly and people with chronic illness have lower BMR. They have<br><br>higher incidence rate and mortality.<br><br><br><br>6. Coronavirus can be found in cats, dogs, pigeons, ducks and geese. They<br><br>are not infected because all of them have very high BMR.<br><br><br><br>7. It is well known that herbal medicine can increase the metabolic rate<br><br>and kill the virus. The herbs prescribed in Canton are commented by WHO to<br><br>be effective.<br><br><br><br>8. Passengers from an infected aeroplane cabin have a greater chance to<br><br>cause an outbreak in a cold place,<br><br><br><br>9. Pregnant women are much less infected. They have high BMR. Are those<br><br>500 contact pregnant women free from infection?<br><br><br><br>10. More data are required to analyse if active people (eg. outdoor<br><br>workers, labourers) are less prone to be infected.<br><br><br><br>Therefore, I would like to suggest a simple test to confirm this<br><br>hypothesis :<br><br>Incubate the virus at different temperature in human tissue media, say<br><br>below 36C, 36.5C, 37C, and above 37C.<br><br><br><br>If the hypothesis is correct, then control is straight forward :<br><br><br><br>1.

I am a Medicine Student myself in Germany and we fully expect the virus to have its projected High point of the Infection Rate in september. After this point the Infection Rate is expected to go down based on historic Data collected from earlier pandemics and Population studies, because many people will have developed asymptomatic (partial) immunity or had the symptoms alredy so the infection chain is interrupted. The main goal is to keep the Infection rate relatively low which on our Graph is correctly displayed as Growth, but without this Context it could be interpretet as Failure of containing this Health crisis. In reality the Quarantine is working better than you would read from the graph, because we are able to keep the infection rate low enough to not overencumber our intensive care Units for the seroius cases. So more important is the infected to dead and infected to recovered ratio imo.<br>Also a side note to the situation in China: They did many things right that many other countries failed to do like acting very quick and strict, but those numbers are always to be taken with caution referring to the last SARS corona situation and their information handling then. (but well those are the best numbers avaiable, seeing you took them from the JH university)<br><br><br>TLDR the main factor of how succesful the crisis management is that should be analyzed is the number of covid related deaths in each country and not neccesarily if there are new infections or not. <br>(i saw that its included in the interactive graph but your video focuses more o the infection rate, so i just wanted to point that out that this is a more powerful indicator)<br><br><br>some more very informative graphs and numbers:<br><a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/478220a4c454480e823b17327b2bf1d4\">https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/478220a4c454480e823b17327b2bf1d4</a> (numbers germany: Robert Koch Institute)<br><a href=\"https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd\">https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd</a> (numbers worldwide: WHO)<br><a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6</a> (numbers worldwide: John Hopkins University (slightly more up to date than WHO))", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T07:40:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "God link", "comment_text": "Cuz China reporting is totally truthful HAHA", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T07:36:45Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "william daley", "comment_text": "China is lying \ud83e\udd25", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T07:36:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shrew Zomad", "comment_text": "china ?! kkkkkkkk", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T07:33:41Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Exallus_", "comment_text": "China and south korea arent reporting so dont worry about them", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T07:27:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Super Man", "comment_text": "Anybody that uses data from China should understand that the value they plot for them is complete garbage.

Under the current scheme, little Lichtenstein will inevitably look like a hero; but not because their policies and techniques are the best!<br><br>Item 2: The stats from China are almost certainly falsified, as gobs of news stories are now reporting. It is, of course, true that China does things no free country would think to do; e.g., weld people into their homes, make medical care dependent on one&#39;s social credit score, etc. This allows draconian measures for epidemic control that the U.K. would (hopefully) never tolerate.<br><br>BUT, it is also true that the recent Chinese stats are impossible to take seriously. Merely comparing the mainland (where they can control and falsify information) to Hong Kong (where they can&#39;t) shows the disparity. If the stats from Wuhan are to be believed, one magical day a couple of weeks ago, they just stopped getting new cases, and the daily numbers since then have been a smooth, flat line (not the jagged bouncing line you get from real-world reporting with real delays).<br><br>And then there&#39;s the somewhat morbid observation: If the death rates have leveled off, why is it the crematoria still have an exponential increase in business, and a backlog?

Instead, plot the log of reported COVID deaths against linear time.  After all, what matters here is how many will die, not how many will cough.  Then interpret the changes in the slope as a function of lockdown measures.  Use this to project the trajectory of what will happen in countries like the USA based on the data for countries which locked down earlier.  This avoids unrealistic assumptions about lockdown effectiveness, such as those being made by Trump&#39;s advisors.  The varying mortality rate also essentially factors out since you are only looking at how policy affects the total mortality over time.  Said another way, how much you slow it down is independent of what percentage of people die.  Also, imperfection in the deaths data is unimportant as we can imagine it&#39;s about the same for all countries.  Using this approach, you should be able to quickly show extrapolations for the USA based on them adopting various degrees of lockdown over time.  For that, one can assume that they will repeat the policy path of others, that is, starting with loose lockdown (current status) and thereafter tightening it at specific dates.  Make it simple and just show the set of curves for going from the current status to total lockdown (similar to Italy or France) at various dates.  You should be able to quickly show that the total deaths will far exceed the 240,000 the government is predicting, and under all circumstances.

Particularly the death rate from medical causes (ie, excluding accidents, suicide/homicide, etc).<br>As you, and many others, have stated: we simply have no idea how many actual cases of coronavirus there are, and how many deaths can actually be attributed to it. There&#39;s quite a bit of speculation that coronavirus was already present and causing hospitalization or death months ago. If that is the case, it&#39;s not only possible but I would say likely that this virus has already infected a large number of people, much larger than we think. But because we&#39;re only testing those who we have reason to test (the people showing the most severe symptoms) we have drastically skewed data that is making us think things are much worse than they actually are.<br>When a pandemic like the 1918 flu strikes, the death rate spikes dramatically. Obviously. The number of people that are dying that wouldn&#39;t normally die is being elevated. The number of people having heart attacks, strokes, etc should be fairly constant, so if we see random, otherwise unexplained spikes in the overall death rate, and at the same time there is a pandemic sweeping humanity, that gives us a bit clearer of a look at things. We may not be able to test everyone for coronavirus or accurately attribute coronavirus to deaths, but even the most inefficient backwoods systems can generally tell you how many people have died during a certain period of time. If this number is spiking for no otherwise apparent reason, probably coronavirus.<br>I suspect we will see a slight elevation in deaths over the past few months. Coronavirus was setting in before anyone really cared. And I think it did start infecting people at an exponential rate, and we did start to see an exponential rise in deaths, but most people are able to fight it off like a common cold so no one really cared that much. It probably meant that people at high risk, ie the very old, the already sickly, and the most immuno-compromised, saw the highest death rates. But old people dying, pardon the callousness.... is not really news. Something was going to kill them, it turns out an extremely infectious but otherwise relatively mild contagion will do the trick. Once we noticed the trend, the alarms started to sound off and we became immensely focused. Even though we&#39;re quite likely well past the peak of infection, we only now start testing, and so to us this infection is &quot;starting&quot; to spread exponentially.<br>The rise in coronavirus cases probably has far more to do with measuring our ability to test for a disease than it does the actual presence and/or threat the disease poses.

And that will be the problem. These measures are so strict, keeping the measures for many months, maybe several years, while hoping for a vaccine might be more damaging than the virus itself in the long run. Even though it looks like China is getting control, it doesn&#39;t mean a second, third, even forth wave won&#39;t come. So how long is China willing to keep their country shut down and keep entire provinces under constant curfews? Some say a vaccine might be two years away, other say it&#39;s possible that we might never find a vaccine.<br><br>So the second a country ease up their protective measures, the virus will come back. And you&#39;ll have the whole situation again.<br><br>And another thing often not talked about is the mutations this virus is doing. A week ago Iceland found 40 different mutations of the virus, in a relative small number of infected. Viruses like these are programmed to make mutations, in order to survive when people develop immunity. This is probably what happened with the Spanish flu, as most peolpe who died from the Spanish flu died about one year in, during two big waves. These new waves was most likely caused by mutations, making the virus more deadly. Then, out of no-where, all of a sudden - the deaths stopped. No-one at the time knew why, but now we understand it was probably because a new mutation of the virus was defeating the other mutation; and this new mutation just happened to not be as deadly.<br><br>So, we might have mutations making this virus far worse than it is now causing new waves, or we might also have new mutations making this virus less dangerous.<br><br>The projection graphs like these are showing, shows the current situation - but we know of experience with viruses that they come in waves. So seeing numbers go down might just be a false sense of security. We&#39;re just seeing the first wave go down, we don&#39;t know how many waves there&#39;s gonna be.

Don&#39;t test it for safety, people will trust you if you say it&#39;s safe. Just tell them you can download porn really fast with it.<br><br>STEP 2 - Declare that there is a new virus in an area of the world where 5G is already rolled out. If there is high pollution in the area, even better. Wuhan, China as a totally random example. Do it in winter when people&#39;s immune systems are already suppressed.<br><br>STEP 3 - Start testing people for infection with an inaccurate test which no one even knows the accuracy of. Make sure it gives lots of false negatives and false positives for maximum uncertainty. Most people will just take the numbers of infected you present as fact.<br><br>STEP 4 - Focus on mainly testing people who are really sick. Use the excuse of test shortages and cost (legitimate excuses) for why most healthy people aren&#39;t being tested. That way it will look like the case fatality rate is much higher than reality. But just to help make it look real, 5G will help increase the real case fatality rate.<br><br>STEP 5 - Make sure the media goes all in on over hyping and fear mongering. Get most of the sellout alternative media on board too and make them hype it up even more. Focus on areas of the world with lots of old people and active 5G, like Northern Italy... And cruise ships. Convince people that where they live will end up just as bad and worse. Make people so paranoid that they overwhelm hospitals by coming in with the first sign of the sniffles. This zombie rush of paranoid idiots will make it appear that entire countries are getting sicker when mostly they are just getting increasingly paranoid. As a bonus, some people will become susceptible to sickness just by remaining in non-stop sleep deprived active adrenal paranoia. Even many practicing doctors and nurses may be fooled by the zombie onslaught, especially those in 5G areas.<br><br>STEP 6 - After weeks of testing very few people, start testing far more people at an exponential rate. T his will create the illusion that the outbreak is now spreading rapidly, when really tons of people would have likely tested positive back before anyone even knew there was a virus. If you time it right, it will look like a growing serious threat rather than an always present nothing-burger. For added effect, report that a (coincidentally disproportionate) number of politicians and famous people are infected. This is when the masses start to grow increasingly concerned rather than just a tiny minority<br><br>STEP 7 - Start counting people who die of the flu or other similar illnesses as dying of the pandemic virus to inflate the numbers. Symptoms are similar, so this isn&#39;t a stretch. Hundreds of thousands of people die each year from the flu, so this can make your fake pandemic look much more real by inflating your numbers.<br><br>STEP 8 - Wait until the perception of the pandemic is scary enough that people are demanding to be mass quarantined and think it&#39;s a fantastic idea and the only solution. Then start a slow motion quarantine rollout. Get the people to lead you to quarantine them instead of forcing it on them, to avoid resistance. Make it look like it wasn&#39;t your plan all along, but rather the only reasonable course of action.<br><br>STEP 9 (OPTION 1) - Keep things locked down until warmer sunnier weather decreases incidence of what is otherwise mostly normal symptoms of colds and flus (plus some 5G immune suppression). Declare that the quarantines were effective, and that without them, tens of millions would have died. Yay for big government! Yay for tyranny!<br><br>STEP 9 (OPTION 2) - Keep society under permanent medical martial law. With numbers never going up but not disappearing fully either. Perfect excuse for permanent tyranny. Especially in the midst of economic collapse which you will have created by now with the fear mongering and quarantines. Travel will remain heavily controlled as long as you want. People will accept the tyranny because they are terrified of the outbreak getting out of control.<br><br>STEP 10 - Eventually present a vaccine which most people take unquestioningly. After all the fear mongering and the quarantines, people will be completely paranoid and no longer thinking rationally (assuming they ever did at one time). This vaccine will mess with their immune system just like flu vaccines do. Ideally, add this to the yearly set of vaccinations. Get people to line up willingly to shorten their lifespans and make them more susceptible to a real pandemic. Don&#39;t worry, most people will not require evidence of efficacy nor safety. They still trust the government and media despite absolutely no reason to do so.<br><br>Congratulations!

Then, to all of those just mindlessly claiming you know absolutely everything about China, which you don&#39;t, here are some points to consider:<br><br><br>- China locked down the city of Wuhan when less than 500 cases were confirmed, and later the province of Hubei. What was your city / country doing when you had 500 cases? <br>- Looking back at the data in China, it was estimated that when Wuhan had 500 cases, it actually had more than 3000 because of the delay of symptoms and therefore missed tests. What was your city / country doing when you had 3000 cases? What were YOU Doing when you had 3000 cases?<br>- China built two hospitals with more than 1000 beds each, each within one week. What were your city / country doing when your hospitals were full?<br>- China had 34 provincial units, with a majority of them having millions of population. All of them have made huge amount of contributions to the province of Hubei, each helping one major city in Hubei to fight the virus. If you are in Europe, what were your fellow EU buddies doing when you are in need? Were they helping out with all possible resources, or were they trying to take advantage of goods that you are entitled with? If you are in the States, are other states helping out when your state is in trouble?<br>- When you blame China for its slow action, are you the same people who earlier blamed China for locking down Wuhan and therefore violating human rights? What on earth do you want it to do then? Apply a Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s lockdown?<br>- You (some countries) were given 1.5 months to brace yourselves for the virus, but what were your government saying in the early stages? I bet it is something along the lines of &quot;this is just a flu&quot; or &quot;everyone will be immune from it after they get it&quot;. <br><br><br>Of course, you might be able to tell from my broken English that I&#39;m a Chinese living in Canada, so you might just think all the above texts are paid by the CCP.

However, in late January, when China had already warned the world for thousand times and cases in U.S started rising, most of them were doing the worst things imaginable. They genuinely believed that COVID-19 = seasonal flu, and they kept attending massive festivals or going to giant cities during long weekends, in fact some of them are probably of those Miami spring breakers who were exposed to YouTube.\r<br>China started to act in around Jan 25th, since then, it was showing the world of its methods: massive lock downs, face masks, quarantine, which later been followed by the wise countries like South Korea. In around Feb 7th, the new hospitals were finished and the first testing kit was coming out. Chinese were sacrificing everything to fight back the virus. Back in those days, I read the case number every hour and phoned my family every day, I was desperately wanting to go back home. In mid February, the curve started to flat out, despite one day there were suddenly more than 10k of new cases detected, and that was due to an introduction of more efficient testing standard. \r<br>Sadly, after these informations reached western countries, they were transferred into tools of slandering China after been reported by medias like CNN and politicians like Mr. Trump and Pompeo. I kept telling my friends to avoid massive social activities and even shared my face masks with them, but they would always reject politely, I think it is because deep down in mind, they think China is not trustworthy. I felt so sad that I eventually couldn&#39;t stop them from risking themselves or their family members.\r<br>Judging from China&#39;s case vs time table, I successfully predicted that the burst of cases in U.S would start in early March. Judging from what Americans were doing to stop Covid-19, I predicted that the outbreak will be much, much worse than China during its worst time, so I abandoned the upcoming quarter and was able to catch up the last few flights back to China.

Pro tip, turn up the sound while your device is hooked to an external speaker with some bass and you will hear a Thump Thump Thump or whack whack whack, those are Chinook helicopters providing Steam, or clouds, or overcast Etc this provides them with cover. The helicopters they are using have silent mode especially when they hover, some people can hear them but most people cannot. If you live next to a railroad, or a highway, your chances of hearing them are better because the low hum of the railroads going by or Diesel Tires on the pavement diffuses the effect of the silent mode on these helicopters. I have not identified the smaller helicopter they&#39;re using, but in my area they are using red tandem helicopters or Chinook helicopters to lay this team and run back and forth about a 3/4 mile stretch. They are also deploying drones via Jets, very large ones, I&#39;ve seen this with my own eyes through binoculars. Step outside at night and take a look at the weird stars that were not there when you were a child. I noticed that most of them are part of a triangle. Some of these triangles are perfect. Pay close attention to those ones and the areas above them as a large jet will fly right over it, 30 to 90 seconds later you will have lights in the sky floating towards these triangles, they will join these triangles and the light will change to match those of the triangle. Side note, there are also other constellations like pyramids, or the Big Dipper. Without binoculars you will only be able to see one of these Big Dipper&#39;s, but with binoculars you will be able to see the next Zone over where they also have a big dipper oh, and the next Zone over where they have a big dipper Etc.

If you think China stopped testing to hide the numbers so &quot;no test = no new cases&quot;. This is due to the fact that the rate of infection is under control and the doctors and nurses assisting the severe regions are coming home. Some provinces in China already begin their business, and a few days ago they opened the blockade to HuBei<br>3.

Some say China is incompetent in reporting this virus.....China bought the world 6 weeks+ (reported in January) for preparing against the virus but no, most of the western countries just treat it like the common flu and some does not even report it, especially the mainstream media from the US, and look at what is happening now.<br>5.

China shut down several cities to save the citizens which cost one season of the economy. And look at some countries having &quot;human right&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;, they prioritize the economy over saving lives, I guess that is not worthing mentioning.<br>I also saw ppl comparing the data from China and US.

This virus will not stop until you put all your efforts to stop it or most of people get affected by this virus. In China and South Korea, the government did so much to stop it. However, in Europe and US, the government did not pay attention at the beginning and hasn&#39;t done much still. This virus will not kill much people if it&#39;s under controlled, but will kill lots of people once your medical system collapse because this virus spreads so fast and easily and no country can survive without enchancing the medical supports and quarantine. \r<br>Today people in China has returned to their regular life because they put so much efforts to stop this virus in the last 2 months. They saw what happened in Wuhan and they made a big move. They quarantine the whole city and even Hubei province where Wuhan is, so the virus will not keep spreading to the rest of China. And then they sent thousands of doctors and nurses, millions of medical equipments(masks, protective suits, respirator and ECMO) from other cities to Hubei. They built 2 hospital in 2 weeks in Wuhan, which everyone can see it from  24 hours live stream. People in China must stay at home for 2 months.  In Hubei province( include Wuhan ), people are not even allowed to go out shopping. But everything will be delivered to your home when you need it. In the rest of China, most of people use online shopping for everything which will be delivered to your home normally in 30 mins. Actually online shopping is normal in China nowadays. You can buy almost everything from internet. People still can go out shopping if necessary but with mask and keep distance from others. Government sent people to someone who need special care like elders and disables. The government also give a few masks to each family so they can use it when they go out shopping every week. They also organise people to set lots of small markets near your home. So you can easily go out to buy some foods, but also with mask and keep distance from others.\r<br>People do not follow the rules will get warning first, and will be forced to quarantine by police if they still don\u2019t want to do it. Because they know if they do not control this virus to spread, millions of people will get sick and die.\r<br>The prices for everything in China during this quarantine is not allowed to increase or you will get a millions dollars fine, which make sure everyone in China can still afford everything during this quarantine.\r<br>The Chinese medical staff has made a big sacrifice during this time. At the beginning, people knew nothing about this virus and so many doctors and nurses got affected by this virus. After they blocked the whole Hubei province, thousands of medical staffs went to help Hubei. Some of my friends are doctors in China, they told me that they all requested to volunteer to go Hubei as they know the hospitals there has already overloaded. During the last 2 months, you can see all these news and videos from internet, which showed you how hard they were working in Hubei. Everyone has to wear a protective suit, mask and glasses. During the first few weeks, they kept working hours( some of them worked 10-12 hours) without breaks, no food, no drinks, not even toilets. Why? Not because they are not allowed or human right violation(just like all western medias will say). Just because everytime they go eat, drink or toilet, they need to change a new protective suit. Everyone want to save the medical resource as they know they don\u2019t have enough and they might need more in the future. It is a horrible feeling when you wear a heavy protective suit for hours everyday. They have to wear adult diapers during work.\r<br>Have a look the link below, you will see what happened in Wuhan.\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9FVqwO4TM\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU9FVqwO4TM</a>", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T00:49:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Yu Cheng", "comment_text": "I thought humans are cancer to the earth, and now I realized that the CCP is a virus, much more aggressive and contagious, while the coronavirus is Earth\u2019s antibody.", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T00:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Cars", "comment_text": "I haven\u2019t seen the video by the way but the thumbnail is terrifying.

I had learned that this was an emerging science which dramatically improved the ability to tell if a child was cured of their Leukemia or not after their three years of traumatic treatments. If it detected more leukemia cells the doctors would just continue the treatments a little longer. The research showed that this greatly reduced the incidence of relapses, which was a serious problem because the OLD methods could not detect these residual cells as well. <br> <br>This written presentation was the result of an exhaustive research project that I conducted with the help of the Canadian Institute for Scientific and Technological Information or C.I.S.T.I., which provided me with over 900 of the most recent medical studies from around the world which dealt with the newest research in this field and I learned that from all the different attempts, the P.C.R. approach was the most promising. No doctor would have had the time or inclination to do this because it took six months of intensive work reviewing thousands of pages of material. I did it because I had the extra motivation of a child dealing with this disease and my training as a lawyer allowed me to review this mountain of material very quickly.<br>   <br>The doctors at the Montreal Children\u2019s Hospital actually adopted my suggestion about P.C.R. and applied it first to my own daughter, then to all children in our hospital and eventually to all children in our part of the country. I did NOT invent anything\u2026I just researched what other ALTERNATIVES were available and brought it to the attention of the doctors who were not yet aware of it. Dr. Baruchel reconfirmed my recollection of this whole story to me at a medical conference at McGill University years and years later\u2026which was very gratifying.<br><br>I recount this background only to establish that I am not some  \u201cconspiracy\u201d theorist or your average layman who swallows any crazy, unproven ALTERNATIVE idea without really checking it out thoroughly and to prove that non-medical, ordinary people CAN make a contribution...if you are properly motivated and DIVINELY inspired, which I feel I had to have been to have engaged in an initiative which was so far outside my field of expertise.<br><br>NOW...BACK TO THE FUTURE<br><i>___________________________</i><br> <br>We are currently dealing with the CORONA virus and prior to that the SARS virus, the MERS virus, the H1N1 virus, the SWINE FLU and the AVIAN FLU. It seems to never end and the apparent inability of the world\u2019s medical community to deal with these outbreaks in an effective and rapid time frame using the old conventional methods makes it IMPERATIVE for us to investigate ALTERNATIVE methods such as was developed by Dr. ROYAL RAYMOND RIFE.<br> <br>After again doing exhaustive research, I learned that Dr. RIFE was able to kill bacteria and VIRUS and other pathogens by blasting them with RADIO waves which were tuned to the SPECIFIC resident resonant frequency for that bug which made it &quot;explode&quot; without harming the patient. It took him over ten years of research and testing to develop this science and it was all based on the well-established science of RESONANCE. The high frequency generator he used and the treatment apparatus, a GLASS ELECTRODE was based on a NIKOLA TESLA invention, which lends further credibility to all of this.<br> <br>More importantly, this RIFE radio frequency therapy was proven 100% valid and showed its effectiveness in a controlled scientific study in 1934 conducted at The University of Southern California under the auspices of committee of top doctors. RIFE cured 16 out of 16 terminally ill CANCER and Tuberculosis patients. His technique was also used effectively on a list of 26 other catastrophic illnesses which he also attributed to \u201c micro-organisms\u201d, including VIRUS where each had it\u2019s own particular \u201c MORBID\u201d killer frequency. We now know that some cancers are caused by a virus and that so many diseases are caused by other microscopic pathogens.<br> <br>Rife&#39;s method was so successful that other doctors were already using it and the A.M.A. even tried to buy into his company. When RIFE and his partners refused, the A.M.A. banned the use of his RADIO FREQUENCY technique and prosecuted doctors using it! <br><br>In those days the A.M.A. was heavily financed by CIGARETTE companies! <br><br>Unlike other stories we hear about cures which are being kept secret and which have no credibility, RIFE and the A.M.A. ended up in court where all of these facts and the evidence of RIFE&#39;S claims were made a matter of public record and so this is not one of your typical unfounded \u201cconspiracy\u201d theories. In the light of this history it shocks me as incomprehensible that this methodology has not ever been properly investigated by the mainstream medical and pharmaceutical professions.... or maybe it is understandable...it is virtually FREE!<br> <br>Pundits today have dismissed RIFE\u2019s methods because although several companies have tried to revive this science and claim to sell RIFE machines, they have not replicated the exact killer frequencies of Dr. Rife&#39;s original methodology and they do not really work. The problem is due to the fact that when RIFE tried to commercialize his machines, his engineering partners decided to generate his frequencies in a different TWO-step fashion to hide and protect the identity of the original ONE step \u201ckiller\u201d frequencies used by RIFE because those could not be PATENT protected. By then the A.M.A. stepped in and banned the technology so Rife and his company had to shut down.<br><br>From my extensive research on this matter I believe that with today\u2019s technology we should be able to replicate Rife\u2019s original frequencies from SCRATCH and within a very short time. <br><br>We are already able to IDENTIFY a particular virus or other \u201c micro-organism\u201d responsible for an illness, like we did with this CORONA virus, relatively quickly, so that is not the problem\u2026the problem is killing it. If this RIFE radio frequency technique has any validity and actually works, we could find out very quickly by testing it to see if there is a specific frequency which kills certain pathogens like this CORONA virus.<br> <br>We can\u2019t be sure if RIFE\u2019s system really works but it is at least worthy of being properly investigated because the time has come to admit that the mainstream medical profession needs a PARADIGM SHIFT in the way we tackle these pathogens and that using an ALTERNATIVE mechanical weapon like RESONANCE instead of toxic drugs or slowly developing vaccines might be logical and might work. We spend so much time and money on other approaches which hit a dead end, we should at least put some time and money into checking out this particular ALTERNATIVE science properly and not leaving it only to the fringe underground science community.<br><br>What I am saying is that the historical accounts of the effectiveness of this RADIO FREQUENCY therapy invented by Royal Rife is compelling enough that we should at least demand that it be properly tested once and for all and not just continue with our conventional fragile system and slow methods. <br><br>The whole world economy and all of our daily lives are paralysed by this CORONA virus pandemic and is an embarrassment at this stage of human development.<br><br>We need to explore a NEW approach. If this RADIO FREQUENCY proves ineffective...I will be the first to dismiss it...but we should at the very least check it out and find out one way or the other. <br><br><br>At this point it has become obvious that the public itself must get involved because the mainstream medical and pharmaceutical communities have failed or refused to investigate this idea since the 1920&#39;s and have ignored it because it is virtually FREE and there is no profit in it...SHAME...SHAME...SHAME<br><br>Sincerely<br><br>LEON MALINIAK B.A., B.C.L.", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T16:13:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Holographic C", "comment_text": "It\u2019s just a mild cold Lol If humanity is that weak...", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T16:13:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sateg Llib", "comment_text": "china is not doing good.

It cuts through the noise and shows clearly what policies actually succeed against the virus. There are basically four kinds of response:<br>1. China (forced lock down, massive testing, isolation of positive patients). Near eradication - and I&#39;m really surprised how many people find this shocking. It works. China may well be a totalitarian state, but its hardly surprising that if you keep people absolutely isolated, the virus must die out.<br>2. States that have attempted something less than a lock down but have implemented very high levels of testing, tracking and surveillance (Singapore, South Korea, Japan). In absolute (linear) terms these countries have done very well, comparatively. However, the presentation here shows that these countries have achieved an unstable equilibrium. Maybe South Korea is close to effective eradication (exception being imports) but if they are, this boils down to very early intervention. Good luck to them.<br>3. Coutnries that have essentially sailed blind into this such as Italy, but have been forced to implement emergency measures such as lockdown. What you see here is a trend first towards a slower exponential growth and then towards linear growth (fixed cases per day). This is not what I&#39;d regard as control but its a platform upon which you can then implement mass testing and this will eventually see the virus trend to eradication. The UK is also in this group and its good that they are now talking about mass testing.<br>4. Countries like US (and potentially many others such as Brazil) with weak governance, fractured responses (divisions between levels of government) and worst of all, disinformation (yes, I&#39;m looking at you, Fox News). The US may eventually end up in group 3 as something like mass lock down happens (whether it is forced by government or by the body count). <br><br><br>Bottom line. It doesn&#39;t matter what you think of China.

Three &#39;countries&#39; (if we include the cruise ship Diamond Princess as a self-contained entity) have so far got off the main curve. One, Diamond Princess, would have naturally limited as it was a very small population effectively isolated from the outside world but with a much enhanced risk of transmission given the close quarters. China&#39;s figures, without wishing to minimise their efforts, have to be subject to some caution given their Government&#39;s initial denials and habitual manipulation of published statistics.<br><br><br>South Korea should be seen as a relatively reliable indicator; there is a democratic government, a well educated and connected populace and no prior record of systematic distortion of official statistics. However, the issue here is that the spread of the virus may have been atypical being largely focused around the rather secretive Shincheonji Church. The decline in growth seems to map to the church&#39;s change in stance. Initially it denied there was an issue and actively obstructed efforts to trace and isolate those with infections. The close proximity and large numbers of church members during worship made them a potent focus of infection. Once the church officially directed its members to cooperate with the medical authorities this seems to have had a significant impact on transmission rates.<br><br><br>Where does this leave us? The charts show that transmission follows a similar track wherever it occurs. If we can find more examples of countries where the growth in infections has reached a turning point then this would give more confidence in the charting. What these charts do not, in themselves, do is provide any way of predicting the point at which infection rates will begin to decline.

No one\u2019s \u2018winning\u2019 because there\u2019s too many stupid people out there passing it around, making it harder for us normal minded people to just continue living our usual lives. This isn\u2019t the 1300\u2019s anymore, yet even with our advanced technological advances, such a simple rule as STAY HOME will likely make this worse than the Bubonic Plague before it finally does plateau/end - assuming anyone will even return to normalcy afterward. By then everyone will be driven so mad by fear mongering they won\u2019t trust being close to anyone anymore.<br>These graphs have SEVERAL MAJOR problems and they\u2019re all because hardly any hard facts are known about it. Here\u2019s only a couple points:<br>1. It can live in the air and on certain surfaces for X time, but how much does weather affect it? When summer comes around for North America, it\u2019s logical to think it will hang around even longer.<br>2. The 14 day quarantine doesn\u2019t mean ANYTHING unless EVERYONE does it at the same time! Yes, eventually the \u2018new cases\u2019 stat will plateau and even descend, but if X people stay inside while Y morons don\u2019t, then X people just wasted their time because they might get infected the moment they step back out of their house and the stats become even worse from the relapse!<br>3. The \u20186 foot minimum\u2019 and \u201810 foot max gathering\u2019 rules are completely stupid and useless because of how germs work. A cough/sneeze doesn\u2019t stop at 6 feet - even covered SOME tiny portion will still be hanging around in the air! Then someone completely different might walk right through that cloud. As for the \u201810 person max\u2019, it\u2019s done far more harm than good to literally every aspect of human life. Just look at the unemployment rates because businesses had to shut down worldwide simply because they can\u2019t trust Y moron to STAY HOME!<br>Even if/when the world \u2018beats\u2019 this, it will still take years for the public to recover - again assuming it ever does. For a perfect example here, look at how the US still hasn\u2019t fully recovered from 9/11 because of all the stupid regulations that were put in place and are still around!

Navarro said that given the outbreak in China, the MEDICAL supply chain should be transferred from China to the United States;<br><br>4. China shared the New Coronavirus gene sequence for the first time, allowing countries to produce test reagents accordingly, and to promote the development of vaccines. Trump PRAISED China&#39;s transparency in the early stage, and later said that China is not making the information transparent ENOUGH. <br><br>5. Trump said that everything is UNDER CONTROL, that the US have done it VERY WELL. The risk of corona virus outbreak is very LOW. It may disappear &quot;as it is.&quot;<br><br>6. The U.S. government announced  $ 100 million in aid to the affected countries, but NO MONEY was allocated.<br><br>7. When China announced the LOCKDOWN of Wuhan, the US public opinion began to talk about HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOM; when China built wartime HOSPITALS, US public opinion began to talk about CONCENTRATION CAMP AND MENTAL ILLNESS; when China MOBILIZED NATIONAL RESOURCE to ASSIST Hubei, and US public opinion questioned WHO officials: Is it not because of AUTOCRACY ?<br><br>8. Some members of parliament like Burr said &quot;NOTHING&quot; before everyone, yet SOLD STOCKS SECRETLY IN ADVANCE in fear of going bankrupt; <br><br>9. The U.S. epidemic has begun to spread. Trump said he would NOT bear ANY responsibility for this because his predecessor owed too much. In fact, Obama established the Office of Global Health Security and Biological Defense that can coordinate national health-related departments, but the Office of Biodefense has been disbanded by Trump in 2018, leading to no response to the epidemic;<br><br>10.

On the other hand, the detection of high-income people is SMOOTH, including criminals with high social status. ;<br><br>11.

The same goes for South Korea.<br><br>But here is the important bit. Notice how every country that dropped off the average trajectory, eventually increased, again leading back to the normal path? You have to look at the very first drop offs, they rebounded... and the later drop offs were low when the graph stopped... but Qatar, China, Japan, South Korea, all had an uptick. First, it is important to know that they still had new cases... they only slowed the cases, and even then the cases were rising again. That is because you cannot stop the spread... you can only slow the inevitable.<br><br><br>Here&#39;s the important information...<br><br>It spreads like the Flu... which cannot be contained. And there is no vaccine. So the only way this is resolved, is through natural herd immunity. Which, unfortunately requires that people get sick, in order to develop natural immunities after they recover.<br><br>We cannot stop it. So we need to curb our emotional reactions, and stop getting angry at healthy people who don&#39;t isolate.<br><br>As to the &quot;flatten the curve&quot; philosophy... it is misguided, and needs to be more nuanced.<br><br>Flattening the curve is meant to prevent overloading hospitals all at once, and spread out the cases so that they can be handled at a better pace. But this does not require every demographic to isolate.<br><br>The only people that should be isolating is the elderly, the immunocompromised, people that aren&#39;t healthy, and healthy people that must be in frequent contact with the aforementioned individuals.

And this needs to happen as quickly as possible. Instructing those people to isolate only slows the inevitable, without having a significant impact on flattening the curve of hospitalization cases. And what little they do impact the curve... it is worth the risk in order to get herd immunity sooner. It will also decrease the negative impact on economies that are already going to be severely impacted.<br><br>And for those that feel there are too many people, in that scenario, that aren&#39;t isolating. Think about the exceptions I mentioned... that is a huge portion of the population anyway.

The real number is likely to be much much higher.  New hints points to something between 10-20 times higher.<br><br>The hints are these. <br><br>First : still in Wuhan, there is many videos of people waiting in line at the hospitals, waiting to be tested, even after the so called \u201cvictory by the CCP\u201d over the virus. These people are asked to go back home because it\u2019s of no use to test them, because the officers tells them that they \u201cwon the war\u201d against the virus. So sick people simply go back home. Again there are many videos about this online.<br><br>Second: look up the number of people who no longer have cellphone numbers among the biggest cellphone companies in China, it\u2019s alarming. They say about 21 millions people deactivated their account during the pandemic. We cannot say that they all got killed by the virus, but the spike of deactivated numbers coincide with the pandemic.<br><br>Third and MOST IMPORTANT : there is a massive amount of urns with peoples ashes in all crematoriums inside the city of Wuhan. ONLY IN ONE CREMATORIUM, there is MORE than 5 000 urns to be picked up by the victims\u2019 family. AGAIN only in one crematorium (that confirmed) has more than DOUBLE of people who died by the virus than the reported numbers by the CCP. And this all happened just after the CCP declared that they \u201cwon the war\u201d..<br><br>This is by far over.

Somehow people are still going to beaches and parks with a large group, even if there&#39;s a ongoing stay-at-home order in many states and cities. The government has to shut down beaches and parks for god&#39;s sake.\u00a02. Chinese propaganda chinese propaganda.... I mean some public health officials from China have literally been telling countries to test as many people as possible. Somehow US is still only testing people who have severe symptoms and have been exposed to confirmed cases. For some reason, when Chinese government raises some valid arguments, western countries either say fuck off or simply ignore them, and then turn around buying testing kits from unregistered companies. Also you don&#39;t have to use the testing kits from China. Mass produce the testing kits for god&#39;s sake. South Korea is testing everyone now....<br>And honestly, I wouldn&#39;t be so surprised if people only complain about China. But now people are complaining about south korea as well.<br>Meanwhile, my doctor friend in Evanston is like, the social distancing and quarantine measure is working China, the progressive testing strategy is also working in south korea, and wtf is US government and other western government doing.....<br><br>Also some people are like, Chinese government is no longer testing everyone, which is why the numbers are down. like western countries have ever been doing that. \ud83d\ude44\ufe0f. meanwhile, for chinese citizens to fly back home, everyone needs to get body temperature taken multiple times while on the plane and before passing the custom. If body temp is about 37.3C or the person is showing any symptoms, the person has to be tested. If positive, everyone sitting closed by along with the person has to be quarantined. For people without symptoms, depending on the local policy, either they have to be quarantined in their own assigned hotel rooms, or they have to self-quarantine at home for 14 days, during which the government will send people to take body temperature measurement daily. And some people will be like, that&#39;s against human rights to lock up people. Remind me again, what california, washington, oregon, illinois, new york, italy governmet is doing right now? And remind me what california and chicago did, when some dub masses still have to go to parks and beaches with groups??

It give some broad avenues of what a population can do, how fast it can do it, and how that will affect the stability of that population going forward. The idea, in a nutshell, is that exponential growth of a population in a biome can only be sustained for so long. Resources become depleted. How quickly those resources replenish helps determine where the population falls on the k-line. If the relationship is stable, some of the population may die but the biome achieves some level of homeostatic equilibrium and the populations that rely on each other will rise and fall in, roughly, sine waves. The other broad choice is collapse of the population, which in this case would be rapidly infecting everyone, leaving the virus no new prey unless it rapidly mutates. The problem is that the k-line is about how populations of organisms interact, and in this case we are the prey being depleted. Both populations can be crashed by overconsumption, first of the prey itself and then everything else down the chain as panic spreads and holes appear in, presumably, once stable biomes.", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T20:49:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kimmer Callahan", "comment_text": "And... we\u2019re using Chinese reporting.... all arguments invalid", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T20:49:33Z", "likes_count": 33}, {"comment_by": "WAN", "comment_text": "China.China.China", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T20:49:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan Strickland", "comment_text": "Very nice exposition.

A country that tests very aggressively will have a lot of confirmed cases, but a lot of these cases will be mild ones - mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic. Detecting those is actually good, because it allows to isolate these people and prevent them from infecting others - so despite the fact that case numbers will look high, control over the spread is much better. On  the other hand, a country which is already on the verge of breakdown or in full chaos will likely only test what&#39;s ending up at the hospital anyway. So the former may even count more cases than the latter, but the percentage of infections being tracked is higher and the bulk of the cases being found is much milder. <br><br>Another point:  we&#39;re on the verge of getting new tests that will simplify testing - consequently, the number of confirmed cases is likely to explode. Case numbers post quick-test will not be comparable with case numbers pre-quick test.<br><br><br> Similarly, a country in which the situation relaxes may find the resources to do more out of hospital testing and see case numbers rise again more quickly.<br><br><br>So simply comparing number of cases largely tracks an artifact of test availability that says precious little as to how bad the situation is. I think the number of deaths is a more solid parameter, though even that has problems, since not every country is doing postmortem diagnosis and thus, people dying of previously undiagnosed COVID-19 don&#39;t necessarily get counted.", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T20:21:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Wolf Kid", "comment_text": "You can\u2019t believe the charts the Gov been  trying to cover it up", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T20:20:50Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "eatright909", "comment_text": "China isn&#39;t a success dude, you might want to remove China", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T20:20:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ben stiller", "comment_text": "its an attack not an outbreak this is bio warfare", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T20:20:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wuhan Wonton", "comment_text": "Let\u2019s be real tho, can we really trust China\u2019s numbers?

My hometown was in total lockdown just like wuhan, only one person per day per family was allowed to got out and buy supplies.Everybody must wear face mask to go to the public.Supermarkets are fully stocked with fresh meats and vegetables and other supplies every single day and price are normal as well. Check points were everywhere to take people\u2019s temperature. I felt really safe and there\u2019s no need to panic.

While the media may not specifically make a statement which is false, they place the fact in a context which ensures maximum fear or panic or whatever the narrative which needs to be achieved. I can\u2019t blame them as there business is to make us buy their product, thus they require us to be scared or angry. Instead, the best way of understanding what is happening is to look at credible and robust metrics, as this video shows. This does take some effort.<br><br>Is the epidemic out of control or not. After thinking about it for a great deal of time I realised there is a simple method of determining this. The critical question is, do we know where all the infected cases are or not. If we do not knw where all the infections are then the epidemic is out of control, if we do know where all the infections are then its under control.<br><br>The first issue I had was the numbers of those infected varied so much as to be meaningless. It depends on testing regime, more testing results in more infections for example. The other is in many countries people are infected but not reporting, in china you would only present if you were in very poor health, otherwise you would stay at home. In summary, the numbers inflected metric is too unreliable to be useful.<br><br>The one metric we do have which has a very high accuracy, although not 100%, is deaths. The next step is converting this into infections. Most people who studied and currently work in the field of disease control estimate the probably mortality rate is 1%, based on current data. This may not be correct and it may go up and down depending on a range of factors such as average age of the population and health system, but is a useful start point. Thus if we multiply the number of people who have died by 100 we will probably have an idea of the number of symptomatic inflections. If this value varies from the official infection rate a lot this could tell us one of three things. To account for any variability i use an error factor of +/-25%,<br><br>If the number of people who have died multiplied by 100 is greater than the official infection rate, it reasonable to assume there are a lot of unknown infections and as a result its out of control and needs a severe response. (125% or greater)<br><br>If the number of people who have died multiplied by 100 is roughly equal to the official infection rate, its reasonable to assume most of the infections are known and the epidemic is controllable, but still needs some response. (75% to 125%)<br><br>If the number of people who have died multiplied by 100 is less than the official infection rate, it\u2019s reasonable to assume most of the infections are known and the testing is showing a large number of asymptomatic infections. This also means its being controlled. (less than 75%)<br><br>Once controlled then targeted responses to deal with specific clusters can be implemented. The curve should start flattening in this case, but remember than there is latency in any disease, so even if you control it on day one, it could be day 14 before the curve starts flattening. I use this methodology with the numbers on worldometer to determine what is happening and I think its giving me a reasonable view.<br><br>Stay Safe.", "comment_date": "2020-03-28T08:10:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "R B", "comment_text": "My worry is that as soon as we get on top of this, people will become complacent.

In fact a Corona Virus is also known as &#39;the common cold&#39;. What they&#39;ve done here is create a way to test for the proteins that present naturally in the body when infected, but these proteins can also be present due to other illness. So, you have someone who gets sick, is found to test positive, which may or may not even be accurate, winds up dying and the cause of death is attributed to the Corona Virus, even though it may just be that they in fact just tested positive but died from other causes. How easily you can turn false positives into a &quot;deadly disease&quot; when you&#39;re LOOKING for it in anyone who is showing signs of a cold!<br><br><br>So, now here we are in a total lockdown and all they had to do was tell us were all gonna die from this big bad common cold if we don&#39;t follow orders. If they are testing for it, the current method of testing will surely provide plenty of positive results. Every time someone dies we can blame it on the virus and now we have the pandemic they needed to throw us into complete social and economic collapse. They are pushing this concept of &#39;social distancing&#39; on us and mandatory curfews because they don&#39;t want patriots congregating and organizing an uprising!<br><br><br>There are multiple agendas playing out through this cleverly crafted hoax and perhaps the most obvious is the complete destruction of the world economy so they can move us into a digital one world currency. The current fiat system is designed to fail again and again. It is a whirling bottomless pit of debt that no country will ever be able to free themselves from. The banking cartel will introduce a new system that claims sustainability and the suffering &#39;working class&#39; will be lining up for their handouts to get us all back on our feet. Everything will be provided, even housing in their fabulous little smart cities. You will want for nothing as long as you fall in line with the plan. Your funds will be made usable through microchipping and you&#39;ll never need the freedom of cash ever again. <br><br><br>And of course the magical miracle vaccine to rid us of this scary Covid-19 monster will be made available to all. Your children will get to go back to school as long as they get their jab. Biometric systems will be installed in all schools and medical clearance will be automatically confirmed through your child&#39;s RFID.<br><br><br>They will install their 5g systems worldwide in order to support this new technology and it will be used for crowd control and the slow destruction of our reproductive organs. Cancer rates and other disease will steadily climb to support the medical mafia, funneling more money into Big Pharma and ultimately lead to a vast reduction in the population. As we all know they&#39;ve made it clear that there&#39;s just too many of us. But don&#39;t worry, you will get to have your 50+ years as a slave to this parasitic system. Just can&#39;t have you living to be a few hundred years old like they used to.<br><br><br>Ok, so now that we see what&#39;s really going on the next question is, what are we going to do about it? What CAN we really do? How can we ever stop what&#39;s happening when it&#39;s already come this far? We can take a deep breath and look around. Do you see death? Do you see sickness? Are you really in any danger at this very moment? Probably not. We can fight back by taking control of our perceived reality. We are panicking over a virus that thus far has claimed no more lives than the flu does every single year, and we have no way of truly confirming that said virus is actually to blame for these deaths! The only way it is harming us is by BELIEVING what we are being told through the media propaganda. The same is true for whats to come. The powers that shouldn&#39;t be only have power over us when we choose to BELIEVE they do. In this moment the only thing that is real is what&#39;s happening right NOW. Everything else is fantasy. We have to live our lives from a place of consciousness in this moment. Do not feed the fear. Be prepared for what may come and have a plan of action but do not allow what MAY BE interfere with your REALITY.<br><br>Human contact is vital to our health. Stand up against this fear based mind control and go out and start hugging people. Viruses are the result of the body attempting to flush poisons from the body. They are not transmitted person to person. We&#39;ve been lied to about that too! <br><br><br>Speak your truth and share as much information as you can with those around you. Get involved in your community. Build trust among neighbors. When the time comes to choose and you decide you will not take the solution government is offering you will have to find a place to go. We will need land where we can start our own self sufficient communities based on trade.There doesn&#39;t have to be violence. In fact, that&#39;s probably what they&#39;re hoping for as I&#39;m sure they&#39;re fully prepared for that, but we do need to choose. We can choose to exercise our inalienable rights or we can choose to lay down at the feet of our masters. We will have to let go of all that which used to define us. It will be difficult, but it will be true freedom. We will no longer be serving a system that sucks the life force from us to feed their insatiable thirst for power.

They can offer possibilities and the far past as context but beyond that, its not meant to be the news. Its why you don&#39;t see most media outlets reporting on the odds of sporting events. <br><br>Caveat there is they do report on the odds for political races but unlike sports, the reporting of that information is news as its information that can effect the outcome, or someone&#39;s perception of the outcome, so it is &#39;newsworthy&#39;. <br><br>You give in to the same false impression of the media that gives Trump and others the same fuel to bash the news. The news, when done right, is not there to tell people what to think. It&#39;s simply there to present the facts available so that the reader can make up their mind about their own choices. It&#39;s why reporters will quote people from both sides of a piece, even if one side can be considered by the majority to be a nut job. Quoting them shows that there at least does exist an alternative side of things. <br><br>The news is supposed to be like science. It doesn&#39;t care what you think or feel, it just states the facts so you can figure out how you want to process the information. There&#39;s often a story connected to it mostly because it&#39;s a proven thing that it is the kind of thing to grab attention so you actually receive the important information. And yes, there&#39;s an entire formula and psychology to reporting. <br><br>Ever notice how the first paragraph of a story tends to be small, and the second tends to be larger and often repeats what the first said? That&#39;s because most people skimming a paper or news site only read the first paragraph before deciding if they want to continue. It&#39;s called the lead. It&#39;s basically the short pitch to get you to read the rest. The next paragraph is the actual start of the news piece and offers more context to what&#39;s said in the lead. <br><br>I&#39;m meandering, but my point is here, that right now, we don&#39;t have the data (largely due to the lack of wide testing), so instead of reporting on maybes and what ifs, right now they&#39;re focused on what is. It&#39;s why you&#39;ve seen stories about china starting to get control, because there&#39;s data to support that.

And yes exponential growth is unbelievably uncertain in this view, but it&#39;s still an important view for planning.<br><br>Also if you want a less biased number use the death rate. You don&#39;t need special tests for death, so you have much more accurate number on how many people died of the disease.  Keep in mind that deaths are VERY delayed.  The average time from infection to death in China was 20 days.  Things could have grown incredibly by the time someone dies.  Consider if the % of fatality is 1% and speed of spread is 1/3 more cases per day, 1 death can vaguely imply 100 people infected 20 days ago. 100 people times 1 1/3 case growth per day to the power of 20 days = 1 death implies 31533 infected people plus or minus something so huge it boggles the mind.  <br><br>Also there are signs that China didn&#39;t win.

Well the easiest way to not find new cases is not to test and testing more will find more (if we did&#39;t think there were lost more untested infected people out there, why are are we doing social distancing).  Sp how can you account for that bias?  I can see two ways:<br>1) Count cases based on estimated symptom onset data rather than testing date then look at the shape / slope of the curve.  This is what US CDC is doing.  See <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html</a>.  Note: You have to wait a couple of weeks before this data is indicative (the viral gestation + reporting delay period).  CDC marks this area in grey on their curve and puts a footnote to that effect.<br>2) Count based on % of positive tests.  This will still be biased by the choice of who you test.  You are more likely to find COVID-19 is a person with symptoms of the disease or have know exposure to it than you are with when testing people who have been in strict social isolation.  Still, it is better than looking at just total cases.  Unfortunately I have not seen any data that I could use to test this technique with.<br>As least the CDC curve is starting to show evidence of a reduction in new infection rates (likely because of social distancing measures).

This allows us to fit a quadratic regression to the data of the form (ax^2 +bx +c) from which we can get values and errors for a and b. We can then uses the values to find the peak of this quadratic (-b/2a) which corresponds to the number of cases when we are halfway to the peak of the disease. By properly propagating the error in the values of a and b, we then get a new interval for the approximate number of cases which we expect to see at the peak of the disease (lets call this value k for now). Then an exponential regression can be fit to the raw case data of the form (ce^(dx)) so that values and standard errors for c and d can be found. We can then solve for x as a function of c,d and k and we see that x = (2/d)ln(k/2c).

But you&#39;ll end up with A LOT of very UNHAPPY humans ... which eventually will start to complain and worse :(, let alone those that have issues of the mind or other issues), it&#39;s more a question of, slowing it down, and getting our medical oomph up to strength without overworking our medical people and others we rely on. <br><br><br><br>But it is quite clear that the Reagonomics/Neoliberal models were we cut more and more out of healthcare necessities (I don&#39;t mean the rising costs, but back up beds and emergency equipment that normally should be available and in stock for these sorts of things), are simply not able to handle it. So we need to ramp up production and train people hopefully in time to match that growth that we slow down. We as humans have already made too many mistakes, focusing only on lockdowns and quarantining EVERYBODY. Rather than testing (I get it also not enough tests, but that too came from arrogance and market only thinking) and putting people in quarantine that tested positive or came from a region where there was as heavy outbreak (Region.. NOT COUNTRY there is a big difference). But the ghost is now out of the bottle, and we just need to social distance to slow it down until we can catch up, and yes that is a race that has many healthcare professionals worried. But in the end the same amount needs to get it (and no that isn&#39;t bad), it just means until we have the capabilities to come together and fix this... things need to slow down. No hoarding of medical equipment, send what you can to each other, so later others can send what they can to you when your curve rises.<br><br><br>Hoarding it will be yet ANOTHER mistake, led by the human instincts of fearing of what is strange and &quot;ME FIRST!&quot;. Viruses take advantage of that through eons of evolution, but we have the brain capacity to overwrite that instinct, so please.. let&#39;s do that together. Rather than listening to politicians that want to get more power (I&#39;m looking at you Viktor Orban, and you too Netanyahu). Because really after the west is more or less &quot;done&quot; with the first wave, it&#39;s going to explode in Africa and other nations, and then they will need the material we needed before them.

Bigger spread of the population and their dietary difference (not a lot of cattle ranches and pig farms over there) are huge, but there is much more genetic diversity from Kashmir to Bangladesh to Sri Lanka.

Basically we&#39;re looking at the big picture through a keyhole, and the amount of testing we can do is that keyhole. The more testing we can do, the wider the keyhole. The testing being done is only on folks that think they have something and present themselves for testing. There could be folks that have it silently wandering around spreading it, b/c they don&#39;t show symptoms. And, when they get symptoms, it&#39;s mild. So, they think the just have allergies or a cold or something. The good thing is the worry about covid is prompting more folks to show up for testing. So, you get to see if someone does just have a mild sniffle or if they have covid. The bad thing is we have folks rushing to get tested if they cough once. This is where healthcare professionals have to make the assessment on who gets the test.<br><br><br>2) since covid has 1-14 day incubation period, 5 on avg, by the time we see the curve, it&#39;s already had a week to build up in a population via transmission. This is why places that take proactive measures to self-quarantine a week or two before they get hit are fairing better then places that wait to do something when they first notice it. (By the time you notice the start of the curve, it&#39;s already on you big-time... this is what happened to NYC, China, etc). People in areas going &quot;I don&#39;t know what the big deal is, nothing is goign on here&quot;.. yes, because you took proactive measures. That&#39;s the whole point of proactive measures.<br><br><br>3) the measure of an illness is also how badly it impacts a person. Covid seems to impact folks in different ways; majority get mild symptons, some get severe symptions, some lead to death. But, this leads some folks to a false sense of security. It&#39;s like looking on tech forums and someone goes &quot;well, I haven&#39;t had that issue with my PC&quot;, but they draw a broad generalization based on their limited example and just assume nobody else will have a problem. This is dangerous thinking. Even if people are not having bad issues, they can still risk passing it on to others that can.<br><br><br>4) the infection rate for covid is about 2x that of flu.. and infecetion rate is exponential. So, you have pow(infection rate, degrees of separation). Degrees of Separation is how many jumps the virus had made.. (Think of it like the 6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon.. how many jumps do you need to make to get from one person to Kevin Bacon.. and most people can tie back to Kevin Bacon in 6 jumps... Person A knows person B knows person C.. etc.. until someone knows Kevin Bacon). The Covid has a rate of 3. So, 1 person can give it to 3, those 3 give it to 3 more each (9), etc, etc. Prof Hugh Montgomery had a vid comparing flu to covid. Flue has 1.3 or 1.4 ... if it makes 10 jumps (10 degrees of separation) 1.3 to power of 10 is like 14, and 1.4 to power of 10 is like 28. 3 (covid&#39;s infection rate) to power of 10 is 59,000 people infected. HOW they respond to the infection is the biggest concern.. again, might hit some people miniroly, while others end up in ER on respirators.<br><br><br>5) the infection curve is tempered with our healthcare capacity curve. The CDC has a flat-dashed-line on their &quot;flatten the curve&quot; chart. Every location has a finite amount of healthcare. But, in many places, it&#39;s operating close to capacity already. Now we&#39;re tossing a new healthcare issue on top of it, and it can quickly max out the healthcare system. Healthcare workers can operate overtime, but they can&#39;t do that indefinitely. So, over time, the healthcare system degrades in effectiveness. People become exhausted to the point of not being able to work. Their immune system gets whacked from stress, so they get sick or possibly even catch the virus themselves. They become overhwlemed and frustrated and decide to quit. As our healthcare system is being overwhelemed, it doesn&#39;t remain operating at a constant max capacity; it&#39;s degrading over time.. that&#39;s why you want to get this infection curve under control ASAP. Because, a weakened healthcare system is like a weakened immune system.. it leaves you vulnerable for a secondary problem. And, history has shown that major outbreaks often hit in waves. We&#39;re dealing with 1st wave. If our healthcaer system is over-taxed and broken after it, then if we get hit with a 2nd wave (or another issue, like smallpox or what-not shows up).. we&#39;re in seriuos trouble.<br><br><br>6) on a long-term scale.. the decisions on how to deal with this, and how many people we think are an &quot;acceptable loss&quot; to die to it...People are not machines. We don&#39;t just pull them out of the server racks, order new ones, and replace them a week later, fully imaged with software and up-n-running like nothing was happening. Humans take YEARS to grow, educate and invest in. In some places, birth rates were already low (amount of new borns replacing amount of people dying). Now lets add on amount of people dying from this. That is an extra burden of population we have to replace. And we can&#39;t replace it over night. The financial loss in the people that die isn&#39;t as drastic as the TIME loss in them. An 18yo that dies.. that&#39;s 18 YEARS of time spent raising and educating them to &quot;boot the up&quot; to almost become a productive member of society. A 40-seomthing that dies.. that&#39;s 40 YEARS of time investment we just lost. Now do the math for every person that dies and determine how many years. I&#39;m an analyst by trade. I crunched some numbers. The financial loss from the people dying is a drop in the bucket, but the time lost in growing and developing them into productive citizens is a MAJOR impact. Companies wanting to just open their doors and have folks working more are bieng short-sighted. We could have a pandemic drastically killing off labor forces, and then (to their greedy asses), it creates a labor deficit, which means workers have the power to demand higher wages, because there&#39;s less work force. (Supply and demand). Companies wanting to keep operating or operate ASAP are wanting to make money now while making it harder for themselves in the future. (That&#39;s from a purely business perspective.. so it boggles my mind that teh businsses haven&#39;t thought of this).<br><br><br>7) An issue we&#39;re seeing is .. places that get it under control aren&#39;t giving it enough time to snuff out. China, for instance. They got it under control in Wuhan, then they started opening up travel again. Once you have the lid back on Pandora&#39;s Box, you don&#39;t open the damn thing again. You give it time for the fire to snuff out. That&#39;s like two weeks or so. Too many countries are getting it under control, and acting like that means they&#39;ve snuffed it out. So, we&#39;re going to see a 2nd wave of this stuff running around sooner or later.<br><br><br>8) The goal with getting it &quot;under control&quot; isn&#39;t to make everyone immune. It&#39;s so that we can let folks get infected in a controlled fashion that the healthcare industry can deal with the problems within capacity without being overwhelmed, and we give sick folks time to recover and become &quot;human shields&quot; of Herd Immunity. A person that recovers is no longer infectious themselves, but, they could still carry the virus on their hands or clothes if they&#39;re still not practicing proper hygeine. (IE: so them coughing on you won&#39;t make you sick, but if they interacted with people still contagious, and didn&#39;t was their hands before hsaking your hand, they could still pass it on). As we get more and more folks recovering, they act like shields that help &quot;fence off&quot; certain parts of society, which can help prevent others from getting sick. But, as we&#39;ve seen, this virus is a silent ninja that spreads around and hits before folks even realize it. But, as more people recover, they can&#39;t get it again, which helps slow the virus spreading if they are still cautious and use proper sanitation and hygeine.<br><br><br><br>9) Some of us old farts have lived through some crazy shit (80&#39;s market crashes, 9/11, H1N1 / SARS).. this thing is nothing.. NOTHING like what we&#39;ve seen in the past. This is a once-in-a-lifetime healthcare event that needs to be taken seriously. The biggest part that&#39;s pissing me off is that proactive measures can easily help temper how badly this thing hits, but we&#39;re seeing so many countries not take it seriuosly until it&#39;s on their doorstep. Filling sand bags when teh hurricane is already on your doorstep.. it&#39;s too late. The other part is seeing countries think the threat has past moments after they get it under control. They are in the eye of a hurricane. They need to stay hunkered down and take things seriously so the 2nd wave doesn&#39;t hurt them as bad. There is just so much short-sightedness going on via people in power. And, gov&#39;ts keep telling folks to &quot;shelter in place&quot;, but don&#39;t give them a means to. People here in the states dont&#39; qualify for unemployment if they voluntarily quit their job. Companies know this, so they stay open and workers are forced to come into potentially hazerdous work environments as their only means of support. IF they had an alternate means, like getting unemployment for a month of two if they voluntarilty quit their job, then they could have an option to stay home and big business wouldn&#39;t be dictating how many bodies we throw on the fire from the top-down (while people in power are shetering in their mansions).
