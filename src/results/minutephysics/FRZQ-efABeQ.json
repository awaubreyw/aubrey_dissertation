So what formula do i use to find out the chance to roll 1 win out of the 25 slots, and 2 wins, and 3 wins etc?<br>So far i have only figured out how to find the chance to roll 0 wins, 1 win and 25 wins.

The states with the largest amplitudes are those integers closest to N/p, 2N/p, 3N/p, and so on.
