I have never understood tthe butterfly effect to mean the hypothetical butterfly is really &quot;causing&quot; a specific tornado in so direct a sense, but rather that the presence or absence of its wing flaps would (given enough time) result in different overall weather patterns on planetary scale than there would have been absent the flapping.  That would mean that of you see a given tornado in world where the butterfly flapped its wings (possibly years, centuries, miillennia before) there would be a very good chance that this particular tornado would not have existed in the alternate universe where the butterfly didn&#39;t flap its wings.

Say you had a 2x2 grid, and this pendulum was in this grid, where we describe the pendulum as a black square, and where the pendulum is not as a white square. the pendulum can only be in 1 of 4 states, and if the pendulum is following some rule that governs where it will appear, it will appear deterministic to us because we can easily keep track of the entire system.<br><br>Now extend the example to a 1000x1000 grid, and we blow up the pendulum just a little bit to be some number of black squares. In order to keep track of the pendulum, we need a full description of the entire state space, even if it behaves deterministically, because any square that we &quot;miss&quot; will create uncertainty as to which squares get filled in next by the deterministic rule.<br><br>Thus a pendulum in a continuous space, even though it seems simple, has a state space that is sufficiently large, that we don&#39;t keep track of and therefor the pendulum is complex, and will exhibit chaos.<br><br>You can also think about a real pendulum in a room. You notice the pendulum swinging around chaotically and you assume it&#39;s simple...but your not keeping track of all the air molecules that are bumping into it at any given moment in time...and therefor one is omitting a valid description of the true system, which is the pendulum and a bunch of air molecules.", "comment_date": "2022-07-11T10:13:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Loading", "comment_text": "I disagree.

As in, it was just an example. It could of just as well created a car wreck.  So, it is not that you could of easily predicted it... like you said, there are too many butterflies.. but I don&#39;t think the BE assumes simple predictions, and therefore it is not talking about tornados/weather specifically ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIPUdru82c&amp;t=0m57s\">0:57</a> ), the tornado example was just a WOW factor. As in, WOW it created a tornado?!?! No one could of guessed!! That&#39;s crazy! That&#39;s chaos!... Moving on, just because there are many simple 3-body chaotic systems to reference other than weather ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIPUdru82c&amp;t=1m00s\">1:00</a> ),  it seems irrelevant to the fact that the butterfly IS <b>indeed</b> flapping its wings in a very complex chaotic system, called life.  That is kind of the point that BE is illustrating. This butterfly flap is not occurring in a simple chaotic system, it is massive and chaotic, and basically unpredictable, it&#39;s so unpredictable that random tornados might just get created... but it is still a <b>system</b> , it <b>could</b> be calculated (maybe by super advanced aliens, lol). And I always felt that this tornado was probably 10-20 years later, on the other side of the planet.. So, it is not like the butterfly is a <b>direct</b> cause of the tornado ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIPUdru82c&amp;t=1m31s\">1:31</a> ). This whole thing is more like the opening to some animated disney movie where the butterfly flap pushes off a leaf from a tree to the ground and it just so happens to cover, and protect from the sun, a dying fly larvae. That fly larvae just so happens to have a mutant gene that allows it overpopulate and demolish crops. Flashforward 20 years later, and this bug has moved over to the other side of the world destroying crops and creating a new Dust Bowl, hence, tornados.... or maybe some other way. I thought the point of BE is to illustrate that it is possible, no matter how complicated. Or, in other words, you don&#39;t need sufficiency ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIPUdru82c&amp;t=2m45s\">2:45</a> ), a butterfly flap doesn&#39;t have to guarantee a tornado.  The question is.. is a tornado possible (where it would otherwise not be), at some point, as the flap event propagates thru infinite chaos? Like multiverse theories. Why is our universe so fine-tuned? Well, a multiverse theory might would say that there are countless un-tuned universes where life is not possible.. in fact it HAS to be fine-tuned for life to exist, therefore, of course you live in a fine-tuned universe.  In the case of BE, it just so happened to create a tornado in this example. So, of course you live in a universe that was fine-tuned for it. But, in another universe, it created a car wreck. And that other universe was fine-tuned for that outcome ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIPUdru82c&amp;t=3m20s\">3:20</a> ).  Anyhow, I feel the BE does do a decent job of describing chaos, even if it is lacking in simplicity ( <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIPUdru82c&amp;t=3m50s\">3:50</a> ). I mean, how chaotic does it have to be if a butterfly flap some how leads to a tornado?

I think the point about the butterfly effect is to show how a tiny change in a system has the potential to massively change the outcome of a system. I.e. not sufficiency or necessity, but existence. The fact that there is even a conceivable situation in which the existence or absence of a hurricane in Kansas is uniquely determined by the flapping of exactly one butterfly&#39;s wings is already surprising and illuminating. It&#39;s a parable that reminds us that tiny inputs can have massive impacts. The butterfly/hurricane example (actually, the specific-butterfly-and-specific-potential-hurricane example) is useful because it is a visceral example of this: a less interesting example would be that the hurricane was going to happen anyway, but the butterfly flapping means that it demolishes its first house at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIPUdru82c&amp;t=22h34m43s\">22:34:43</a>.02 instead of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIPUdru82c&amp;t=22h34m43s\">22:34:43</a>.03. Small input, large (but less terrifying) impact.

What a hopeful, surprising, and inspiring sentiment!<br><br><br><br><br><br>P.S.<br>In a more mathematical example, one can think about neighbourhoods of points on a fractal generated by iteration of a holomorphic/entire function. In neighbourhoods of points on the Julia set, you have this beautiful chaos under iteration of the function that sends the poitns of the neighbourhood sprawling out across the plane (indeed, the points will get sent out to all but 2 points of the Riemann sphere). But in neighouhoods of most points of the Fatou domains, there is no chaos at all: the set will stay exactly within the Fatou domains. The analogy to the butterfly here is that the tiny changes near the Julia set have large impacts, and the flapping of wings in exactly-perfect conditions can have hurricane impacts.", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T07:26:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Mazzetti", "comment_text": "You must be fun at parties", "comment_date": "2022-01-26T06:11:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sentient #6", "comment_text": "Nah man, this is just you being excessively concerned about a metaphorical example from chaos theory.

That is not the reason the Butterfly Effect is invalid. The more concise reason is that the minute differences in the initial conditions must occur over the scale of the attractor--in the case of weather this is probably the size of Rossby waves, but at the very least a scale much larger than the very localized effect of the wings flapping. That turbulent scale simply dissipates into localized heat very rapidly. To be a real effect, the minute change in temperature (or whatever) must occur at a much larger scale--miles in the case of weather. It&#39;s still a tiny error, but over a larger scale. A more interesting thought experiment that preserves the Butterfly Effect idea is imagining that the butterfly tips over a candle when flapping its wings. The candle then falls and ignites a small fire, which explodes into a massive forest fire. The massive forest fire alters the temperature over a wide area--and that change in initial conditions in theory could result in a necessary change in the weather much farther away at a future time, to create the tornado. In that case, it is true causality. It&#39;s a very remote possibility, but still possible. In the &#39;pure&#39; example of just the wings flapping, it could never happen. :)", "comment_date": "2021-11-29T01:21:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neel patel", "comment_text": ".                             |________1/2 light years____|<br>                        ` ` \ud83d\udca1``(bulb)<br>     <i>___________||||||______________________</i><br>     |.                                      |                               |<br>     |.                                   1m                               |<br>     |.                      |.              |                               |<br>     |_<i>__________|.  |______|____________</i> ___|<br>                        +  |.    -     <br><br>When switch is close bulb light up in?<br>A) 1 year<br>B) 2 year<br>C) 1/c second<br>D) non<br><br>What is right answer?", "comment_date": "2021-11-28T13:26:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mahat 'ma nigga' ndhi", "comment_text": "in my opinion the interesting thing about butterfly effect is that if a system is in an unstable balanced position then that small bit of air can cause bigger effects or that our system can amplify stuff, for example i&#39;m on a bridge and i&#39;m holding a mug, a cockroach flies into my face, i freak out and release the mug, it hits the front window of a car passing underneath, the driver freaks out and well the rest is pretty violent but let&#39;s just say that cockroach is now wanted by FBI", "comment_date": "2021-11-27T14:58:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rudxain", "comment_text": "The &quot;many butterflies&quot; effect is related to &quot;causality clouds&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-11-26T05:05:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Databyter", "comment_text": "One of the main things people do not consider in theoretical constructs like the butterfly effect is that there is more than one butterfly.

The basic gist being that between you and the mishap, there are a bunch of slices of swiss cheese, all jumping around, that represent various steps or elements to fixing and flying an aircraft: maintenance training, tool accountability, aircrew sleep, condition of aircraft systems, preflight inspections, flight planning, weather, and about a million other things - an inherently chaotic system.

In other words is the carbon dioxide in the air The cause or the effect of the heat. No one has yet to answer this question with any certainty and without cause effect how can you know anything about global warming wait that was a fraud that was identified because of leaked internal memos which is why we now call it climate change. I mean literally if I wanted to I can make an argument that it was the clean air act of 1976 that actually causes global warming if there was such a thing because from 1935 to 1970 temperatures have been going down and climatologist will warning us of a global ice age that could possibly be coming. Sometime in the late 70s they stopped with all that frantic oh my god if we don\u2019t get rid of all this carbon dioxide we will be buried under a mile of ice. They waited for about a decade and then started talking about climate change. With the evil despicable bad thing being carbon dioxide the same thing that was causing the global cooling. One gas two outcomes. As a scientist if you perform an experiment and one time you add a gas and it makes temperatures go down and the next time you add a gas the temperature goes up what are the odds that it\u2019s that gas that is the cause of those temperature fluctuations. Zero. Every atom every molecule has a very specific chemical make up of that chemical make up will make it do the same thing cause the same effect every time if there\u2019s a variation in an experiment that is not consistent especially as temperatures going up and temperatures going down than the individual atom molecule compound cannot be the reason there must be some other variant affecting the outcome giving you different outcomes. Basic chemistry basic physics. The primary reason why so many climatologist these days talk about global warming or climate change is because it\u2019s the only way they can get a grant many of the same people would probably be able to come up with proof that climate change is a fraud if you simply changed their ability to get and retain grants with them being told that their research has to go into proving climate change is a fraud.", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T18:52:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikkel Allen", "comment_text": "man blows on leaf.. butterfly is frightened and flies away, bird sees buttefly but come is for the kill, bird knock bee hive, bee sting man, man falls in campfire, campfire rages out of control and alights regional forestforest fire, smog increases global warming, permafrost melts and more methane released, water weight triggers global vocanic eruptions, even more methan released, all humans die in hellish inferno.

But then you re-run the exact same model with all the exact same values except that you leave off the last digit so that it&#39;s now 4.36234341.  The model gives the same results at first, but then the predictions for the 2nd day are a bit different, and by a week out, the output describes a completely different forecast.  That little difference of .00000001?  That&#39;s the equivalent of the input of a butterfly flapping its wings on the other side of the world.  There&#39;s nothing significant about that butterfly; it&#39;s just that little differences in the beginning can create big differences down the line.  Or not (because sometimes they don&#39;t).

I don\u2019t think its about the magnitude of one specific initial system value, but more about the inherent unknowability of the initial conditions of all system variables- so I propose the Tse-Tse fly effect - butterfly effects are much to large  to consider.  Size doesn\u2019t matter and like a fractal, you can zoom in closer and closer and get different final system states dependent on the fractal values you detect at the moment you stop zooming in.

It can collide with a slightly bigger grain, which in turn collides with some unstable pebbles and so on, eventually unleashing a rock slide. This seems to essentially be the picture people have in their mind when they think that the butterfly &quot;causes&quot; the tornado.

This means that if one butterfly flaps its wings once, then after a long enough time, the whole weather pattern on earth would be different than it would have been if it didn&#39;t flap. In this sense, not only can a butterfly cause a tornado at some point in the future, but it always will! Of course, as a chaotic system, it is essentially unpredictable, so it is still not possible to make a causal connection between a specific butterfly and a specific tornado.<br><br>This fact that it is not possible to make this causal connection becomes even more obvious when you keep the &quot;too many butterflies&quot;-effect in mind :)<br><br>(*Once you understand chaos, the fact that any butterfly will cause a tornado doesn&#39;t seem so extraordinary anymore, but instead rather natural -- which is perhaps even more extraordinary in its own right)", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T13:36:29Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "Harry Robins", "comment_text": "I find it weird because it&#39;s a closed loop, if something so small like a butterfly&#39;s wings causes a tornado somewhere else, then what does that tornado cause?", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T13:36:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anna Kollins", "comment_text": "I do not like the butterfly effect\u201d\r<br>pans to scenic shot of river\r<br><br>pans back to Henry", "comment_date": "2021-10-21T13:36:17Z", "likes_count": 21}, {"comment_by": "harry.tallbelt", "comment_text": "Wait, Henry lives in the same state with Hank Green?
