Photons can only lose energy. This is what happen with fluorescent materials; they absorb a high energy photon, waste part of that energy as heat then release a new photon at lower frequency.<br><br>Some laser such as the green ones based on Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet; Nd:Y3Al5O12)  use a non linear effect, combining 2 photons at 1064 nm to produce a new one at exactly double the frequency, 532 nm. UV laser exist which use 3 photons as input for each UV photon as output. They manage to produce coherent light, which mean every single photon are synchronized to start the wave exactly at the same time ; no phase  difference. The frequency of each photon is slightly different because of Dopler effect induced by thermal motion. The small spread of frequency is called bandwidth.<br><br>The known facts are:<br>- Photons go at different speed depending on the frequency<br>- Once entering in glass and adjusting angle and speed, they maintain that new angle and new speed until reaching another interface<br>- if the exit location is parallel  to the entering, the photon resume at the same angle. An image is just shifted but keep the same color. In case of prism, the angle is different, so the color keep diverging, so a white beam get exposed to it&#39;s true nature ; a large collection of colored photons.", "comment_date": "2017-12-20T13:49:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steve Greenfield", "comment_text": "Wow.

At that year mark the first light leaves through the other side as new light continues to enter the other end, basically &quot;overwriting&quot; the data. The narrator constantly referred to their new tech as something that slows light down to a crawl, so slow in fact that it will take a year for it to travel a few inches and once out the other side, it stretches out as it returns to its full speed, the narrator kept saying. Its the same as, in reference to the double slit experiment, saying that the &quot;mere&quot; act of observing makes things act differently. In reality, observing particles is far from a &quot;mere&quot; act. Its taking other particles, charging them with energy and firing them at the one you want to observe changing the way the particle being viewed acts because of all the extra energy transferred.

Another common misconception is that the photons get\u00a0absorbed and reemitted.\u00a0\u00a0This isn&#39;t true for two reasons one photons aren&#39;t high enough energy to have the electrons in glass jump to the next level hence the reason of\u00a0glass being\u00a0transparent. The second is that the time from the time a particle is absorbed and emitted is essentially random. So if we sent one photon through a piece of glass and measured the time it\u00a0took\u00a0for the\u00a0photon to make it through the piece of glass \u00a0then sent another through the same piece of glass you should measure the times to be different. Instead of a uniform speed you get one that varies. What actually happens is that the photon has an oscillating electromagnetic field which then affects the electrons in the glass and makes them begin to oscillate. So then the electrons have their own oscillating electromagnetic field and its the interactions of these oscillating electromagnetic fields that leads to the apparent slow down of light traveling through a medium.
