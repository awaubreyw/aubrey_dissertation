I&#39;d recommend leaving at least 5 blocks between the ring and whatever building you put in the middle of it, so you can make a farm inside, space for other security measures, or just to walk around in. Then again, this is just a guide, do what you wish.<br><br> Once that is done, take obsidian and line the inside of the ring with it. Don&#39;t worry, I already made space when I told you the size of the ring, no further digging required. When you finish that, go to the innermost layer of obsidian and continue it two or three blocks up. if you want, you could stretch the width of the ring beforehand to save space for a thicker inner wall (but make sure you save at least 3 blocks of width in the moat for the lava!), and even add an overhang to your wall for more difficult entry. <br><br>Another option for your wall is instead of an overhang(or even with the overhang, for the craziest base), you can add cobwebs. If your enemies are scaling your wall and get stuck in the web, the only place they&#39;re going is down into the lava or away from the wall. If you want to get really high tech you can build an observer system that sets off an alarm, activates other security systems or notifies you in some way when the wall is tampered with.<br><br>Now, it&#39;s time for the lava. All you need to do is fill the moat up enough that there is one unfilled layer at the top to hopefully trap invaders . So if you went with the ring I told you to make, there will be one layer of lava at the bottom. As I said before I usually make the moat a bit deeper. Also, I believe (at least in PE) lava will not damage cobwebs, so you could also put it over the lava for extra defence.<br><br>Congratulations! You&#39;ve locked yourself in your own high security base! Sure, you can build some stairs, but you&#39;ll need to get back in. There are so many things you can do. You can be as boring as those stairs, or as advanced as keycard reading slimeblock launchers. Secret entrances. Pop out stairs. Get creative! But that is all I have for you.
