Disclaimer - I&#39;m not a physicist and I know that there&#39;s an exceptionally high probability that I&#39;m wrong. But if so I would like to have someone explain to me why that&#39;s the case. I&#39;ve been thinking about these things for a long time, trying to puzzle them out.<br><br>My take is that the string doesn&#39;t break because the length contraction is an illusion caused by the speed of light. Of course that circles around to the question of what is real vs perceived.<br><br>Anyhow, here we go.<br><br>Suppose two rockets were built at the same zero G rocket shipyard. One of them accelerates away from the second one for a bit then accelerates in reverse so that it is stopped relative to the other ship. Their clocks may have diverged a little bit from that initial movement but I don&#39;t see that as being relevant. A string is passed between them and at the exact half way point on that string there is a light. The light flashes and each of the spaceships starts to accelerate (at the same rate) the instant they see the flash of light. Just for the sake of simplicity let them reset their clocks at the same time.<br><br>This should provide an initialized state that eliminates outside influences that would affect the experiment.<br><br>Since the two spacecraft are accelerating at the same rate they will be moving at the same speed. However each of the spacecraft will see the other in it&#39;s past because of the time that it takes for the light to travel between them. Nothing new there, when we look at any object we are looking at it&#39;s past. The string does not break because the real distance between the spacecraft does not change.<br><br>What about other observers? An observer ahead of the two ships but along their direction of travel will see the nearest ship move first and then the further ship move. This is because it is observing the second ship further in the past than it observes the first ship. So it is easy to claim that the string should break given that they are observed to not move at the same time. Ultimately this is simply an illusion. The string does not break and the observer does not see it break because she is looking at it&#39;s past. What she will observe is that the string will appear to stretch but in reality it&#39;s length has never changed.<br><br>So where have I screwed this analysis up?", "comment_date": "2022-07-24T15:36:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Evans", "comment_text": "I think you got it backwards, the string doesn\u2019t break:<br>There is no actual length contraction\u2026<br>Assume you a rocket represented by \u201cAASSBBSSCC\u201d, and it travels fast enough to shrink 1/2 it\u2019s stationary size,<br>So the stationary observer sees ASBSC.<br>Notice the it not only shrunk, but parts move.

You need to include the perspective of both rockets and the outside observer. Basically the string will snap because the rockets will accelerate faster than the signal along the string can propagate to the behind rocket. In your model, you keep showing the string as more of a static object, but in real life, the string will not stay tense. Like from the rear rocket&#39;s perspective, the string will begin to bundle up, and will only break because the lead rocket brings the string past it&#39;s tensile strength. Without adding real numbers, it is hard to determine if the string will break or be fine, as it heavily determines on how fast the rocket&#39;s accelerate, how long the string is, what the tension strength of the string is, what the propagation speed of the string is, what the mass of the string is, and when each rocket leaves (like an agreed upon time or when the lead rocket observes the rear rocket moving).<br><br>Consider this other scenario. The lead rocket accelerates, and has a light-year long string trailing behind it (No rear rocket), assuming the acceleration is slow enough and the string is strong enough to hold itself together, then in the scenarios where both rockets leave at an agreed upon time (which is what I&#39;m assuming this video is assuming), the string will also be able to hold itself together. As the rear rocket will actually be pushing the string closer to the lead rocket by the time the signal of the lead rocket leaving reaches the rear rocket.<br><br>In the video, you don&#39;t even need to add a rear rocket, because the assumptions made would make a trailing string behind the rocket also break. Give the string a real mass, propagation speed, tension strength, and give the rocket a constant acceleration, and you will see that if you make sure the string doesn&#39;t break, it will not break in any scenario.<br><br>So if you calculate the original video scenario all out, what an outside observer will see will be very similar to what the behind rocket will see. It is essentially the rear rocket catching up to the rocket infront of it and the string beginning to bundle up and drag behind the rear rocket, where it gets interesting is the lead rocket which will &quot;see&quot; the string stretch out and become longer, but this effect will be counteracted by the contraction of space between the rockets and the string will actually remain the same size.<br><br>Also worth noting, something that failed to include in the calculation is that the front rocket and rear rocket (if leaving at an agreed upon time) will actually see length contraction of the space between the rockets, as each rocket will observe the other one moving at different speed due to the finite speed of light.<br><br>Also worth noting, that if the string is so tense that it will not stretch at all, it will break at the point where it attaches to the lead rocket, as stretching is how objects accelerate as a &quot;single&quot; object.<br><br>By the way, I came to all this by trying to find a scenario where the string does not break and stays tense, and if you calculate it out, it occurs if the rear rocket matches the observed speed of string (and if the string propagates at the speed of light, then it would be the observed speed of the lead rocket), this will create not tension on the string and will be very similar to the scenario of the lead rocket dragging a string behind it. And because of that, it was clear that the scenario where both rockets leave at an agreed upon time would also not have the string break.<br><br>Another scenario I used to double check myself was the scenario where a ship is traveling to alpha centauri from earth. It quickly accelerates to 86% the speed of light, which causes the distance from the spacecraft to appear to half. When the craft get halfway in its journey, 2.6 earth years or 1.3 spacecraft years, another spacecraft is sent out which also quickly accelerates to 86% the speed of light. The spacecraft that was originally 2.2 lightyears away, is now only 1.1 lightyears away, as it is still only halfway on its journey.", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T15:41:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unique learning Kartik", "comment_text": "Congratulation for 6million subscribers advance \ud83e\udd73", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T15:09:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LumberJak", "comment_text": "What I&#39;m taking away from this is that if I do jumping jacks my body will be ripped to pieces.", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T14:38:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Salomone", "comment_text": "The spaceships would not tear themselves apart if the front spaceship always matched speed with the rear spaceship.", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T13:45:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rajesh Thomas", "comment_text": "I have a question.

One is that inertial reference frames are distinctly different from accelerating reference frames, and the video is sloppy about it, only comparing inertial frames at different times. The other is that the video confuses relativistic phenomena such as length contraction with real physical forces such as string tension: length contraction is uniform, but string tension is not. Whether the string breaks depends on how resilient the string is, and has nothing to do with acceleration or length contraction per se.<br>\r<br>Consider the case of the OBSERVER accelerating, with the rockets turned off in an inertial frame. The observer will see the rockets and string getting shorter and shorter over time. The string doesn&#39;t break, because there are no forces on the rockets or the string: no engines have been turned on.<br>\r<br>In the case of the rockets accelerating instead of the observer (the case in this video), one has to be VERY careful about what one means as &quot;simultaneous&quot;. It would be accurate to say that in any real physical situation, there is no such thing as simultaneous. One rocket will start sooner than the other (and thus they will either move closer or further apart, all else being equal). If we idealize the situation and assume that the rockets both start simultaneously as measured in their INITIAL REST FRAME, e.g., via synchronized clocks, then they will remain a constant distance from each other as measured in their (now accelerating) frame. Neither spacecraft sees the other shrink, nor do they observe the string to contract along its length.<br>\r<br>The principle of equivalence applies in this idealized case: just as the rockets and string would all fall at the same rate in a uniform gravitational field, they should all accelerate at the same rate in our idealized simultaneous case. Except the acceleration from a pair of rockets is NOT as uniform as a gravitational field.<br>\r<br>Where the video gets confused is mixing up the relativistic phenomenon of &quot;length contraction&quot; with the VERY different phenomenon that acceleration is typically not uniform: bodies are pushed by real physical forces in a non-uniform way. The rocket engine pushes on the rear of the spacecraft, which in turn pushes gradually on the middle and front of the spacecraft. In the case of the string, the rear spacecraft cannot push the string, so the string starts collecting on the front of the spacecraft. The front spacecraft pulls on the string, but the string reacts sort of like a rubber band or slinky, with the lead end of the string getting stretched out (which may or may not be forceful enough to break the string), and the middle and rear parts of the string slowly catching up. All strings work like this, more or less, even the strongest and most resilient: it&#39;s just that a very strong cord doesn&#39;t stretch as much and transmits its tension faster than a rubber band or slinky.<br>\r<br>Adding this concept to the very idealized case, what we would have is the string stretching out and wobbling a bit as the acceleration is introduced into the system. A very high acceleration would rip the string apart instantly - never mind crushing the ships. A very low acceleration wouldn&#39;t break the string at all, and all the materials would reach an equilibrium being accelerated at about the same rate.<br>\r<br>In other words, there is NO observable perspective in which the string breaks due to &quot;length contraction&quot;. Length contraction is not a physical entity, just as relativistic mass isn&#39;t really mass (different discussion, but worth googling if you&#39;re interested). There is a real issue with respect to forces being limited to propagating at the speed of light (if not even more slowly - e.g., the speed of &quot;sound&quot; through the string), and those forces could cause the string to break. But those forces arise from the mechanics of how the system is accelerating, not from any sort of relativistic effect such as length contraction. Again, using the principle of equivalence, if the entire system were accelerated in a uniform gravitational field, all parts of the system would experience no acceleration or forces at all, and nothing would be pulling or pushing or breaking.", "comment_date": "2021-08-24T04:40:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mr StickyikyGamer", "comment_text": "So that&#39;s why iron man had a problem with his suite at first.

For the most part, the object (such as the Earth) flexes with the waves. However, to my understanding, there is a degree to which the object itself &quot;resists&quot; that stretching and compression, which I&#39;ve heard from quite reliable sources causes friction within the objects as well as stresses akin to tidal stresses. So, tidal heating, etc. In theory, in fact, this could be usable as a sort of &quot;engine&quot; to harness useful energy from passing gravitational waves. (Not <i>much</i> energy, of course, but still some).<br><br>Given that, I would say the following...<br><br>First, no, the rockets are not independent objects at all. Nor is the string a separate thing from them. That isn&#39;t how reality works to our best level of understanding. Everything is quantum (sorry Copenhagenists). So either there is no distinction between objects or frames of reference at all, and SR is wrong... or <i>every point in spacetime</i> is its own distinct object, and all deformations due to special or general relativity are smooth and continuous, and the relativistic effects are applied smoothly and continuously both between and within each body in question, and SR is correct (but misapplied here).<br><br>Thus, all objects <i>should</i> experience internal stresses, due to length contraction and/or non-simultaneity as they accelerate. However, these forces should be absolutely miniscule to the point of being effectively undetectable, compared to the more ordinary, inertial forces involved in that level of acceleration. The reason they don&#39;t pull apart due to the length contraction/non-simultaneity is because the chemical bonds between the atoms are strong enough to withstand those forces.<br><br>This I see three basic regimes for a string/cable stretched between the two rockets (assuming spherical cows etc; in reality the string would probably break almost all the time <i>long</i> before relativistic effects become relevant, just due to random thermal fluctuations in the combustion chambers/nozzles).<br><br>1. The acceleration is fast enough that, despite being <i>flawlessly</i> simultaneous, the string snaps because the string itself can&#39;t bear the force of its own acceleration, i.e. mundane inertial forces break the strong.<br><br>2. The acceleration is slow and gentle enough that the relativistic forces between the rockets are within the tensile strength limit of the string. In this case, just like the rockets don&#39;t tear themselves apart, they don&#39;t tear the string apart either.<br><br>3. <i>Possibly</i> in some <i>very</i> narrow regime between the two, there might be a tiny sliver of a regime in which the kinetic/inertial forces aren&#39;t <i>quite</i> strong enough to shred the string, but the acceleration is just <i>ever so slightly</i> too fast for the string to provide sufficient force to simply pull the rockets closer together rather than breaking. Consider that, while weak, the string is still capable of handling many many many many more orders of magnitude more force than the gravity between the rockets. Both are way, way smaller than the forces involved in the acceleration, but the string is still able to do more than your intuition suggests.<br><br>I strongly suspect that for the vast majority of materials the string/cable could be made out of, that third regime doesn&#39;t actually exist. Actually, I suspect, with not quite as much certainty that the overlap between regimes 1 and 2 is quite vast, and that regime 3 is completely impossible.<br><br>Unless, of course, you assume either infinitely light but infinitely weak string, or infinitely strong string, in either case, you haven&#39;t presented a paradox, just a poorly chosen set of assumptions.<br><br>Heh, that said (and yes, I realize it&#39;s incredibly pedantic)... it&#39;s kind of a neat way to rephrase something a lot like the &quot;twin problem&quot; (I don&#39;t call that a paradox, because it isn&#39;t; it all works exactly as it should.)", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T04:20:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gustaf Carstam", "comment_text": "is there any reference frame where the back one starts accelerating before the front one?

As we talk of rockets, let us consider a galactic referential. In this referential (and not in the rocket referential) the two moving rockets connected by a long rope will appear as contracted along their moving direction. This contraction will be different as seen from another moving referential (another rocket for instance). More importantly in the rockets + wire frame nothing special happens; the astronauts, the rockets, the wire do not feel any form of contraction.\r<br>The second issue is to think that it is not possible to synchronize the two rockets. Synchronization in a given frame is not an issue in relativity, it is only a problem when you consider events in two frames moving at different speeds.\r<br>Now, let us consider that the two rockets start their engines simultaneously, let them burn for a certain duration and then stop the engines. Two cases must be considered. If the thrust is in the direction of the rocket movement, their speed relative to the referential has increased and their apparent size, still seen from the referential, has decreased. If the thrust is in the opposite direction, their speed relative to the referential has decreased and their apparent size has increased.\r<br>Henri approach is making a mess in between the moving frame and the referential frame. \r<br>\r<br>If you are still unconvinced, there is an obvious argument against Henry erroneous approach. Let us assume that you may measure the rope tension in the rocket frame, then you will be able to derive a value of speed from the contraction factor. This speed will not be related to any frame. Said differently you will be able to measure an absolute velocity. This is in total contradiction with the relativity principle.
