I know it&#39;s not the point of your video, but the Higgs boson event display portrayed twice therein is just an early simulation. As of today we have real images of Higgs boson events. May you not know where to find them (originals I mean), drop me a line (p.e. on twitter @pagarab).<br><br>Also, not that I feel offended but saying experimental particle physics is like to &quot;wait and see what nature has in store&quot; (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbsnY--LFh0&amp;t=2m26s\">2:26</a>) could sound somewhat discouraging for young students who might feel interest in the field. In fact, we give nature a twist so the right conditions are met for new particles to pop up. And not only those we are almost sure of finding, like the Higgs boson, but also the ones we simply dream of, like dark matter or supersymmetric particles. As exciting as quasiparticle physics is, experimental particle physics is not left behind. Embarking in such a quest is a hell of ride !<br><br>Keep up with you great videos.
