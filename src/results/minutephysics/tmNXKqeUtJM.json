All mass accumulates through the action of a vortex. A vortex has the shape of two opposing cones that meet at a point. Perpendicular to this center of mass accumulation lies the ecliptic. In our case, the center of mass which birthed the planets is our sun. That sun has an equatorial plane in line with the ecliptic. All planets in the solar system began their journey being spun out along this equatorial plane. The sun itself is in motion perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic so while the system appears flat from our point of view it would be more accurate to consider the motion of the planets a spiral in space time. According to Russel, all direction is curved and all motion is spiral. These are universal laws which he layed out in great detail in \u201cThe Universal One\u201d (published in 1927).", "comment_date": "2021-11-08T17:27:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Meliokrates", "comment_text": "Wake up from the coma!\u00a0<br>The new physics knocks at the door!<br>The constructor theory results in two EXPERIMENTALLY PROVED SEVERE violations of the law of conservation of energy, which are described in the two links below:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\u00a0</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAydFMDKj2Y%C2%A0%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAydFMDKj2Y\u00a0\u00a0</a><br>Let us popularize the two links above as much as possible!\u00a0<br>Let us popularize the two links above\u00a0in any possible way!<br>Let us push forward together the technology progress and end poverty around the world!", "comment_date": "2021-11-04T12:40:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChimeGaming", "comment_text": "Jesus made the solar system", "comment_date": "2021-11-01T18:45:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ChimeGaming", "comment_text": "No", "comment_date": "2021-11-01T18:45:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Meliokrates", "comment_text": "How fundamental physics lost its way, that is, how to solve the two EXPERIMENTALLY PROVED paradoxes, which are described in the two links below:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY%C2%A0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\u00a0</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAydFMDKj2Y\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAydFMDKj2Y</a>", "comment_date": "2021-10-30T12:33:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mentilly all", "comment_text": "cartoons do not the reality make", "comment_date": "2021-10-19T04:37:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Wright", "comment_text": "&quot;Don&#39;t believe this video.&quot; <br>- Round Solar System Society", "comment_date": "2021-10-16T17:32:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pavan Gaonkar", "comment_text": "ok is that a confirmation of the fact that we live in a 3D world?", "comment_date": "2021-10-09T02:54:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Meliokrates", "comment_text": "How to interpret the TWO REAL EXPERIMENTS, which are described in the two links below:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX14NK8GrDY</a><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAydFMDKj2Y\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BAydFMDKj2Y</a>", "comment_date": "2021-10-06T13:56:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gimiter", "comment_text": "why not merciry?", "comment_date": "2021-09-29T21:44:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Venkat Babu", "comment_text": "Finding larger right angle prime.", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T14:40:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Connor Kearley", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude16", "comment_date": "2021-09-19T22:01:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vishwa Info", "comment_text": "Can you post a video about HOLLOW EARTH...

Just as you noted that if a forming solar system is already rotating around a single axis in 3D space, the rotation space is already &quot;flat&quot; , likewise, for any given set of items orbiting something in 4D hyperspace, it is possible that they are already rotating around a common 2D plane, which would make their rotation space already flat. Yes, it&#39;s also possible for that plane they are rotating around to ALSO have things rotating within in, around the other 2D plane of rotation. However, if we&#39;re talking about getting to that stage from random orbital paths, consider that for any ser of objects orbiting around a 4D object in 4D space, it is POSSIBLE that those orbital paths all occupy the same 3D hyperplane of that 4D space, and that within such a 3D hyperplane of rotation space they have a net rotation around one axis of that hyperplane. That axis would be your &quot;up and down&quot; as you called it, and could cancel out in the same way leaving a 2D plane of rotation for that set of objects. If, on the other hand, a set of objects were in orbital paths which stuck out of such a shared 3D hyperplane just a little, but still managed to cancel the movement in one of those three directions in that same way, what would remain of the orbital paths in 4D space would fit into the remaining 3 dimensions which had not been canceled out. Repeat (or continue) the process to cancel out one more dimension of orbital space and you would be left with a 2D orbital plane around a complementary 2D plane.", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T07:44:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Superposition Hyper-Webster", "comment_text": "No, you fools!

An object with mass can have its own gravity and then there is an unknown force that is also gravity that attracts energy. Can you make a video explaining gravity more clearly and what causes the spinning in space that causes dust to crash and clump. It all seems tied to gravity which I am totally lost on what it is.

It seems logical to assume the debris above the poles would not be rotating fast enough to defy the gravitational pull of the primary body, effectively &quot;clearing&quot; those areas by gravity alone as those particles would eventually collide with the primary gravitational body.\u00a0The debris between the polar areas\u00a0and the &quot;flat plane&quot; would move slowly toward the center of the primary body, but as they draw closer to the body they\u00a0approach\u00a0the galactic plane, and\u00a0since the plane of a rotating sphere moves faster, the debris would\u00a0naturally accelerate\u00a0about the primary body in the\u00a0rotational direction, eventually\u00a0to the point that they are falling around the rotating body at an equal or\u00a0faster rate than the gravitational force toward it [i.e. orbital velocity]. Thus, without collisions,\u00a0the\u00a0debris would pass the &quot;galactic plane&quot; and the gravitational pull of the central\u00a0body would begin acting <b>against</b> its velocity in the direction away from the galactic plane, causing it to slowly curve back towards the galactic plane, and would continue to oscillate in this manner until it reached an equilibrium [i.e.\u00a0a flat disk about the rotating axis]. Is my thinking flawed here?\u00a0Granted, collisions do speed up the process immeasurably, but it just doesn&#39;t seem logically necessary to have collisions in order to create a flat\u00a0disk about a\u00a0star, though\u00a0it\u00a0would be\u00a0necessary for the creation of planets.\u00a0My point being that rotation [spin] and gravity\u00a0would be\u00a0the primary cause of a flat solar system in our universe, and collisions are more akin to the cause of planetary bodies within that solar system, but it would still be flat\u00a0either way.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-01-13T12:34:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Fischer", "comment_text": "It all makes sense now...", "comment_date": "2014-01-13T11:31:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phil Francis", "comment_text": "Just like a flat earth this model is so wrong.

I&#39;m an 18 year old non-physics student so please correct me if I&#39;m wrong :)<br><br>At the start, he gave 2 reasons for the Solar System being flat: 1) collision between particles and 2) having 3 spacial dimensions.<br><br>For the first reason,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNXKqeUtJM&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a> Total angular momentum is like the rough average direction in which the particles are moving. Like in a hurricane, every particle has it&#39;s own path of movement, but as a whole the hurricane looks like it&#39;s spinning in 1 direction. Now in the case of the Solar System, it&#39;s much more messy.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNXKqeUtJM&amp;t=1m41s\">1:41</a> Particles lose kinetic energy when they bump into each other.<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNXKqeUtJM&amp;t=1m52s\">1:52</a> Conservation of angular momentum is like what he said, the spinning as a whole does not stop.<br>So the particles still continue orbiting the Sun while they lose the energy that allows them to pull away from the gravity of the Sun. Thus, they end up only spinning with the main up of down movement being their movement closer to the &#39;equator&#39; of the spinning mass due to the Sun&#39;s gravity, hence the flattening effect.<br><br>For the second reason,<br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNXKqeUtJM&amp;t=2m05s\">2:05</a> about the four spacial dimensions, he&#39;s explaining that in the three dimensional model that was just explained, the particles in the xyz-space have only the choice to move into the xy-plane (as explained at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tmNXKqeUtJM&amp;t=1m33s\">1:33</a> ). However with the new w-axis, the particles can move in the wz-plane, which is not affected by the xy-plane, so particles would be able to move between planes and thus remain non-flat, so only a 3 dimensional universe would allow this phenomenon.<br><br>Hope this helps in the understanding of this video!", "comment_date": "2014-01-12T17:23:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Pira", "comment_text": "Very good :) but\u00a0 I do wish you\u00a0would have explained the side view of or solar system and show what it looks like as our sun travels threw space on its great trip around whatever it is orbiting\u00a0and the solar system is not flat ...we have\u00a0Stellar kinematics (not theory).

It appears one is doing all the orbiting, but it just because the suns movement is negligible, but still being affected.<br><br>And if it was simplified even further into 2 equally sized objects orbiting each other.\u00a0 Then after observing many complete revolutions, it would appear the two objects adhere to an imaginary plane while going around each other in this balance.<br><br>If this was just a fictional a two-dimensional world, the plane could not be tilted to any other orientation - it would always have to lie &quot;flat&quot;. (To clarify my poor descriptive skills with an visual example) this could be like seeing a large coin glued flat on a horizontal table. One could not pick up a certain end to make it higher than the other. Its not possible to tilt the coin at all.<br><br>In a three-dimensional world, a coin could be tilted (a 3rd component - z would be needed to describe the plane with a tilt). In other words, by altering the value of z on one side and applying the equal but opposite amount on the other, the plane will end up being tilted a little more to the one side.<br><br>The orbit path - as an imaginary circular path, could be described as the circumference or edge of some imaginary coin. If this tilt was constantly changing (z values), it would be sort of along the surface of a sphere. (but this could be wrong as the coin could be moving). i.e. seeing it as just a 2D disc (the plane is the orientation) that is intersecting a 3D sphere at a point in time - and the edge - the circumference or surface area is the potential position at some point in time.<br><br>\u00a0-- But the system between the 2 orbiting object works because one object loses the exact opposite velocity that the other gains, and vice versa.<br>So if this system was visualized as x and y go back and forth in complete balance with each other, on this imaginary plane, the z component affecting the tilt of the plane. (It still makes the circle path become the surface area of the sphere in the bigger picture, but is just describing the same thing in a different way -- as TEAM\u00a0 x-y\u00a0 vs TEAM z ). Since x and y balance each other out, z is left to to balance out between the two of them. The result is like seeing the disc more or less coming to a certain orientation of its tilt while having a wobble", "comment_date": "2014-01-10T20:35:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IM GOOOD!", "comment_text": "Huh??
