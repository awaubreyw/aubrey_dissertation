The few mountains that do have such abrupt edges are typically volcanoes. Flat land practically never has mountainous features rise up out of no where unless there is a volcanic reason for it. Most mountains exist for continent scale tectonic reasons and typically feature no surrounding flat land, or feature gentile gradation from the mountain to the flat areas. Erosion plays a huge factor. Erosion eliminates sharp transitions at the base of mountains.
