.<br><br>Time is shorter at one&#39;s feet than at their head, because of the geometry basically the greater the energy compression contracting spacetime=0 now the shorter the expanding wavelengths dividing acceleration or gravitation away from its source in unison.. .\u00a0 .<br>The amount of radiation compressing the wave amplitude reaching 1 meter, then will be one-fourth as much at 2 meters, hence one-fourth the intensity.. .\u00a0 .Thus objects just free fall\u00a0towards the greatest energy compression, or shortest rate that time flows.. .\u00a0 .\u00a0\u00a0<br>Simply because

systems -1 are the ashes from prior electrical systems +1=0.\u00a0 . ..as the surface of the light sphere increases with the square of the radius the strength of the gravitational field transverse Q inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that constant expanding light sphere.. .\u00a0 .<br><br>Concentrated spheres at right angles such as electrons, onions, the Earth and Sun, are surrounded by now slice layers of light of equal pressures.. .\u00a0 .Clouds float around the Earth in them.. .\u00a0 .The reason they float in curves parallel to the Earth is because of these equipotential planes of pressures which curve as the Earth curves.. .\u00a0 .<br>Spherically curved planes of pressures act as lenses to multiply and divide light radially because everything is contracting and expanding a locational 4pi spherical inward absorption t=0 and outward emission of electromagnetic waves.. .\u00a0 .<br><br>And that constant outward division now from the Sun transverses the inward force called gravity as time unfolds C2 takes about eight minutes to reach Earth.. .\u00a0 .<br>And likewise the constant outward momentum of the light from Earth\u00a0forms the inward acceleration in unison as time unfolds C2 from the continuous stimulated emissions.. .\u00a0 .and contracting spacetime\u00a0at the bare clay centres within the solar vortex where the solar and planetary gravities meet within the solar vortex.. .\u00a0 .<br>\u00a0<br>As their individual light spheres super impose crests and troughs become in phase now, their space time line symmetries will synchronize, or amplify by multiplying electrical potential along cubic dynameters compressing the wave amplitude +4-0-4+-\u00a0now the shorter the expanding wavelengths dividing acceleration or gravitation away from its source in unison.. .\u00a0 .<br><br>And as all the light spheres from all the stars of a galaxy.. .\u00a0 .\u00a0eventually all their spheres will super impose as crests and troughs become in phase now, their space time line symmetries will synchronize, or amplify by\u00a0compressing the wave amplitude\u00a0+4-0-4+-\u00a0now the shorter the expanding wavelengths dividing acceleration away from its source in unison.. .\u00a0 .\u00a0<br><br>Therefore relative to the perspective of an outside observer at the centre of their own time line of broken symmetry, there is no dark matter!<br><br>And as those vibrating sinusoidal spherical wavefronts propagate through extremely cold low pressure density regions of space acting upon the wave amplitude the wavelengths simply become longer as they spread out over billions of light years.. .\u00a0\u00a0 .Therefore the big bang never happened.. .\u00a0 .And the cosmic microwave background radiation mainly comes from all the cold hydrogen at the centre of their own 3D ref-frames spherically distributed around us.. .\u00a0 .<br><br>In other words this an energy displacement called a redshift interpreted as receding velocities of galaxies is actually a consequence of less energy exchange with distance, less wave interactions oscillating in between time dilating gravitational gradients with distance.. .\u00a0 .And Doppler causes a redshift because light in a vacuum is a constant wave chain reaction from A to B.. .\u00a0 .<br><br>But what if the big bang really did happen?<br>Light emitted now from all matter, from the star&#39;s, and the galaxies of perpetual systems are forever passing out into the infinite ocean of Zero Kelvin, of &#39;empty space&#39; never to return and without ever coming into contact with objects of that nature.. .\u00a0 .<br>That kind of tiny finite island big bang material universe would be destined to become gradually but systematically impoverished and the evolution of perpetual systems would never had happened.. .\u00a0 .<br>But luckily for us our universe is not like this.. .\u00a0 .\u00a0Since Mach&#39;s Principle: &quot;All inertial ref-frames are determined by the composite matter of the universe&quot;, was the basis for Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity.. .\u00a0 .<br><br>All things come out from the One

outlook.. .\u00a0 .\u00a0if you see firm land everywhere within the oceans of becoming and passing.. .\u00a0 .You need names for things just as if they had a rigid permanence.. .\u00a0 .But the very river in which you bathe a second time in the future.. .\u00a0 .\u00a0is no longer the same water that you entered before in the past.. .\u00a0 .<br><br>Vibrating matter is simulating rest and balance now through violent motion!!<br><br>Vibrating matter is a fine mixture of +\u00a0and - electric charges coming into and out of existence.. .\u00a0 .<br>Antimatter positive electric charge and Matter negative electric charge forms a profound and perfect symmetry forming and breaking and when that symmetry is broken forms the imperfect spiral symmetry of the Fibonacci sequence.. .\u00a0 .<br><br>Einstein believed out of the worlds religions Buddhism was the closest to the truth!<br>Buddha said a long time ago, that it was rather like looking a the waves coming to a sea shore!!\u00a0<br><br>The magnetic fields are always at right angles to the direction of the electric current.. .\u00a0 .And this is rather like a series of wavefronts at right angles coming to a seashore.. .\u00a0 .<br><br>Antimatter matter annihilation is like looking at the water receding from the seashore (universe) +1\u00a0into the bass of each wavefront forming t=0 and breaking at the
