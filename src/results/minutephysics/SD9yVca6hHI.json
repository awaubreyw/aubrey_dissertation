Sure, but at the same time I feel like once we do, more people will complain about that new source. They&#39;ll come up with more reasons to favor another, even newer source because the alternative to fossil also kills some west African dung beetle or something. Then, once that newer source is used, more will complain for an even newer one to be used instead, but only after it&#39;s accepted will begin to complain about its affect on something else.

To answer this question we needs a lot of estimates: <br>- volume of water in a typical dino pee<br>- frequency of peeing per day<br>- how many dinosaurs existed<br>- how many millions of years dinosaurs existed<br>- volume of water in lakes, rivers, oceans, glaciers etc<br>- speed of water being recycled<br>- other parameters I&#39;m not aware of<br><br>I tend to think this is probably not true. At best, in a 300 mL coffee you took today, maybe a few water molecules were once parts of dinosaurs pee. Not the whole cup.
