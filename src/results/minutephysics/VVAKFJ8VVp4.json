But I&#39;m sure that it is not a problem for you to draw something that you cannot see.... &quot;close one eye&quot; ?? Really ?? Have you already closed one eye to look at the stars ? So you&#39;re drawing stars with branches because you see them with branches when you&#39;re closing one eye ? And why not with the 2 eyes closed ? It would be easier to draw them... <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVAKFJ8VVp4&amp;t=0m40s\">0:40</a> , do you really think that it looks like a star that we usually draw ?
