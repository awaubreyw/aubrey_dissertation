Take them in turn.<br>Conservatism is not for individual rights or personal liberty; rather, it is for religious values (euphemistically called \u201ctraditional values\u201d or \u201cfamily values\u201d) and a government that enforces them. Although conservatism calls for some economic liberties, it simultaneously demands various violations of individual rights in order to support certain aspects of the welfare state (e.g., Social Security and government-run schools), in order to shackle or control \u201cgreedy\u201d businessmen (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley and anti-immigration laws), and in order to forbid certain \u201cimmoral\u201d acts or relationships (e.g., drug use and gay marriage). Thus, conservatism is utterly at odds with capitalism.<br>And fascism, far from having anything in common with capitalism, is essentially the same atrocity as communism and socialism\u2014the only difference being that whereas communism and socialism openly call for state ownership of all property, fascism holds that some property may be \u201cprivate\u201d\u2014so long as government can dictate how such property may be used. Sure, you own the factory, but here\u2019s what you may and may not produce in it; here\u2019s the minimum wage you must pay employees; here\u2019s the kind of accounting system you must use; here are the specifications your machinery must meet; and so on.<br>Another ill-conceived approach to the left-right political spectrum is the attempt by some to define the political alternatives by reference to the size or percentage of government. In this view, the far left consists of full-sized or 100 percent government; the far right consists of zero government or anarchy; and the middle area subsumes the various other possible sizes of government, from \u201cbig\u201d to \u201cmedium\u201d to \u201csmall\u201d to \u201cminimal.\u201d But this too is hopeless.<br>The size of government is not the essential issue in politics. A large military may be necessary to defend citizens from foreign aggressors, especially if there are many potential aggressors\u2014say, multiple communist or Islamist regimes\u2014who might combine forces against a free country. Likewise, a large court system might be necessary to deal with the countless contracts involved in a large free market and with the various disputes that can arise therein.<br>A small government, by contrast, can\u00a0violate\u00a0rights in myriad ways\u2014if its proper purpose is not established and maintained. Observe that governments in the antebellum South were relatively small, yet their laws permitted and enforced the enslavement of men, women, and children. Likewise, the U.S. government was quite small during the 1890s\u2014even though the Sherman Antitrust Act had passed and was violating businessmen\u2019s rights to liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness.<br>The essential issue in politics is not the size but the\u00a0function\u00a0of government; it\u2019s not whether government is big or small but whether it protects or violates rights.<br>The proper purpose of government is to protect individual rights by banning the use of physical force from social relationships and by using force only in retaliation and only against those who initiate its use. A properly conceived political spectrum must reflect this fact. Whatever terms are used to identify the positions of political ideologies or systems must be defined with regard to the fundamental political alternative: force vs. freedom\u2014or, more specifically, rights-violating vs. rights-protecting\u00a0institutions.<br>Because the term \u201cleft\u201d is already widely used to denote social systems and ideologies of force (e.g., socialism, communism, \u201cprogressivism\u201d), and the term \u201cright\u201d is substantially used to denote social systems and ideologies of freedom (e.g., capitalism, classical liberalism, constitutional republicanism), the best approach for advocates of freedom is not to develop new terminology for the political spectrum, but to define the existing terminology with respect to political essentials\u2014and to claim the extreme right end of the spectrum as rightfully and exclusively\u00a0ours.<br>A notable advantage of embracing the political right as our own is that the term \u201cright\u201d happens to integrate seamlessly with the philosophical and conceptual hierarchy that supports freedom. This is a historic accident, but a welcome one. Although \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d originally referred to seating arrangements of 18th-century legislators in France\u2014arrangements unrelated to anything in contemporary American politics\u2014the term \u201cright\u201d conceptually relates to fundamental moral truths on which freedom depends.<br>Capitalism\u2014the social system of the political\u00a0right\u2014is the system of individual\u00a0rights. It is the system that respects and protects individual rights\u2014by banning physical force from social relationships\u2014and thus enables people to live their lives, to act on their judgment, to keep and use their property, and to pursue personal happiness. This observation grounds the political right in the proper goal of politics: the\u00a0protection\u00a0of rights.<br>Related, and still more fundamental, capitalism is morally\u00a0right. By protecting individual rights, capitalism legalizes\u00a0rational egoism: It enables people to act on the truth that each individual is morally an end in himself, not a means to the ends of others, and that each individual should act to sustain and further his own life and happiness by means of his own rational judgment. This observation deepens the significance of the term \u201cright\u201d and anchors it in the only code of morality that is\u00a0demonstrably true.<br>In short, seen in this light, the\u00a0right\u00a0morality gives rise to the principle of individual\u00a0rights, which gives rise to the need of a political system that\u00a0protects\u00a0rights, which system is properly placed on the political right\u2014in opposition to all systems that in any way violate rights.<br>Observe the clarity gained by this conception of the political spectrum. The far left comprises the pure forms of all the rights-violating social systems: communism, socialism, fascism, Islamism, theocracy, democracy (i.e., rule by the majority), and anarchism (i.e., rule by gangs). The far right comprises the pure forms of rights-respecting social systems: laissez-faire capitalism, classical liberalism, constitutional republicanism\u2014all of which require essentially the same thing: a government that protects and does not violate rights. The middle area consists of all the compromised, mixed, mongrel systems advocated by modern \u201cliberals,\u201d conservatives, unprincipled Tea Partiers (as opposed to the good ones), and all those who want government to protect some rights while violating other rights\u2014whether by forcing people to fund other people\u2019s health care, education, retirement, or the like\u2014or by forcing people to comply with religious or traditional mores regarding sex, marriage, drugs, or what have you.<br>Importantly, on this essentialized conception of the political spectrum, the right does not entail degrees; only the left does. This is because degrees of force are degrees of\u00a0force; violations of rights are\u00a0violations\u00a0of rights. Freedom and rights are absolutes: Either people are free to act on their judgment, to keep and use their property, to pursue their happiness\u2014or they are not free; they are to some extent coerced. Either government protects and does not violate rights\u2014or it violates rights to some extent.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Fact: noT cOPy aND PaSTe?\u00bf", "comment_date": "2020-12-23T00:04:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u3060\u3053\u305f", "comment_text": "this sounds like that one half life 2 song", "comment_date": "2020-12-22T05:07:12Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "SKELLREEPER", "comment_text": "Who are here after searching for half life music", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T21:13:39Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "The Experience", "comment_text": "I came here because I wanted to listen to CP violation from Half life 2, it wasnt CP Violation and I dont understand any of this, but darn is it cool.", "comment_date": "2020-12-21T14:02:57Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Venkata Kumar Iyer", "comment_text": "Aliens: <i>___</i><b>***</b><br>Humans:We have only learnt to distinguish between left and right.", "comment_date": "2020-12-18T16:46:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Kraft", "comment_text": "To sort out whether the aliens are made up of antimatter vs matter, couldn&#39;t you ask them, &quot;are you made up of the stuff that comprises the majority of the universe&#39;s mass...or the other stuff?&quot; ?", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T00:36:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omansh Sharma", "comment_text": "let the aliens figure it out.", "comment_date": "2020-12-08T09:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gorge Lis", "comment_text": "just stop a wideo at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Elt0Gt9Cb6Q&amp;t=3m09s\">3:09</a>... done, u have 2 anti-aliens.", "comment_date": "2020-12-07T12:57:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hariharan 4349-21", "comment_text": "???

Googology is basically the study of very large numbers and the notations that is used to express them. When you study googology in depth, you can see that the so-called scientific notation which we usually use to express large numbers is actually incredibly weak in comparison to many of the commonly used notations in googology such as Knuth&#39;s up-arrow notation, fast-growing hierarchy, Bird&#39;s Array Notation and Bashicu Matrix System, although it may not seems weak at all to an average person. This is mainly because we don&#39;t need numbers much larger than those that can be made using exponents in real life. For example, the mass of Sun is approximately 2*10^30 kg and the number of subatomic particles in the universe is approimately 10^80. \r<br>    Below I will show you the formal definition and some examples of expression in Knuth&#39;s up-arrow notation:\r<br>a^^^^...^^^b with n uparrows = a^^^...^a^^^...^^a^^^...^^a... ...a^^^..^^a with (n-1) uparrows between each successive a&#39;s\r<br>Where a^b is the same as a raised to the power tower of b\r<br>First, we will take a review of addition, multiplication and exponentiation. We had all studied in school that addition is repeated counting, multiplication is repeated addition and exponentiation is repeated multiplication, mathematically:\r<br>a+b = a+1+1+1...+1 (repeated b times)\r<br>a*b = a+a+a...+a (repeated b times), and\r<br>a^b = a*a*a*a...*a (repeated b times)\r<br>Now, we will start with the double up-arrow operator, which is better known as tetration.\r<br>a^^b (read this as &quot;a tetrated to b&quot;) = a^a^a^a^...^a (b times) (a power tower of a&#39;s b terms high)\r<br>Keep in mind that exponents are always right-associative, so a^b^c^d is the same as a^(b^(c^d))\r<br>For example, 2^^3 = 2^2^2 = 2^4 = 16\r<br>2^^4 = 2^2^2^2 = 2^2^4 = 2^16 = 65536\r<br>2^^5 = 2^2^2^2^2 = 2^2^2^4 = 2^2^16 = 2^65536 = 10^(log10(2)*65536) using rules of logarithm = approx. 2*10^19728 (a number WITH 19729 DIGITS!!!!!!)\r<br>3^^3 = 3^3^3 = 3^27 = \t7,625,597,484,987 (approximately 7.6 trillion for short)\r<br>10^^^3 = 10^10^10 = 10^(10 billion) = 1 followed by ten billion zeroes\r<br>Now do you see how powerful tetration is in comparison to scientific notation?\r<br>But that&#39;s not the end of the story. Just like how tetration is repeated exponentiation, pentation is repeated tetration, which is normally denoted as triple up arrows (^^^) In summary, the n arrow operator is repeated (n-1) arrow operator\r<br>    After that, I suggest you to learn the definition of fast-growing hierarchy, which is basically like this:\r<br>f_n(a) = (f_(n-1))^a(a), when n is a successor ordinal, or in other words, \r<br>f_(n-1)(f_(n-1)(...(f_(n-1)(a))...)) (nested n times)\r<br>When n is a limit ordinal, f_n(a) is defined as f_(n[a])(a), where n[a] is the n-th element of the fundamental sequence of the ordinal n\r<br>    For the definition of successor and limit ordinals, you can search it yourself in Googology Wiki\r<br>    Now, here&#39;s an equation for you. Given that 1/f_x(100) is the amount of DNA I inherit from my mom, try to find the ordinal x. The ordinal x here is known as my DNA ordinal\r<br>    Here&#39;s the approximate value of x in Bashicu Matrix System: (0,0,0)(1,1,1)(2,2,2)(3,3,3)(3,3,0)(4,4,1)(5,5,2)(6,6,2)(7,7,0)(8,8,1)(9,9,2)(10,9,2)(11,9,0)(12,10,1)(13,11,2)(13,11,2)(13,11,1)(14,12,2)(14,11,1)(15,12,2)(15,11,1)(16,12,0)(17,13,1)(18,14,2)(18,14,2)(18,14,1)(19,15,2)(19,14,1)(20,15,2)(20,14,1)(21,15,0)(22,16,1)(23,17,2)(23,17,2)(23,17,1)(24,18,2)(24,17,1)(25,18,2)(25,17,0)(26,18,1)(27,19,2)(27,19,2)(27,19,1)(28,20,2)(28,19,1)(29,20,2)(29,19,0)(30,20,1)(31,21,2)(31,21,2)(31,21,1)(32,22,2)(32,21,1)(33,22,2)(33,21,0)(34,22,1)(35,23,2)(35,23,2)(35,23,1)(36,24,2)(36,23,1)(37,24,2)(37,23,0)(38,24,1)(39,25,2)(40,25,2)(40,25,1)(41,26,2)(41,22,1)(42,23,2)(42,23,2)(42,23,1)(43,24,2)(43,23,1)(44,24,2)(44,23,0)(45,24,1)(46,25,2)(47,25,2)(47,25,1)(48,26,1)(49,27,0)(50,28,1)(51,29,2)(52,29,2)(52,29,1)(53,30,0)(54,31,1)(55,32,2)(56,32,2)(56,32,0)(57,33,1)(58,34,2)(59,34,2)(59,34,0)(60,35,1)(61,36,2)(62,36,2)(62,36,0)(63,37,1)(64,38,2)(65,38,2)(65,38,0)(66,39,1)(67,40,2)(68,40,2)(68,40,0)(69,41,1)(70,42,2)(71,42,2)(71,42,0)(72,43,1)(73,44,0)(74,45,1)(75,44,0)... ...\r<br>For the definition of Bashicu Matrix System, you can search it up yourself in google\r<br>    So can you please help me to analyze my DNA ordinal?", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T23:21:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tacos4Tico", "comment_text": "I\u2019m going to show this to my science teacher and see if they understand..", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T16:57:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mohammed Parvez Jamadar", "comment_text": "PCMB all in ONE channel by a NEET and JEE District topper himself ,here is the link <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1yecOEqtQ9s\">https://youtu.be/1yecOEqtQ9s</a><br>to one of his videos", "comment_date": "2020-10-18T15:39:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paguo", "comment_text": "How the fuck do we know anti-matter uranium electrons spin towards right?", "comment_date": "2020-10-17T16:49:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Damorere Vlogs", "comment_text": "&quot;simply build a particle accelerator&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-10-12T09:32:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Will Johnson", "comment_text": "Simply build a particle accelerator", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T23:04:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheVergile", "comment_text": "im pretty sure we could communicate left or right by using stars. if we know where the aliens are its super easy bc they see us going around our sun either clockwise or anticlockwise depending on whether they sit above or below our orbital plane.<br>if we dont know where they are we could define a simple geometric system. draw a line between the two pulsars with frequencies x and y. from this line draw a plumb line towards the pulsar with frequency z.<br>look at this from the direction of pulsar with frequency w. make sure pulsar z is up. define left to be the direction of pulsar x. is this the direction electrons spin when emitted from decaying uranium? if not please stay away from earth, thanks", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T19:55:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Sunskimmer", "comment_text": "I watch this channel when I\u2019m feeling too smart to keep my ego in check", "comment_date": "2020-10-07T05:46:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sollace", "comment_text": "Phsyicists: &quot;You need a particle accelerator to tell left from right.&quot;<br>Most normal people: <b>points finger</b>", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T10:06:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Troiken", "comment_text": "How do we know we&#39;re matter and not anti-matter?", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T03:10:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rajat_ D.", "comment_text": "How do we know about antimatter like we don&#39;t know how it behaves...so how can we confirm it&#39;s orientation???", "comment_date": "2020-10-05T08:19:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "karsten69", "comment_text": "...so...

As such the letters D and L are used. However, there is a way to name molecules absolutely and that is by using the new naming convention where all chiral centers of a molecule are named according to the general principle that  objects of heavier atomic mass usually taking precedence. If there are substituents (specifically alkanes) that weigh the same, the more branched alkane would take precedence. (An example is that isopropyl would take precedence over propyl.) Sameness is not an issue because by definition chirality involves unique substituents. After the numbering, a frame of reference is chosen whereby  the lowest preceding substituent is behind the molecule with respect to the viewer. The remaining substituents are then used to determine if precedence is increasing in a clockwise or anticlockwise manner. If clockwise, the chiral center is named with the letter R and anticlockwise, S. This means that all chiral centers of a molecule are named either R or S according to the above rules. As such, R and S are absolute and need no molecule to compare to whereas D and L are relative (and are determined by comparing to glyceraldeyde). <br><br>As such, the TL;DR is that there is a method by which one can differentiate between enantiomers, so long as R and S are used rather than D and L.<br>Also sorry for the huge wall of text, just had to get this clarification out in the open.", "comment_date": "2020-02-27T05:47:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aryan Jindal", "comment_text": "I think that minute physics and Nolan must collaborate", "comment_date": "2020-02-27T05:36:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "alveolate hermeneutist", "comment_text": "is there some problem with just drawing out the chirality? are visual illustrations also somehow symmetric in some unexpected way now?", "comment_date": "2020-02-27T05:06:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Adro Slice", "comment_text": "I like the K-On! particle kek", "comment_date": "2020-02-27T05:05:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pratham arya", "comment_text": "How to simply build particle accelerator without the help of tech of anti-alien?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-02-27T05:03:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chitranjan Baghi", "comment_text": "all that for a hand shake that will eventually end up in a blast of energy. coz matter anti matter.", "comment_date": "2020-02-27T04:57:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kosmos", "comment_text": "Oh.", "comment_date": "2020-02-27T04:55:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "emperor chop chop", "comment_text": "What&#39;s a &#39;matter you&#39;?

Mater on the other hand can hide inside of the core of a star and end up becoming a big Clump overtime and then redistribute to become the dominant species of matter. Antimatter does not have this hiding quality. When sings are fused together in order for any antimatter to exist it has to exist in a very large amount the most common anti-meth her projection is an antimatter star or an antimatter black hole. Anything smaller would be destroyed immediately by space debris created by said regular stars and all other items would have a Cascade effect inside antimatter leading to its eventual destruction but matter is incredibly resilient and capable of forming matter that survived the collusion and explosion process explosion that might destroy all of antimatter won&#39;t exactly destroy all forms of matter and then after a bunch of recycling matter is the only thing that we have left for the most part. If antimatter was capable of being as durable as regular matter then it would be but it&#39;s just not it&#39;s simply too reactive. But why another question and could be if antimatter is ever able to create complex molecular structures such as uranium or iron. The thing about it is that antimatter has to form alongside with right who are protons and neutrons and they don&#39;t want to fuse together they&#39;ll just break apart or annihilate each other as they try to form more complex molecules if you can create a complex molecule with antimatter I would say you have done the impossible unless there is a way to do that that I am unaware of<br> Concep_vipereon", "comment_date": "2020-02-26T15:53:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicholas Caprarola", "comment_text": "This is all under the assumption that aliens use the same nominclature or do science the same way we do.
