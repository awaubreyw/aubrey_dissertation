Googology is basically the study of very large numbers and the notations that is used to express them. When you study googology in depth, you can see that the so-called scientific notation which we usually use to express large numbers is actually incredibly weak in comparison to many of the commonly used notations in googology such as Knuth&#39;s up-arrow notation, fast-growing hierarchy, Bird&#39;s Array Notation and Bashicu Matrix System, although it may not seems weak at all to an average person. This is mainly because we don&#39;t need numbers much larger than those that can be made using exponents in real life. For example, the mass of Sun is approximately 2*10^30 kg and the number of subatomic particles in the universe is approimately 10^80. \r<br>    Below I will show you the formal definition and some examples of expression in Knuth&#39;s up-arrow notation:\r<br>a^^^^...^^^b with n uparrows = a^^^...^a^^^...^^a^^^...^^a... ...a^^^..^^a with (n-1) uparrows between each successive a&#39;s\r<br>Where a^b is the same as a raised to the power tower of b\r<br>First, we will take a review of addition, multiplication and exponentiation. We had all studied in school that addition is repeated counting, multiplication is repeated addition and exponentiation is repeated multiplication, mathematically:\r<br>a+b = a+1+1+1...+1 (repeated b times)\r<br>a*b = a+a+a...+a (repeated b times), and\r<br>a^b = a*a*a*a...*a (repeated b times)\r<br>Now, we will start with the double up-arrow operator, which is better known as tetration.\r<br>a^^b (read this as &quot;a tetrated to b&quot;) = a^a^a^a^...^a (b times) (a power tower of a&#39;s b terms high)\r<br>Keep in mind that exponents are always right-associative, so a^b^c^d is the same as a^(b^(c^d))\r<br>For example, 2^^3 = 2^2^2 = 2^4 = 16\r<br>2^^4 = 2^2^2^2 = 2^2^4 = 2^16 = 65536\r<br>2^^5 = 2^2^2^2^2 = 2^2^2^4 = 2^2^16 = 2^65536 = 10^(log10(2)*65536) using rules of logarithm = approx. 2*10^19728 (a number WITH 19729 DIGITS!!!!!!)\r<br>3^^3 = 3^3^3 = 3^27 = \t7,625,597,484,987 (approximately 7.6 trillion for short)\r<br>10^^^3 = 10^10^10 = 10^(10 billion) = 1 followed by ten billion zeroes\r<br>Now do you see how powerful tetration is in comparison to scientific notation?\r<br>But that&#39;s not the end of the story. Just like how tetration is repeated exponentiation, pentation is repeated tetration, which is normally denoted as triple up arrows (^^^) In summary, the n arrow operator is repeated (n-1) arrow operator\r<br>    After that, I suggest you to learn the definition of fast-growing hierarchy, which is basically like this:\r<br>f_n(a) = (f_(n-1))^a(a), when n is a successor ordinal, or in other words, \r<br>f_(n-1)(f_(n-1)(...(f_(n-1)(a))...)) (nested n times)\r<br>When n is a limit ordinal, f_n(a) is defined as f_(n[a])(a), where n[a] is the n-th element of the fundamental sequence of the ordinal n\r<br>    For the definition of successor and limit ordinals, you can search it yourself in Googology Wiki\r<br>    Now, here&#39;s an equation for you. Given that 1/f_x(100) is the amount of DNA I inherit from my mom, try to find the ordinal x. The ordinal x here is known as my DNA ordinal\r<br>    Here&#39;s the approximate value of x in Bashicu Matrix System: (0,0,0)(1,1,1)(2,2,2)(3,3,3)(3,3,0)(4,4,1)(5,5,2)(6,6,2)(7,7,0)(8,8,1)(9,9,2)(10,9,2)(11,9,0)(12,10,1)(13,11,2)(13,11,2)(13,11,1)(14,12,2)(14,11,1)(15,12,2)(15,11,1)(16,12,0)(17,13,1)(18,14,2)(18,14,2)(18,14,1)(19,15,2)(19,14,1)(20,15,2)(20,14,1)(21,15,0)(22,16,1)(23,17,2)(23,17,2)(23,17,1)(24,18,2)(24,17,1)(25,18,2)(25,17,0)(26,18,1)(27,19,2)(27,19,2)(27,19,1)(28,20,2)(28,19,1)(29,20,2)(29,19,0)(30,20,1)(31,21,2)(31,21,2)(31,21,1)(32,22,2)(32,21,1)(33,22,2)(33,21,0)(34,22,1)(35,23,2)(35,23,2)(35,23,1)(36,24,2)(36,23,1)(37,24,2)(37,23,0)(38,24,1)(39,25,2)(40,25,2)(40,25,1)(41,26,2)(41,22,1)(42,23,2)(42,23,2)(42,23,1)(43,24,2)(43,23,1)(44,24,2)(44,23,0)(45,24,1)(46,25,2)(47,25,2)(47,25,1)(48,26,1)(49,27,0)(50,28,1)(51,29,2)(52,29,2)(52,29,1)(53,30,0)(54,31,1)(55,32,2)(56,32,2)(56,32,0)(57,33,1)(58,34,2)(59,34,2)(59,34,0)(60,35,1)(61,36,2)(62,36,2)(62,36,0)(63,37,1)(64,38,2)(65,38,2)(65,38,0)(66,39,1)(67,40,2)(68,40,2)(68,40,0)(69,41,1)(70,42,2)(71,42,2)(71,42,0)(72,43,1)(73,44,0)(74,45,1)(75,44,0)... ...\r<br>For the definition of Bashicu Matrix System, you can search it up yourself in google\r<br>    So can you please help me to analyze my DNA ordinal?", "comment_date": "2020-10-28T23:21:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "funnibird", "comment_text": "helium likes messing with my small amount of ocd", "comment_date": "2020-10-27T23:14:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr___Gonz", "comment_text": "Anyone else notice that the spiral pattern looked a lot like it would fit in the golden ratio (fibonacci sequence)?", "comment_date": "2020-10-26T09:51:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vin\u00edcius Frias A Leite", "comment_text": "Hahahaha", "comment_date": "2020-10-16T16:52:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark W", "comment_text": "The organic chemist Leon Mandell (Ph.D, Harvard), thinks hydrogen should be located above carbon.", "comment_date": "2020-10-15T21:53:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stargel", "comment_text": "I hate dumb changes \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2a", "comment_date": "2020-10-13T17:19:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sachin Tharuka", "comment_text": "So why do we watch this???

The D and F Orbital type Elements being on the inside of the Periodic Table makes sense because they add Core Electrons. <br><br>The easiest, most logical and accurate way to teach/learn the Periodic Table, is by plotting the Elements 1 by 1 based on Quantitative data according to the Periodic Law, rather than showing all the Elements at once. After all, Elements were created from smallest to largest, they did not all come into existence at once. <br><br>Here is the Periodic Table at it&#39;s best, providing the maximum amount of accurate and useful Element information in 2 dimensional space.
