I have given demonstrations of driving down country roads at 80 km/h in reverse. The instability you talk about is because of the &quot;tow in&quot; set on the front wheels. That is the left wheel is set to turn slightly to the right and the right wheel slightly to the left. The result of this is the car has a tendency to naturally steer straight if you let go of the steering wheel. However &quot;tow in&quot; going forward is &quot;tow out&quot; going backwards. So a car configured to be stable going forwards is hence configured to be unstable going the other way.
