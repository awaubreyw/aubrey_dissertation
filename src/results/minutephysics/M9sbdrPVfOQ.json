If we can get the Searl Effect Generator out to the public we can achieve type 1 status as a civilization, on our way to becoming a type 2 interstellar species. This type of technology could be used to create an electrogravitic propulsion system, what Thomas Townsend Brown was trying to develop back in the 1920s. The perfect shape of ship for this type of propulsion would be a disk. We should also have the Venus Project, where all goods and services are made abundant for all the worlds people, recycle everything and automate as much as possible, 3D print homes and anything that is wanted, use NAD+ and stem cell research to reverse ageing, terraform other planets and create circular dome cities on the surface, and if you care about privacy, metamaterials have a negative refractive index which allows certain frequencies of electromagnetic radiation to pass through with superluminal velocity allowing for faster than light computing and meta invisibility, meta materials are not found in nature they are created by taking a metal like copper gold silver or other metals and creating a nano sized crystal structure, depending on what you want it to do depends on the shapes of the structure. We could also use propulsion system that uses mercury, barium, thallium, calcium, copper oxide, superfluid ferrofluid, in a torus that uses magnetic fields to rotate the liquid at high velocities, creating a gravitomagnetic field.

Accordingly, THE PLANETS move away very, very, very, very slightly in relation to what is the Sun. I have explained the cosmological redshift AND the supergiant stars. E=mc\u00b2 is F=ma, as the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE.

Indeed, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy.

We <b>label</b> 3 spatial dimensions as the first three, and the 1 temporal dimension the fourth, by (unspoken) convention. (And because we grow up hearing time referred to as &#39;the fourth dimension&#39;) <br><br>The convention came about because time wasn&#39;t academically considered to be a dimension until after the three spatial ones were. Somewhere between Newton and Einstein (I think), time went from something that exists but you don&#39;t really think about, to just another axis on a graph. <br><br>Einstein was the first to think about time as being &#39;like&#39; space, a dimension (or axis) you can move forwards <b>and</b> backwards on, and trace out wiggly paths through spacetime, rather than just through space. Even the words we use to talk about time &#39;forwards and backwards&#39; suggest that there is only one way to travel through it, in a straight line, and that&#39;s mostly true in every-day experience, but it turns out not to be completely true if you look closely enough.

In that manner we can effectively argue which dimension belongs to which number assignment.Once we get into effective descriptions of higher definitions our brain has a harder and harder time absorbing the description of it because of or 3-D existence for the sake of argument. You are right though that the number assignment is trival in the grand scheme besides the ability for us humans to comprehend them. It was be like describing Shakespeare to a fish unless you can dumb it down and that&#39;s what the number system accomplishes.

The 4D Rubik&#39;s cube example is specious. <br>If you want to imagine 4 dimensions it&#39;s simple. <br>First let&#39;s simplify and think about one dimension, X. Now let&#39;s visualize a point in the X dimension. Imagine it&#39;s X dimension coordinate is 5. Then imagine it&#39;s 10. The units don&#39;t matter and you intuitively know that the point is now twice as far from the origin at 10 as it was at 5.<br>Now let&#39;s imagine the same thing in two dimensions. Our point starts at X=5, Y=0. Then imagine it at X=10, Y=0. To us this looks no different than the first example because we didn&#39;t move in the Y dimension, but that doesn&#39;t mean there is no Y dimension, we just don&#39;t see it implicitly because our point isn&#39;t moving in it.<br>OK, so let&#39;s take the example all the way, skipping the third dimension and imagining the outcome was the same in three dimensions and skip to four dimensions.<br>In this case let&#39;s first imagine our point only moves in the fourth dimension, time. In the first three dimensions it appears stationary. It is moving through time but not space. Now let&#39;s move it in two dimensions at once. Let&#39;s move it along the X axis and the Time axis. Think of a chart or graph. For each unit of time we move, the point moves 5 units of X. What do we see? Well, at unit 0 of Time, the point is at X=5, Y=0, Z=0. At unit 1 of Time, our point is at X=10, Y=0, Z-0, Time=1. At unit 2 of Time, it&#39;s X=15, Y=0, Z=0, Time=2. <br>Our perception of this is MOTION and it&#39;s one of the ways we perceive Time (or at least interpret it). But simply looked at the point is moving in two of the four dimensions. X and Time. Nothing difficult here. The only difference is that we can only move in the positive direction on the time axis, as far as we know anyway. It&#39;s like a one way street.

We actually live in the fourth dimension, which is why we perceive three dimensional objects as being the highest form of creation. If we lived in the third dimension, we would perceive two dimensional objects as the highest form of creation and so forth. That water and oil in a jug explanation has nothing to do with dimensions, but everything to do with physical properties. Math is an irrefutable truth of the universe. In math when you plot a line, it is a second dimensional object in within the third dimension. The line travels along the X,Y plain, because it is two dimensional. However, if the line could talk it would not perceive this, the same way we do, because we can see it going either vertical, horizontal or a combination of both or we could rotate the line into traveling along the X,Y, and Z plane. But to the line itself, none of that would matter, because it is simply a line going in one direction. Add to that, the line may not even see itself as a line. Let&#39;s think about this. When we view anything with our eyes all we see at one moment are combination of two dimensional planes that seem to form three dimensional objects. Never, unless we are looking at a transparent object do we see the entire object at once and even then all we can see is the direct viewpoint we are looking at the object from. However, if we could perceive four dimensions while existing in the fifth we could perceive the entire three dimensional object at once and all sides at the same time. Now, I know that doesn&#39;t seem possible, to most. But, if you could talk to a line, a cube wouldn&#39;t make much sense to it either.

What he talks about cuts through our common assumptions and relates to our unquestioning auto-acceptance of anything we are told.  As he says there is no absolute direction for the x-dimension or any others.  He also mentions multiple time dimensions but I&#39;m not sure how that would look if it did not somehow also equate spatially somehow.  Having multiple spatial dimensions allows us to record an angle from a spatial-point to some point between each of them.  But, how do you likewise have angles from a point-in-time between multiple time dimensions?  Time usually has but one roll-out.  If an object rolls out at an angle between two time lines it must appear to animate at an unexplained rate in ours whilst presumably also animating across what must be parallel spaces (or universes).  Being at an angle to the two timelines (one existing across the universes somehow) I guess we would see the oddly walking person for only a very short span of time in our universe!  That short time would be the time taken for them to cross through our universe...  This is, in a fashion, making the second time dimension just the 4th spatial dimension returning us to or original question.

There IS in fact a fourth dimension, and a third, and a second, and a first. It&#39;s not very accurate to relate them to cups of water, because in water everything molds together into one fluid body. In dimensions, however, there are requirements to achieve a certain dimensional existence- namely, the ones before it. If I were to draw a cube, I would first need to make a line, then a plane by intersecting those lines, then a space by intersecting those planes. Assuming the fourth dimension deals with time, that cube doesn&#39;t exist in four dimensions- it is still and exists in three. There is no matter of &#39;direction,&#39; because dimensions go in ALL directions. If you start with a line, you can point it in infinitely many directions and it will still be a one-dimensional line in the first dimension. However, the moment you intersect that line with another, it creates the concept of a flat space called a plane- that is, several lines can exist in different positions throughout. As soon as you intersect that &#39;plane&#39; with another, you get a space- multiple planes can exist within that space, and thus a third dimension is formed. In two dimensions, could you have a separate plane anywhere in existence? No. In one dimension, could you have anything but one line in existence? No. Thus, you need all dimensions before it to achieve the dimension your object exists in.

A dimension is not a universe that we live in, rather the way we see things. Therefore, if you look at a Rubik&#39;s cube from the perfect angle from the side, you can only see a square, hence 2d square, or 2d triangle, or 2d whatever the case may be. Human eyes are only capable of seeing 3 dimensional figures because, we can not see through something, unless it is glass, and even if it is glass it would have to double and maybe even triple for it to be considered 4d, so in that case a pentagon, would have well over a hundred sides outside, and if you had special eyes to see through it, hundreds more lines and sides that overlapped each other on the inside of the million sided 4d pentagon. Also dimensions are the direction you are going. In 2d, you would only be able to move North, South, East, and West, plus you wouldn&#39;t be able to flip over so you would be looking at one side of the world upside down. In 3d we can move up, down, north, south, east, and west. So in theory, if there was a fourth dimension somehow, the moment we entered it we would turn inside out and make a huge mess of inner organs on the 4d floor and the 4d sofa. There is no other way of direction, you can&#39;t move diagonally naturally, and even then diagonal is a direction, if you did manage to move another direction and see things from a 4d perspective, your body would be incapable of seeing the 4d objects and your sense of sight would vanish, which is the scientific way of saying that your eyeballs would explode. There is no 4d of seeing and there is no 4th direction to move. Therefore, technically there is no 3D, or 2d, or 4d, or zero.

There are not 3 spatial dimensions and 1 time dimension, they are all just spatial dimensions.

Have you ever seen one of those flip books where you flip through all the pages rapidly and an animation can be seen? I posit that our universe is very much like that. Where one page in that book is like a slice of frozen time in our world, just like one page is a slice of frozen time for the animation. On closer inspection you can see that animation has a &quot;world line&quot; and it is actually a 3 dimensional object. The same I think is true of us. Our perception of time is just a flip book if you will in layman&#39;s terms. Where the book is 4 dimensional  and the page is a 3 dimensional slice of frozen time in our world. As we move through this 4 dimensional space we get the illusion of time as we flip from one page to the next. I don&#39;t really believe we are in a 4 dimensional book but I thought it best to illustrate the concept this way. So as you can see, time isn&#39;t spooky or different at all. It is just a higher spatial dimension like all the rest.

Imagine your car has a system that has a Long&#39;GPS (a GPS that only describes longitude) + a Lat&#39;GPS (a GPS that only describes latitude) + an Altimeter (describes Altitude or Height).<br><br>You drive for days, and go to a very high parking, maybe several kilometers high. You park your car at a random level in the parking, very high. Then there is a blast of EMP and all your electronics get knocked down, and you get kicked in the head and forget everything. When you&#39;ll be looking for your car, what do you need to do to find it?<br><br>You will get a look at the coordinates the 2 GPS and Altimer displays (it&#39;s locked since the time of the EMP blast). Each device gives you a 1-dimensional information.<br>- The GPS give you the latitude and longitude. It means both GPS provide 1-dimensional information about the position. It&#39;s a first dimension. But you are clever and you combine these two data points: at the cross of these 2 one-dimensional lines, there is the 2-dimensional position of your car on Earth&#39;s surface. It is the 2nd dimension.<br>- Then, Altimeter gives you the height of your car. You combine GPS + Altimer: your car is at the cross of the 2-dimensional position (latitude+longitude) and the 3rd line, the height, or distance from the 2D position of your car on Earth&#39;s surface. The third dimension (because it&#39;s a 3rd number to describe the coordinates).<br>- You go to this exact 3-dimensional position (longitude+latitude+height). Your car is not here. Why?<br><br>Because you forgot THE FOURTH dimension: time. Indeed, you just woke up from a 25-year long coma. Your car has been stolen. Time IS the 4th dimension. Because it ADDS a 4th number to describe the coordinates of your car. The position of your car changed in time. And only by looking at this 4th dimension you can find your car.<br>&quot;Where was my car 25 years ago at 10am?&quot; This is a 1D coordinate because there is just 1 number (the date), but if you can add to this the 2 GPS + Altimeter&#39;s coordinates, and if you can time-travel as easily as you can space-travel, you would find it back right here in the parking lot 25 years ago.<br><br>So there is a FIRST dimension (one line, wherever it comes from and goes to, be it north, up, back, or left) and then a second, and a third and a fourth dimension. And we humans are able to tell which one is which. The author of this vid is confusing spacetime dimensions with playing with a compass in his head. The space dimensions are just not about right/left or up/down or back and forth or north, est, west, south. A dimension is about the minimum number of coordinates (number) required to describe the position of any point within it. In this world, we need 4 numbers (or data point) to describe the position of any point / object because we live in a 4 dimensional world. Now how do we know Time is the 4th?<br><br>What&#39;s the minimum number of coordinates you need to describe the position of a point within Time? 1. So it can in theory be the first dimension. But we had our Einstein moments so now we know the space and time are not separate, just as we know earth is not flat. So what&#39;s the minimum number of coordinates you need to describe the position of a point within spaceTIME (when you add time)? 4. Time adds the 4th coordinates required to describe the position of a point within spacetime.

In my opinion, an infinity would be defying the theory of relativity. But maybe the speed of light itself is the infinity nobody understands. We know that the speed of light is a boundary for all of physics, but maybe it is an entrance that we don&#39;t have the key to. One thing that really confuses this theory but also kind of supports it, is that nothing can go faster than the speed of light, even from a perspective. Light moving past you while you are moving in a car, will see you as not moving. NOTHING can possibly move faster than the speed of light. And nothing BUT light can move the speed of light. I have probably confused anyone reading this a lot, but again, what I believe doesn&#39;t change anything. Nobody can truly know what the answer is, so there is really no point in debating it.

This also proves that there can not be a god from heaven, there is only human life that we can think of. But yes, if there is 4th dimensional world somewhere, then &#39;time travel&#39; is very much possible because the 4th dimension (time) is a direction past and future. but it will take atleast 4 years for us to go into 4th dimension in a speed of light, that means out of solor system and then reach the point we wish to. But to do all this we need to cross vacuum which is 0 dimensional world. this shows though time travel is possible but it has to be in flash of a second. And to travel is a flash of a second we need 80 percent of all the sun&#39;s energy to be accumulated at one place and help us throw out from there into the Galaxy so that we can tackle the vacuum and travel in a flash of a second to that &#39;earth year&#39; thru the light year. condition of anyone travelling thru a flash will make him sleek from its original body dimension which in other words mean if a person is 100 kgs, he will loose 50 % of his body mass and will make him appear like a floating bone. I will get back with more explanation soon. Now, if time travel has to take place, a person&#39;s mind just can&#39;t do it all alone, his mind has to be hypnotized to make him react normally to another dimensional world. For eg. a human mind just can&#39;t react to a &#39;shock&#39; with a calm body posture and his/her brain. Travel into is possible if we travel through a flash. An energy flash can only be created on a tip (like that of a pyramid) and then with Newton&#39;s first law giving us some inertia and throwing out in higher dimension to travel back and forth. To reach to your original position, time traveler has to exactly know &#39;the date, time and the exact sec to come back otherwise he will be trapped forever in energy of another dimension.
