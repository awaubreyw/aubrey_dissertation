The equation R = 1000 * Vol is wrong because he forgot two principals about R, those being that R is the quantity of mass that leaves the rocket in a given amount of time (unit kg/s) and the role that density plays in the equation. The correct equation is R*t = 1000 * Vol [kg] and the number 1000 isn&#39;t there because there are 1000 liters in 1 m^3 of liquid, but rather because the density of water is 1000 kg/m^3. So knowing that we can easily see that R, which is equal to m/t (because it&#39;s the quantity of mass that leaves the rocket in a given amount of time; m - mass, t - time), needs to be measured in the unit of kg/s and the correct way to get this unit from that equation is to represent the mass (m) as m = (1000 [kg/m^3])*(Vol [m^3]) = 1000 * Vol [kg], where Vol is the volume of the water leaving the rocket. Then we put that equation in the previous one (R=m/t) to get R = (1000 * Vol)/t [kg/s]. And if you&#39;re still doubtful there is a simple test we can preform to see that this result is correct. We know that mass is measured in kilograms (kg) and acceleration is measured in m/s^2 (meters divided by seconds squared). From there we know that the first part of the identity (M*g = R*Ve), M*g, is measured in (kg*m)/s^2 and since it is an identity the second part must be measured in the same units. Since we know that Ve (the speed at which the fuel is ejected) is measured in m/s (meters divided by seconds) we just need to work out what R is measured in so that the identity is correct. So (kg*m)/s^2 = [R] * m/s. From here we can conclude that R is measured in kg/s exactly as our previous explanation showed us. In summary R = (1000 * Vol)/t [kg/s] where as R*t = 1000 * Vol [kg]. Also the 1000 in the previous two equations comes from the density of water which is 1000 kg/m^3 under normal circumstances.", "comment_date": "2015-10-18T03:27:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mathe Roland", "comment_text": "so i got 16l but i think i am off ....does someone understand this shit??", "comment_date": "2015-10-08T12:04:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aditya Nadgir", "comment_text": "dude, in the second case -mg is not equal to the force applied by the fuel, because clearly the fuel is winning.....that&#39;s why he rocket is flying...", "comment_date": "2015-10-02T03:59:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Amit Anand", "comment_text": "why no background bass????", "comment_date": "2015-09-27T19:03:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Levi Constantin", "comment_text": "play ksp now on a computer you will learn about rockets", "comment_date": "2015-09-22T19:33:15Z", "likes_count": 59}, {"comment_by": "Kitsumyr", "comment_text": "this video is called fiveminutephysics not minute physics", "comment_date": "2015-09-04T12:54:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aeroscience", "comment_text": "You should do more rocket science", "comment_date": "2015-06-03T01:28:34Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jenny Cole", "comment_text": "this is very exciting.", "comment_date": "2015-06-02T19:22:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter & Pete", "comment_text": "Good video, nice to see someone recognizes that a rocket thrust generator &#39;exhaust&#39; is part of the mass of the rocket (system).<br><br>However what the video does not explain is how it actually propels itself upwards.
