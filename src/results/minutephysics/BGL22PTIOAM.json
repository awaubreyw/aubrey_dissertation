How are you supposed to teach a student what the strong and weak nuclear forces are if they do not have a fundamental understanding of what a force is and how it affects an object (not where it comes from, but what it DOES)? This fundamental understanding comes directly from newtonian physics. How do you teach a student not to fall for internet junk science about overunity machines if they don&#39;t have the basic understanding of work and the conservation of energy that comes from the work of James Prescott Joule, Lord Kelvin, and other 19th century scientists? How can they grasp diodes and transistors if they do not understand what a potential difference is in the simpler context of the work of Alessandro Volta and Georg Ohm?<br>The fact is that teaching these things effectively takes time. High school physics teachers have, in some cases, just 9 months to teach as much physics as we possibly can.<br>I am not arguing that these newer topics should not be taught-- in fact, I strongly believe that they should be, and I do teach many of them including the photoelectric effect, deBroglie wavelengths, nuclear decay and radiation, atomic spectroscopy, and some special relativity. But to tell teachers not to bother teaching Newton&#39;s law of universal gravitation &quot;because it&#39;s just an approximation&quot; ignores the larger pedagogical point. I want my students to learn Newton&#39;s theory in October and know it well so that when they hear that black holes attract massless photons in April, they say &quot;But wait!&quot;. These are the most beautiful moments in teaching physics, when students recognize exactly what is wrong about these old theories and speak out. That is how science is done in real life. They need to learn to question accepted scientific theories based on contrary evidence. <br>You make an analogy to history-- but history is the same way. How can a student possibly understand the civil rights movement of the 20th century without the context of the slave trade in the 17th and 18th centuries and the Civil War in the 19th?<br><br>Lastly, from a more practical perspective, I understand the desire for students to know &quot;how it really is&quot;, but for 98% of the population, the approximations of Newton and Galileo are still incredibly useful for describing force and motion on a macroscopic, everyday life scale, and far easier to teach and learn, both conceptually and mathematically. As long as they are made to understand that these are only approximations, we owe it to students to continue to teach them in great detail. No physics teacher worth his/her salt would earnestly tell students that<br> Newton&#39;s ideas are the most modern picture of gravity, or teach galilean kinematics without emphasizing that things get substantially more complicated when the earth&#39;s curvature is introduced. To oversimplify by saying that I am &quot;lying&quot; to my students by making them learn a theory that is no longer considered the best model is a bit insulting to me and to good physics teachers everywhere. And the implication that the president or secretary of education would have the ability to rectify this perceived problem just by introducing curriculum changes from the outside is very misguided. <br><br>I would really like to hear your thoughts.", "comment_date": "2016-06-09T16:14:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "HooKares?", "comment_text": "Jesus, physics in my high school wasn&#39;t even offered.

I live in N.Y. and as such I took a regents exam. Now from what I can remember there wasn&#39;t a HUGE amount of material from post-classical physics on that exam, but there was some.

I certainly agree that there could be more of those types of things in a high school education but at the same time you cannot discount the sheer utility of all the classical physics.

Also you have to consider the fact that many people do not learn best when 2 or 3 years worth of mathematics and knowledge is crammed into maybe a years worth of education and in a simple and philosophical sense, the point of life and education is not really to shove as much information into students as humanly possibly as quickly as possible.

Realistically, anyone could somewhat easily understand any concept in physics. String Theory for example, is not hard to understand. What makes physics a difficult subject is understand the applications of fundamental concepts and the mathematics they entail. For instance, anyone could describe what would happen if you released a yo-yo from rest, but understanding the forces and torques that may act on it and being to understand the math involved in such is more challenging. Also, the whole idea of formulas is overly contrived when first taught in high school, for example. We learn about Newton&#39;s Second Law, and assume that a scientist calculates force by simply multiplying mass and acceleration. When in reality, most people are unaware as to how Newton even came up with the formula (by realizing velocity as a derivative of time could be expressed as acceleration, and also leading him to write F=dP/dt, given P is translational momentum) Not only this, but for example what this formula have lead us to create, such as the equation which we can use to describe harmonic oscillators (x&#39;&#39;+(b/m)x&#39;+(k/m)x=0, [I substituted for gamma and omega]). And this is just kinematics. There is so much to Physics that it is truly astounding to try and comprehend. That&#39;s also why most people who believe they know physics really know almost nothing about it. Understanding concepts isn&#39;t understanding physics. Knowing how they apply and what they entail and being able to work with them from a mathematical standpoint is. That&#39;s really why it&#39;s not possible to learn any meaningful physics until college, when you can do actual research and when you have to do actual situation based problem solving and develop unique insight for each problem. It&#39;s not something you can just read about or watch videos for: you have to actually practice it.", "comment_date": "2016-02-05T11:10:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "nathan mulvaney", "comment_text": "Most of this as well as calculus is taught in Ireland (ages 16-18)", "comment_date": "2016-02-02T00:18:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DawnOfTheDead991", "comment_text": "Science and Physics is too white for Barrack.

How do we make physics &quot;awesome&quot; so we can educate the future Sagans, Feynmanns and Tysons? Do what got THEM into physics. First, be born a genius. Feynmann went to PUBLIC grade school and high school! He needed no one but some encouraging teachers. Why isn&#39;t that good enough now? What has changed?<br><br>For your edification, here are the opening paragraphs of the report &quot;A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform&quot;, by The National Commission on Excellence in Education, April 1983 (over THIRTY years ago):<br><br>Our Nation is at risk. Our once unchallenged preeminence in commerce, industry, science, and technological innovation is being overtaken by competitors throughout the world. This report is concerned with only one of the many causes and dimensions of the problem, but it is the one that undergirds American prosperity, security, and civility. We report to the American people that while we can take justifiable pride in what our schools and colleges have historically accomplished and contributed to the United States and the well-being of its people, the educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a Nation and a people. What was unimaginable a generation ago has begun to occur--others are matching and surpassing our educational attainments.<br><br><b>**If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war. As it stands, we have allowed this to happen to ourselves.**</b> We have even squandered the gains in student achievement made in the wake of the Sputnik challenge. Moreover, we have dismantled essential support systems which helped make those gains possible. <b>**We have, in effect, been committing an act of unthinking, unilateral educational disarmament.**</b><br><br>Our society and its educational institutions seem to have lost sight of the basic purposes of schooling, and of the high expectations and disciplined effort needed to attain them. This report, the result of 18 months of study, seeks to generate reform of our educational system in fundamental ways and to renew the Nation&#39;s commitment to schools and colleges of high quality throughout the length and breadth of our land. That we have compromised this commitment is, upon reflection, hardly surprising, given the multitude of often conflicting demands we have placed on our Nation&#39;s schools and colleges. They are routinely called on to provide solutions to personal, social, and political problems that the home and other institutions either will not or cannot resolve. We must understand that these demands on our schools and colleges often exact an educational cost as well as a financial one.", "comment_date": "2015-07-17T03:46:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NJ Near", "comment_text": "I love your YouTube channel, but good grief.

What sucks about school is that they don&#39;t teach you all of this amazing stuff like Quantum Mechanics, but thank god that they show you how to write essays, not only in 6th grade, but also in 7th, 8th, and 9th. Literally all of my past English courses have taught me the same thing. I already know how to use proper grammar, but I guess I need to learn it again next year. Rather than take all of this English that I already know, teach me something I don&#39;t know, like <b>cough</b> Quantum Physics, String Theory <b>cough</b>.<br><br>Today in school, we are learning how to research the internet and books for an essay. Although I already learned how to cite, find important information, find reliable sources, etc, TWO years ago. So thank you school, for wasting one hour and thirty minutes on English skills myself, as well as most of my friends and pupils already know. Granted, there are some things I did learn this year like, how to write in MLA Format, which is nice to know, but I probably won&#39;t be needing that skill in the future.<br><br>Now I don&#39;t know what career I want. But the career I will want, will have absolutely nothing to do with sports or English, In my case, Gym and English Class. I do understand that Gym is to help students learn to live a well lifestyle, but making students that are uncomfortable with their physical activities and such. Making students learn proper grammar is necessary and should be learned. it should not however be repeated, year after year, even this year our English teacher taught us what a sentence is. Really? We&#39;ve learned about clauses and such, years before this. Overall, the career I want to have might relate to Science or Music or something computer related. I am not saying English is not important, just that they are not teaching the parts of English that ARE important. Instead of grammar and essays, maybe it would be nice to know if the student even will want to use these English skills in the future. After college, I most likely will never have to write an essay persuading a person why to find the character in the story guilty. No job that I have in mind will require that I do that, so why do it now? Just in case I change my mind? Sorry, but I doubt that I will, rather than go on to something much more interesting like this.<br><br>I would love to learn how to write LUA code, but I guess I&#39;ll have to learn that on my own time. And what is funny, is that if my career ends up around that skill, school work would have been a complete and utter waste of time. Other than helping me go to college, elementary - high school would have been nothing. If I go into video game programming or something that would require LUA, C++, or Html coding, that would help prove that school is wasting student&#39;s time. I have never learned to code in school, and it is such a shame, because I find it very fascinating.<br><br>One of the things I am grateful for school however, is for my advancement in mathematics, since I am one grade level ahead, and for teaching me my vast music skills. Without school, I would have not learned I can play five instruments, or can solve Quadratic Functions and stuff like that a year ahead of everyone else. That is the good that school has brought upon me. Unfortunately, it is very hard to learn Physics and LUA coding without someone like a teacher, to TEACH. Maybe school should focusing on basic things everyone should know, and focus more on things like student&#39;s interests for career pursing, maybe a student wants to be a professional athlete, good for them. Let them study Health as well as Anatomy, to understand the body, and give them Sports electives, to practice. I am not saying they should not receive math classes, but only basic math knowledge classes, instead of putting a student who does not like math in Pre-Calculus, let them get another class that interests them, instead of having them fail the class they do not want to do.<br><br>Have Math, Science, English and History, but only basic knowledge.<br>A future Author does not need to know what the crusades were, and why were they important. They need to know how to write better, and how to write well to captivate emotion. Put them in English II, Expressive Writing, and some other class they have an interest in, like Choir. Myself, for example, would love to have classes such as:<br>LUA Coding/Programming, Physics, Marching Band, Orchestra, and Pre-Calculus.<br>I would rather not waste time in the Gym, learning how to play Badminton. Granted, I will be taking Pre-Calc next year in my Sophomore year, but I will not be taking LUA Coding, because that is not a class, and I will not be taking Physics, because Sophomore classes for science, do not include Physics. Although I would need to take classes to build up to Physics, I have no problem with that, rather than just take Earth Science in 6th, only to switch it up to Life Science in 7th, only to move to Physical Science in 8th, only to move to Biology in 9th, only to move to Chemistry in 10th. Although some of these are important, such as Life Science, I fail to see how I will use the study of environments and interactions, if I do become a physicist. I do not know what prior knowledge is necessary for Physics so please cut me some slack, thanks.\u00a0<br><br>Overall, school has become less of a &quot;Learn what you want to do, and become good at it, and help the world by using it&quot; and more of a &quot;Learn what we tell you to, and learn less of what you want, even though you will not use most of what we have taught you.&quot;<br>School is now more expensive, thus reducing the chance of more people having jobs, adding revenue to the economy, and instead, increase the number of people on welfare, having governments pay for them. Although some people, just don&#39;t like to learn, that doesn&#39;t mean that others don&#39;t want to. They just don&#39;t want to learn things that will be useless to them.<br><br>Earlier I said that we learned to write in MLA Format. This rant is not in that format, and it was still easy to read (hopefully). I would appreciate the lack of hate, because this is just a rant, a rant from a concerned 14 year old, worried and concerned about his future, the future of his friends, and worried about the future of this country.<br><br>Now how many high school kids have thoughts like this on their mind?

Anyway he and several of my math and science teachers growing up and worked at honywell during the Apollo missions were being designed and built like very very good gyroscopes that went into the orbital units as one project from what I remember that got me interested in the career I ended doing for the last twenty years along with a deep interest in science and technology.  But I live in a state where they have one of the highest concentration of technology companies along with graduation and in others states people fight about whether certain non sencical history and social science is ok to be in textbooks in public federally funded school so I would imagine physics is like magic books to alot of regressive parts of the country. But I also live in a state where we elect very polar opposite cadidates based on the fucked up jerry mandered districts just like all over the US of A.
