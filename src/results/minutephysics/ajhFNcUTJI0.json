Einstein&#39;s Unified Field Theory has been solved. I have written a book called the Master of Reality. In this book I confirm that Einstein&#39;s dream of uniting gravity to electromagnetism was the correct path to follow. The answer to the Theory of Everything was in plain view the entire time. The reason Einstein did not finish the Unified Field Theory was because he was born too soon. Einstein did not know about the quarks. He died ten years before the discovery of the quarks. The entire solution for the unification of gravity to electromagnetism is in my book. In this book there are many more astonishing breakthroughs as well. All that was needed to be done was to use a second rank tensor equation to solve the problem and it readily reveals that force of gravity comes about as a particle to space interaction and not a particle to particle interaction. The reason modern day physicists did not solve the problem is because quantum field theory was incorrect. They have been using the wrong model to solve the Unified Field Theory problem.\u00a0<br>For more detailed information see my website at: <a href=\"http://www.super-relativity.com/\">www.super-relativity.com</a>", "comment_date": "2021-05-26T16:54:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elvis Sibilia", "comment_text": "Nice video.

So any switcheroo we do has to keep light moving at the same speed...&quot;<br><br>No physicist has validly shown, both before and after Einstein was born, that the speed of light\u00a0is constant. For instance,\u00a0according to\u00a0Maxwell&#39;s 19th century electromagnetic\u00a0theory,\u00a0the speed of light (relative to the observer) varies with the speed of the observer:<br><br><a href=\"http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Chasing.pdf\">http://www.pitt.edu/~jdnorton/papers/Chasing.pdf</a>\u00a0<br>\u00a0John Norton: &quot;That [Maxwell&#39;s] theory allows light to slow and be frozen in the frame of reference of a sufficiently rapidly moving observer.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"http://culturesciencesphysique.ens-lyon.fr/XML/db/csphysique/metadata/LOM_CSP_relat.xml\">http://culturesciencesphysique.ens-lyon.fr/XML/db/csphysique/metadata/LOM_CSP_relat.xml</a>\u00a0<br>\u00a0Gabrielle Bonnet, \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon: &quot;Les \u00e9quations de Maxwell font en particulier intervenir une constante, c, qui est la vitesse de la lumi\u00e8re dans le vide.

But Newton&#39;s theory had got rid of the idea of absolute rest, so if light was supposed to travel at a fixed speed, one would have to say what that fixed speed was to be measured relative to. It was therefore suggested that there was a substance called the &quot;ether&quot; that was present everywhere, even in &quot;empty&quot; space. Light waves should travel through the ether as sound waves travel through air, and their speed should therefore be relative to the ether. Different observers, moving relative to the ether, would see light coming toward them at different speeds, but light&#39;s speed relative to the ether would remain fixed.&quot;<br><br>Also, in 1887 (prior to FitzGerald and Lorenz advancing the ad hoc length contraction hypothesis) the Michelson-Morley experiment unequivocally confirmed the variable speed of light predicted by Newton&#39;s emission theory of light and refuted the constant (independent of the speed of the source) speed of light predicted by the ether theory:<br><br><a href=\"http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/kursarchiv/SS07/Norton.pdf\">http://www.philoscience.unibe.ch/documents/kursarchiv/SS07/Norton.pdf</a>\u00a0<br>\u00a0John Norton: &quot;These efforts were long misled by an exaggeration of the importance of one experiment, the Michelson-Morley experiment, even though Einstein later had trouble recalling if he even knew of the experiment prior to his 1905 paper. This one experiment, in isolation, has little force. Its null result happened to be fully compatible with Newton&#39;s own emission theory of light. Located in the context of late 19th century electrodynamics when ether-based, wave theories of light predominated, however, it presented a serious problem that exercised the greatest theoretician of the day.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1743/2/Norton.pdf\">http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1743/2/Norton.pdf</a>\u00a0<br>\u00a0John Norton: &quot;In addition to his work as editor of the Einstein papers in finding source material, Stachel assembled the many small clues that reveal Einstein&#39;s serious consideration of an emission theory of light; and he gave us the crucial insight that Einstein regarded the Michelson-Morley experiment as evidence for the principle of relativity, whereas later writers almost universally use it as support for the light postulate of special relativity. Even today, this point needs emphasis. The Michelson-Morley experiment is fully compatible with an emission theory of light that CONTRADICTS THE LIGHT POSTULATE.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=JokgnS1JtmMC\">http://books.google.com/books?id=JokgnS1JtmMC</a>\u00a0<br>\u00a0Relativity and Its Roots, Banesh Hoffmann, p.92: &quot;There are various remarks to be made about this second principle. For instance, if it is so obvious, how could it turn out to be part of a revolution - especially when the first principle is also a natural one? Moreover, if light consists of particles, as Einstein had suggested in his paper submitted just thirteen weeks before this one, the second principle seems absurd: A stone thrown from a speeding train can do far more damage than one thrown from a train at rest; the speed of the particle is not independent of the motion of the object emitting it. And if we take light to consist of particles and assume that these particles obey Newton&#39;s laws, they will conform to Newtonian relativity and thus automatically account for the null result of the Michelson-Morley experiment without recourse to contracting lengths, local time, or Lorentz transformations. Yet, as we have seen, Einstein resisted the temptation to account for the null result in terms of particles of light and simple, familiar Newtonian ideas, and introduced as his second postulate something that was more or less obvious when thought of in terms of waves in an ether. If it was so obvious, though, why did he need to state it as a principle? Because, having taken from the idea of light waves in the ether the one aspect that he needed, he declared early in his paper, to quote his own words, that &quot;the introduction of a &#39;luminiferous ether&#39; will prove to be superfluous.&quot;", "comment_date": "2014-11-30T16:44:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pradeep", "comment_text": "please make a video on interstellar..
