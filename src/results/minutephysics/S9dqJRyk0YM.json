First off, there&#39;s more to a color than its hue; there&#39;s also the value (light or dark) and saturation (bright or dull). Pink is simply a light red.

It&#39;s a straight line running from short wavelengths to long ones (the term waveLENGTHs should be a clue), with visible light somewhere in the middle. The idea that you can circle back around from high wavelengths to low ones and that there&#39;s a &quot;gap&quot; between them is just nonsense. It&#39;s not a clock face. The color wheel is an artistic concept, not a scientific one, and on the color wheel, RED is across from green (not just pink); that&#39;s why red and green are considered complementary colors.<br><br><br>Thirdly, it <b>is</b> true that taking green light away from white leaves magenta, which could described as a sort of pink. But that doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s no such thing as pink light. If anything, it shows the opposite, because you can create magenta light by mixing blue and red light.

But if it doesn&#39;t loop around then why does color theory work? If it doesn&#39;t, then why does blue shift into purple before ending, purple having some red in it? And how can we say pink doesnt exist, when it obviously does exist. Maybe not as pure light or something, but as a color I&#39;m seeing on my screen right now, it has a wavelength that must fit in the spectrum.

This is simply because rose is the mixture of red and magenta would be rose, and red and magenta don&#39;t meet on the wavelength, I think that maybe if we could see all types of light, rose wouldn&#39;t be a color.<br>Now finally moving on to pink: Pink is a very relative color, it&#39;s more of a shade than one specific light value.

Jason Wentworth", "comment_text": "All of this should, I think, be prefaced with &quot;As <b>our</b> eyes work, we see these various colors.&quot; In other words, the specific photo-chemical reactions in our eyes&#39; retinal rods and cones, along with how our brains process their inputs, determines what we call colors, and:<br><br>Even the term &quot;visible wavelengths&quot; (of light) is purely human-specific, as other creatures on Earth, such as birds, can see into the wavelength range that we call ultraviolet (and some animals may see in at least some of the wavelengths that we call infrared--pit vipers certainly sense infrared in order to locate warm prey, although their pits don&#39;t form images as our eyes do). People who have had their eyes&#39; lenses surgically removed due to cataracts (especially in earlier years, before implantable plastic replacement lenses were available; such patients used strong eyeglasses to restore their vision back then) can see some way into the ultraviolet and infrared ranges. Also:<br><br>During World War II, such people--who were usually elderly--were recruited by the American OSS (the predecessor to the CIA) because they could see the ultraviolet-only beacon lights that our spies used for coastal extraction pickups. I also knew of an older astronomical spectroscope technician who, after cataract surgery, was better at calibrating spectroscopes, because he could see &quot;beyond both ends of the visible rainbow&quot; that spectroscopes&#39; prisms (or diffraction gratings; these are more popular today) produce from white light, seeing into both the infrared and ultraviolet ranges, which other people can&#39;t see. In addition:<br><br>Intelligent beings living on planets orbiting other stars likely define &quot;visible wavelengths&quot; between different lower and upper wavelength limits than we do, especially if their worlds&#39; sun(s) (some planets are in double-star and multiple-star systems) are significantly brighter or dimmer than our Class G Sun, and/or if their planets&#39; atmospheres preferentially scatter, and are transparent to, different &quot;sets&quot; of light wavelengths than those that our atmosphere scatters and lets pass unhindered. As well:<br><br>Arthur C. Clarke pointed out (in both his non-fictional [&quot;Profiles of the Future&quot;] and fictional [&quot;The Fountains of Paradise&quot;] books) that even creatures living on planets orbiting dim red dwarf stars (whose light is mostly in the infrared; that&#39;s why Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf that is the nearest star besides our Sun, is invisible to the naked eye despite its closeness) would see colors, because their infrared-tuned eyes (and &quot;matching&quot; brains) would generate them. The colors that they would see would probably look very different to us if we could, somehow, &quot;see through their eyes&quot;; our eyes would see--if we could visit their planets (which may become possible someday)--only the dim, red visible light emitted by their home stars, which would make for gloomy landscapes and dark blue skies even at noon. Plus:<br><br>Red dwarf stars--at least the younger, flare-prone ones--are not now considered to be likely abodes of life because their planets have to orbit very close--just 3 - 7 million miles or so from them--in order to be as warm as our Earth is with our brighter but more distant Sun. This extreme proximity would cause those planets&#39; rotations to quickly become tidally-locked as our Moon&#39;s is, and because many red dwarfs are flare stars, the radiation from frequent flare events could erode such nearby planets&#39; atmospheres (because being &quot;slow spinners,&quot; they&#39;d have weak or nonexistent magnetic fields to protect their surfaces and atmospheres) and make life, as least as we know it, impossible due to the gouts of intense radiation. But red dwarf stars shine steadily not for billions, but for hundreds of billions to <b>trillions</b> of years, so once they &quot;settled down&quot; from their flare-prone, &quot;youthful whipper-snapper&quot; days, more distantly-orbiting planets that might have migrated inward (or nearby planets that retained their rapid rotations and magnetic field &quot;shields&quot;--and thus also their atmospheres--due to having moons [and/or by having spin axes tilted at large angles to their orbit planes]) might be worlds where life, even intelligent life, could be found.", "comment_date": "2018-01-26T13:01:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Igor Gerlovin", "comment_text": "What we call &quot;color&quot; depends on both 1) the wavelength or any mix/ratio thereof, and 2) on the way receptors in our eyes perceive those wavelengths.", "comment_date": "2018-01-26T05:29:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wild Animals", "comment_text": "YO I FOUND A RARE PINK SHEEP!!!", "comment_date": "2018-01-25T23:19:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "epicSonicFan2020 Am", "comment_text": "that&#39;s a pink sheep=Pink Sheep", "comment_date": "2018-01-24T15:23:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "chad reacts", "comment_text": "What if you only drink coffee", "comment_date": "2018-01-23T19:00:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Victor Vasconcelos", "comment_text": "My teory PINK = RED + WHITE TONALITY", "comment_date": "2018-01-22T13:06:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rosie Fay", "comment_text": "Wait -- so for the same reason white light doesn&#39;t exist either?

So are you saying that some color that has not been clearly defined by you cannot be represented by a single wavelength value of light in the visible spectrum (such as x hertz)? I don&#39;t know enough about our brains to be able to say whether our brains recognize all of that smooth variability in wavelengths, if they recognize certain set changes in wavelength, or if they just say something is either in the red range, and we resultantly see red, blue range or green range and all the different colors that we see are just the result of different mixings of those 3, but that isn&#39;t really truly the heart of the issue. what you are essentially saying is that &quot;There exists no x such that x = &#39;pink&#39; in the set of all wavelengths,&quot; and I&#39;m not entirely convinced because the initial proposal isn&#39;t well defined.

First, FACT: the electromagnetic spectrum is a continuous measure of wavelengths from larger to smaller. Around 10^-6 to 10^-7 meters is visible light, and as we get smaller and smaller we get infrared, then microwaves, then radio waves. If we go larger get have ultraviolet then X-rays then Gamma rays. This measure of size in a continuum in one direction get smaller and in the other getting larger get further and further apart. To suggest they meet in some sort of wheel would mean that infinitely small would EQUAL (or meet) the infinitely big!!! Which is absurd in itself. <br><br>It would also mean that radio waves or gamma waves DO NOT (CAN NOT) EXIST as there is nowhere on this proposed wheel for them to exist! Because the author is talking about color he mentions (erroneously slips in) this IMPOSSIBLE wheel as we know that in pigment colors we often use a color wheel to represent the gradation of colors. <br><br>However, he never mentions that there are two types of light and ways of deriving color WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT LIGHT\u2014pigments &amp; pigment mixtures and pure (single spectrum) light &amp; light mixtures. ONLY PIGMENT LIGHT HAS A COLOR WHEEL! Spectral light has a color BAND. <br><br>However, in a pigment color wheel we move from green to blue to purple to red to yellow and back to green, with purple being the bridge between the two &quot;ends&quot; of the color spectrum as it appears with a prism diffraction. Also, if you look at a light spectrum the red end and the blue/violet end has NO &#39;purplish&#39; bridge back to red so there is no way they can be visually joined. <br><br>Finally, there are numerous misidentification of terms, playing loose with plural and singular which may seem to matter but in fact scientifically make the author&#39;s statements BS. And there is failure to identify terms (i.e., the two types of color) which is just plain misleading, etc. etc. Also the video confused a &quot;pure&quot; single spectrum color (i.e. has one distinct wavelength) with most colors we see that are actually mixtures of multiple colors (and wavelengths) that our brains fuse\u2014like &quot;pink.&quot;. And not even mentioned is that fact that we &quot;see&quot; color in our brains, which can change based on the environment.
