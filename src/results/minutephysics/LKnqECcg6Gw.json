Thus red and green do not make yellow, but make brown instead.<br><br>The true colors are magenta, canary yellow and cyan. That is why you can never make true green from blue and yellow. True green can only be made from cyan and canary yellow. True purple (violet) can only be made from blending cyan and magenta. From there, mixing mixed colors is both subtractive and muddying.<br><br>Really, how could you expect to make a bright color like yellow from two dark colors like red and green? That makes no sense.

This is because the max. number 1 byte (or 8 bits) can store is 255 (because 2 to the power of 8 - 1 is 255)<br>2) Many Image formats don&#39;t square root it anymore. If you have a camera, a RAW image wont either.<br>3) Square rooting wont have much of an impact on file size. People instead used 8-bit-color, which combines the R, G and B channels into one byte. This cannot be read as a normal number (For example, increasing the amount of Red in a pixel in 8-bit color will not raise it by one, look it up). using a square root would probably make it a float (= a number with decimal places: 0.1, 0.3123213, while numbers like 5 can be stored it is a waste due to the way they work, again, look it up, too much to explain)<br>4) Many sensors detect 30-bit-colour (10 bits for each channel, R, G and B). They normally downsize this to 24-bit-colour if the camera tells it to.<br><br>TL;DR, square rooting does not help file size, as storing their float value would use more space then just storing 8-bit-colour or 24-bit-colour.", "comment_date": "2018-04-26T21:56:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hyatt Parkinson", "comment_text": "My sister works for Valspar Paint and creates her CH (Color Harmony) thoroughly through it.

We can see this from a simple geometric parallel: Taking the sum of squares is the same as what is being done in pythagoras theorem, where the first parts are the the shorter sides and the second is the longer side. We then have from the triangle inequality that the longest side in the triangle is upper bounded by the sum of the other sides, as the distance from a point in carthesian coordinates cannot be further than first going to some other point and then back to it (the shortest path is always the strait line).<br><br>This means that we should actually see the colors turn darker when such a &quot;fix&quot; is applied. The problem is more that just averaging the RGB values actually does this effectively to the brighness (as the brighness scale is seperate for each of the colors), and we instead need to perform the inverse operation, though this get more complicated if we did not start out with a pure Red/Green/Blue colors.<br><br>The problem is somewhat more complex, and has to do with the difference in type of coordinate system, when describing colors in terms of hue, intensity (brightness), and saturation. The transformations between these coordinate systems are non-linear, which means that we cannot perform an average with respect to hue and bightness in the RGB color scheme and expect to get the results we would have got if we had applied them in a coordinate system describing what we actually want.<br>What happens is somewhat similar to what would happen if you drew a strait line between 2 points on a sphere, and took the middle point. That point would be inside the sphere, and if we let brightness be described the distance from the centrum, we would then have that the new point (a mix between the 2 other color points) would be darker. The actual geometry of the correct color cooridinate system is slightly different, and we actually get such an effect both for brighness and saturation (this is why the yellow between the red and green shown in the video is somewhat more grey than it should be).<br><br>The normal solution is to change to a different color coordinate system before doing any digital color blending, and then change back to RGB before saving/sending it to the screen (since screens AND eyes works based on a RGB system).", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T22:35:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jinxmaster1", "comment_text": "wat u on about m8, the blur effect on images in word are correct ffs.", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T20:22:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahsan Khan", "comment_text": "what the fuck?", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T15:58:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RedsBoneStuff", "comment_text": "Audible, the leading provider of YouTube sponsorship!", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T15:47:11Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Jarta", "comment_text": "I despise the low frequency hum", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T14:33:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KevTFIFA", "comment_text": "So how do I fix his in photoshop?", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T14:17:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Castor Bone", "comment_text": "<del>immediately goes to fix this in photoshop settings.</del>", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T08:27:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hughes Nwachukwu", "comment_text": "i see.. so basically average square root lower than square root average = no good photoshop", "comment_date": "2017-03-19T07:17:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eden", "comment_text": "look at the total time ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "comment_date": "2017-03-18T23:45:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Frank Harr", "comment_text": "It&#39;s a good thing I don&#39;t like blurs.", "comment_date": "2017-03-18T22:14:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Some may call this junk me I call them treasure", "comment_text": "Based on your examples, no it can&#39;t if you did do the real correct way your computer will slow down.

A CCD counts the number of photons that hit a sensor for as long as it&#39;s exposed. A 14 bit camera ranges from 0 to 16383, not 0-1. He&#39;s confusing the gamma curve with brighness levels (which the gamma curve adjusts.)<br><br>Second, cameras do not capture images; they capture light intensity data. Camera sensors most specifically ARE linear (Gamma 1). \u00a0You&#39;ll notice he talks about setting a gamma curve and &quot;evening out the data&quot; to use less in the brighter range to mimic vision.\u00a0<br><br>Third, \u00a0he says that &quot;dark colors&quot; are &quot;sampled&quot; with more data points and bright with less. This is exactly the opposite of what a CCD does. It&#39;s inherent in the linear nature of binary data capture. What the gamma curve does is <del>adjust</del> the linear &quot;curve&quot; from the CCD into a responsive curve more like the human eye.<br><br>In fact, MORE data is captured in the brightest ranges and significantly less in the darker. This is a conundrum for photographers, who have to &quot;ETR&quot; Expose to the Right in order to open up the blacks, and is precisely WHY the gamma adjustment has to be made.<br><br><br>Forth: \u00a0then he attributes the dark lines when blurring to &quot;the camera&#39;s square rooting&quot; which he claims is done to &quot;save space.&quot; \u00a0(Over what? The 0 to 1 he claims is used?)<br><br>Nonsense. Square roots would have to be real numbers, instead of integers, and would therefore be at least TWICE the size as integer representation. Integers are used in the files.<br><br>But more to the point, after saying the problem comes from the camera (for all the wrong reasons) we learn that... you get the same effect with NO CAMERA AT ALL involved. His whole &quot;cameras cause it because they are saving file space by square-rooting&quot; simply falls flat on its face. If you open Photoshop and create a red square and a green square overlapping, you&#39;ll see the same thing. No square rooting; no camera involved. So his whole the-camera-is-at-fault premise is pure bunk.<br><br>The issue is that once the linear gamma (gamma 1) of RGB is converted to human vision equivalence (something less than one), blending using those darker values yields...ummm... darker values. Wow! Who&#39;d have thought?\u00a0<br><br>RGB is a transmissive/additive light definition. Paint/ink/photos are reflective and subtractive. Look, take a tube of red paint, and mix it with green paint. Guess what? You don&#39;t get yellow, you get BROWN. \u00a0Just like he&#39;s complaining about.<br><br>RGB (transmissive/additive light) blending is best done in a linear gamma space, and that&#39;s what he&#39;s advocating for so poorly. (LightRoom does this behind the scenes.) But subtractive blending is done in a non-linear space.<br><br>So why does Photoshop do it that way by default? Because Photoshop is aimed at making (wait for it...) <del>photos</del> which are reflective/subtractive mixtures of ink on paper. You know: <del>paint!</del><br><br>What&#39;s actually happening in Photoshop is that the adjacent colors are mixed at their same luminosity, just as if you were mixing the two shades of red and green paint. You&#39;d get a brownish, and darker tone. They do that because it&#39;s PHOTOshop, and photos are made by mixing inks together.<br><br>Photoshop is not &quot;doing it wrong&quot; - it&#39;s doing it RIGHT!\u00a0<br><br>And, as he graciously points out, you can force Photoshop \u00a0to mix with linear gamma, if you&#39;re so inclined... but tell me the next time you see red and green paint together with a nice yellow line between them !<br><br>Finally, in case you feel the need to try the mix with linear gamma in Photoshop: linear gamma doesn&#39;t work well with sRGB, which is by definition an 8-bit file, as it will likely introduce banding, so using the &quot;mix at gamma 1&quot; in Photoshop should only be used on 16-bit images.<br><br>Frankly, this is all very old \u00a0news.

Our televisions were designed to make up for what they lack in producing color and brightness. Yes there is software solutions to correct this messed up low color and brightness curve that was shown in this video.  But our LCD&#39;s end up getting signals of color which causes grey to be 25 percent rather than its true value that should be 50 percent (mix of half black half white).  But these software fixes just will not fix how our LCD screens tend to show color. LCD&#39;s though have become more advance and capable in getting close to showing true colors, but until the day we have televisions that can broadcast true light and color, the LCD&#39;s themselves will try to compensate for the lack of brightness and color that they cannot omit by putting a higher brightness curve to the image being presented to make it as close as possible to the actual image, making the color grey be close to 50 percent rather than the weird off number of 25 percent. But still LCD&#39;s do this poorly. There is so much technical aspects involved with color in video and imaging when being sent to an LCD because from the moment a video is recorded, being put on a computer, edited, color corrected, then broadcasted to the LCD, the color has probably went through so many variations and it is hard to keep it consistent. Thats why tvs and computers and some phones have color profile settings to adjust how exactly the screen will present color.

That may be why even knowledgeable programmers are reluctant to do it, let alone enable it by default. It <b>should</b> be done when <b>reading</b> the image file, then all the mixing and blending should be done linearly, and then the reverse gamma correction should be applied to the result. Doing gamma correction during color blending would also make the program run slower -- color blending is often done on the GPU these days, and the hardware color blender even in modern GPUs is &quot;fixed-function&quot;, i.e. it isn&#39;t freely programmable, it&#39;s only somewhat parameterizable, and it can only do linear blending (see\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/html/glBlendFunc.xhtml\">https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/html/glBlendFunc.xhtml</a>). You can do arbitrary non-linear blending in a pixel shader (a small user program that is run by the GPU in parallel for each pixel of the frame to compute its color), but that&#39;s still slower than the fixed-function blender, and it may require a large refactoring of your rendering pipeline code, so you may not be able to do that easily.<br><br>As mentioned, the right way to solve this problem is to apply ^(1/Gamma) to all pixel values of an input image as you&#39;re reading it, since common image formats like JPEG have already been gamma-corrected during creation, i.e. their pixel values correspond to (physical light intensity of the pixel)^Gamma. Then you would do all the color mixing and blending linearly, and then apply ^Gamma once to the final result pixel right before sending it to the display hardware -- which internally computes ^(1/Gamma) to get the actual physical brightness of the pixel on the display (this was due to physical properties of the screen on CRTs, and modern LCDs emulate it for backwards compatibility).<br><br>This is all supported in hardware these days: the sRGB texture format (since OpenGL 2.1) takes care of the gamma correction when reading images -- i.e. it computes texture value = (image pixel value)^(1/Gamma) when reading an image into a texture. Then you can blend multiple texture values linearly, i.e. just add/average them to obtain the result pixel which you write into the framebuffer. After that,\u00a0the\u00a0sRGB framebuffer format (GL_FRAMEBUFFER_SRGB, sine OpenGL 3) takes care of computing output pixel value = (framebuffer pixel value)^Gamma, which is sent to the display. I don&#39;t know which part of that pipeline common tools like Photoshop or GIMP get wrong (I&#39;m not really an expert on this stuff either), but the solution proposed here (&quot;Blend RGB colors using Gamma&quot; setting in Photoshop) is not optimal.", "comment_date": "2015-03-22T13:59:21Z", "likes_count": 10}, {"comment_by": "Fai", "comment_text": "oh fuck, i actually learn that from collage.......<br>\u00a0interesting.", "comment_date": "2015-03-22T13:54:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "electronicsNmore", "comment_text": "Great video!", "comment_date": "2015-03-22T13:31:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "dammit dan", "comment_text": "Interesting", "comment_date": "2015-03-22T13:14:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eleazar Pyscher", "comment_text": "Like the &quot;no-hands&quot; presentation.", "comment_date": "2015-03-22T12:36:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Makoy Gonz", "comment_text": "woooooooooowww!!!!! nice Henry!!", "comment_date": "2015-03-22T11:42:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CloudCuckooCountry", "comment_text": "I care about this stuff once I get software that is not-shit enough not to cause hair-pulling levels of colour-banding.
