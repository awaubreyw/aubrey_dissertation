Quality &gt; quantity.<br><br>Anyway, to expand this video&#39;s coverage, one-way mirrors (or two-mirrors) have partially-reflective compound such as a thin layer of nearly-transparent material such as aluminium (in contrast to tin chloride and silver which is used in ordinary mirrors). Ordinary mirrors are coated with a paint at the last layer to prevent oxidation. Because the reflective layer is thinner in one-way mirrors, some of the light can pass through the material.", "comment_date": "2016-06-17T10:04:37Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "portfolio collection", "comment_text": "people who got 10 seconds to learn some science facts should just watch nicki minaj videos.<br>and seriously MinutePhysics? slow down buddy you aint techquickie", "comment_date": "2016-06-09T10:10:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pezpeculiar", "comment_text": "Bitch slow the fuck down", "comment_date": "2016-06-09T07:28:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "squidsrhot", "comment_text": "wasnt even 10 seconds", "comment_date": "2016-06-08T03:25:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lexi Barclay", "comment_text": "Holy shit", "comment_date": "2016-06-03T11:28:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kauiezlan", "comment_text": "this is like hearing explanations from my teacher lmao", "comment_date": "2016-06-02T14:43:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "legnd300", "comment_text": "At 0.5 speed, he sounds soooooo high on drugs lmaooo", "comment_date": "2016-06-02T06:15:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Emerpapi", "comment_text": "Moee than ten", "comment_date": "2016-06-01T03:11:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LJR", "comment_text": "I learned something in 10 seconds, which confused me my whole life.", "comment_date": "2016-05-31T05:19:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cymraeg_ Gaming", "comment_text": "I understood about 2.51462837097381928102897462578198299179209729377% of that. :/", "comment_date": "2016-05-26T20:39:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Smart Guy", "comment_text": "In 10 seconds, I learned what had confused me for 5 years.", "comment_date": "2016-05-25T03:48:20Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Robofrosty", "comment_text": "Change the speed to 2, thank me later.", "comment_date": "2016-05-22T21:30:07Z", "likes_count": 25}, {"comment_by": "Xx1M L3G1TxX 77", "comment_text": "Jesus my video was loading longer than the actual video", "comment_date": "2016-05-17T11:55:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Peng", "comment_text": "lol grade 10 science got you covered now", "comment_date": "2016-05-06T02:17:10Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Jerr y", "comment_text": "I look forward to seeing 10 second in quantum mechanics explain", "comment_date": "2016-04-29T09:02:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mary Cameron", "comment_text": "what just happened?", "comment_date": "2016-04-24T16:59:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tarnished", "comment_text": "the titled changes", "comment_date": "2016-04-23T19:04:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicole Song", "comment_text": "So those one-way mirror public toilets - they&#39;re probably closed at night, aren&#39;t they?", "comment_date": "2016-04-18T08:55:44Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Smittel", "comment_text": "When the timer reached 10 seconds, you kept on talking for around 0.7 seconds...", "comment_date": "2016-04-17T09:27:15Z", "likes_count": 413}, {"comment_by": "Fire Dragon0515", "comment_text": "What about in cars where it is brighter outside but still is mostly see-through", "comment_date": "2016-04-14T21:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ant", "comment_text": "Too slow man, I had to speed it up on 2x.", "comment_date": "2016-04-02T09:13:58Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "rodrick160", "comment_text": "That was twelve seconds man your wasting my life", "comment_date": "2016-04-01T05:34:58Z", "likes_count": 2493}, {"comment_by": "Unbearable Pain", "comment_text": "There&#39;s also special tints that help dramaticize this effect.", "comment_date": "2016-03-30T00:06:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soodless", "comment_text": "Wut did he say\ud83d\ude33", "comment_date": "2016-03-24T17:10:28Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Justair", "comment_text": "have to watch this 3 times.

Unfortunately, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t say the same about these 10-second videos.<br><br>Although I do enjoy learning new stuff related to physics and scientific branches related to it, I am not a physicist myself so my knowledge about the subject is rather limited. That is why I loved your &quot;long&quot; videos, because they provided enough information to understand the subject you&#39;re discussing. Although that is not the case with these short videos, it can be argued that they have an educational role - perhaps they are supposed to make us curious and force us to do some research on our own in order to acquire new knowledge. However, the problem about doing the research is that it certainly takes more time and we would probably have to go through quite a bit of the information we do not really care about in order to find the explanation for the subject you have started. I think you should consider that probably the majority of your followers are not physicists and do not care really about about in-depth reading - if we did, we would study physics at university or at least buy a physics coursebook. Most of us who watch these videos just enjoy learning that one tiny bit of information we&#39;re probably never even going to need throughout our lives.<br><br>As far as we, your audience, are considered, perhaps we tend to forget that the purpose of your existence is not to make videos for us and do what we want you to do. In fact, it&#39;s the other way around - this is your channel and you should be making whatever kind of videos makes you satisfied, and if we happen to like them, we should feel grateful. Therefore, you are absolutely free not to take into account anything I have written here and should proceed doing what makes you happy.<br><br>In case you actually read this, thank you for your time.
