The effect of time can be shown only through these status changes, and there is no pure time keeper in the world which does not need a physical process. Any physical clock records the number of cycles of a periodical process and use this number to indirectly calculate the elapsed time. The number of cycles is the product of time and frequency. In special relativity, when observed from a stationary frame, relativistic time of a moving frame does become shorter but the relativistic frequency of a clock on the moving frame becomes faster to make the product of relativistic time and relativistic frequency unchanged compared with that of the stationary clock. That is, clock time is absolute and independent of reference frames, and relativistic kinetic time dilation won&#39;t be found on any physical clock or any other physical process. Time dilation is just the property of the relativistic time, nothing to do with the physical clock. As we all use physical clocks to observe physical phenomena, clock time is the real physical time.

He has 3 red barrels tied to a dock 1 m apart, sticks YOU in the middle barrel, and simultaneously lets all 3 barrels loose.  At first, the barrels are carried along at the same velocity by the river&#39;s current.  The first barrel now goes over the edge of the falls and begins to accelerate TOWARD the distant MASS at bottom of falls.    YOU  observe Distance between  you in 2nd barrel and 1st barrel increase at an accelerating rate: REDSHIFT  After a short delay, YOU in 2nd barrel go over the edge and begin to accelerate toward the distant mass, but the DELAY in the start of your acceleration means you will never match the velocity of 1st barrel, so distance between 1st and 2nd barrel continues to increase as both barrels fall - and you continue to OBSERVE redshift ahead - - but no you are also accelerating away from 3rd barrel so you also see redshift behind.  Finally, after another short DELAY, 3rd barrel goes over the edge and begins to accelerate, but again, it will never match the velocity of 1st or 2nd barrel, and from amid the barrels you continue to OBSERVE redshift ahead AND redshift behind.<br><br><br>From your perspective amid the barrels, without an external perspective, you might even begin to believe that SPACE between the barrels expands - but from the monkey&#39;s external perspective, onlly DISTANCE between the barrels increases, and the measures of space we&#39;ve developed remain true.<br><br><br>The monkey can PROVE that observations of redshift occur among objects accelerating in THE SAME VECTOR provided the start of their accelerations is staggered by DELAY: at ANY waterfall on earth until either air friction or the rocks at the bottom of the falls yield TERMINAL VELOCITY.<br><br><br>Saint Einstein FAILED to consider the limitations of PERSPECTIVE when he endorsed the priest LeMaitre&#39;s single point expansion theory.<br><br><br>Sir Hubble tried to warn us that the observations of red shift DO NOT verify or prove an expansion of space, but the mathemagicians have continued to follow the proverbial wild goose ASSUMPTION made by LeMaitre and Einstein at the expense of TRUTH - <br><br><br><br>The monkey scratches his butt, sniffs his finger and falls over backward laughing at LeMaitre, Eistein and all the wannabe knowitalls since who have put their FAITH in an erroneous ASSUMPTION.<br><br><br>The monkey says inverse of shortest is longest, so inverse of Planck distance is LONGEST MEASURABLE DISTANCE - 1/10^-35m  -= 10^22 light years  .. he thinks this may be the ACTUAL radius of universe.  If the monkey is right then our probes only allow us awareness of 0.0000000000001% of the universe - even if we could probe every inch of our visible space.<br><br><br>The monkey tries to complete the priest&#39;s half-baked theory.<br><br><br>He thinks that far beyond the range of our probes may lie a very large MASS toward which all the galaxies of universe accelerate - and in that case, the redshifts we observed are EXPECTED.<br>He thinks at core of universe may exist and ONGOING matter/antimatter annihilation PROCESS - and that the INWARD forces of this process COMPACT matters and energies enveloped by the process to extreme density - - So dense that matter as we know it is transformed to protomatter held in a singular state by the INWARD forces of the annihilation PROCESS.
