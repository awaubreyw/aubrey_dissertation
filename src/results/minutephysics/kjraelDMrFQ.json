So, the pressure different between liquid and mist need to be high enough as a barrier in between, so it is not pure mist, but pure liquid but convert into mist outward, so the liquid goes down but the gas goes up, so liquid is need so it pushes upward the gas to outward? Or it can be pure gas, so there is no liquid and mist, just pure gas. So, why mist is there? Because there is visual so that is why there is a mist so you can see. So, it is about convert two different pressure base on your action so it converts into liquid from mist, so increasing the pressure so become liquid from mist. If you shake so the pressure change and also if you press the spray the pressure change within so come out in high pressure so become cold and with cold, is impact to cause dust to be push away. <br><br>Compare to compress air, so what is same and different? So, the air itself is compress within to fill the space, so high pressure within so outward there is high pressure, so within the compress air so the press will be reduce so air within compress is not same as before? For this one it is same as always? Since there are two different phase that create a pressure within so it holds it until liquid run out which gas run out, well, the mist, since the liquid is bottom of the mist, so the tube is at bottom which suck up the liquid or wherever the tube is to suck up?? So, it is at the top, then it sucks up the mist which create a vacuum outward so the mist raise as liquid decrease, so liquid is convert into mist so it bubbles up into mist. For air compress, so there is no bubble up, just outward gas that is all. The bubble is a sign of convert phase or creating a pressure system which within bubble is different from above. That the bubble within is something else. So, holding the pressure, then release the pressure. Also it releases the pressure within, to be accurate it is converting the pressure within which inside has two different phase.

It&#39;s true that more energy can cause a fluid to boil or lowering the pressure works as well. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really a good explanation though. Maybe something like this?<br>A drop in pressure occurs. This decreases the pressure/boiling point and the fluid boils. The most energetic molecules evaporate at a higher rate. Temperature is just the average kinetic energy. If we remove the higher speed molecules leaving the slower ones on average, the temperature drops. Now we have a cooling liquid and heat external to the can can flow to the cool can. The valve closes and pressure builds as external heat from the environment flows into the can. Eventually the vapor pressure is reached and boiling stops. Things are now the same temperature everywhere. Your can is &quot;recharged&quot;.<br>I wonder the differences between full and near empty cans...
