Also the London short of cash idea is also off the mark. In the 1960s Britain was booming economically and plans were drawn up to replace the bridge not primarily  because it was sinking but more because it simply wasn&#39;t considered wide enough to cope with the ever growing traffic of the latter twentieth century. Rather than demolish the bridge the London council hit on the plan to offer to sell to anyone willing to pay for it&#39;s deconstruction and removal. Over forty bids were received and all the bidders were acutely aware that they were not bidding for Tower Bridge [even though it is correct that many tourists do mistake Tower Bridge for London bridge] The bridge was deconstructed, shipped off and the new bridge built to replace it.

The president said that George bush the president before him was not patriotic, because we were 5 trillion in debt, this was after the two twin towers fell and we had to go to war, and now we are going to be $20 trillion in debt by the time\u00a0this\u00a0 president is out of office. And now Hillary Clinton\u00a0the liar and cheater, \u00a0the murder of four men in Benghazi because her and this president did not want to send them help, yes maybe it&#39;s time for a female president but not a murderer! And as usual the Clintons will be\u00a0getting away with yet another matter. I know you Democrats like to have Democrats in the White House because they are the ones that like to hand out money just to get reelected, I have in-laws that will vote for them just because they are Democrats. I&#39;m not a Democrat but I still voted for President Clinton because at the time he was the better candidate. This president has lied to his own black people that put him in office, there are more blacks out of work\u00a0 and more\u00a0on welfare and more people on food stamps, and now he wants to let another country of immigrants come through our borders. If we don&#39;t stop this president from giving more handouts just to have more voters in the Democrat column this country is gone, the America we know is slowly turning into Europe a welfare country, we need a Donald Trump a real outsider to go to Washington and try to fix what this black President has done to America. And if you Democrat lovers don&#39;t like what I&#39;m saying kiss my behind.
