in 300 years ago the Newtonian mechanics was born<br>during the modern industry germination times, basically the gravity, explosive<br>force or trajectory force was primarily studied. The industrial science<br>develops up today, as the kinetic foundation the Newtonian mechanics should be<br>developed followed by dynamic, have a complete theory system to face all<br>dynamical phenomenon (including personal force). Such as\uff1aelectromechanical dynamics, hot dynamics or<br>hydrodynamics and so on , it is the most important part in all personal living<br>environments. There will have some questions if they are interpreted by the<br>Newtonian mechanics. The most basic reason is that the Newtonian mechanics<br>takes the disposable use of force as the object of research but the modern<br>mechanics mostly needs to face the situation of the long-enduring use of force,<br>and photo-electrical and the Big Bang Theory", "comment_date": "2021-03-09T20:36:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abbers", "comment_text": "inb4 some trump supporter bursts in here babbling about how this is all a satanic communist teletubby conspiracy to steal our testicles.", "comment_date": "2021-03-09T19:45:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pasha Hart", "comment_text": "Yea just don&#39;t rely on them for power like you can with fossil fuels...... looking at you Texas and Communist Socialist California.......", "comment_date": "2021-03-09T19:34:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris van Gerve", "comment_text": "Please get your facts right.

Nuclear has 3 problems, plants are expensive to build(nuclear fuel is cheaper than gas per megawatt), the fear, and it&#39;s not quick to turn on or off so we need something else to act as a buffer for energy peaks and valleys, natural gas works well in this regard but I&#39;d be happy with anything that fits.

Wind mills simply cannot do the job of combating climate change and there&#39;s no theoretical way for them to EVER have that capability. Like AT ALL. ;) In a poetic finally, the final note of the video mentioning better storage methods is just wishful thinking, and little else. <br><br>This is in fact the total consensus of science that no one likes to talk about as we&#39;ve all been bamboozled by the renewable energy sales pitch deeply steeped in the naturalism fallacy. Renewable energy is really a quite terrible idea on it&#39;s own merits or lack thereof, but it&#39;s never examined in the popular press or even scientific literature. That&#39;s why there are exactly ZERO quality studies showing that large scale renewable energy for the entire world is even possible, much less practical. Really none at all and that&#39;s before tackling the larger more complex question of if it helps with climate change. Which is all a rather bewildering oversight considering how much this &#39;goal&#39; influences public policy. <br><br>The most commonly cited incorrect example is Mark Z. Jacobson&#39;s &#39;Solutions Project&#39;. It&#39;s been comically debunked many times most comprehensively here <a href=\"https://www.roadmaptonowhere.com/\">https://www.roadmaptonowhere.com</a>, but also in this more formal scientific form, which was the subject of hilarious nuisance lawsuit since Jacobson couldn&#39;t be bothered to defend his views with science. <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722\">https://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722</a><br><br>But really it&#39;s not a mystery once one understands how energy works. Wind and solar are fundamentally terrible energy sources while the other popular renewables are far too limited in scale; and all of them are deeply destructive to the environment as they use up far too much land and natural resources in their construction and operation. Both are unavoidable factors as they&#39;re so deeply inefficient. They will simply never work for general use, and the big goal of 100% renewable power is just flatly impossible. Proponents of the renewable dream don&#39;t even try to hide it, they just keep asking for more research and more study. Implying that the &quot;kinks&quot; will be worked out... But in reality they&#39;re hard physical limits intrinsic to the concept, that&#39;s why renewable power is just modern day alchemy. <br><br>The list of insurmountable flaws is really quite long, and it only takes a single one to scuttle the whole idea. <br><br>-No system exists to ensure grid reliability, particularly with regards to frequency stability, in fact wind and solar drastically worsen reliability which is the paramount requirement of any energy system. <br>-Renewable power is seriously geographically limited, much of the world just doesn&#39;t have that geography. <br>-Long transmission lines to cross connect areas with different generation and demand are all but impossible to build due to right of way and environmental laws.<br>-Large storage is at best infeasible and even if it could work it only adds more cost and reduces the overall efficiency of the power system straining generation capacity that renewable power already can&#39;t meet.<br>-There&#39;s no renewable solution to many types of energy demand, the fixation of electricity alone leaves out over half of our energy consumption. The idea of electrifying energy thing is both impossible and ignores the fact that we&#39;re never going to have enough wind and solar to meet our electricity demands, so trying for 2-3 times the current level is absurd.<br>-The land use requirements and raw material requirements of wind and solar power is tragic. Not only do these resources not exist, but it&#39;s cause environmental havoc to try and obtain them.<br>-The short life span of renewable power installations at less than half conventional generators (and that&#39;s an ideal comparison) greatly worsens all the other factors.<br><br>And this isn&#39;t even everything, just a few big obvious ones. That&#39;s why the future, and especially are carbon free future is nuclear powered.

Modern windmills that generate AC at 60 hertz to match the grid. Requires the windmill to turn at a set speed. The blades rotate to capture more or less air to maintain a set speed. Then an expensive transmission keeps the output speed at 60 hertz to spin the generator. <br>My question. An old style windmill designed to pump water. Operates at a variable speed with high torque. I have seen these windmills spin very slowly in a slight breeze pumping a small amount of water. Then pump a lot of water in high breeze. A governor pushes the blade out of alignment when the wind is strong enough to damage the pump. If you replaced the pitman that operates the pump. Instead mount a DC motor in it\u2019s place. No matter the wind speed. The generator would put out 24 volts. The current will go up and down. The generated current can wired the same as solar cells are. Solar cells generate DC voltage and is converted to AC. Wind blows 24 hours a day. Providing most of the energy a home needs. With the excess banked on the grid. <br>I can get a 24 foot diameter multi bladed water pumping windmill very cheaply. <br>Is this method of generating electricity be practical? <br>What are the formula\u2019s I would need to determine horse power at various wind speeds?

Smaller windmills were easier to keep ice off of and the fact that they are windmills meant that they weren&#39;t turning a generator but rather a big flywheel. Generators produce more resistance with more draw. A windmill stays about constant due to the Mass of the flywheel so it would just hits the turbine blades the flywheel adds enough resistance to keep it from spinning out of control. Another big problem with large wind turbines is that the larger they are the more the blades act like their own flywheel trapping Mass so the bigger break you need. In fact most wind turbine explosions are due to the fact that the breaking system has failed. The size of the wind turbine and poor design for icing also lead to the fact that it takes way more fossil fuel to run a wind farm than it does to run a generator at a power plant. There is no economic benefit from wind turbines. All they are doing is using resources when that could be focused on cleaning our fossil fuel power plants or using even cleaner nuclear energy!

When converting kinetic energy to electrical energy the power remains constant (minus some efficiency losses).  Power from the rotating kinetic energy of the turbine is RPM x Torque (ft-lbs) (1 ft-lb/min = 0.023 watts).  Power generated in electricity is voltage x amperage (1 volt-ampere = 1 watt).  So on the electrical side you can either boost voltage or amperage to get your power and on the mechanical side you can either boost torque or speed.  With most generators boosting speed is equivalent to boosting voltage meaning you can lower your amperage.  On average this is more efficient as it is safer to transmit lower current and allows your electrical components (wiring, breakers, etc) to be lighter and more efficient.  On large gas turbine powered generators (think jet engine powered generator) that spin at 10,000 RPM or more the internal wiring is extremely light.<br><br>Most residential power grids (in America at least) run at 15,000 to 25,000 volts for this reason, they can run at much lower amperage (if they were running lower voltage the size of the power cables would be immense, probably too large to run on the standard above ground pole you see in rural areas).
