I think he was trying to explain why energy is emitted from hot objects like incandescent light bulb filaments in the form of particles called photons which each have an energy content that is proportional to their frequency.  It turns out that the higher frequency photons of visible light are emitted from electrons making transitions between orbitals of the tungsten atoms in the light bulb&#39;s filament with the energy and frequency of a photon increasing as the energy difference of the two orbitals it moves between increases.  The closer two orbitals are to a tungsten atom&#39;s nucleus, the greater the difference in their energies which is emitted as a photon whenever an excited electron drops down from the higher to the lower energy orbital.  As the filament heats up, its atoms start vibrating more violently and their random impacts against each other will be able to knock electrons from lower energy to higher energy orbitals that are closer and closer to the nucleus and have greater and greater energy differences.  When those electrons then return to their starting orbitals they will give off photons of higher and higher energy and frequency as a consequence.  This is why the light emitted by a hot object experiences a shift in the average energy and frequency of its photons toward higher values as the object gets hotter.", "comment_date": "2018-10-14T13:18:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mayonnaise", "comment_text": "Don&#39;t trust people with edited comments", "comment_date": "2018-10-12T08:50:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KinoftheFlames", "comment_text": "what?", "comment_date": "2018-10-08T06:30:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "regi johnn", "comment_text": "Not the quantum theory, its the cookie theory \ud83d\ude15", "comment_date": "2018-10-02T14:01:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "regi johnn", "comment_text": "U made me confused", "comment_date": "2018-10-02T13:59:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ZigSputnik", "comment_text": "I don&#39;t think silly analogies ever help.

In 1900 Planck derived a formula which was agreeing with experiments even on low frequencies. But he did not use quantization yet. In November 1900 he realized that he needed to find more fundamental derivation of entropy law. He used Boltzmann&#39;s equation for entropy S=k*logW . To find W Planck had to count how many ways an energy can be distributed across a set of oscillators. That&#39;s when he first thought of &quot;energy elements&quot;.
