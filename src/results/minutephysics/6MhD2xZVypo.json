Those who believe that the earth is a sphere are idiots who are caught in the brainwashing of the devil (Freemasonry). Antarctica is an icy continent that is too large for humans to grasp. Gravity works with the spiritual power of the spirit. Since the human eye (lens) is round, what you see looks round. The image of the horizon from the stratosphere taken with the iPhone is a straight line. However, it is distorted up and down with a slight shaking. YouTube videos of that kind are processed with fisheye lenses and the like. Mason is fooling humans with the lie of science in order not to know the truth of God&#39;s teachings or the content of the Bible. The flag of the League of Nations represents the flat earth theory. The olive vines that surround the earth point to Antarctica.\r<br>\r<br>* The earth is not a sphere, but the flat earth theory is correct. The earth is neither rotating nor revolving. The sun appears to move from east to west because the earth is tilting. To explain this concretely, you can think of an umbrella in the sky. As the umbrella in the sky rotates while tilting its axis, the sun will appear to be in a circular motion. In reality, the umbrella is not rotating, but the earth is tilting while tilting its axis. The tilt angle of the axis changes when the four seasons change. When this goes out of orbit, it becomes a pole shift, which is the ice age.\r<br>\r<br>* In the predecessor Kujiki Taiseikyo, written by Prince Shotoku, the freshness is light, the sun rises, and when it becomes heaven, it becomes the heaven and keeps covering the earth, and the turbidity sinks heavily. , The shade is stiff and becomes the ground. A modern translation of this is that the quanta that make up the universe are light, constantly circulating, and the elementary particles that make up the Earth are heavy, stagnant, and solidified into matter. Therefore, the earth is immovable, and the universe (heaven) is moving around. Due to the law of inertia, heavy objects cannot move. It is a child&#39;s deception such as the heliocentric theory, and it is just a superstition that the earth rotates forever. If the earth revolves around the heavy sun, the galaxy should revolve around the center of gravity of the universe, but there is no such movement, only the constellations are circularly moving around the heavy earth around the North Star. ..\r<br>\r<br>* Let&#39;s prove that Galileo&#39;s heliocentric theory is a lie\r<br>It should be possible to observe the rotation of the earth from a flying airplane, but it does not seem to be moving very much. The earth, the atmosphere, and the airplane are not rotating as one. The atmosphere is not bound to the earth because the wind is blowing from all directions, north, south, east and west. Airplanes are not bound by the atmosphere because they can navigate freely in the atmosphere. Certainly, when observing the appearance of flying a botfly in an airplane in flight, the botfly was flying lightly without being affected by the inertial force generated by the weight of the botfly itself due to the speed of the airplane. This is evidence that no inertial force is generated in the confined airplane. In other words, it is considered that the air in the space before and after the botfly (even if it is a vacuum) cancels the inertial force. The inertial force is created by the air pocket after the object is moving. Therefore, after the airplane, the inertial force works, and if it suddenly decelerates, the inertial force works positively. However, the atmosphere on the earth is freely flowing without being glued to the earth. Therefore, if the airplane sails westward against the eastern inertial force (due to centrifugal force) due to the rotation of the earth, the propulsive force of the airplane will be attenuated accordingly. The inertial force generated by the rotation of the earth at 1700 km / h is quite large, and it is quite possible that the airplane cannot travel.\r<br>\r<br>The speed of rotation of the earth near the equator is 1700 km / h. If the ground is moving at this speed when the plane lands, the plane will be wrecked by the impact. The reason why it is not wrecked is that the earth does not rotate.\r<br>If you look closely at the movement of the constellations, you will see two circles. If the earth rotates, one circle should be formed. This is a contradiction of the rotation theory.\r<br> \r<br>If you ride a rotating wooden horse that rotates counterclockwise and pass the ball to your opponent, the ball will bend in a right curve. If you shoot the target with a rifle, it will not hit the target in the same way. This is also the basis for saying that the rotation theory is wrong. The rocket launch video shows the rocket flying straight into the sky. If the earth is rotating, it should draw a curve that warps in the direction of rotation due to the inertial force of centrifugal force.\r<br>\r<br>Evidence that Antarctica is infinite\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXXnXq_FCNo&amp;list=UU8nlwBiuAcuLKOFz7V-NGyg&amp;index=7\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXXnXq_FCNo&amp;list=UU8nlwBiuAcuLKOFz7V-NGyg&amp;index=7\r</a><br>\r<br>* The most stupid is the Nobel Prize-winning scholar, and the most genius is Prince Shotoku, a psychic of wisdom who excels in intuition.\r<br>\r<br>Let&#39;s break free from the brainwashing of science (mathematics, physics, etc.) built with lies and regain the true scholarship in our hands. Twice\r<br>\r<br>Science is a fiction created by the devil to deny God, and it is true that it is described in ancient Japanese legends and the Christian Bible. All the stupid scholars overturned this truth and built it into Mason&#39;s convenient system. Thanks to that, the people believe in the devil&#39;s scam rather than the word of God. What is called brainwashing without calling this brainwashing? Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution, Galileo&#39;s heliocentric theory, Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, medicine, genetic engineering (genes are words and genes are tools) are all wrong. On the contrary, ghosts, UFOs (aliens are lies), psychic powers, divine miracles, telepathy, teleportation, etc., which are called occult, are true. There are things and spirits (gods) in this world, and the universe is active by the spiritual power (thoughts) of God. God created everything by means of word soul. It is clear when you read the Bible. Today&#39;s scholars use human wisdom to knead logic and cannot reach the truth. What is important is intuition. Why does a child do that? What cannot be answered is a mistake. Our common sense is more correct than a stupid scholar. Everything is made up of matter by the thought of God (person).\r<br>\r<br>1 + 1 = 2 cannot be proved by a mathematical formula. Only the physical phenomenon that one apple is combined with another apple to form two apples can be proved. If the apple disappears suddenly, or if the number increases like the art of alter ego, 1 + 1 = 2 does not hold. 0 + 1 \u2260 1. Since 0 (none) is not a thing, it should not be treated as a number. Even if you combine apples and oranges, the things are different, so there is no point in adding them. If God is defined as having (integer), there is no existence (0) because there is no other than God. Mathematics is wrong and fictional because it defines 0, negative numbers, imaginary numbers, \u221e, etc. that do not exist in this world.\r<br>\r<br>The roots of scientific theory are all unsuccessful, and the bottom is cracked. For example, in particle physics, electrons connect atoms to form a molecule. A meson is a link between a proton and a neutron, and a proton is made up of three quarks. Electrons and positrons (antimatter) are generated from photons. Every time a new elementary particle is discovered, an elementary particle that connects the elementary particles is required, and the relationship between the elementary particles and the elementary particles becomes increasingly unclear. Why is there a difference in the presence or absence of electric charge even though protons and neutrons have the same mass? Science has no answer to these questions. I think that electrons are matter, and positrons are matter-deficient holes surrounded by ghosts and not matter. In other words, antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is trying to think logically and is losing sight of the truth. God&#39;s constructed natural mechanism is simpler, but difficult to understand with human wisdom.\r<br>\r<br>Einstein&#39;s ghost\r<br>People who often experienced asphyxia are said to have seen the scene of heaven through the tunnel of light during the rebirth. The speed of movement of the soul is no longer bound by gravity, and in the world of consciousness there is no law of invariance of the speed of light that I discovered in my lifetime. In other words, what you think is to move as it is. Furthermore, what you think is transmitted to the other party as it is. All of us life share one inner nature. And the substance is actually consciousness. All things are in your heart, and you are the one who lives in the heart of all life. It means that everything in this universe looks like the outside world to the eye, but in reality the outside world is your inner world. Here, the relativity disappears, and this universe is based on the &quot;universal truth called God.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-10-01T12:44:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asyhab Fadhlurrahman", "comment_text": "ei, apa hubungannya UANG dengan DUNIA, ahh cuci otak aja anda ini", "comment_date": "2021-09-17T18:18:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicol\u00e1s Vergara", "comment_text": "What you know about Rowling down in the deep", "comment_date": "2021-08-30T04:47:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XPNDBLhero", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MhD2xZVypo&amp;t=0m51s\">0:51</a> - I think there&#39;s a guy at Burning Man that would disagree w/ this...
