Why Intelligence never evolved here or anywhere else? The laws of mathematical probability forbid it. There is no chance for it too evolve, because civilizations as they reach an advanced technical stage, that is invariably associated with a gaping inequality with the general wisdom of the majority of its citizens and consequently the administrators and its techies, makes it inevitable that the prolonged period where wisdom could match the technical know-how, the statistical probability of an accident occurring kicks in.  Consequently no intelligence, worth its name can arise. If such a possibility could have existed, then there would already have existed an eternal paradise and certainly no irremediable suffering. Like Tegmark, I think we have had already some close encounters. Think about it that on that particular day, there was a civil officer in charge in Russia, by sheer CHANCE!

The modernization projects launched by the US and Russia are upgrading delivery platforms, ie the missiles, submarines, and bomber aircraft. Both the US and Russia have halted production of new warheads and are instead using existing stockpiles. The upgrades both countries are pursuing aren&#39;t increasing the power of warheads, but instead focus on the deliverability of their payload. This actually allows for fewer warheads because there is less need to saturate a target with multiple nukes to guarantee their destruction. If anything, the Future of Life Institute should be supporting the new weapon systems to justify more aggressive campaigning for arsenal reduction.<br>2. The justification about deterrence needs being met by countries with small arsenals like Pakistan, North Korea, and India is that all of those nations are primarily regional powers with regional interests. It is also fairly ironic that the video uses North Korea and Pakistan as examples of sensible nuclear policy, since each of those nations are the considered to be the highest risk vectors for nuclear terrorism and proliferation. Countries like Britain and France have limited arsenals in no small part due to their participation in NATO, and can rely on coverage from the US. The same is likely true for China, which can still reasonably rely on Russia against Western nuclear aggression. If the arsenal was reduced to, say double digits, NATO member states will likely pursue their own weapons programs to get their deterrence needs met, again defeating the the purpose of counter proliferation.", "comment_date": "2016-12-27T17:23:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bill Nye", "comment_text": "Hey, setting the earth into a mini ice age wouldn&#39;t be all bad because it could be one way to stop global warming", "comment_date": "2016-12-27T16:07:43Z", "likes_count": 16}, {"comment_by": "DtWolfwood", "comment_text": "Interesting the suggested links brought me here from the &quot;No Cloning&quot; video. pretty topical since the president elect wants the exact thing this video warns against.", "comment_date": "2016-12-27T15:10:06Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Herobrine 37", "comment_text": "B.S. = Be Serious.", "comment_date": "2016-12-27T15:06:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ch0k1ngh4z4rd", "comment_text": "Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.", "comment_date": "2016-12-27T15:01:22Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Dreezy Mango", "comment_text": "That was totally the guy who made ZE END OF ZE WORLD vid", "comment_date": "2016-12-27T14:29:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wooby VR", "comment_text": "Well<br><br><br>Australia seems fairly safe in nuclear war if not<br><br><br><br><br><br>we can just invade new zealand", "comment_date": "2016-12-27T13:43:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LimeGreenTeknii", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRnU0bqsyq0&amp;t=1m02s\">1:02</a> Yes, nobody in their right mind...", "comment_date": "2016-12-24T19:12:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "kinpatu", "comment_text": "The concern over accidental launch is justified.

The numbers look impressive, but in an attack, a large number of nuclear weapons and delivery methods will likely be destroyed unless they are concealed by submarine, strengthened missile silos, etc... <br><br>We sign arms treaties to hinder the exponential growth of such powerful weapons that can be triggered by accident on any side.

Old nukes are inaccurate, and require maintenance. Such funds go to restoring them in places like submarines (ex. Trident program), where the quantity of nuclear arms isn&#39;t so much important as their ability to exist after an attack. Submarines and other more modern delivery systems are used to attack an enemy that has already fired, and being behind in this technology can be fatal to the security of a nation.

Minute Physics, I thought you were better at doing your homework.<br><br>First, the propaganda-esque word choices--&quot;kill millions of people,&quot; &quot;radioactive fallout, which would kill even more,&quot; etc. The explosions could potentially kill millions, if detonated in the heart of a large city, but the radiation wouldn&#39;t &quot;kill even more&quot;. Damage caused by the total radiation from all nuclear tests is highly contestable, because it&#39;s calculated on a linear scale: meaning they assume if a lot will hurt you to death, a little will hurt you a little. This is not true, and accurate models actually show that some increase in exposure to radiation is beneficial, which is why sunbathing is good for you, or why flying (which exposes you to a great deal of radiation) doesn&#39;t kill you.<br><br>The biggest threat isn&#39;t a nuclear winter, as that scenario is so far from being likely it&#39;s absurd--that&#39;s like claiming the biggest threat to earth is a huge meteor hitting it, causing another ice age (the same thing as nuclear winter, but not from atomic weapons). The US hires hundreds of people to regularly replace and upkeep their nuclear arsenal, and the Russian arsenal is mostly disconnected and stored in various pieces. Additionally, to even launch a nuclear weapon, there are 3-10 safeguards in place that all have to be simultaneously activated, included key slots on opposite sides of a large room that both have to be turned within less than a second of each other, making it pretty impossible for them both to short or for one person to launch them both. No nuclear weapons are wired to automatically fire--all are configured to require multiple layers of human interaction, and then computer safeguards are stacked on top of that.<br><br>Close calls will never equal automatic nuclear weapon launch. Owning more nuclear weapons is not a security threat any more than a few are for the same reasons mentioned above--they will not automatically launch, and guarding &lt;100 nukes is the same as guarding more--you just duplicate the security in multiple facilities. And America at least takes this obligation very seriously--like I said, they have hundreds of highly-educated technicians, physicists, and engineers who team with security and other personnel to upkeep and maintain the things--including keeping them from falling into the wrong hands. I&#39;ve applied for this job, and read through the requirements for it--it&#39;s pretty intense.<br><br>The cause you&#39;re pushing is not a bad one, but the way you introduced it is worse than terrible. What you may not realize is the many, many benefits of the nuclear industry are colored as bad by poorly researched/presented information like this. Hundreds of thousands of people would die every year without the bounteous boon of nuclear technologies, but folks only hear propaganda like this and think that everything nuclear is bad. Were you aware that the Department of Homeland Security pushed to get regulatory control over isotopes because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was &quot;letting them out to the public&quot;? Allowing silly things like medical isotopes and measurement isotopes loose in the world? And that they were planning to ban all isotopes, because &quot;isotopes are nuclear--isn&#39;t that bad&quot;?<br><br>The total lack of understanding surrounding nuclear in general isn&#39;t helped by videos like this, which serve to present highly emotionally charged content devoid of much fact to make the public fear nuclear...enough of my rant. I&#39;m very disappointed, MinutePhysics.

This is particularly true of big cities (one potential group of targets). The other targets for nuclear strikes are airbases, navy ports, and the nuclear silo sites of the enemy, here there is not so much material to burn. <br>While the initial radiation of the first instant of a nuclear explosion is incredibly high, and will begin to incinerate things almost instantaneously, this heat does not last long, and is followed by a tremendous blast wave which can put out fires by starving them of air.<br>Not saying that a nuclear winter cannot happen, just this idea that there are enough nuclear weapons to destroy the world several times over is nothing more than a myth.<br>Some other myths, in the event of nuclear war, everyone dies. Not everyone will die. Almost certainly the majority of people will survive. Many will be severely injured, and many rural folk wont have any idea of what is happening. People will more likely die from existing in a lawless world where many of the institutions and industry we take for granted no longer functions.<br>Secondly, radioactive fallout is not a primary consideration, the air will be safe to breath pretty swiftly because all the major nuclear powers use air burst strikes for maximum destructive power. Fallout occurs in ground burst and near ground burst strikes. And the only people to employ that tactic are forces without high tech missiles, such as North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organisations.
