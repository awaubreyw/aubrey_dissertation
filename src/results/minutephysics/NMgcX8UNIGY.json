In truth, in order for an electron to know that there is anorther electron nearby so it knows it needs to move the right way, the electrons exchange photons. They exchange actual photons in order to do that.

It&#39;s just the connection and use of energy!! Another cool FACT is that when these scientists teleported these particles they thought to them selves what was stopping them doing it on a bigger scale!! We&#39;ll nothing!!

There&#39;s a big theory with facts that u can read up on which explains this in better detail!! But telekinesis is possible!! And anyone can do it!!

Quantum entanglement is when two particles must have a state related in a certain way, so when the state of one of them is determined, the state of the other instantly determines, no matter how far it is away. For instance, if two particles are created from a decay, they must have opposite spins. Since their spins are not determined at that time, when one of the spins is determined, the other one instantly determines to be the opposite, so not exactly telekinesis.", "comment_date": "2013-03-03T20:19:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fluffletoes The Gnome", "comment_text": "shut the FUCK up... thanks", "comment_date": "2013-03-03T08:33:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jimbob926", "comment_text": "Neil Turok sounds like a vulcan name", "comment_date": "2013-03-02T12:07:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Buddlebot", "comment_text": "This guy is a much more respectable narrator than the original guy.", "comment_date": "2013-03-02T05:20:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Manuel Melchor Miranda", "comment_text": "I lke the stickman :D", "comment_date": "2013-03-01T14:35:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "k0m1kk", "comment_text": "Magnets ...

No science disproves god.  It is impossible to disprove god.  Philosophy can use conclusions drawn from science to argue against the existence of god.  Logic can argue that since there is no evidence that god exists, then there is no reason to assume god.  \n\nBut.  The very fact that there are a great number of learned and accomplished scientists who are devout believers in one religion or another disproves your thesis that science disproves god.", "comment_date": "2012-10-07T19:08:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "arcticdeserts", "comment_text": "You really shouldn&#39;t use all caps when you are clearly so ignorant on the subject you&#39;re vehemently crusading against.", "comment_date": "2012-10-07T19:08:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrNamehere99", "comment_text": "So that&#39;s how magnets work", "comment_date": "2012-10-07T19:07:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperTyden", "comment_text": "not at all, i believe in god and science", "comment_date": "2012-10-07T19:07:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperTyden", "comment_text": "unless religion is right...", "comment_date": "2012-10-07T19:07:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mikevalla", "comment_text": "Holy moley... this has got to be quite simply the BEST educational video I have ever seen!", "comment_date": "2012-10-07T19:06:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valdas House", "comment_text": "best mp video ;D", "comment_date": "2012-10-07T19:06:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atlas", "comment_text": "He never said e believes in god dumb ass.", "comment_date": "2012-10-07T19:06:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Xathael", "comment_text": "Which means, you all are a bunch of blokes who are arguing about two things that have different concepts.
