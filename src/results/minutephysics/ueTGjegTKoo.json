One minor clarification: The core of the engine does actually produce a significant amount of thrust in a high-bypass turbofan - when at altitude. It&#39;s about 50/50.

As such, the fan&#39;s power consumption isn&#39;t as high, which leaves more enthalpy available to convert to thrust coming out of the core nozzle (the turbine driving the fan doesn&#39;t need as much at cruise). At takeoff, though, you&#39;re trying to squeeze every last drop out of the fan and therefore there will be very little energy left over to make thrust out of the core.

Looking at the 747-400 compared to the A350-900, the Airbus actually got larger wing span and its only 4 meters shorter.. so yes, the 747 is larger, but only just. The A350 is actually a huge plane  And the uppcoming A350-1000 will actually be longer than the 747-400.  (of cause the 747-i8 is longer still, but its the 747-400 in the picture.)<br><br>The issue is that B747 have 4 engines and the A350 have only 2. The thurst of the A350 engines is maximum 350kN, but for the B747-400 only 280kN. Actually the engines of the A350 is even stronger than the one of the A380.<br><br><br>There is one additional error in the video. its over theoretical compared to the actual reality of aircraft engines. All (or almost all?) turbofan engines is direct drive engines. Because the fanblade have a maximum speed the rotation velocity most be keeped. This make it so the turbine engine have to have huge torque.<br><br>The compromise to this is that the turbine engines is a loot larger than it need to be, and the fan ist still smaler than is optimal. This is why engine manufacture dont make the fan at optimal size. Because then the torque would be to much.<br><br>The solution to this is of cause to introduce gearing. And there are some prototypes under development. This not only makes it so the fan can be any size (that is the optimal size for every given aircraft, but it also make it so the turbine engine can be the optimal size to.. that is a lot smaller.<br><br>This will decrease the fuel consumpsion more than making the fan bigger.
