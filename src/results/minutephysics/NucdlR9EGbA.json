Our sun generates it&#39;s own energy not primarily from hydrogen which may generate some incidentally but it is not the main mechanism.<br>The real threat to the survival of mankind is from our sun. <br>The true model of physics has been unlocked and a new era of unestimated abundance, peaceful, intelligent advancement is within the reach of humanity. However the pseudoscience of the big bang and particle physics by big business and big egos some of who refuse to acknowledge the simple indisputable evidence that destroys the particle model and the big bang are trying their best to keep it silenced and some have even gone to great lengths to have the evidence removed from online. For now it remains online so humanity still has hope of surviving what is coming and which will cause a zombie type apocalypse if scientists don&#39;t wake up and get back to adhering to scientific principles. Follow the evidence not what you assume must be true or what looks likely using cherry picked mathematics from a model that does not unify(work). Our sun goes micro nova periodically followed by periods of darkness, causing extinction events followed by ice ages. Another one is coming, we should be getting prepared but science has been taken hostage by money and egos. Its time to get really really serious!

Can&#39;t you simply ignore that sentence? And if you can&#39;t, can you really begin a discussion with Henry with that sentence in mind that he said? He only said that in some cases it&#39;s actually difficult to distinguish if a person is a man or a women, but we often need to do so. And this is not offensive, in my opinion (surely he didn&#39;t say that sentence for that purpose): it happens all the time. Transgender people has been in doubt at least once in their lives, asking if their body represents theirselves, if that is important, what can they do... And genderfluid people don&#39;t even feel a single answer in their lives. But of course cisgender people (like me) need to say &quot;he is transgender&quot;, &quot;she/he is genderfluid&quot;, because we have to give names to things (and probably don&#39;t have the right pronouns). We also expect that the suddivision is clear and without doubt, when it is really very ambiguous sometimes. Just think about bisexual and sexually fluid: we know the difference between them in theory. But in reality, a bisexual person has often periods during which he/she is mostly attracted to women, and then others when he/she is mostly attracted to men; so actually a person should defines his/her sexual identity regardless of names and strict definitions, and probably a full description is sometimes better than a name.", "comment_date": "2017-12-14T19:44:16Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Vu", "comment_text": "i am 100%<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>can&#39;t understand what you said<br>but i am interested in your vid", "comment_date": "2017-12-07T02:55:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nacho", "comment_text": "heres a question: what would happen if you sprayed the sun with 1 solar mass of water?", "comment_date": "2017-12-01T15:43:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wendy", "comment_text": "you collabed with yourself nice job", "comment_date": "2017-11-19T03:02:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryley Williams", "comment_text": "What is the degenerate quark matter?", "comment_date": "2017-11-07T06:25:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrGoatsy", "comment_text": "Saying Pluto isn&#39;t a planet is like saying midgets aren&#39;t people.<br><br><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23PlanetEquality\">#PlanetEquality</a>", "comment_date": "2017-11-03T00:50:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "person", "comment_text": "wait i thought minute earth and minute physics were by the same people wtf", "comment_date": "2017-10-29T02:23:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raoul Titulaer", "comment_text": "came here for the metamoons tho", "comment_date": "2017-10-29T00:36:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brendan Sullivan", "comment_text": "Black Holes, Neutron Stars, and White Dwarfs (Collab. w/ MinuteEarth)", "comment_date": "2017-09-28T00:25:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Xd Labocris", "comment_text": "ur gay", "comment_date": "2017-09-24T22:47:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Imi\u0119 Nazwisko", "comment_text": "What happens when a neutron star cools down?

Black holes cannot be holes. The larger, or more dense an object is, (or the more mass an object has) the more gravity it has, thus the more objects it can pull. (remember this) Black holes are created through the collapse of stars. Not all stars create black holes though, they create small, but extremely dense white dwarfs, which have the mass many times greater than that of our own Sun. White dwarfs are only created by the collapse of smaller stars, contrary to the collapse of larger stars which create black holes in a fantastic supernova. (I am only thinking logically here and everything is unscientifically unsupported) Black holes have more mass than white dwarfs, so much condensed mass that they absorb light, the fastest known object in the universe, due to this obviously they are &quot;black&quot;, and unable to be seen, only as a shadow to the light of stars. Here is the theory: black holes are extremely condensed objects of mass, such as that of white dwarfs, super-compressed by the supreme collapse of stars themselves. Black holes don&#39;t &quot;suck&quot; things in like a vacuum, but are rather pulled in by the immense gravity by the extreme mass of the black hole. So much that they pull in light itself, thus we cannot see them, thus we think of them as &quot;holes.&quot; The more mass it absorbs, the larger the black hole becomes, behaving like a planet.
