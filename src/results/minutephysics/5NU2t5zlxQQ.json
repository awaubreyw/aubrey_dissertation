Considering the universe is Constantly expanding. This doesn&#39;t mean that there is more being created - just that there is more separation between objects - such as galaxies. We know these things by measuring the energy in the Universe and seeing it&#39;s expansion. You could roll everything up back into a ball from a central point and this is something that we can see. Everything is expanding from a central location, which means at one point in time the universe was much smaller while still retaining the same amount of mass and energy. Thus we must ask the question because the Law of thermodynamics and entropy do not lie, what caused the Universe&#39;s creation? Was it &#39;nothingness&#39;? Of course not, it had to be something that was not restricted to time, space, matter, or energy ( i.e. God). Thus something Supernatural had to create the natural, something beyond our Universe had to create the Universe. The best, and in my opinion only, explanation for this is God. The Universe is not INFINITE, because it is not ETERNAL. If the Universe is not Eternal, it can not be infinite, and since the Universe is only so old - then it can only be so big by the rate of it&#39;s expansion.

Number one, that infinity cannot expand. I consider this to be false, on account of the fact that something cannot be infinite without being expanding. This can be hard to get at all and impossible to fully comprehend the vastness of infinity. Infinity is one of two things. One is\u00a0a gradually expanding, yet unstoppable number, item, or reaction. In simpler terms, it is something like x=x+1. Or it can be a number or amount of an item that is expanding to fast for us to comprehend. x equals x to the power of infinity. However, BOTH of these are considered impossible in real world terms due to a simple matter of physics. The Law of Conservation of Mass, one of the most respected laws of physics, states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. This means that the universe CANNOT be infinite. It may expand, but theoretically would have an edge made of all of the unused matter converted from the original big bang explosion. The common belief is that, once this matter is used up, the gravity of everything inside of the universe will pull itself towards the center (Which a non-infinite universe would have at the origin point of the big bang) until it lost all outward momentum and started to revert inward toward said center. This would cause a clump of mass in the center and... well, that&#39;s unknown. It may condense into the ultimate clump of dark matter, or there may be some huge chemical reaction. This is pretty much unknown, and cannot be known without having all the information in the universe. So, according to this theory, our universe is just a temporary expansion ending with a re-condensing. Morbid as it may seem, this is the current theory. But, on the bright side, if everything is temporary, it gives much more incentive to DO things. Live a little, because any moment could be your last.

Though , i think it depends on the size and strength of a black hole. Some black holes have the ability to absorb light due to its great sheer strength, however, there are some which aren&#39;t as strong. Maybe light can&#39;t be absorbed into them, so light maybe able to orbit a black hole if its speed (3*10^8 m/s) is greater than a paticular specific speed which differs for every black hole..
