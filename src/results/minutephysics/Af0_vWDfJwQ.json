It is supposed to ignore collision with basically anything but still cause and be affected by gravity? It rather sounds absurd and unlikely. Like a quickfix to something we did not yet understand yet.<br><br>I rather think the following is the case: As you know, gravity has the effect to pull things to the object exerting it, but also being pulled by the object. The more mass an object has, the more likely it is to be affected by gravity and affect other objects. Imagine there is a planet flying across space just slightly beyond the gravitational reach of our solar system - it would just fly straight away. If it had more mass (~2 to 100 times more), it might have been in reach of the suns gravitational force, thus being affected by its pull -- but also exerting the same amount of force to the sun (but due to the difference of mass the sun would be pulled much less), which might cause the planet to orbit.<br><br>Orbiting is imagined as something which has a fixed object of higher mass in the middle and an object of lower mass orbiting it, but actually the fixed object is not unaffected by it, it will move slightly along with it.<br><br>The galaxy&#39;s coherence of stars is explained by dark matter, but I think we just did not got the concept of gravity right. It distorts light and time - but what if this phenomenon is not exclusive to black holes and insignificant everywhere else, but rather fundamental to the understanding of it? What if the view we have all around us is just more and more distorted, and we interpret the wrong data? Not only light is affected, but it is said that time too. And what if time is not even affected, but instead space is distorted by gravity in a way, which causes it to &quot;contain more place&quot;, which looks like time goes slower? What if a black hole just expands the space existing in its surroundings, which makes matter and light travel thousand or more times &quot;further&quot; than before?<br><br>I also heard, orbiting planets are said to fly in straight lines, but space is distorted around stars which causes the route to go actually in circles.<br><br>I think, before we claim there is something we cannot measure, and a hella lot of it, first let&#39;s understand gravity and its effects on space, time and light on the large scale. Because that might lead to the real answer why galaxies can hold their stars together - by their shared gravitational force - and maybe because stars which did not happen to stick to it just flew away long time ago.", "comment_date": "2016-12-30T13:10:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "IVI", "comment_text": "I just finished watching your video on antimatter and I have a question.

It&#39;s simply a total separate, completely irrelevant force that has nothing to do with the carrying particles of electromagnetism and has no relation to electromagnetism whatsoever. Gravity and dark matter both exists regardless of the existence of electromagnetic fields, and the existence of things like black holes prove this, they have so much gravity that they obliterate the carrying particles of electromagnetism, if dark matter or gravity were related to electromagnetism, black holes could not exist, and we know that their existence is vital to the creation of important structures like galaxies that heard stars together so they don&#39;t flail about randomly smashing into each other.<br><br>It&#39;s just stupid and wrong.

These parts of the universe are totally separate from mass, energy, particles, and the electro-strong-weak forces, which <b>DO</b> exist, and can be measured, viewed, understood, and studied. We can watch the carrying particles of electromagnetism do their thing, and they do what electromagnetism should do. If they caused gravity, or dark matter we would have seen it a <b>LOOOONG time ago</b>... Like seriously, do you think every scientist in the world is a complete and total moron who never thought to check if electromagnetism, a force they can observe and study in detail was causing other forces of nature?
