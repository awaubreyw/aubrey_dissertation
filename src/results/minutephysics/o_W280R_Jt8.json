A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. What is called brainwashing without expressing brainwashing in this? Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, medicine, the genetic engineering (the gene is the soul of language as for the gene a tool) of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO (as for the alien a lie), supernatural power, a miracle, telepathy of God, the moment movement to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).\r<br>\r<br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. An apple becomes extinct suddenly and does not become 1+1 = 2 like an operation of the other self if a number is quality to increase. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence (integer), no (0) does not exist.\r<br>\r<br>If 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, infinite space is infinite (\u221e) and does not exist either. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is mistake definition of 0or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.\r<br>\r<br>It was done that Einstein who hit the contradiction of the uncertainness theory that became the quantum-mechanical basics returned by contradiction of own theory of relativity and defeated it. When Mitsuko of the one of the boxes of a theory, the light jumps out of a shutter, a spring shrinks, and a box lightens, and true time becomes uncertain because time advances if mass by the theory of relativity lightens. Therefore I concluded that an uncertain theory was right. The principle of constancy of light velocity of Einstein is an error, and the special theory of relativity from it is a mistake, too. Thus, the quantum mechanics is blague.\r<br>\r<br>I find out a lie of Einstein\r<br>UFOA took off in speed of light C from 0 spots to the right direction, and UFOB took off at the same time in speed of light C from 0 spots to the left direction. In A, B arrived at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the left at the point of Ckm from 0 spots to the right one second later. The distance of the meantime is 2Ckm. The speed to see UFOB becomes double speed of light C from UFOA. This is right than it is measured in a speedometer. The principle of constancy of light velocity is an error. In other words, the theory of relativity is a lie. I know it even if I think about such a thing for common sense. A law of the addition of the speed is why and is applicable to a material, and is it not applicable to light? Naturally it is applicable to light. Time stops when I exercise in speed of light, and mass becomes infinite. Why is so; cannot examine it. In other words, such a thing is a lie.\r<br>\r<br>Message of the spiritual world of Einstein \r<br>When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;.", "comment_date": "2021-10-09T19:42:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Lady Bonezz", "comment_text": "Noticing a lot of rude people on here bashing on each other.

Those who believe that the earth is a sphere are idiots who are caught in the brainwashing of the devil (Freemasonry). Antarctica is an icy continent that is too large for humans to grasp. Gravity works with the spiritual power of the spirit. Since the human eye (lens) is round, what you see looks round. The image of the horizon from the stratosphere taken with the iPhone is a straight line. However, it is distorted up and down with a slight shaking. YouTube videos of that kind are processed with fisheye lenses and the like. Mason is fooling humans with the lie of science in order not to know the truth of God&#39;s teachings or the content of the Bible. The flag of the League of Nations represents the flat earth theory. The olive vines that surround the earth point to Antarctica.\r<br>\r<br>* The earth is not a sphere, but the flat earth theory is correct. The earth is neither rotating nor revolving. The sun appears to move from east to west because the earth is tilting. To explain this concretely, you can think of an umbrella in the sky. As the umbrella in the sky rotates while tilting its axis, the sun will appear to be in a circular motion. In reality, the umbrella is not rotating, but the earth is tilting while tilting its axis. The tilt angle of the axis changes when the four seasons change. When this goes out of orbit, it becomes a pole shift, which is the ice age.\r<br>\r<br>* In the predecessor Kujiki Taiseikyo, written by Prince Shotoku, the freshness is light, the sun rises, and when it becomes heaven, it becomes the heaven and keeps covering the earth, and the turbidity sinks heavily. , The shade is stiff and becomes the ground. A modern translation of this is that the quanta that make up the universe are light, constantly circulating, and the elementary particles that make up the Earth are heavy, stagnant, and solidified into matter. Therefore, the earth is immovable, and the universe (heaven) is moving around. Due to the law of inertia, heavy objects cannot move. It is a child&#39;s deception such as the heliocentric theory, and it is just a superstition that the earth rotates forever. If the earth revolves around the heavy sun, the galaxy should revolve around the center of gravity of the universe, but there is no such movement, only the constellations are circularly moving around the heavy earth around the North Star. ..\r<br>\r<br>* Let&#39;s prove that Galileo&#39;s heliocentric theory is a lie\r<br>It should be possible to observe the rotation of the earth from a flying airplane, but it does not seem to be moving very much. The earth, the atmosphere, and the airplane are not rotating as one. The atmosphere is not bound to the earth because the wind is blowing from all directions, north, south, east and west. Airplanes are not bound by the atmosphere because they can navigate freely in the atmosphere. Certainly, when observing the appearance of flying a botfly in an airplane in flight, the botfly was flying lightly without being affected by the inertial force generated by the weight of the botfly itself due to the speed of the airplane. This is evidence that no inertial force is generated in the confined airplane. In other words, it is considered that the air in the space before and after the botfly (even if it is a vacuum) cancels the inertial force. The inertial force is created by the air pocket after the object is moving. Therefore, after the airplane, the inertial force works, and if it suddenly decelerates, the inertial force works positively. However, the atmosphere on the earth is freely flowing without being glued to the earth. Therefore, if the airplane sails westward against the eastern inertial force (due to centrifugal force) due to the rotation of the earth, the propulsive force of the airplane will be attenuated accordingly. The inertial force generated by the rotation of the earth at 1700 km / h is quite large, and it is quite possible that the airplane cannot travel.\r<br>\r<br>The speed of rotation of the earth near the equator is 1700 km / h. If the ground is moving at this speed when the plane lands, the plane will be wrecked by the impact. The reason why it is not wrecked is that the earth does not rotate.\r<br>If you look closely at the movement of the constellations, you will see two circles. If the earth rotates, one circle should be formed. This is a contradiction of the rotation theory.\r<br> \r<br>If you ride a rotating wooden horse that rotates counterclockwise and pass the ball to your opponent, the ball will bend in a right curve. If you shoot the target with a rifle, it will not hit the target in the same way. This is also the basis for saying that the rotation theory is wrong. The rocket launch video shows the rocket flying straight into the sky. If the earth is rotating, it should draw a curve that warps in the direction of rotation due to the inertial force of centrifugal force.\r<br>\r<br>Evidence that Antarctica is infinite\r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXXnXq_FCNo&amp;list=UU8nlwBiuAcuLKOFz7V-NGyg&amp;index=7\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXXnXq_FCNo&amp;list=UU8nlwBiuAcuLKOFz7V-NGyg&amp;index=7\r</a><br>\r<br>* The most stupid is the Nobel Prize-winning scholar, and the most genius is Prince Shotoku, a psychic of wisdom who excels in intuition.\r<br>\r<br>Let&#39;s break free from the brainwashing of science (mathematics, physics, etc.) built with lies and regain the true scholarship in our hands. Twice\r<br>\r<br>Science is a fiction created by the devil to deny God, and it is true that it is described in ancient Japanese legends and the Christian Bible. All the stupid scholars overturned this truth and built it into Mason&#39;s convenient system. Thanks to that, the people believe in the devil&#39;s scam rather than the word of God. What is called brainwashing without calling this brainwashing? Darwin&#39;s theory of evolution, Galileo&#39;s heliocentric theory, Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, medicine, genetic engineering (genes are words and genes are tools) are all wrong. On the contrary, ghosts, UFOs (aliens are lies), psychic powers, divine miracles, telepathy, teleportation, etc., which are called occult, are true. There are things and spirits (gods) in this world, and the universe is active by the spiritual power (thoughts) of God. God created everything by means of word soul. It is clear when you read the Bible. Today&#39;s scholars use human wisdom to knead logic and cannot reach the truth. What is important is intuition. Why does a child do that? What cannot be answered is a mistake. Our common sense is more correct than a stupid scholar. Everything is made up of matter by the thought of God (person).\r<br>\r<br>1 + 1 = 2 cannot be proved by a mathematical formula. Only the physical phenomenon that one apple is combined with another apple to form two apples can be proved. If the apple disappears suddenly, or if the number increases like the art of alter ego, 1 + 1 = 2 does not hold. 0 + 1 \u2260 1. Since 0 (none) is not a thing, it should not be treated as a number. Even if you combine apples and oranges, the things are different, so there is no point in adding them. If God is defined as having (integer), there is no existence (0) because there is no other than God. Mathematics is wrong and fictional because it defines 0, negative numbers, imaginary numbers, \u221e, etc. that do not exist in this world.\r<br>\r<br>The roots of scientific theory are all unsuccessful, and the bottom is cracked. For example, in particle physics, electrons connect atoms to form a molecule. A meson is a link between a proton and a neutron, and a proton is made up of three quarks. Electrons and positrons (antimatter) are generated from photons. Every time a new elementary particle is discovered, an elementary particle that connects the elementary particles is required, and the relationship between the elementary particles and the elementary particles becomes increasingly unclear. Why is there a difference in the presence or absence of electric charge even though protons and neutrons have the same mass? Science has no answer to these questions. I think that electrons are matter, and positrons are matter-deficient holes surrounded by ghosts and not matter. In other words, antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is trying to think logically and is losing sight of the truth. God&#39;s constructed natural mechanism is simpler, but difficult to understand with human wisdom.\r<br>\r<br>Einstein&#39;s ghost\r<br>People who often experienced asphyxia are said to have seen the scene of heaven through the tunnel of light during the rebirth. The speed of movement of the soul is no longer bound by gravity, and in the world of consciousness there is no law of invariance of the speed of light that I discovered in my lifetime. In other words, what you think is to move as it is. Furthermore, what you think is transmitted to the other party as it is. All of us life share one inner nature. And the substance is actually consciousness. All things are in your heart, and you are the one who lives in the heart of all life. It means that everything in this universe looks like the outside world to the eye, but in reality the outside world is your inner world. Here, the relativity disappears, and this universe is based on the &quot;universal truth called God.&quot;", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T23:36:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "monbeau parfum", "comment_text": "I m a Facter Checker like Reuters. <br><br>Is Earth Round? <br><br>All evidences provided are crap \ud83d\udca9 <br><br>VERDICT<br><br>EaRTh is FlaT!", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T19:54:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steve Anthony", "comment_text": "Wow This dude is So stupid. ..I can prove every single one of these wrong and im not a flat earther... although im not a spinning globe earther either! either. .", "comment_date": "2021-09-23T18:16:11Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "The Real MAGA deal", "comment_text": "This was the most pathetic attempt to prove the earth is a globe I&#39;ve ever seen.

So in reality you are traveling in a circle and NOT in a perfectly straight line. If you dead reckon west you will inevitably end up going south. <br><br>Ships disappearing over the horizon is another fallacy. It is only a matter of perspective. You\u2019re eyes can only see so far, you cannot see indefinitely from the east coast to the Rocky Mtns. Check your weather app and it will tell you how far the visibility is in your area. I just checked my area in Southern OR and it\u2019s 10 miles. Think about it, there are all sorts of things in our atmosphere that restrict our vision such as rain, snow, mist, dust, smoke, the atmosphere itself which is most dense at ground level. However, when you see ships completely disappear beyond the horizon, that\u2019s when you can take out a high zoom camera and the entire ship, haul and all come back into view and you can even see water much further beyond the ship. <br><br>Think people think\u2026 We\u2019ve all been so thoroughly indoctrination since day one in the class room that we literally can\u2019t think straight! As for the photographs of the earth as evidence that the earth is round, this again is complete nonsense as NASA itself admits that they are composite images! They are NOT photographs! The only picture of the earth that they claim is actually a real picture is from the apollo 17 mission. I downloaded this image from NASA and now omitted it i to photoshop, turned up all the levels and low and behold there is i square box around the earth proving thus was not a genuine picture of the earth from the moon. Not only that but the earth was the same size as the moon is from the earth. This cannot be possible for they claim the earth is eight times larger than the moon. Therefore the earth should appear much larger from the surface of the moon.<br><br>The sticks and shadow trick, that also works on a flat plane just as easily. And as for time zones where it\u2019s dark on one part of the earth and light upon another, that is no absolute proof the earth is a globe either. For in the level earth model the sun is a local sun and not 93 million miles away. The way the sun\u2019s rays shine down upon the earth through the clouds at an approximate 30 degree angle indicates it\u2019s not millions of miles away from us otherwise those rays would come in much more straight and in parallel lines but they do not. In basic trigonometry, if two sides of a triangle is known you can easily calculate the distance of the third angle back to its starting point. <br><br>Next time you see the rays of the sun shining through the clouds take out your triangle and measure the degree of the angle that the sun\u2019s rays are projecting down upon the earth. Then you will have two sides of the triangle. Now it\u2019s just a matter of connecting one side of the triangle to the other.

The helio model doesnt work. The clock in Prague made over 600yrs ago when they knew more about the nature of everything than we do now. The way we began with the globe model is that was stuck in class rooms without any proof and they just accepted it as fact cuz they saw it and assumed it&#39;s the truth after some 20 generations or so quit handing down the truth. But of all thr conspiracy theories that exist I never thought I&#39;d actually find any legit evidence that would make me even consider having to put it on the table as plausible and in need of more investigation but after having seen new evidence that forces me to change my position it would be a lack of logic and rational to not reconsider once presented with a new argument or evidence that prove that something is false. But the coriolis effect is one of thr thing&#39;s the flat earth ppl have yet to explain..but they did a good job with the moon and mapping it out n it&#39;s exactly like an xray of the world which is crazy! But the clock in Prague shows exactly how it works n it makes sense. But how&#39;s that even possible how did they accurately track everything as it does 600yrs ago! There&#39;s also so much crazy history and architecture that doesn&#39;t make any sense at all..we must have had some more advanced tech than were aware of. The fact that NASA itself has a paper in a request for patent they needed to have the space shuttle &quot;work on a flat and stationary earth&quot; and what sucks is they&#39;re censoring thre chs that make compelling arguments that they can notdebunk they delete! So can&#39;t just say look it UP cuz they give ya all these bs dumb versions of it that are cartoonish and can&#39;t be taken seriously.. why bother? Who cares? What&#39;s at stake? What&#39;s really going on here. The bible even mentions it but even in Christian school they ignore those verses and claim its cuz they were ignorant of the shape.. but God wasn&#39;t? Cmon all knowing would know such things!  It may also be hollow too. The magnetic north doesnt make sense. True north . Daylight savings why? Elliptic clocks don&#39;t need it and they did fine and even accurately track all heavenly bodies sun moon date time the day length and even seasons and which days are longer and shorter Babylon time still accurate how?  How can we see through the moon? If it were solid why can we see thr sky in it as if it were transparent?  Why do we see the ship on a horizon when we zoom in? Or a city?  Or anything? Its so much easier to explain with images than text fails!  But the evidence theres enough to raise some questions good ones that can&#39;t be answered. But the flat earth leaves a lot of questions still too so it&#39;s not done yet not quite solve wish tf we would get some disclosure. NASA lies so often it&#39;s hard to trust them they&#39;ve lied so much about it all so long now. The other things that pilots agree when asked or maybe they just say that so they don&#39;t have to be bothered with a dozen questions lol. Who knows but if ur really interested in finding truth not just debunking it as I tried and failed cuz usually they are ignorant of physics or cherry pick that what support their theory and leave what doesnt out. But this time that wasn&#39;t the case!  The series was a 7 video part thing started short n they got longer but it really flew by cuz its actually interesting. I started with 2x speed cuz they do talk slow lol. But fast learned will get it quick watched a 2nd time to better answer a few questions lingering. But the series was great it&#39;s called LHFE1-7 the lost history of flat earth. Ewaron is ch. Maybe I&#39;ll drop a link cuz yt deleted their ch the day I watched it lol so u would need bitchute rumble e.t.c to find the other series whats happened on earth part 1-13. Very interesting stuff it would be good to have some more open mind&#39;s to help seek truth. Every idea&#39;s gotta be permitted how else can we know the bs apart from thr good?  W/o debate when they just say no debate and bock delete mock censore slander smear shut down ignore e.t.c its real suspect and also makes one question it more than they would have other wise!  Why not just debate it and debunk it with facts and evidence if it&#39;s such a bad idea that we can prove it? Then why don&#39;t we? Why haven&#39;t we been given not a single actual photo of earth?  The full things always a cgi composite image why?  That&#39;s not even a hidden fact they say they can&#39;t map it right on a sphere why?  But we&#39;re not asking for a map just an image! Perhaps our world is about 4x larger than were aware of!  The bible again describes this as well. Why was the book of enoch taken out?

What causes us humans to stay on earth? Gravity, what causes objects to fall from the sky towards the center of Earth? Gravity.

If we were to stand at a position farther away from earth\u2019s center, then we would experience a force of gravity weaker compared to standing at a position closer to the center. But do we experience different forces of gravity at different positions of Earth? No. How is that possible? Because the sphere is the only shape where no matter where u stand, u will pretty much be always at the same distance from the center of Earth.

But all the rest yes.<br>The \u201chabitable\u201d part of the earth is round just like the circle of the earth, which is a literal ice wall just like the Bible says in Job 38. Beyond the circle of the earth, it is squared within the Antarctica which is everything past the ice wall.  The Bible is very clear that the sun and the moon are are only tens of miles above us, and not millions of miles away.  Globalist, who state globalists, do so because they\u2019re willingly ignorant.  The video that convinced me the most was 200 reasons we do not live on a spinning ball, and the fact that the Bible reveals a one-sided level earth. Isaiah 40:22 not just describes the circle of the earth, whereupon God puts his weight by way of the solid  firmament(Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_W280R_Jt8&amp;t=37m18s\">37:18</a>), by way of the pillars of heaven(Job <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_W280R_Jt8&amp;t=26m11s\">26:11</a>), That connect to the ceiling sky above, but also the curtain ceiling, and tent walls, that come down within 2.7 miles of the Antarctica, and then go inward making a lower ceiling, until the end of the inhabit bowl part of the earth, which is connected to other tent walls again, that lead to the ground. According to Job 38, there are several obstacles that keep a person from reaching the end of the world, which is the tent wall.  Besides the pillars, the mountain tops touch the solid sky in many places, so airplanes would be a hard way to reach it.  To reach God\u2019s decreed place, which is the outer darkness, you must bring your own food, and survive the cold, and I\u2019ll let you read the rest about to the paths to the darkness thereof.  Since we believe the north pole is the center of the earth (but Israel is the center of all the lands of the earth, which is only a sidenote), The distance between the centerpoint of the north pole and the outer frozen wall, makes this called the frozen deep.  As God says the compass upon the (vertical)face of the depth, and the Face of the deep is frozen.  Deep here meaning an outward measurement, and not a downward measurement.<br>The water course of the earth, which is the natural drain of the oceans, is found at the North Pole, of which some of the waters turn into underwater rivers(Ecclesiastes), they go out, and they come back to go out again.  The only way you will know this, is to go to the old maps of the world like in Southern California, or read the stories from Spain, Portugal, England, and France about the force of the rivers that leads to the whirlpool watercourse.  There was a point of no return for all ships.  Why are they hiding God from us?

Day and night happen because the sun and moon are local and spin in a circle around the flat earth, the sun is not 93 millions miles away, you can even trace the suns rays through the clouds to show that it is much closer than we are told<br><br>8. The Coriolis Effect cannot be proven and has never been shown to exist, saying that when you shoot a gun, the bullet leaves earth and does not spin with earth doesn\u2019t make sense, that doesn\u2019t happen, how come if you through anything into the air, it doesn\u2019t fly to the south, if that were the case you should be able to feel the force pulling you south even a tiny bit, saying that you can\u2019t feel it because we are to small and also saying that the Coriolis effect is real is non sense, it can\u2019t be one or the other but according to NASA apparently it is<br><br>7. No one has ever done this, this although would work on the flat earth because if you are at the North Pole and you walk 10K Kilometers south, then walk 10K west, then walk 10K north again, you will end up in the same place because when you are walking west, you Are walking in a curved line because the North Pole is in the center of the flat earth map, you aren\u2019t walking in a triangle, your walking in a \u201cQuarter Circle\u201d shape<br><br>6. This happens because the sun is not 93 millions miles away and is in fact much much closer<br><br>5. Orion is Upside Down in Australia because  it\u2019s on the opposite side of the North Pole as the US, it\u2019s simple, it works the same in a ball Earth and a flat earth and that in no way proves the earth is a ball<br><br>4. You can still circumnavigate the earth if it is flat, if you go east or west, you\u2019ll go in a big circle and come back around, the same circle the sun goes, you can not circumnavigate by going south as you will hit the edge, this is why the Antarctic treaty was sighted and is still being signed by 52 nations making it illegal to go to the North Pole, they even have military there to make sure people do not go there, this is the oldest treaty that is still being signed, you can also find NO airplane flight paths that go past the South Pole if mapped out on a flat earth map, in fact airplane flight maps are a perfect way to prove the earth is flat, all airplane flights go in a curved shape, if mapped out on a flat earth map it makes a perfectly straight line, you can also not find any fights that go from one continent to another continent that are both below the equator, this would be impossible to do on a flat earth map unless they want to go way out of their way for no reason<br><br>3. Ships disappear due to perspective, once you see a ship disappear over the edge take a telescope, binoculars or a high power zoom camera and you can bring them back into view, there are also soooo many times where people can see stuff that should not be visible due to the earths curvature, you can see light houses across lakes and you can even look at the world records for long distance photography, this should not be possible if the earth had curvature<br><br>2. This in no way proves the earth is round, there have been many times where solar and lunar eclipses happened when the sun was still up and you can see so many times where stars are even visible through the moon, we don\u2019t even know what the moon is<br><br>1. Look up earth photos, all of them look completely different, NASA even admits that photos of the earth are photoshopped because they cannot get far enough away from the earth to take photos, there is even a video of \u201cRob Simmons\u201d from NASA Showing how they make CGI photos of earth and they openly admit they are photo shopped, look up the Blue Marble photo that ended up being the default wallpaper on the iPhone, you can see multiple cop and pasted sections of clouds and duplicated parts, that proves it\u2019s not real, you can find so many photos that have duplicated clouds and one of NASAs photos of earth clearly has the word SEX written in the clouds, I don\u2019t know why they did that, they even have a photo of Pluto and you can see they have a hidden picture of Pluto from Mickey Mouse hidden in the craters and stuff, if you go on google images and find a photo of earth and then go to the linked website and read about it, 95% of the time they admit it is a composite and NASA even stated the last photo taken of earth was taken from the Apollo missions over 50 years ago, THATS HALF A CENTURY AGO, And there is even a video that was recorded by accident showing them clearly using the window of the space ship to fake a shot of earth when they were still in low earth orbit, Neil Armstrong even kicked 2 interviewers out of his house for asking about that video during an interview, he swore at them and Neil\u2019s son even threatened to call the CIA and have them waxed and it was caught in video, that would not happen if they actually went to the moon", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T04:30:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "random gamer489", "comment_text": "plot twist we live on mars", "comment_date": "2020-12-13T10:14:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Subscribe to Jenny Tu", "comment_text": "Genesis 1:1-2 \u201cIn the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

You are a Judah and dont deserve help, recognition, or acknowledgement, :-() here:s why;...1# NASA has photos/videos showing Earth from the ISS, see Videos of astronauts space walk ot repairs, the outside ISS cameras mounted outside the ISS are pointed towards earth, ( by the way isn&#39;t rotating, let alone at a 1000mph) here&#39;s why): 2# NASA  numerous photos of earth from space all show the cameras looking at a Flat, no spinning earth,..&quot; just look at &quot; the highest free fall jump from space, Felix B.,somethimg is the jumper.. F elix starts his ascent from the CMD Post in the Nev Desert,  after 4 hours of ascending he&#39;s close to the jump point. Looking down towards earth Felix sees his cmd post&#39;s from space directly below him. and jumps, &quot; he lands ecactly where he staded. ( So a rotating eatth is debunked ). <br>3,# You say; the oceans and everything else is held in place due to the earth&#39;s gravitational pull. :-()  But then i say; &quot; if the earth is spinning at a 1000mph with a G Force powerful enough to whole all oceans in place? :-() if these g-forces are that powerful , :-() then Everything on earth would be Held in place by the gravitational pull that is holding the waters in place on a globe that is upside down the closer you get to the South Pole. If you put a stick through the middle of a Ball-globe  and make it stational on its axis, half the globe would be in a Upside Down position. And no way can something fixed in a upside down south pole position, turn itself Rightside up, period. So how does every point-place on a fixed earth  able to be in a Upright position?  People would be rhe same as the Hands on a Clock. 4# how is a plane flying in a horizonal motion, connect with any point on the globe in it&#39;s same Upright position? Impossible. Horizonal flying cant meet up with a round earth, you try it, 5# You say science has figured out the exact points of the earth:s curvature, THATS A BUNCH OF SUBLIMINAL SUGGESTIONS. .. Millions of people fly to every part of our earth, and have Never looked out a plane&#39;s window and saw a curvature. I have flown from Cali to Europe enough times, and looking out the plane window all anyone will see is a horizonal flat earth beneath them, you saying you have pin pointed the exact locations of earth&#39;s curves, :-( Then how could it be missed by millions of passengers flying for the pass 200 years, ? Your calculations exist only in your head. If not  then give the long/lat positions of earth&#39;s curves.. 6# Then you claim that the curvature is at the last point where a ship disappears from eue sight? That to is false. Me and a buddy flew our drones to the point where the ship vanished, but the closer we came to that point where ships sink the ship came right back into view, our eyes and distance play tricks on our seeing things. Try it yourself, fly your dome towards where the ship   vanished. The closer you get to a ship the bigger it shows,  if not then the world would have spotted the curve too. And speaking of boats, how do a ship sail  around a globe and not end up upside down at rhe earths South Pole? That&#39;s shyt you find in Harry Potter movies. You said the earth spins on its axis which means the bottom of the globe, south pole, would forever be the bottom upside down  position. So how are boats and planes maintaining their horizobal positions going around a globe? Show me, dont tell me, thats only a one minute explaination, u just have to guide the plane around the circumference of the globe and keep it in a rightside up position . We trust people with Titles and shut our minds down against what our common sense says is impossibe. All of us flat earthers just want to see a Image explaining how a ship or plane gets to the south  pole rightside up, easy peezy for you to draw right? Smh. U have over half the world believing in the impossible, which makes them mindless becuz they trust what you tell them, :-( and that is the coldest mind game to play on anyone.

Apollo 15 had to orbit the round global earth before heading to the moon.<br><br>JAMES IRWIN&#39;S TESTIMONY<br><br>   Jim [James Irwin] felt God\u2019s love and presence in a powerful way out there.  Though separated from home by 215,000 miles, he sensed a nearness and presence of God that he never anticipated.  Some other Apollo astronauts also had spiritual experiences during their missions, but Irwin knew the God of the Bible personally.  In the midst of their hectic schedule, he had time to briefly quote his favorite Bible verse, Psalm 121:1, I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help.  It was particularly fitting against the massive hills of the Apennine Mountains and canyons of Hadley Rille, but we must hasten to verse 2, which gives the answer to the question: My help cometh from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.  Graciously deferring to the hard-working ground crew back on Earth, Jim appended, \u201cbut of course we get quite a bit from Houston, too.\u201d  Several times when problems arose deploying experiments, he prayed for help.  Almost immediately, ideas would come to mind that worked.  He describes some of these moments:<br>It was almost like a revelation.  God was telling me what to do.  I never asked Houston because I knew there would be a delay.  I didn\u2019t have time for Houston to get an answer to me; I needed an immediate answer.  I could see several logical ways to go about solving these mechanical problems, but I wanted to know the best way.  I prayed, and immediately I knew the answer.  I am not talking about some vague sense of direction.  There was this supernatural sensation of His presence.  If I needed Him I could call on Him, call on His power.  (To Rule the Night,p. 19)<br>He describes the sensation of looking up at home:<br>In the three days of exploration, there were a couple of times when I actually looked up to see the earth\u2014and it was a difficult maneuver in that bulky suit; you had to grab onto something to hold yourself steady and then lean back as far as you could.  That beautiful, warm living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart.  Seeing this has to change a man, has to make a man appreciate the creation of God and the love of God.

The flat earth theory also explains why day and night occur. <br>8. I saw somewhere on the internet that this has been debunked.<br>7. What???? <br>6. It seems to me I would have to know several things. The elevation of both sticks (one may be on a mountain and the other a valley), and the position of the sun to the sticks (otherwise one shadow could be cast more south and the other more east) and the distance of the sun from each stick. It&#39;s not at all clear that this experiment could be performed.<br>5. You gloss over this one too quickly. I do however think that this has some substance to it because I have seen this explained to the point that I was a little closer to agreeing.<br>4. I have a globe earth and a flat earth map. I did this exact experiment using my finger as the ship. You will probably be disappointed to learn that using this method I &quot;proved&quot; that the earth is flat and round.

Objects do disappear bottom first, different amounts under different weather conditions. The changes in air temperature will affect the up curving arch of light. The arch of light closest to the bottom of the object will hit the flat surface first as you go farther away and the arch of light closest to the top of the object will hit the flat surface last as you go farther away. Greater elevation has more ground clearance for the arch of light to not be obstructed by the flat floor. &quot;If the Earth were flat&quot; that is asserting something without science, you cannot manipulate the Earth so you don&#39;t know what would be the case &quot;If the Earth were spherical&quot; or &quot;If the Earth were flat&quot; or &quot;If the Earth were concave&quot; <a href=\"https://imgur.com/aUtqGyq\">https://imgur.com/aUtqGyq</a><br>2.

All other planets are round, therefore the Earth should be round.<br><br>That is not a true argument. You cannot look to the sky to determine the shape of the Earth beneath your feet. Nobody would determine the dimensions of the floor of a house by looking up at the light fixtures. <br><br>#9. Timezones. It&#39;s always day somewhere and always night somewhere. <br><br>Yes the sun&#39;s observable movement across the sky determines when it is day and when it is night. Again this is not a true argument and does not prove the dimensions of the Earth beneath your feet.<br><br>#8. Coriolis Effect. <br><br>The Coriolis effect is said to cause sinks and toilet bowl water to spin in different directions based on your position on Earth due to Earth&#39;s alleged movement. However this has been proven false due to the fact the sinks and toilet bowls have been found to spin in opposite directions within the same house. The motion of the water is dependent on the entry of the water, shape of the bowl or basin etc..The Coriolis effect does not exist. <br><br>#7. Triangles.<br><br>This CAN be achieved on a flat surface.<br><br>#6. Shadows<br><br>Shadow&#39;s do not prove the Earth has curvature. It must be first assumed that the Earth is a Globe to begin with. If you however use a local sun on a Flat Earth the shadow&#39;s would still remain the same. I.E it literally proves nothing.<br><br>#5. Stars<br><br>The stars appear different on &quot;different&quot; parts of the Earth. Yes you are viewing them from different positions on Earth. It doesn&#39;t prove the Earth is a Globe.<br><br>#4. Circumnavigation.<br><br>This can be done on a Flat Surface. East to West in reality is merely a circle. However North to South and back to North has never been achieved. This would be proof the Earth is a Globe, something that is lacking.<br><br>#3. Horizons<br><br>The horizon changes based on the strength of your instruments and your height above the Earth. The human eye see&#39;s everything in pyramid shape. So when standing at the end of a long hall way everything appears to shrink in the distance, the floor appears to rise, the ceiling appears to come down and meet at a point. The same is true with the horizon. It is simply perspective and the way the human eye works, you can never see the whole Earth because our eye sight is not infinite. <br><br>#2. Lunar Eclipse<br><br>Lunar eclipses have occurred while both sun and moon are visible above the horizon. Therefore the object eclipsing the moon is not the Earth. The has been recorded numerous times and all we get is an explanation for why this occurs. However the explanation is simply that, it&#39;s an explanation attempting to explain away common sense perspective and maintain the status quo. I.E Earth is still a ball with 0 proof. Merely explanations and interpretations of phenomena.<br><br>#1. Photographic Evidence.<br><br>It is photo-shop, but it has to be. Admitted by NASA themselves. Composite images stitched together to form a picture. A picture doesn&#39;t prove the ground beneath our feet is curved. Just 100&#39;s of years of TV brainwashing propaganda from schools, education, and society being drilled with the concept of the Globular Earth.<br><br>The real truth is the Earth is a level plane. Water proves this because water is always level. Flat Water = Flat Earth. Earth is a container of water which must always be contained. Therefore the seas and oceans are contained, because that is the natural property of water. We have been bamboozled and hypnotized into this Globe nonsense. This was not the fault of our teachers, or professors, or educators. They were also fooled into this propaganda. We must realize that our world is an amazing place that harbors life, consciousness, complex life forms and organism. Earth is unlike anything else in the universe. It is the single most important thing in existence. We&#39;ve been dumbed down and misled for centuries by the powers-that-be for alterior motives. <br><br>If you want to learn more about the Earth and about the world we live in I recommend visiting channels like Eric Dubay, Beyond the Imaginary Curve and more. Websites such as <a href=\"http://thenarrowgateweb.com/\">thenarrowgateweb.com</a> are great for starters. You can learn so much more and remove yourself from this matrix. Locked away in urban cities instead of free and exploring the world. We&#39;ve believed that it&#39;s all been discovered and they have killed our desire for exploration. The world might just be a whole lot bigger than we know and full exploration of Earth is what is needed. We are prisoners who are documented and kept under surveillance at all times. We cannot roam freely throughout the world but must get approval from our masters &quot;governments&quot; that rule over us.<br><br>If we step out of line and revolt, we get put in prison by those still under it&#39;s hypnosis. All to maintain this system of slavery that has us in chains. I will not stop until the truth reaches the masses and until this system is eradicated. We the people will rise up together and destroy this indoctrination system flooded with lies. The Internet is there worst enemy because here we can freely and collectively share our mind and remove this idiotic nonsense called Government. They legally steal from the people and provide very little services. They need to be removed, if not with peace then with violence and massive blood shed.<br><br>It is a challenge that we must face. Our children will carry the torch. We must not be silent, we must not fall asleep once again into this matrix system. The truth will live on and our lives will have counted. Peace to all my brothers and sisters who support the truth, free and open minded individuals capable of entertaining a thought without having to accept it. <br><br>Research Flat Earth honestly and openly, and ignore the clowns/trolls because they are everywhere trying to persuade you otherwise.", "comment_date": "2019-04-03T23:33:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tank Simmons", "comment_text": "#1 \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T08:43:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tank Simmons", "comment_text": "#7 \ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2019-04-02T08:42:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SuperThirst", "comment_text": "If ANY of this makes sense to you then you really havent studied light refraction, or how you can zoom into the horizon and pull distant objects back into view.

Time zones don&#39;t prove a spinning ball earth, the gif I sent demonstrates how it would be possible for it to be day and night on a plane<br>3. Airplanes that fly north and south do not adjust their flight paths to account for any coriolis effect, Eg. Assuming a heliocentric model with the earth travelling at more than 1000mph at the equator, the coriolis effect would cause a plane flying from buffalo, New York to Miami, Florida to fly off course in a westerly direction due to the supposed spin of the ball earth as the airplane approaches the wider circumference of the earth at the latitude of miami, Florida, yet in reality the flight arrives in Miami on time and without the pilot having to adjust for any coriolis effect due to the rotating of ball earth<br>4. &quot;If you walk 10,000 km straight along the earth&#39;s surface, turn 90 degrees and walk 10,000 km more...&quot; That&#39;s observable and repeatable...<br>5. The premise of measure the sunlight with a stick and a shadow to calculate the earth&#39;s curvature is based on the assumption that the earth is a ball, and that&#39;s what the different shadows prove. yes there are different shadow lengths, but to conclude that because these shadows are different lengths that necessitates that the earth is a spinning ball, also that experiment is reliant on parallel sunrays hitting the earth, when crespular rays show the sunlight not to fall parallel to the earth<br>6. The stars are different depending where you are on the earth, therefore it&#39;s a spinning ball?<br>7. Someone went in a circle round the earth, therefore it is a globe? With reference to that gif also, someone could go round the outside of those continents and perceive themselves to circumnavigate a globe, when in fact they have just gone in a circle around a flat plane<br>8. Boats don&#39;t disappear over a curved of the earth horizon, you can bring them back into view with a decent camera like a Nikon P900. Also on a flat surface like a basketball court if you placed a camera on the ground and walked away from it, your legs would appear to disappear over the &quot;curvature&quot; of the flat basketball court, but of course it was just beyond the line of sight of the camera. As well there any many things that we can see over the alleged curvature of the earth that we shouldn&#39;t be able to see if the earth is a globe of 25000 miles in circumference.<br>9. &quot;During a lunar eclipse, the shadow of the earth is curved&quot;, providing nothing but assumption that the earth cast a shadow on the moon. If I stated, &#39;during a day there are clouds going over the flat earth&#39; as an argument to prove, I am sure you would utterly reject it, as it is preceding from conclusion and making the evidence fit the conclusion, rather than preceding with inquiry of the evidence and from that reaching the conclusion.<br>10. &quot;We know the earth is round because we have photographic evidence&quot;. Although all but one piece of &quot;photographic evidence&quot; at the time of 1972 were admitted to be composites, compiled together from &quot;low earth orbit satellite photograph data&quot; that were stitched together. Rob Simmon created a composite image of the ball earth known as the &#39;blue marble&#39;, which was positioned to the general public as an actual photograph. In discussing this process he explains how he takes the data from these other photographs and in photoshop he input the clouds, and the atmosphere and all these different layers, and he said &quot;it looked kinda flat, I just ended up hitting ctrl+z a lot&quot; and &quot;it is photoshopped, but it... It has to be&quot;. On the topic of the alleged photograph of ball earth, there is video footage from Apollo 11 of them faking the picture of the earth &quot;halfway to the moon&quot; by turning out all the lights in their cabin, pointing the camera at the cabin window from the back of the cabin and filling the window with the earth, with a piece of cardboard inserted that they were pretending to be the terminator line of the globe. This was staged and positioned as if it was a photograph taken from the camera pressed up against the window looking down on ball earth. <br><br>Research flat earth", "comment_date": "2019-01-28T00:11:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "wjsig1", "comment_text": "the lunar eclipse is the only tough one for me. the other nine were childish arguments, all are explainable on flat earth.", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T21:15:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "consciousnick -", "comment_text": "But my pastor needs my money.", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T13:57:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RYU", "comment_text": "Photographic evidence is a bad joke :))", "comment_date": "2019-01-27T00:23:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Matesz", "comment_text": "There are 0 proves in this video.

This seems to be a consistent problem with videos like this, since they really don\u2019t seem to understand the belief system of their intended audience. I would love to see more content providers aware of this so they could do a better job of shutting flat-earthers up. \r<br>\r<br>Anything involving celestial bodies is immediately thrown out the window since the disk-shaped earth is apparently covered by a holographic dome projecting images of what fits the globular earth narrative. So arguments #10, 9, 6, 5, and 2 can be immediately thrown out. When trying to convince these people, you simply cannot depend on what can be seen in the sky, even with their own eyes.\r<br>\r<br>Argument #1, lol don\u2019t you know NASA is trying to deceive you into thinking the Earth is round for some still unclear and poorly articulated reason? You can\u2019t trust anything they say. All of the photographs they make publically available are obviously Photoshopped.\r<br>\r<br>Arguments #7 and 4 would be extremely difficult to replicate. First, you can\u2019t expect people who think the Earth is flat to be able to afford trips like this in general. Very few people, even fairly wealthy individuals trying to prove a globular Earth, have the free time or motivation to undertake these travels over vast distances themselves. How many people do you know can just travel around the world in one direction over the weekend to prove it\u2019s round, or are willing to drive 10,000km in one direction, then 10,000km in another direction, and 10,000km in another direction to prove the triangle principle you mentioned? Not very many, I\u2019d bet. With these flat-earth people, you have to introduce concepts that are easy for them to replicate themselves without substantial critical thinking skills and without too much time or money being invested.\r<br>\r<br>So now we get to the decent arguments you mentioned, because they can be personally repeated by these people in question. Argument #8 about the Coriolis Effect is pretty good, except you\u2019d probably need to provide a more in-depth explanation about this and break it down so more people understand exactly why it happens. Argument #6 is also pretty good, you just need to encourage them to find a trusted friend/family member in another state so they can (hopefully) use this simple equation to calculate the Earth\u2019s curvature themselves. Hopefully they don\u2019t think NASA hacked this person as well. #3 is also good except that they\u2019ll complain that these timelapse videos available on the internet look \u201cfake.\u201d Stress the lying down and quickly standing up during the sunrise fact more and you will probably convince more people.\r<br>\r<br>So the bottom line is focus less on external parties who have the knowledge and means to look outwards into the universe, and focus more on inexplicable skeptics who need a way to prove it to themselves without spending their own money if you want to drive this point home to people who don\u2019t already believe it.", "comment_date": "2018-12-07T08:02:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Z3N PRXS", "comment_text": "Asking a flat eather to find the edge is like asking a ball eather to find the curve.

In the early days of transatlantic voyages, one needed to keep track of one&#39;s latitude and longitude. The former is easy: just measure the altitude of the north star. The latter, longitude, ain&#39;t so easy. The stars move from east to west across the sky as time goes on. They also move if you travel east or west a significant distance. Now, when you&#39;re in the middle of the Atlantic (or any other ocean), you can compare the current stars&#39; positions with what they were when you left shore. And they will have moved both due to the earth&#39;s rotation and to your travels. But what you see is the sum of the two. How to disentangle them? Use a chronometer. That will tell you how much the stars move due to the passage of time (amount of earth&#39;s rotation). Subtract that from your observations and you end up with how much the stars have moved solely due to your travels! This was why there was a competition for people to come up with increasingly accurate chronometers. ALL THIS ONLY WORKS IF THE EARTH IS ROUND, WHICH IT IS, WHICH IS WHY IT WORKS.

All they need to do, in order to prove to themselves that their theory is wrong, is to travel around the globe in either an Easterly or Westerly direction,  by boat, on foot or by air, whilst adjusting their wristwatch to local time as they arrive at successive countries, until they return to their starting point, whereupon they will find that the date on their wristwatch will be one day ahead or behind the calendar at their origin. The only logical explanation for this apparent phenomenon is that they have travelled all the way around a rotating sphere. They could double check that by setting off in any direction and follow a straight line for 10,000 kilometres, then turn 90\u00b0 left or right, then travel along that path for exactly 10,000 kilometres, and next make another 90\u00b0 turn in the same left or right direction as before, then finally travel for another 10,000 kilometres in a straight lin. At the end of that 30,000 kilometre journey they will be back at their starting point. The only sane explanation for this is that they will have travelled around the surface of a 40,000 kilometre sphere. No shape other than a sphere would yield that result. Try it with a ball; draw three consecutive straight lines, each  \u00bc of the diameter of the ball in length, and all at right angles to each other, turning to the right each time, and you will be back at the starting point on that ball. Now try to do the same thing with any other geometric shape, and also on a flat sheet of paper (like a flat earth), and the finish point will not be the starting point. For a flat earth, the beginning and end of the 30,000 kilometre journey will be 10,000 kilometres apart.", "comment_date": "2018-05-19T01:09:54Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Ljice Vatepri", "comment_text": "I accept everything he said , except the photographic evidence , i believe earth is in a ball forme , i dont believe in the moonlanding", "comment_date": "2018-05-12T21:35:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Edwards", "comment_text": "ill give you all a bit of a hint water always levels its self out.", "comment_date": "2018-05-08T03:24:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Edwards", "comment_text": "how earth does not run on gravity at all it runs on electromagnetism you all know nothing more then you are all told.", "comment_date": "2018-05-08T03:23:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Edwards", "comment_text": "study more about water and the ball earth rotating thousands   of miles an hour in space with fake gravity holing it all together when you know  what water behaves like and how heavy all the oceans of the earth are you know often what the modern world thinks is real is not and what how race new once is. modern mankind is fare more stupid then the parst.", "comment_date": "2018-05-08T03:21:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Edwards", "comment_text": "all of you are fools and this person doing the vid as well its no wonder the Illuminati can control you all so well.", "comment_date": "2018-05-08T03:11:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "stefano dova", "comment_text": "all bullshits if earth is round why the streets are not round", "comment_date": "2018-05-07T18:17:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ilan Wallace", "comment_text": "yep.<br>pics and it <b>still</b> didn&#39;t happen", "comment_date": "2018-05-01T22:09:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Riko Green", "comment_text": "19 billion dollars a year and NASA can&#39;t provide one 4k video proving the earth is round by flying away from earth showing the curvature.", "comment_date": "2018-04-25T18:35:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TRU MAN", "comment_text": "Flat earth proof <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zczK51l9w6Y\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zczK51l9w6Y</a>", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T10:04:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The MP", "comment_text": "@minutephysics ... i belive you should remove this mass of spamming posts of ignorance this guy makes here", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T09:59:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TRU MAN", "comment_text": "DARREN NESBIT FLAT EARTH ,A NEW HORIZON. <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UuW9CqhBdE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UuW9CqhBdE</a>", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T09:55:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TRU MAN", "comment_text": "Ice halo caused by glass sky<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywQXoSKKLPQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywQXoSKKLPQ</a>", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T09:51:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TRU MAN", "comment_text": "&quot;Meteor&quot; hits outside of firmament. <br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMSHXqbHUos&amp;t=10s\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMSHXqbHUos&amp;t=10s</a>", "comment_date": "2018-04-23T09:47:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TRU MAN", "comment_text": "Polaris proves flat earth.

Planets - assert that here are no planets, only wandering stars; don&#39;t offer any explanation as to why/how they wander. Also point out that no space probes have landed on any so-called planet and that, of course, all photographs of planets are NASA fakes.<br><br>9. Time Zones - Best ignored, but if pushed explain how the sun works like a spotlight and that is how it is daylight in some places and dark in others. If some smart-arse glober points out that the spot light only seems to light about a sixth of the earth at once, whereas in reality half the earth is lit and half dark, trot out some or all of the mantras of last resort (see below). If they don&#39;t go away, abuse them and break off the discussion.<br><br>8. Coriolis Effect - post a link to a flat earth video that shows a cascade type flush toilet or a sink with the tap on and to one side so that the water doesn&#39;t swirl in the direction it should according to the Coriolis effect. Ignore the stuff about ballistics and meteorology. If pushed, assert that, like gravity, the Coriolis Effect doesn&#39;t exist.<br><br>7. Triangles - never ever use maths to prove the earth is flat, except the 8 inches per mile squared curvature formula which nothing on earth conforms to and which thus proves there is no curve. When globers use maths claim that they have got their sums wrong and that, anyway, you can&#39;t trust maths , you should only trust common sense and the evidence of your own eyes<br><br>6. Sun lower in the sky as you move away from the equator - just ignore this; you&#39;ve never been out of your back yard so you have no reason to believe that this is true.<br><br>5. Inversion of constellations/moon in southern hemisphere - post links to videos by Eric Dubay, P-Brane, etc. that offer flat earth explanations of this. In fact different videos offer different explanations: perspective, reflection from the dome, crepuscular rays, a spinning moon disc. You don&#39;t understand any of them, but your common sense tells you they are right, all of them.<br><br>4. Circumnavigation - point out that east-west circumnavigation is possible on the flat earth; assert that no north-south circumnavigation has ever happened. If a glober posts links to articles about north-south circumnavigations that have in fact happened, ignore them and repeat the mantras of last resort (see below)<br><br>3. Horizon - assert that the horizon always rises to eye level and would not do so on a globe earth. Also claim that it is all down to persepective and that anything which appears to have disappeared over the horizon can be brought back into view with a telescope. If challenged, repeat the mantras of last resort.<br><br>2. Lunar Eclipse - explain how the shadow on the moon cannot be the earth and that eclipses are in fact caused by a simultaneously invisible and opaque body that just occasionally obscures our view of the moon or sun and the rest of the time is, er, somewhere....<br><br>1. Photos of the globe<br>Photographs showing curvature are shot with fish-eye lenses; photographs showing the whole globe are all NASA fakes, whether taken by NASA or not.<br><br><br>THE MANTRAS OF LAST RESORT<br>If the argument is going badly then, whatever the subject of the discussion, reply with one, or preferably all of the following, type in CAPITALS of course:<br>(altogether now....)<br>WATER FINDS ITS LEVEL<br>YOU CAN&#39;T STICK WATER TO A SPINNING BALL<br>GRAVITY IS ONLY A THEORY, IT DOESN&#39;T EXIST.<br><br>Simples....", "comment_date": "2017-11-28T19:17:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "GodsGrace", "comment_text": "As Christians we should be awake to Satan&#39;s flat earth psy-op deception to marginalize us.

All of the stars and planets we have ever seen are round- there&#39;s no reason to indicate that the earth should be any different.<br><br><br>Great observation! They DO appear to be round. Round=Circular. The sun and moon are round, circular disks. The stars and planets appear to be round circular lights. Thus, the earth must be round shaped as well. And, it is. The flat earth map depicts an accurate, ROUND, circular disk of earth, with Antarctica surrounding everything. It&#39;s like a plate, and a plate is ROUND.\u00a0How in hell is this observation used as proof that earth is a sphere? It should be used to prove that the earth is circular, but of course that would be crazy talk! <br><b>Raising eyebrows</b><br><br><br>9. Times zones: Day and night happen at different times, at different places on earth. It&#39;s always day somewhere,and night somewhere else.\u00a0<br><br><br>No shit day and night happen at different times and places on earth. The sun and moon make their rounds like clockwork over earth, the land passing below sun being daytime and the land passing below moon being nighttime. BUT, sometimes, the sun and moon will be visible in the same sky. In the north pole, the sun doesn&#39;t set in the winter, and the sun doesn&#39;t rise at all in the Summer. It doesn&#39;t make sense on the spinning globe theory, but perfect sense on the flat earth theory. Think I&#39;m full of shit? Look up &quot;sun doesn&#39;t set flat earth&quot; and &quot;flat earth sun and moon seasons and cycles&quot;, for starters <br><br><br>8. Coriolis effect states that freely moving things (hurricanes, cannon balls, ect) will deflect to the right because of rotation of Earth.. North of equator deflects right ,south of equator deflects left.\u00a0<br><br><br>Its weather phenomena and has to do with the magnetism of the sun, moon and tides. The key to the Coriolis effect lies in the Earth&#39;s rotation. Considering there&#39;s irrefutable evidence that proves Earth as being flat and motionless, it&#39;s easy to dismiss the so called &quot;effect&quot; No rotation, no Coriolis affect. No rotation, no gravity. <br><br>7. Triangle test-walking, turning, walking and turning to create a perfect right triangle... is impossible on a flat surface.\u00a0<br><br>Wrong. I can draw the triangle image on a flat piece of paper, and any person can duplicate the triangle on a flat surface. Ridiculous statement, come on now.\u00a0<br><br>6. Sun sets lower in sky as you drive away from equator. Measure curvature using sticks and shadows at different locations.\u00a0<br><br><br>The sun sets lower and lower in sky because your following it&#39;s path in the sky. Its always gonna appear to be setting. And the shadow test doesn&#39;t measure curvature. It measures the distance the sun has travelled after passing directly overhead of observer. The further the sun is, the more angled the shadow will be. This is actually a flat earth proof. Look up &quot;flat earth time zones and shadow experiment&quot;. <br><br>5. constellation upside down on various places on earth.\u00a0<br><br><br>The stars and planets circle us. Like a babies lullaby toy dangling above it face in a crib. It rotates. For an observer on one side of earth, Orion&#39;s belt will be upright. As the stars continue to move in a clock wise circle above earth, what was upright to the first observer would appear upside down to the observer on the other farther side of the earth. Simple really.<br><br><br>4.Circumnavigation proves a globe.<br><br><br>Actually, one can easily circumnavigate the world on a flat earth. Look at a flat each map, and trace your finger in a circle around the lumps of land, keeping your finger in the shaded blue of ocean. Possible! Circumnavigation DOES NOT prove the earth is a globe.\u00a0<br><br><br>3.Ships disappear over the horizon, thus proving a curve.<br><br><br>It&#39;s called the law of perspective. The farther an objects gets from the observer, the smaller the object becomes before disappearing from sight. You can watch a ship disappear over the horizon, yes. But if you grabbed binoculars and looked, you would see it come back into focus. Let it disappear over the curve again, and grab a telescope. It&#39;s comes back into sight! The curve is an illusion to the naked eye. The horizon is the vanishing point.\u00a0<br><br><br>2. lunar eclipse-the black shadow is round and must be the earth.<br><br><br>This is a phenomoma that isn&#39;t fully understood yet. It&#39;s NOT the moon eclipsing the sun, for there have been numerous documented occasions in which the moon was seen in the sky during an eclipse. And models attempting to show how the eclipse happens either show the earth spinning in wrong direction, or the Moon orbiting the earth at break neck speeds. Look it up.\u00a0<br><br><br>1. Photos of earth\u00a0<br><br>There is not a single REAL picture of earth. Anywhere. NASA admits this and says earth &quot;has to be photo shopped&quot;.For some reason, nobody has been able to take a picture or video... not even through the space station with a smart phone! We supposedly have pictures of galaxies and planets, but not a single video or photo of earth. Seeing is believing right?!?! But even if we could take a picture, it would be a blurry spinning ball right? Picture a marble spinning super fast. That&#39;s what a real picture of a spinning globe earth would look like!\u00a0<br><br>You have to look up flat earth proofs and not click in the first &quot;flat earth debunked&quot; videos you see. Give it a real chance, then decide. <br><br>Top proven facts:<br> Look up &quot;flat earth and...<br>- clouds behind the sun/moon, airplane routes (zig zagging all over globe?!) law of perspective (ships over horizon), sun rays, angles and time zones, and measuring the temperature of sun light AND moon light.<br><br> &quot;29 proofs the earth&#39;s flat&quot; or &quot;Eric Dubay flat earth proof&quot;.

For example Orion is upside\u2012down if you\u2019re in Australia.\u201c<br>     Again, only [A] is reached.<br> <br>[4]  \u201cFerdinand Magellan, and many people afterwards, circumnavigated the Earth.  That means he left headed west, continued going west, and came back to where he started, still going west.  Actually Magellan was dead, but one of his ships led by Juan Sebastian Elcano, finished the journey.  If you head west and circumnavigate the Earth yourself you\u2019ll be able to tell because you\u2019ll observe one fewer sunrise than everyone who stays at home.\u201d<br>     Again, only [A] is reached.  Any such journey may be shown to operate satisfactorily within many models (a model is a speculative conjecture, a DEDUCTION, a HYPO\u2012THESIS, or a THESIS), depending upon how far along the sequence of science one has gone to derive it.  As far as I can tell neither round nor flat models have went past that of speculative conjecture.  Additionally, the term circumnavigate is misused presumptorily, \u201ccircum\u201d being suggestive of a there existing a circumference.  This is merely part of the magic act known as pseudo\u2012science.<br> <br>[3]  \u201cThe horizon: Ships on the ocean or tall Chicago building viewed over Lake Michigan disappear bottom first.  And, you can watch the sunset twice if you watch it lying down and then quickly stand up.  The simple fact is, if the Earth were flat, there wouldn\u2019t be a horizon beyond which things disappear.  So, from across Lake Michigan you\u2019d be able to see all of Chicago, as well as the Rocky Mountains.\u201d<br>     Only [C] is reached, thereafter disaffirmed and refuted by means of mere magnification, whereby objects repeatedly reappear when they could not were Earth round.  In addition the video\u2019s author err by stating as fact that were Earth flat the Rocky Mountains may be seen.  Particulates, water molecules, etc. prevent the appearance of objects a thousand miles in the distance when adequately magnified.<br> <br>[2]  \u201cDuring a lunar eclipse, the shadow of the Earth on the moon is curved.\u201d<br>     Again, only [C] is reached, as neither the curved darkness being a shadow, nor it being created by Earth, nor that Earth is in\u2012fact round, have been verifiably\u2012demonstrated.  Such assertion comes from circular logic, a simple fallacy.<br> <br>[1]  \u201cWe have photographic evidence.\u201d<br>     Here, not even [A] is reached.  While photographs are observations, skipping [A~D] is disallowed, photographs represent only one of a gathering of all available events, FACTs, and observations, explicitness for no photograph has been provided for, nor has any one photograph been verified.  Thus such photographs remain as unverified observations, and may not be admitted as evidence.<br> <br>Summary of [10~1]:  As a group it is possible they could reach [C], but still have a long way to go to reach [L].  The evidence provided for in this video gives us only reason to doubt knowing Earth is round.  Not one DEDUCTION was generated or verified EMPIRICALLY.  No data or information was gathered or ensured as explicit.  A group of verified DEDUCTIONs and a group of explicit data and information must be gathered before even a HYPO\u2012THESIS may be developed, much less verified EMPIRICALLY via often lengthy and complex experimentation.

As any geometry student can tell you, this is impossible on a flat surface.\u201d<br>     Authors omit this triangle is possible only when each leg traverses exactly 1/4 of a circumference.  Author omit that such an experiment has never been done.  Authors omit that nowhere on Earth is it possible to walk this route.  Authors omit that such an experiment may not be verifiable.  Authors omit that such triangles are also achievable on a sphere\u2019s interior, as well as upon the exterior and interior of other non\u2012spherical shapes, such as pyramidal\u2012ovoids.  I could go on, but suffice to say that not even [A] is reached.<br> <br>[6]  \u201cThe sun, in general, gets lower and lower in the sky as you travel away from the equator.  And, you can use this to directly measure the Earth\u2019s curvature.  Pick 2 places a few hundred miles directly north and south of each other, and at noon measure the shadows cast by a meter stick at each location.  You can use the shadow lengths to figure out the angle between the sticks.  And, once you find out how far apart they are, you can calculate the Earth\u2019s curvature.\u201d<br>     Only [A] is reached, after which the presumption is made that such phenomena must be due to Earth having spherical curvature.  At [B] any number and degree of substantiated suppositions could be derived and gathered, from which conjectures of many shapes other than a sphere could be reasonably speculated upon.  For instance such shadows are just as mathematically\u2012conceivable upon a flat\u2012Earth as they are upon a spherical Earth.", "comment_date": "2017-08-20T06:15:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Super Malario", "comment_text": "pathetic", "comment_date": "2017-08-19T13:03:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Markvs Black", "comment_text": "Cancer.

Because you kan see circular lights above you does not mean the ground is curved. A basketball court is not curved because the ball and the rim is round. Total abuse of logic. Also all the pictures used are made from CGI. The planets dont look like that through a telescope. They are much more transparent av wave as if they are under water. <br>9. This is just as possible on a Flat Earth if the sun is close and moves across the Earth. This does not prove the curve of the earth what so ever. The sun does not fade evenly on the horizon as it would if it was far away, however its light fades like a local lightsource like a city etc with the light being last to disappear in the middle. The terminatorline of the suns light on the earth is what im talking about here. <br>8. Coriolis effect is proven false all the time. This is a made up force and sports stadiums and golf courses across the world are not known for their different &quot;pull&quot; on the ball. Also snipers do NOT have to take the direction of the shot into account. Complete lie. Airys Failure experiment proves that the earth is stationary.<br>7. Ehh WHAT??? <br>6. Ehh what again? This only work if u assume the sun to be as far away as they say it is. Also this does not prove the ground is curved. The shadow experiment is ridiculous because for it to work you have to assume the sun is at a certain distance. Wich it is not. Also Erastosenes did not factor in Refraction of light. So in short he assumed the earth was curved instead of there being a slight curve to the light.<br>5. Has nothing to do with if the ground is actually curved. You have to assume that the solarsystem model is correct for this to have any bearing on the subject, and it is not. <br>4. If you travel East to west on a disk where the north is in the middle you&#39;re going in a circle on that disk. This seriously should not be hard to understand. <br>3. Why this happens is unkown but it does not prove the ground to be curved. Especially when you consider that you can see MUCH further in many places than should be possible with the globe math. Also With better optics you can still see things that had vanished behind the so called curve. Also when measured with lasers etc. no curve is detected. Also things to consider are perspective and refrafction(that light bends in any medium it travel through)  <br>2. How do you prove that it is the shadow of the Earth? A flat piece of paper casting a shadow on a football etc will have a curved shadow on the ball so what this is proving is beyond me.<br>1. The pictures from NASA are fakes. If you believe they made it 250 000 km into space, landed and came back in a tweakers shelter made with tin foil and tape long before they had any good computers your are an optimist indeed. Also they have NEVER returned to the moon, built a base or anything that can be easily documented. They are lying to you.

There is an absence of logic here. I&#39;m hoping that some of you will wake up soon and realize it. Everything we&#39;ve been taught was designed to make us believe these things are true. Forget what you&#39;ve been taught in school for just a moment and use your own brain to make your own deductions. Do your own experiments without any regard to what you&#39;ve been taught. Treat it like a human being would have treated it before they had people teaching these things and calling them facts. If you can do this and you really give it an honest chance, you are going to be very surprised at what you&#39;re going to find.  I&#39;m not here to offend anybody, pass judgment, or portray that I know more than anyone else here. I am simply speaking to those who God intended to receive this message from me. It&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t believe in God. You can been Atheist, a Scientologist, Catholic, Pagan, or a Christian... Whatever you believe is no matter. The truth is still the truth, whether you believe it, or not. Most people don&#39;t want to hear the truth if it doesn&#39;t line up with their own ideals. That&#39;s simply our ego getting in the way. None of us here know everything, I certainly don&#39;t.  One thing I do know is that the more that I look into these things the more these things they&#39;ve been teaching us throughout history have not been adding up.  On top of that, there are a great deal of what most would call &#39;coincidences&#39; involved. After you run into so many of these coincidences, they start to become pretty predictable. That tells me that it&#39;s no coincidence and in fact, there is no such thing. These things that I&#39;ve uncovered over the past several months of research have been pretty extraordinary, to say the least. It doesn&#39;t take long before you start to see all this nonsense around us that we&#39;ve been taught is &#39;logic&#39;.  My friend, we are not taught logic we are born with it. Some of us have more of it than others do but everybody, for the most part, has their own logic.  Our ideals may vary or be different, but our logic is something that is universal concerning facts. I  unplugged from mainstream media and resources and tried to debunk some of these conspiracy theories with an honest effort. What I have come up with as far as my own personal deduction on these so-called conspiracies or conspiracy theories is that they are turning out to be true. And no matter how much we may try to fight it, eventually the truth will prevail. The devil is smart. His greatest trick is to make us believe he&#39;s not real. Once your eyes are open to that you will see that he is hard at work. &#39;The Great Deceiver&#39;- he is everywhere and most of us don&#39;t see it. And just like the truth, you don&#39;t have to believe in God or in Satan in order for them to exist. Open your eyes, open your mind, and give &quot;what if&quot; an honest &#39;lookin&#39; into&#39;.

It was surprising to find that no one even wanted to consider reaching a more concrete based belief about it. Anyway I was left to research on my own and consider deeply how that I can truly know that the earth is a globe. I learnt a lot from the challenging of beliefs that we generally hold in unshakeable faith. I also learnt that moonlight may be producing a cooling light.. which totally blew my mind. I&#39;ve encountered theories that state that the drop in temperature in areas of direct moonlight could be due to loss of heat into space. I am yet to see this verified. Also the last point you make about the pictures of earth are one of the main reasons some people are very dubious as there is no doubt that NASA is editing and possibly completely fabricating these images. Anyway thanks for the vid. It was seeing the moon and stars the other way around and the  vortex spinning alternate ways on both hemispheres that led me to returning to my belief that the earth is spherical. As I say I learnt some things along the way. Let&#39;s be open to challenging concepts! Even though they may at first seem implausible.

We see lights in the sky there is no such thing as planets. 9. Timezones work on the Flat Earth as well so this is a moot point. 8. Because you use the Coriolis Effect as a proof show that you are willing to use fiction as this has never been proven in fact all tests that have been done to show this have proven that the earth is stationary. 7. Seriously, no one has done that triangle test in real life it. 6. This test is a moot point as it makes 2 assumptions that the earth is Ball and that the sun is so far away the the rays come in parallel. The reality is the sun is close and the effect can been shown on a flat surface.  5. Polaris is always at the center of the stars rotation. This is not possible on a Ball. Also if we were spinning around the sun once every year then we would see different constellations every season, but we don&#39;t. The heavens declarer the flat earth.  4. If you use a compass or look at the starts they always point to the center. So if you go east or west you will go around in a circle. If you want to prove a Globe you need to go over the north pole and the &quot;south pole&quot;. By the way there is no such thing as a south pole. 3. Look up Rob Skiba and the sun set, it is light refraction. a 2 dollar magnifying glass  a paper image and a table can show how this works on a flat earth. Of better yet lie down on flat football field and have a friend walk away from you and see their legs disappear. 2. What his is not telling you is that they clam the sun reflects off the moon, and therefor is of the same nature of light, but the moon light is cold not warm. So the moon is clearly not reflecting the suns light. So whatever is causing this effect is not the earth blocking out the light from the sun to the moon. 1. Hahahaha, no they have not even Nasa admits they are composites. The one he showed has been proven 100% to be faked in the documentary a funny thing happened on the way to the moon. If you compare the official images the sizes of the continents change drastically. Start doing research and you will see that there is a better case for the earth bing flat than a Globe. P.S.

You can&#39;t prove anything on television is real, you can&#39;t prove if we ever left the earth&#39;s atmosphere, you can&#39;t prove why the coriolis effect happens, you can&#39;t prove how far it is to the sun. Someone else did, and you believed them.  You decided or were told to believe in what people you perceive to be smarter than you are telling you, because you do not understand.  I&#39;m betting most of you have never put in 1 second of research into this issue, and simply sided with whatever opinion wouldn&#39;t get you laughed at.  You might recall the folks who first put forth the theory that the earth was round, were both laughed at, and even executed.  Was it wrong of them to challenge the normal?  No!  What is wrong is blindly accepting things passed down, without proving it yourself.  Can you think of ANYTHING more detrimental to the progress of science, than blind acceptance?  So what if someone wants to question what YOU perceive to be obvious?  Have you looked at our world lately?  Aren&#39;t you fucking embarrassed to be counted among what is accepted and normal?  Isn&#39;t it a admirable character trait to question authority, since our authority figures are leading us to war, overpopulation, famine, disease, drought, deterioration of every part of our environment, land, sea and air.

You do this because you perceive yourself to be superior to another person, which is a most dangerous mental illness.  There&#39;s no such thing as a superior person.

Same with the sun, you can still light up some some of the world and not all of it based on a different orbit made by the sun and bthe cause of perspective. Also, the stars will still be inverted or turned around on a flat model because of, wait for it, perspective one again. Ever hear of an astrolabe? If not go look it up buddy.

Everything above us that is going further we see it going down, and everything below us going further we see it going up. And this flat earth and sky we see it intersecting at horizon. ( horizon is the maxim point of of view, and it increase depending of your altitude). The shadows are like that because the sun is much closer from earth, and much smaller.

Airey filled a telescope with water that greatly slowed down the speed of the light inside the telescope and found that he did not have to change the angle of the telescope. This showed that the starlight was already coming in at the correct angle so that no change was needed. This demonstrated that it was the stars moving relative to a stationary earth and not the fast orbiting earth moving relative to the comparatively stationary stars. If it was the telescope moving he would have had to change the angle.<br><br>(c) The Sagnac experiment\u00a0(Reference - Comptes Rendus 1913 v157 p 708-710 and 1410-3) Sagnac rotated a table complete with light and mirrors with the light being passed in opposite directions around the table between the mirrors. He detected the movement of the table by the movement of the interference fringes on the target where they were recombined. This proved that there IS an aether that the light has to pass through and this completely destroys Einstein&#39;s theory of Relativity that says there is no aether. It is for this reason that this experiment is completely ignored by scientists. More recently Kantor has found the same result with similar apparatus.<br>(Il Nuovo Cimento 32B(1):1-27, 11 March 1977) proved that a hollow sphere (the universe) rotating around a solid sphere inside (the earth) produced exactly the same results of Coriolis forces, dragging of Foucault pendulums etc. that are put forward as &quot;proofs&quot; of heliocentricity! This paper gives several other confirmations of the superiority of the geocentric model.<br><br>Thus, there is evidence that the earth is NOT moving around the sun, but either the aether is moving around the earth carrying the planets with it, or the earth is spinning on its axis. The most likely model is that the aether is rotating around the earth as calculations show that if it did not, it would rapidly collapse upon itself<br><br>Other generalizationsEdit<br><br>A relay of pulses that circumnavigates the Earth, verifying precise synchronization, is also recognized as a case requiring correction for the Sagnac effect. In 1984 a verification was set up that involved three ground stations and several GPS satellites, with relays of signals both going eastward and westward around the world.[20]\u00a0In the case of a Sagnac interferometer a measure of difference in arrival time is obtained by producing interference fringes, and observing the fringe shift. In the case of a relay of pulses around the world the difference in arrival time is obtained directly from the actual arrival time of the pulses. In both cases the mechanism of the difference in arrival time is the same: the Sagnac effect.<br><br>prove the flat earth model wrong now ?", "comment_date": "2016-11-18T20:55:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Josh Wilko", "comment_text": "I think people who are stupid enough to believe that the earth is any shape other than a spherical, must either;<br>a) Not have a proper understanding of gravity.<br>b) Not believe in Gravity.<br>c) Never seen a drop of water.<br>d) Think Australia is 10 000Km across<br>e) All of the above", "comment_date": "2016-11-18T13:41:18Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Dolled", "comment_text": "the earth picture is photoshop can you search for it on youtube still no proofs", "comment_date": "2016-11-18T13:28:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dolled", "comment_text": "bad reasons ... so bad", "comment_date": "2016-11-18T13:26:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "burnt potato", "comment_text": "Will u go tell flat earth girl this?", "comment_date": "2016-11-18T03:26:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "giddykitty37", "comment_text": "Thank goodness videos like this exist.", "comment_date": "2016-11-17T21:30:07Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Noah Johnson", "comment_text": "My uncle thinks the earth is flat rofl", "comment_date": "2016-11-17T17:35:28Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "ooDuckey01", "comment_text": "Wow he is wrong on everything.

From the earth there&#39;s no way to prove the earth is round, and there&#39;s evidence NASA has faked everything.<br><br>9) Can be explained by the sun moving closer and farther away from you. If the sun is much smaller and closer than previously believed, this would account for it. If you measure the angle of the sun&#39;s rays or the change in the size of the sun from dawn to noon it supports this theory.<br><br>8) That&#39;s a pretty solid argument for round earth<br><br>7) This would also be good evidence, however, there&#39;s an issue. How can you ensure you are traveling in a straight line for a great distance other than by using a compass? Flat earther&#39;s believe the north pole to be the center of the earth&#39;s surface so this &quot;turn 3 times&quot; experiment would also work on flat earth (using a compass)<br><br>6) This experiment can be recreated on a flat earth with a sun that is much closer and smaller than we&#39;re lead to believe. This idea is supported by the various angles the sun&#39;s rays are cast through clouds (instead of all in a straight line)<br><br>5) Doesn&#39;t really support flat or round earth because you would still be looking at the sky in a different angle, regardless.<br><br>4) Flat earther&#39;s also believe you can circumnavigate the earth. They believe the North pole is the center of the surface world and that the south pole, or Antarctica, is the border around our world. Antartica remains the only land mass largely unexplored and no one has successfully gone in one end of Antarctica and came out the other.<br><br>3) You can&#39;t see things that are far away because of the atmospheric prospective. However with a telescope is possible to see things far away. Also light houses can be seen for miles away despite round-earthers claiming they should be well bellow the horizon.<br><br>2) Can be explained by the earth being a circle, as flat earthers believe it to be.<br><br>1) The only photographic evidence of the entire earth is from NASA, there are no other sources. They are believed to have staged all of their space missions.<br><br>Next, can you explain why the curvature of the horizon is always completely straight? Even at the top of Mount Everest? Also how do stars in the sky stay in perfect relation to Earth throughout time even though we are supposedly orbiting the milky way galaxy as other stars orbit there own galaxies.<br><br>I still have no explanation for the Coriolis effect and would love to continue the discussion with any of you.

Any satellite should be far out, away enough to give us a complete film footage view of the earth &quot;Video&quot;  with clouds in motion over countries, and stars in the sky making it&#39;s authenticity verifiable.

The coriolis effect.. lol just youtube it if anything it proves a flat earth before it proves magical round earth. Also the whole toilets spin the opposite ways in australia is a bunch of bull it depends on what angle the water was filled from or the design of the toilet/apparatus. next. Triangles huh? Ok so if you saying something hypothetically is possible i guess that confirms everything huh.. I could say Ok look if i give you some example that can only be done on a flat earth and say SEE SEE LOOK its possible so its the truth. Just stfu with this bullshit you should all be fucking embarrassed if you accepted that as a &quot;fact&quot;. NExt. The sun doesnt get &quot;lower and lower&quot; your perception of it is changing as it goes away. Its called your optical vanishing point and you can look it up and prove it yourself. Ohh shadows.. here we go where it all began. Pythagorus was the one who initially &quot;discovered&quot; the earth was round by using this method. But guess what if you do the same exact measurements with the pretense that the earth is flat it works out perfectly as well so once again how the fuck is this proof but ok? next. Ok the stars dont change for all of you whos brains dont work properly youre just on the other side of the north pole... do i even have to explain that one like jesus christ ppl use your fucking brains. next. Circumnavigated the earth that means its round DDYYURRRR ok so picture the earth is flat like a pizza with antarctica as the outer rim and n pole in the center. How is that gonna have any effect on nit being able to go in a circle around the pole? Lets see you navigate it from N to south that way. Cant do it can ya..? Next. BAck to the perception thing? Man you dont have many points to cover do you but ok try this. Stand on a beach and watch the boat go over the horizon slowly deisappearing from the bottom up right? Now wait til its completely gone down over the &quot;curve&quot; out of sight. now look through a telescope. boom magically seeing the whole boat again over the curve somehow. NEXT. Honestly not gonna lie i cant remember how the luna rthing works but trust me it once again supports a flat earth so there i left you ONE thing to figure out yourself the MOON which is not a solid mass by the way and does not GLOW from the sun sorry look it up if you want to claim to know the shape of the earth i cant remember everything all the time.

Theres no proof saturn or jupiter are anything like <br>earth, Except what NASA says and we know thats as BS as there so called <br>photo evidence.<br>9. Time Zones.. Time zones prove the geocentric model<br> better if people knew the model they were tying to dispute. If the sun <br>was 93 million miles away like the heliocentric model states. ALL DAYS <br>WOULD BE LIKE THE SUMMER SOLSTICE 12 hours 12 hour nights. And the 24 <br>hour sun would not be possible on a globe.<br>8. ahhaha. If you have not<br> seen this proved wrong dozens of times just youtube it.. This depends <br>on how the water falls and the basin it falls into. Not only that but <br>you will see typhoons and hurricanes spinning ways that they should not <br>if this were true.<br>7. Triangles... hahahhahahah. If this were true <br>surveyors would account for the earths curvature. They dont look it up. <br>Neither do pilots architects or anyone who would have to if the earth <br>was curved. Not only that but roads and highways would not run parallel.<br> NOTICE THE SAID IF YOU WALK 10,000k on the earths surface. Something <br>impossible to do. <br>8. Shadows from sticks - This proves the <br>geocentric theory. If the sun was 93 million miles away and 100x the <br>earth you would never see a shadow north or south, only east and west. <br>YOU CAN TAKE A SEXTON AND MEASURE HOW FAR THE SUN IS. Its around 3 <br>thousand miles and 32 miles across. Being it is this close THE FARTHER <br>NORTH OR SOUTH U GO THE BIGGER THE SHADOW GETS.. DUHHHH<br>5. Yes if you look north or south.. The constellations flip. Once again duhh<br>4.<br> Circumnavigation EAST TO WEST is NOT PROOF.. Look at the geocentric <br>model!! Circumnavigation has never been done South or North.. Use your <br>brains its because its not possible.<br>3. ships on the horizon... No <br>its image compression to the eyes.. GET A TELESCOPE AND THE SHIP COMES <br>BACK, and why?? Because there is no curve. Once again common sense THE <br>LAW OF PERSPECTIVE this is proven by seeing the sunset twice by standing<br> up.. It did not go behind a curve.. If your stupid enough to think your<br> eyes can see from one side of the country to another no wonder you <br>believe NASA<br>2. Shadow on the moon.. This has never been proved to be<br> caused by the earth. NASA cant explain why lunar eclipses happen during<br> the day with the sun above the horizon.. LOOK IT UP!... Eclipses were <br>predicted perfectly for thousands of years with geocentric models.<br>1.<br> Photographic evidence. hahahahah hahaha ahhahah just a sec.... <br>hahahahah ahhahah ahhaha hahahha. K, NASA has had their own painters <br>admit these are paintings. They have admitted the rest are CGI or photo <br>shopped.. Look up pics of earth from space.

Works on your little spherical object nicely, I fail to see how it proves the earth is spherical though. All you did was describe something possible on a sphere.<br>6.

That is simply a lie...you cant turn 90 degrees three times and meet up in the same place on earth. 6. why would you do that to calculate the curvature? Why not use the supposed circumference of the earth given by NASA to calculate it? How does that prove curvature? I can do the same thing with a flashlight on a flat table with toothpicks. That doesn&#39;t prove curvature. 5. Yes Orion is upside down in Australia, but how does that prove a round earth? That proves a flat earth..and disproves a round one. 4. WOW Take a plate, move your finger on the plate clockwise....and there you go, you get back to the same point you left from. 3. That is the vanishing point due to your limited sight. At 60 miles away you shouldn&#39;t see any building at all from across the lake. Using a high powered camera, or telescope, or binoculars...you can bring the entire city back into view bottom to top. Can a binocular round a curve or see around a corner? Afraid not. Therefor, things like the statue of liberty, which is 326 feet above sea level, can be viewed in its entirety, from bottom to top, at sea level, from over 60 miles away. Meaning it should be 2074 feet bellow the curve. That is one of hundreds of examples. Look for yourself. 2. There have been over 50 documented lunar eclipses where the moon and sun are above the horizon. I have filmed this myself..ask me for the video. The earth has nothing to do with the shadow on the moon. 1. AHAAA...You call that a photo? Where are the stars? The moon? Other satellites? Space dabbre?

That means that the knowledge and/or beliefs that the Earth is flat also and can only have come from a comparative judgment. Whether it was the comparative judgment between the laws of physics, a biblical premise, simple logic, historical fact, the principles of perception; empirical, anecdotal, objective or subjective evidence, or historical knowledge.

Surely if you believe the Earth is flat then everything else in the sky is flat as well, isn&#39;t that right? Wrong. Whenever there is a solar eclipse, you don&#39;t see a rectangle on the Earth. And even if you believe that only the Earth is flat, in our only possibly imperfect projections online, you don&#39;t see a circular shadow on the Earth, which is basically just a reinforcement of Reason 12.<br><br>Reason 14: We have Live Footage. Think pictures aren&#39;t enough? Then we have live videos right from the ISS (slight reinforcement of Reason 11). You could clearly see the Earth is round if you watched any time NASA would give out live footage of the ISS orbiting the round Earth. The Earth is even rotating! And it was obvious that after a 1 hour and 32 minute orbit (yes, NASA did have live footage of the ISS orbit) they were back to where they were.<br>Live Footage is quite hard to fake, because there is no time for any person like Photoshop guys from NASA (there aren&#39;t even any) to modify it before it is broadcast. Even then, staging something like that on Earth would be impossible; they even had zero gravity!<br><br><a href=\"http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/International_Space_Station/Where_is_the_International_Space_Station\">http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/International_Space_Station/Where_is_the_International_Space_Station</a><br><br>Reason 15: Occam&#39;s razor. People who believe in flat Earths make WAY more assumptions than those who don&#39;t. They believe the curving when you travel in a straight line on the Earth is a &quot;figment of your imagination&quot;. This is obviously just one assumption. Then they have to assume what lies at the end of the flat Earth.<br>It could be &quot;a drop into the nothingness&quot; (which count as 2 assumptions), &quot;an invisible barrier God created&quot; or &quot;where a giant space octopus hides&quot;, and some random nonsense like that. For us who believe the Earth is round, we only have to assume that the Earth repeats at the &quot;edge&quot;.", "comment_date": "2014-07-20T06:37:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "some guy on the internet", "comment_text": "on the last reason it doesn&#39;t look spherical O_O", "comment_date": "2014-07-19T06:26:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "james pond", "comment_text": "So sad someone had to take time out of their day to explain this, and there are still idiots attempting to disprove it.

For example, on one cloudy night you find yourself awakened in a hospital with selective amnesia, you are aware of basic laws of nature, etc, but are oblivious to the shape of the earth or the heliocentric model. This being the middle of a cloudy night you have no ability to look out of the window to see the horizon or infer anything from the lack of stars above. At that point you have zero evidence to believe that the earth is any particular shape as, for all you know, it could be an octagon, a helix, or even go on indefinitely. So, if you have no evidence to support any given proposition it is only logical to suspend belief of all. This is what is known the default position or non-belief.<br>Now, Say that 4 people come to you and each put forth their proposition of \u00a0the shape of the world. Person 1 claims that the earth is on an infinite 2D plane and goes on forever in all directions. Person 2 claims that the earth is a hollow sphere containing the sun and we are in the interior. Person 3 claims that the earth is a flat disk. Person 4 claims that earth is a sphere orbiting the sun.<br>How do you know which one of those is true? You begin by assigning the burden of proof, each person must themselves present evidence to support their proposition. Person 1 attempts to justify his infinite space theory by claiming that he personally walked for a really long time and didn&#39;t find an end, therefore there isn&#39;t one, thus engaging in an argument from ignorance so you dismiss his point. Person 2 presents speculative analysis from a handful of less-than-credible individuals who support the theory with pseudo-scientific and overly complicated &#39;evidence&#39; of blue gas and optical illusions caused by the inner atmosphere. Person 3 presents archaic arguments which border on ideology as well as &#39;evidence&#39; such as the lack of curvature in lakes. Some of this evidence seems compelling and is the best explanation of the world you&#39;ve heard so far, it even has favour with some pre-Socratic philosophers. Person 4 begins by tracing the beginning of the idea of a spherical earth rotating around the sun to the teachings of Pythagoras, about 2600 years ago, Aristotle&#39;s acceptance of the spherical model based on empirical evidence around 2300 years ago, as well as presenting you with the works of Claudius Ptolemy and virtually every influential scholar and scientist of our era, furthermore objective evidence such as the horizon&#39;s properties and countless accounts of individuals circumnavigating the earth is also put forth.\u00a0<br>Now you can either accept the overwhelming general consensus along with 2 MILLENNIA of empirical evidence and debate and assume the position that the earth is in fact round. OR you can choose to reject the collective knowledge of the world and assume that all of those great minds have been deliberately spinning lies and making up an intricate and extremely consistent fabrication spanning everything we know about the universe in order to trick the general public for no apparent reason or prospects of gain, all whilst everyone remains oblivious to this devious plot except for YOU, aren&#39;t you the special one. However, even if you do reject all the evidence supporting a spherical earth, the evidence you have for a flat earth theory are nowhere near enough to prove your conclusion of a flat earth.\u00a0<br><br>TL;DR:\u00a0<br>Evidence in support of...<br><br>The Spherical Earth: Proposed around 2600 years ago on basis of observation by influential historical figures and since agreed upon by pretty much everyone who mattered. No substantial evidence to refute it.
