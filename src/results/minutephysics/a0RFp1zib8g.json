How long it takes is a distant second. No pun intended.<br>As I believe Einstein said, make it as simple as possible but no simpler.<br><br>Say the microwave video. It was essentially void of information, only if you already knew the topic could you tell that you understood from the drawing that microwaves are EM radiation like light with different wavelength.<br>The explanation of light deserves far more than a 10 second layman&#39;s cartoon. As short as possible in the interest of efficacy but no shorter than the significant aspects are conveyed.<br>Don&#39;t stress on time, focus on information quality.<br>I would maybe talk about how the size of MW limits resolving power so you couldn&#39;t image everyday objects with it (diffraction limit etc). How it can&#39;t go through chickenmesh. I&#39;d talk about how it&#39;s made (electro magnetic) meaning exactly the condition that starts it. I&#39;d talk about typical uses like radar and how it goes through the atmosphere. How metal reflects and plastic is transparent. Why a fork arcs in a MW oven. Why it only heats some things. And maybe if you feel courageous, casually throw in that &#39;some claim that megawatt tracking radar microwaves can disrupt the propulsive field of some UFOs and that&#39;s how Roswell happened. Do it quickly and casually at the end, that way the vogon scientists wont have time to throw a hissyfit over something that&#39;s too big for the little minds to handle.<br>Because yes, there is some indication that UFOs aka ET ships use standing microwave constellations on the hull surface to invoke the funky physics they use. And that indeed this finely tuned field can be disrupted and the resonant coupling be lost and they fall down.<br>What few have thought about is that Roswell New Mexico was home to the only nuclear bomb carrying base in the world at the time of 1947 and that New Mexico had 3 experimental high power radars to guard the airspace around that base.<br>The roswell downing was thus accidental. At least 2 other ET craft were downed in 47 and 48, presumably the same way. It was discovered that radar can disrupt the propulsion. A very unexpected frailty but with the wonderful quality of making sense once discovered.<br>Weakminded scientists (basically all of them) don&#39;t like to think about the UFO phenomenon but isn&#39;t it interesting that our scifi has stupid rocket planes that fly like planes in space and make sound while the supposedly crazy hundreds of millions of people around the world speak of craft that are silent, do explosive accelerations and have featureless smooth metallic hulls with rotational symmetry that reeks of being dictated by field geometry... \u00a0not unlike a magnetic coil.<br>Not that there are many stars of considerable age or anything. Surely ET couldn&#39;t be real... \u00a0Impossiburu!<br>While most physicists are feeble minded when it comes to controversy, secretly, subconsciously, many are fascinated by the topic.
