If you have ever lied, stolen, used God\u2019s name in vain (omg) which is called blasphemy , hated someone (which God consideres murder) or done other things that are against His law ( the Ten Commandments), He sees you as a lying, thieving, blasphemous, murderer. He will judge us, and because we have all broken His law, we ALL deserve hell.<br><br>But because He loves us, He became a human about two thousand years ago, lived without sinning, and died a terrible death He didn\u2019t deserve because of us. Three days later He rose from the dead and one day He is coming back.<br>We all deserve the ultimate punishment (hell). But God loves us so much that He took the punishment on Himself. <br><br>We broke Gods law, Jesus paid the fine.<br><br>If you repent from your sins ( sincerely apologize for breaking His law and turn away from doing it anymore) and trust in Him and Him only, your punishment will be paid for, you will get eternal life in heaven, and you will no longer go to hell.<br><br>I\u2019m not telling you this to judge you.
