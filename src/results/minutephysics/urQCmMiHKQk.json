That mass is represented in various quantities of elements found on the periodic table)<br>\r<br>That mass, within the gravity well, stratifies by density all the way down to the core.  From our stratisfied atmosphere (lightest gases at the top please) and the densest stuff at the core (iron, nickle, etc.)<br>\r<br>So if you were falling into the core of the earth unimpeded by air resistance or other matter, you&#39;d continue to accelerate in a straight line to the core where time runs slowest.

A somewhat large body in rotation (like the Earth) will see its core rotate faster than higher layers of strata.  This in spite of immense friction AND in the vaccum of space.  It has to spin faster, the same way an object must fall faster in a slower time frame.\r<br>\r<br>This phenomena (which newton will never help anyone understand) occurs on all large bodies in our solar system with a magnetic field (Earth, sun jupiter, saturn etc)  in fact, the ferrous core spinning faster than higher levels of strata is the force behind the magnetosphere on all these bodies.", "comment_date": "2021-05-31T15:43:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Carnett", "comment_text": "So if we were able to slow down and make it to the very center of Earth without passing through it, would we experience absolute zero gravity, or micro gravity?

I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true.

The speed of the object, of course, will be maximum at center. I think the acceleration is proportional to the shrinking radius, not the radius of earth,  using Newton&#39;s law of gravitation. I come up with a 2nd order differential equation. It&#39;s been decades since I solved a 2nd order differential equation (and I&#39;m stuck, forgotten how to solve 2nd ODE).

It needs to be colder in order for strong and stable magnetic field to exist. Heat destroys magnetic field, just heat a magnet under candle fire and see what happens, that&#39;s all it takes to destroy solid earth theory.

For going from center back to surface it&#39;s exactly the same thing just in reverse, so it&#39;s going to take the same amount of time to get back from center to surface as from surface to center(you can do the calculations). So you just multiply time you get from start to center by 2, convert seconds to minutes and you get approx 38 minutes. If you want to be more precise you can take a lot of different forces for every frickin kilometer and then take the average of those +6700 different forces and just act as if only that one avg force was acting on object. The same way we calculate how much time and distance passes when accelerating - you take average velocity. Here, if force is changing( no matter at which exponent of rate), just take the average.

We&#39;re talking about drilling a hole through the mantle, through the core, through everything that idles at incredible pressure and heat.  We and our perceivable future selves cannot deal with that; we can&#39;t even dig more than a few km through the crust before our best equipment starts to break down.  And our tunnel has to endure the internal forces of the molten core not only squeezing it, but also moving around inside while the continents are moving at the surface (albeit both at a geologic pace, cm per year; but there&#39;s no super-ancient society that built tunnels through the earth for us to ride).  And the Coriolis effect makes the ride down difficult.  And then you need to survive the heat and pressure during the ride, not just the equipment.  And....

So could we calculate the gravity the Solar System feels from the Milky Way is equivalent to if we were on the outside edge of a smaller galaxy of 25,000 LY radius? I mean that we can consider only the mass of the galaxy towards the inside of our orbital distance, but none of the mass towards the outside?

If that is the case then doesn&#39;t it mean that if you were to fall from the top of the planet at 0mph into the hole it should be impossible to ever reach the other side. I&#39;m pulling this reasoning from a video of a physics lecture where the professor used a bowling ball as a giant pendulum and showing that as long as he released it from one side of the room with 0 speed (touching his nose as he held it up) it would never make it back to the same height as energy would be lost during the travel because it&#39;s literally fighting an up hill battle. I assume this could be due to the minor friction from the air in the room opposed to the vacuum this hole will have, but I don&#39;t know for certain.
