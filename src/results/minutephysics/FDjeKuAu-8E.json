These planetary scientists, some of whom presented their alternate, geophysical planet definition to the Lunar and Planetary Sciences Conference in 2017, reject the notion that an object has to clear its orbit to be a planet and consider dwarf planets to be a subclass of planets--just like dwarf stars are a subclass of stars, and dwarf galaxies are a subclass of galaxies. The geophysical planet definition, which is as scientifically legitimate as the IAU&#39;s dynamical definition, defines objects first and foremost by their intrinsic properties rather than by their location.
