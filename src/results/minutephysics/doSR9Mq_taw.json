Since light travels at 299,792,458 ms^-1 (in a vacuum), it bounces off of the mirrors thousands of times every millisecond, that tiny amount of energy converted into heat adds up, and then all the light energy is converted into heat within a fraction of a second.

In earth&#39;s atmosphere, there are countless suspended particles\u00a0known as particulates, as a result, they are easy for long frequency light to pass around, including light green, yellow, red, and hard for short frequency light to pass around, including dark green, aqua, blue,purple; instead, short frequency light pass through particles without bending and results in scattering due to massive amount of particles. In conclusion, the light spectrum scattered includes dark green(570nm), aqua(530nm), blue(520nm), purple(430nm), and average mixture of them is (570+530+520+430)/4=512.5nm(dark blue), which is shorter comparing to our sky color( aqua or blue), and the reason obviously is that there are higher portion of dark green(570nm) than purple(430nm) , which is presumably because most purple light is scattered in upper atmosphere due to shorter wavelength whereas green light go further down and get scattered in lower atmosphere, where we observe our visible sky.<br>at last but not the least, if the particles get larger, the sky color will shift toward long length spectrum,(average mixture: yellow), \u00a0and if particles get smaller, the sky color will shift toward short spectrum(average mixture:blueish-purple), and if there&#39;s no particles, the sky will not have any color.", "comment_date": "2013-11-22T22:54:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trung Tran", "comment_text": "My chem class actually discussed that the sky is blue because of the ocean!!!
