This is the kind of theory that is paraded as factual science for the benefit of not only the owner of this channel but also propagates partial truths under the guise of established fact. The sad part is you have suckers who wouldn&#39;t spend a literal minute verifying the veracity of anything you&#39;ve just said and think their actual measure of intellect is watching your vid, liking it and putting a comment below. Space science is an immensely amazing as well as confusing field. Although this is from 2011, only now is Space Science actually, for example, criticizing the futility of String Theory and its mathematically non reality based foundation was never ever going to help describe our reality. One did not need to spend billions to have figured that out and yet no one questions it because if it sounds cool, if it looks futuristic, if someone with a Ph&#39;d  or multi million sub Youtube Channel says it&#39;s true then well it might as well be true right?  Years after Feynman, his lectures and his death, we have learned little in absolute terms what exactly is Quantum mechanics or Quantum tunnelling and yet somehow you know the inner workings of the Sun and how the nuclear forces and Quantum tunneling help power the sun?  The great thing about the age of Information is that hundreds of years from now our descendants will be able to trace and follow how misunderstood ideas and opinion became established fact and sold to the masses as truth. The space sciences have contributed to our understanding of the Universe, no doubt about it. However not everything within Space Science is vigorously questioned or tested when sold to us through scientific journals or periodicals and magazines. There&#39;s a lot of politics, bull shit and back stabbing as well as poor quality control of information that comes from scientific science but what do we know? Let&#39;s just like and subscribe anything that has fancy theories and equations on it because that will make us feel smart right?", "comment_date": "2020-02-25T16:10:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Omansh Sharma", "comment_text": "I love quantum physics \u2122", "comment_date": "2020-01-28T14:08:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harold Hart", "comment_text": "WHAT ????
