If he finds his bill(50% chance), then he leaves at an hour mark representing which box he found bill #1, and the minute mark where he found #2, if he found bill #2. Ex: Bill #1 found at the 14th box, and bill #2 found at the 45th box, so he leaves after 14 hours and 45 minutes. If bill #2 was not found, he leaves at 14 hours and 0 minutes. Note: I think he is able to check 50 boxes even after his own bill is found because in the video it said that he left the room when he \u201c[showed him that he had succeeded]\u201d.<br><br>Assuming that \u201cA\u201d found the bill, the 2nd person(call him \u201cB\u201d) has a 100% chance of finding bill #2.<br><br>\u00a0Case 1: Say \u201cB\u201d was called into the room at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M&amp;t=14m45s\">14:45</a>, then \u201cB\u201d would check all of the 1st half for where bill #3 was, and for continuity\u2019s sake, leave at hour 45, and the minute marking where he found bill #3. If bill #3 was not found, then he would leave at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M&amp;t=45m00s\">45:00</a>.<br><br>Case 2: Say \u201cB\u201d was called into the room at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M&amp;t=14m00s\">14:00</a>, then \u201cB\u201d would check the 2nd half(top 50, starting from box #51) for where bill #2 was, and leave at the corresponding hour marker for that location(let\u2019s say the 13th hour, as in the 13th box of the 2nd half), and the corresponding minute marker for where bill #3 was found. For example, if bill #3 was found at the 29th block, \u201cB\u201d would leave at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M&amp;t=13m29s\">13:29</a> If bill #3 was not found, then \u201cB\u201d would leave at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M&amp;t=13m00s\">13:00</a>.<br><br>\u201cC\u201d, repeats the pattern, and so forth. After each turn, the people in line are basically building a coordinate system telling them which bills have been claimed (the boxes do not move). After 50 people have repeated these steps, people 51-100 can open the remaining 50 unknown boxes to find their own bill.\u00a0<br><br>Yes, you could claim that they couldn&#39;t accurately measure the time, but it\u2019d be strange for 100 people not to have a watch/phone.

If the money in bk belongs the ak, then he/she is done. Otherwise, the money in bk belongs to some person aj, so ak then opens locker bj. This process is continued until either ak finds his/her money, or he/she has opened 50 boxes.

Everyone meets before going in, they all take there phones out and sync them to the same time or stop watches or anything you want to use to keep track of time. then line up 1-100 \u00a0so everyone can stand in order. so they know everyone&#39;s number of the person after them. Everyone follow the same rule give each other 2 hours in the room for ever minute he leaves early that&#39;s what number the person is behind him or if he leaves at 1 hour and 59 minutes then he found the person two numbers behind him so for example: First person #1 walks in the room at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M&amp;t=00m00s\">00:00</a> hours or <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M&amp;t=12m00s\">12:00</a> am and worst case scenario he doesn&#39;t find his number nor the person behind him so he leaves right at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M&amp;t=2m00s\">2:00</a> to let the others know he didn&#39;t find the persons number behind themselves so the #2 person knows to look in boxes 51-100. So they find there number and if they find #3 number in say box 55 they can then leave 55 minutes from the next 2 hour mark so they would walk out of room at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eivGlBKlK6M&amp;t=3m05s\">3:05</a> so the #3 person knows what box his number is in. Now here the kicker if someone leaves the room at 1 hour and 59 minutes that signals the person behind them that the person behind them is in the same set of numbers so they all know the set of numbers to look for. You keep going till #100 person then they can know exactly what box to go to and know the same set of boxes #1 is in or not so he can find #1 box and leave on that set time. So then everyone knows their box number including #1.
