Displacement.\r<br>\r<br>Going back to basics is always a good idea when trying to understanding anything.\r<br>Displacement is very basic. \r<br>\r<br>Something here (sound) is displacing the water to create &quot;sonoluminescence&quot; a bubble in water that then collapses giving off light. Sound is the (Structured-Energy or Solidified-Energy) here displacing the water. When the sound looses its structure the bubble collapses in a release of its energy. This is a simple display of Energy-Displacing matter. \r<br>\r<br>Energy-Displacement obeys the same basic principles as (matter displacing energy) or (solid matter displacing Liquids or gasses). If you define how solids displace liquids or gasses then you will have the basic understanding needed to define how (matter displaces energy) and how (energy displaces matter). \r<br>\r<br>Because of E=Mc2 we know that everything is energy of various (structures and densities). \r<br>There are four classifications for densities:\r<br>1-Energy\r<br>2-Gas\r<br>3-Liquid\r<br>4-Solid\r<br>\r<br>Examples of these classes are:\r<br>1-Fire / Light / Electricity / Gravity / Sound ... etcetera\r<br>2-Air\r<br>3-Water\r<br>4-Earth\r<br>\r<br>Solids de-solidify into liquids, then gasses, then energies. \r<br>-The reverse process also happens. \r<br>Energies solidify into gasses, then liquids, and then solids.\r<br>This process happens naturally or can be made to happen when we understand how a particular (medium of energy) works.\r<br>\r<br>We know something is true when we can make the information work in our lives and when we can manipulate and create it for ourselves.
