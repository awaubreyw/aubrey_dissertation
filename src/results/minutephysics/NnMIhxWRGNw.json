GRAVITISM.<br>        Over the last decades there have been remarkable developments in thermodynamics and quantum mechanics. Yet many of the basic problems have remained largely unsolved. In the spectrum of opinions expressed by authors who have attempted to solve these problems, one can roughly distinguish three main schools of thought:<br><br>1) Traditional\u00a0axiomatic\u00a0thermodynamics, which cannot explain the origin of irreversibility and time asymmetries.<br><br>2) The statistical school, which generates\u00a0\u201cman-made irreversibility\u2019\u2019\u00a0by imposing asymmetric conditions on symmetric ones in order to describe reality.<br><br>3)\u00a0The new gravitational school, which\u00a0deduces\u00a0the origin of evolution, irreversibility, electromagnetic and thermodynamics from Einsteinian gravitation and the verified expansion of the universe.<br>This school includes some new modifications to the physics as part of GRAVITISM.<br><br>My object is to obtain a consistent mathematical formulation of irreversibility in probabilistic theories.

But this is about what is described above. So long story short, what needs to be done to get the world of physics on the right path in a way that everyone can understand and understand without paradoxes? <br>You have to get down to the roots of the causes (analyze them) and turn aside the ingrown blinders. <br>The cause of the current physics view world builds on the famous formula E=mc2. What&#39;s so bad when you get to the bottom of how this formula came about, analyze it for facts of physics, explain what&#39;s up or not, without declaring the whole thing fake news or conspiracy theory? Unfortunately, many physicists immediately reject it on the grounds that the famous formula is correct and has been proven. <br>This statement alone contradicts the following: Every physics theory or axiom is valid until the opposite is proven. <br>So if other lines of thought or evidence are not heard or analyzed, how are you supposed to prove the opposite? (probably the blinders have grown too big for some) Yes I know I wrote a bit too much, I hope I spoke from the heart of some. <br>It is not easy to convey something new against too many entrenched opinions. Sorry, a short notice has become a long notice. But no sweat, no gain. <br>Nothing is impossible <br><br>THINK DIFFERENT <br>Very good lecture. I have described the derivation of when and how the formula E=mc2 came about in a short and understandable form in the book see link below. <br>In the book, a new physics discovery (RNB = Relative Neutral Reference Point) is presented and with the help of which the proof is finally presented in a comprehensible and short form, how the famous formula is structured or created and what consequences it has on the current physics world. <br>With this (RNB), many paradoxes, taboos and incorrect physical world of perceptions related to the general theory of relativity suddenly become more understandable and comprehensible for everyone. <br>The book is based on sober physics with reasoning, diagrams, formulas in understandable and short form. <br>The new discovery is almost unbelievable but fact! After analysis (RNB), every physicist will probably wonder why it has not been discovered until now.<br>I&#39;ll tell you something now, because we did almost all of the physics experiments on the earth&#39;s surface and included our environment, which has always unconsciously deceived us. More detailed in the book, or free preview visible. <br>Attention: <br>It is not about the entire theory of relativity, but only about the famous formula and its direct effects.<br><br>It is by no means, as one might assume, neither fake news nor conspiracy theory etc. to be assigned. <br><br>Unfortunately, the famous formula E=mc2 is based on experiments based on error (approx. 100 years ago), starting with the Michelson-Morley experiment and has been continuously developed up to the present day. The proof is very clear and understandable with the help of the RNB. <br><br>It was published by epubli, where you can even get a 37-page preview for free.

So, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. Therefore, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. Therefore, the Moon is moving AND not moving IN BALANCE in conjunction with invisible AND VISIBLE SPACE in fundamental equilibrium AND BALANCE; AS E=mc2 IS then F=ma. THE MOON is ALSO manifest or shaped in balance WITH THE EYE. The Moon IS THEN manifest ON BALANCE as what is ALMOST invisible in RELATION to/with the BLUE SKY, AS the dome of a person&#39;s EYE is ALSO visible on BALANCE. Magnificent. Notice that the shape or curvature of what is the Moon matches that of what is the EARTH/ground (given what is a clear horizon, of course). SO, the ORANGE SUN is CLEARLY proven to be FUNDAMENTALLY in accordance WITH the setting, WHITENED, AND fully illuminated Moon; AS the INVARIANT form of what is the TERRESTRIAL or LAND BASED Moon is then clearly proven ON BALANCE. It is CLEARLY predictable that there will then also be the experience of less gravity in relation to what is the Moon. Importantly, BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. So, it is also CLEARLY explained why objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Great !!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Notice that the Earth is also BLUE (as water), AND the Earth is also ORANGE (as lava). The composition of lunar rocks is, in fact, practically identical to that of Earth rocks. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! (Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) SO, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY F=ma. I now have mathematically unified physics/physical experience. Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=mc2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma in a BALANCED fashion. Again, BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. So, I have successfully and consistently used time in order to to CLEARLY PROVE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy must be gravity; AS E=mc2 IS necessarily F=ma in what is a consistent and BALANCED FASHION. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Therefore, gravitational force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Again, notice that the DOME of a person&#39;s EYE is ALSO visible. So, consider what is balanced BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE. Magnificent. INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience, as E=mc2 IS F=ma.<br><br>The Moon is a universal reflection of the Earth/Sun BALANCE, as the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE AND the FULL DISTANCE in/of space are linked AND BALANCED; as gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. <br><br>E=mc2 IS F=ma. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The Earth AND the Sun are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Therefore, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON NECESSARILY matches it&#39;s revolution. Great. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY proven to be F=ma !!!! The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. GREAT !!!!! The EARTH and the Sun constitute and comprise the MIDDLE AND THE FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE (IN BALANCE) in full and BALANCED compliance and conformity with the CLEAR and universal fact that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Great !!!!!! Hence, it is CLEARLY proven, in fact, that the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON NECESSARILY matches it&#39;s revolution. Great. Obviously, what is THE MOON is subject to and constitutive of both E=mc2 AND F=ma. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY proven to be F=ma. &quot;Mass&quot;/energy involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma.<br><br>The following constitutes even further proof of the fact that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Very importantly, in dream experience, BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE is invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE.

in 300 years ago the Newtonian mechanics was born<br>during the modern industry germination times, basically the gravity, explosive<br>force or trajectory force was primarily studied. The industrial science<br>develops up today, as the kinetic foundation the Newtonian mechanics should be<br>developed followed by dynamic, have a complete theory system to face all<br>dynamical phenomenon (including personal force). Such as\uff1aelectromechanical dynamics, hot dynamics or<br>hydrodynamics and so on , it is the most important part in all personal living<br>environments. There will have some questions if they are interpreted by the<br>Newtonian mechanics. The most basic reason is that the Newtonian mechanics<br>takes the disposable use of force as the object of research but the modern<br>mechanics mostly needs to face the situation of the long-enduring use of force,<br>and photo-electrical and the Big Bang Theory", "comment_date": "2021-03-08T20:33:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MaximumSunlite 333", "comment_text": "This is God", "comment_date": "2021-03-07T03:02:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neurofied Yamato", "comment_text": "This was such an amazing yet simple explanation.

Just to improve a bit on the discussion, what you said is the &quot;modern interpretation&quot; of the relativistic energy equation. Now m is the proper mass and is considered an invariant (the mass of the object as measured in its rest reference frame). In this sense, and as you showed, the equation E = mc^2 is not complete in the case of a moving object. Anyway, previously, some textbooks ago, m was the &quot;relativistic mass&quot; equals to gamma*rest_mass, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, depending on the velocity of the particle. Form that the idea that the (relativistic) mass of an object is bigger if it is moving at a certain speed.See here for further details: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity#Relativistic_mass\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_in_special_relativity#Relativistic_mass</a>", "comment_date": "2018-03-15T09:15:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Desert Eagle", "comment_text": "I am not sure about geometry analogy", "comment_date": "2018-03-12T11:08:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prajyot Singh", "comment_text": "If it&#39;s a massless particle, wouldn&#39;t it&#39;s momentum be zero hence making it&#39;s energy zero", "comment_date": "2018-03-09T12:17:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pavit", "comment_text": "I hate triangles and especially Pythagoras for this!!!!!!\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude20\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude24", "comment_date": "2018-03-07T14:05:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Raju Maharjan", "comment_text": "Galaxies travel faster than speed of light and you don&#39;t compare E,mc^2 and pc to a right angled triangle.", "comment_date": "2018-03-07T02:41:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rot", "comment_text": "Omg this is so impressive", "comment_date": "2018-03-04T13:31:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Swayam Singh", "comment_text": "Bro if mass is 0<br>Then how it has momentum", "comment_date": "2018-03-03T16:42:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harshit Agrawal", "comment_text": "but when m= 0 then how could be P ...coz it&#39;s to zero", "comment_date": "2018-02-28T20:56:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jo\u00e3o Vitor", "comment_text": "Yeah, but isn&#39;t p = m \u2022 v?", "comment_date": "2018-02-27T00:08:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sajjad H.

The equation E^2=(mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2 is found from finding the momentum four vector,(Pc,iE), dot producting it by itself, giving (P^2)c^2 -E^2, which must be invariant, so at P=0, have -E^2=-(mc^2)^2, which due to invariance(due to the lorentz transformations) means E^2=(mc^2)^2+(pc)^2.

So pretty much  if i had a mass of literal 0 and had some magic way of producing constant but unfluxuating (so that it never goes too high or too low) energy to propel myself forward then i could create enough momentum to match my energy output and i could essentially go at the speed of light <br><br>OR if i do have a certain mass and if i have unfluxuating (again so it stays at a constant rate) energy i could increase my momentum but due to my mass it would either be too low or right on the edge but never reaching the same levels as my energy output; making light speed still impossible.<br><br>BUT THEN I THOUGHT...GRAVITY IS ESSENTIALLY WHAT GIVES EVERYTHING MASS IN THE UNIVERSE<br><br>SO<br><br>Lets say i have a certain mass and i still have unfluxuating (so its constant) energy so then i could increase my momentum to almost that of my energy output, but never higher due to my natural mass index, again making light speed travel impossible.<br><br>BUT THAT MIGHT ONLY BE THE CASE IN AREAS WHERE GRAVITY IS PRESENT AND PULLING GIVING US MASS<br><br>Light can move so fast because it has no mass index to keep its momentum from catching up to its constant energy (that it gets from its starting point the sun - as example) and it has no mass index because it has no physical form to be affected by the pull of gravity...so if this is true then you could say getting rid of our own mass is the only way to get our momentum to match our energy and move at light speed; but removing mass is entirely impossible.<br><br>UNLESS WE UTILIZE THE NATURAL ZERO GRAVITY ASPECTS OF SPACE<br><br>Gravity is what pulls on everything in the known universe giving it its mass index; so if we have our natural mass and were to have an unfluxuating (constant rate) energy source then we could try to raise our momentum but again would only reach just below our energy output due to our mass being constant, which is what the triangle from the video explains.<br><br>But id say why not instead of trying to remove our mass to create a 2D line out of said triangle we should just remove whats creating the mass in the first place up to a point where its as if we have no mass at all and just make that triangle into an even square/rectangle in where the added left side (which would be gravity) would be equal to the inverse (inverse because you want to take the gravity away not add it on) of whatever the mass side is equal to so that it gives the feeling of moving either at or just as fast as the speed of light.<br><br>This is just a theory in the works though.<br><br>Also if you were to draw an upside down backwards version of the triangle connected at the points where the E and pc meet then label the opposite positions as -E and -pc and also rather than labeling the far left -mc2 label it -G(my label for zero gravity) then you get a nice pictograph of what light is essentially.<br><br>Also once drawn mark the corners where the triangles meet in the middle as the creation point of light from energy having no momentum to energy with momentum<br><br>The mc2 and -G would cancel out(due to the fact that light is effected by neither gravity giving it no mass or zero gravity) making the far walls of both triangles disappear.<br><br>Leaving the E and -E lines to fall flat onto their respective pc or -pc lines making the lights energy &amp; momentum essentially able to be equal(because light is essentially energy particles with either no motion[not moving yet so its not yet light] or constant motion)<br><br>Which then leaves you with the final line (which represents the particles themselves) with an epicenter which marks when particles become light itself and on the left side theres -pc = negative/no momentum and on the right side theres pc = positive/some momentum. So its kind of lights creation process in drawn form.<br><br>Now try just adding a left wall to the triangle shown in the video and label that wall as -G(zero gravity) and you will see the human equivalent of what it might take to go light speed.<br><br>The addition of an equal amount of -G  to match and cancel out the effects of gravity creating mass would force our energy and momentum to be equal but they would never come from the same source however. They would never meet at any point.<br><br>BUT<br><br>The adding of -G (zero gravity) would end up canceling out the mc2 (mass) but the two lines would still be visible because gravity never disappeared it just got cancelled out and also the zero gravity is still taking effect.<br><br>The E and pc lines would remain parted due to the fact that the E (energy source) and the pc (source of the momentum) are not the same entity unlike light which is energy particles with momentum itself and also because zero gravity or gravity would always be affecting our physical form (our physical form in this case being the 2D box itself) unlike light which has no truly physical form to be effected by the drift of zero gravity or addition of mass by gravity<br><br>We have no issue making energy or creating momentum ourselves however but we would be left with the issue of ourselves not being able to naturally produce the energy and momentum all at once from a singular source at a precise moment and also the issue of our physical body being able to be effected by either the drift of zero gravity or pull of gravity<br><br>As long as we are all together physically effected by either/both the drift of zero gravity or addition of mass by gravity and also cannot naturally create energy and momentum from one singular source so as to avoid any complications with spacial anomalies then we wont ever be able to trigger light speed travel.<br><br>This is just a theory of mine though.<br>If you read this i would love your intellectual feedback and input.<br><br>+minutephysics", "comment_date": "2017-07-21T08:22:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ant The Champ", "comment_text": "Genius", "comment_date": "2017-07-18T11:49:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Prashant Kumar", "comment_text": "well u say Energy of Photon = p*c <br>but p=m*v and photons have 0 mass <br>so that must mean that energy of Photon=0", "comment_date": "2017-07-17T09:59:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabe Vega", "comment_text": "Wouldn&#39;t something with no mass have no energy then?

EINSTEIN WAS OBVIOUSLY WRONG.<br><br>His conclusions about the limitation on the speed of light and on the effects of this speed on creating INFINITE mass, which he says is therefore impossible, are based on the inaccurate application and interpretation of the LORENZ TRANSFORMATION equations. I won&#39;t waste time spoon feeding those of you who know what I am talking about because you all know what the LORENZ equations look like.<br><br>EINSTEIN&#39;S conclusions about the limitation on the speed of light are all based on the the mathematical &quot; philosophy &quot; that a ZERO in a denominator resolves the equation to INFINITY. This is not a mathematical law...it is a theory or philosophy. If he is wrong, and many mathematicians have long ago said that he was, then the speed of light CAN easily be surpassed without worrying about the invisible &quot; barrier&quot; of infinite mass.<br><br>We have all known &quot; intuitively &quot; that he was wrong forever because firstly it makes no sense intuitively that you can accelerate to 99.99999% of something but at that other 0.000001% ( I am only a dumb former trial lawyer, so I don&#39;t know if this math is correct..but you get my meaning ) there is an invisible WALL and if he was right it would mean we could never travel to the stars and aliens could never come here. This is so obvious that every science fiction writer has ignored EINSTEIN&#39;S conclusions this being a limitation on our speed capabilities since the start of the 20th century.<br><br>Now, besides the observations that alien propulsion systems must have obviously enabled them to travel MUCH faster then the speed of light to get here and that they are using a propulsion system which cancels the effects of inertia and/or gravity, we have a much more powerful ally; the greatest real scientist of all time, whose inventions are thousands of time more important to mankind then EINSTEIN&#39;s &quot; ideas&quot; \u00a0ever were...NIKOLA TESLA... disagreed with almost everything of importance that EINSTEIN had to say.<br><br>TESLA said that he conducted many experiments where he observed supra-luminal speeds and when a man with 178 of the most important inventions in history says so...I BELIEVE HIM. He also completely disagreed with EINSTEIN&#39;S theory that GRAVITY was \u00a0only a distortion of space. He said gravity was a FORCE.<br><br>This &quot;DISTORTION&quot; theory also makes no sense intuitively because even when you look at the usual &quot; bowling ball on a mattress &quot; analogy, it represents space as only being distorted in ONE plane...what would this DISTORTION look like if, as it would have to be, the distortion takes place in ALL directions at all times ?<br><br>I SAY THAT THERE IS AN &quot;INVISIBLE&quot; PORTION OF LIGHT WHICH WE CANNOT YET MEASURE BECAUSE IT TRAVELS FASTER THEN &quot; C &quot;<br><br>My own theory, which I included in a satirical piece called EINSTEIN PUT ON TRIAL and where I presented the arguments that I would raise to attack EINSTEIN&#39;S theories, presented an ALTERNATIVE argument that the theories of the DUAL nature of light and that the puzzle of the PARADOX effect and the TUNNEL experiment would all be resolved, and QUANTUM mechanics would be reconciled with classical PHYSICS inertial models \u00a0if we concluded that there is an INVISIBLE portion OF LIGHT which travels much faster then what we accept as &quot; C&quot; but which can only be measured by our current instrumentality when it slows down to the speed of light.\u00a0<br><br>This would also confirm BURBRIDGE&#39;s idea that the RED SHIFT is far smaller then what we think and that therefore the UNIVERSE is much smaller then we think and the stars are much closer.<br><br>TESLA created a patent for electrostatic propulsion which he theorized would allow us to greatly exceed the speed of light,...consistent with the observations and theories about the capabilities of ALIEN propulsion systems.<br><br>If we don&#39;t already have such systems...something I hope is wrong...C&#39;MON you engineers...let&#39;s complete TESLA&#39;S work and get this done already.\ufeff", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T23:16:54Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "chaosjacky", "comment_text": "Does this mean, that any other matter with no mass (what is there apart from photons of light btw ?), travels at the speed of light ?", "comment_date": "2014-02-18T20:44:02Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "JCON", "comment_text": "I want minutemath.
