One car of the train has a light bulb exactly in the middle of it. There are two people standing equidistant at opposite sides of the train car. You turn the light on, and the light reaches each person simultaneously, from the perspective of the people on the train.

This video really hit the nail on the head. All your videos are great, but this one really had this essence to it. When people think about relativity, they usually take the word at face value. But scientists don&#39;t want to talk about and study things that we can&#39;t agree on but rather things that we can. I believe that the word you were alluding to but didn&#39;t mention was &quot;invariance&quot; (which is a word that almost seems to crop up on every page in some form or another in Hartle&#39;s, Gravity). It&#39;s great when you do that by the way, when it gets me to think about the vocabulary for the topic the video is about, it&#39;s a little bit of self discovery and it really ties everything I learn in and out of school together.<br><br>&quot;Time is relative&quot; is often quoted amongst popular science. While that is true and fun to think about, what&#39;s not being said is &quot;The space-time interval is invariant&quot; which is, in my opinion, wildly more important. Things that are unchanging while everything else is is a really important concept in science. It&#39;s what holds everything in place. That&#39;s why physics is so keen on conservation laws.

If the picture was humongous to the extent that we can&#39;t perceive its boundaries, it would appear totally different for us humans.<br>The meaning, the perception, heck even the naming , all are relative. If mankind called apples pears, it would have been a pic of 3 pears. The naming is relative. Everything is relative since everything came into existence, hence their existence itself is relative.<br><br>2) The physical concepts described by Einstein are relative. For example, the speed of light is absolute, but that&#39;s when we are talking about objects moving in this universe. Firstly, if there exist parallel universes as physics do hypothesize, the speed of light here would be relative in these other worlds. Secondly, even in this universe, light is not exactly absolute to everything. \u00a0its speed is only absolute when we&#39;re talking about objects moving in the universe as I just said, but the universe is itself moving. It&#39;s expanding, and -here&#39;s the point - in some parts it&#39;s expanding at a speed faster than light.

Scientific opinions though, proven by experimenting, data..etc. The most important condition that characterize the &quot; Scientific Method&quot; is that whichever result you reach in your experiment, it has to be &quot;potentially refutable&quot; in the future. You can&#39;t reach a 100% conclusion (absoluteness) in science. This wouldn&#39;t be science, this would be creed/belief/dogma/religion.<br><br>Quantum Physics supports this conceptually.

Numbers are conceptual ideas about for example\u00a0quantity, etc..<br>So... if you want to check if hypothesis of having 3 apples is true you need to check what numbers represent. Let&#39;s start with number 1 as it is first number (0 is number too, is a lack of value, but we call it number) - so number 1 = apple. but in order to say that we REALLY have 2 or 3 apples, number 1 has to be == with other number 1 (1 has to be perfectly identical with other 1).

We use them only as\u00a0approximation (what is relative!!!)\u00a0so if you will have one apple and perfect copy of this apple (perfect I mean identical to infinity, what is not real!!!) you could merge them conceptually &gt; 1 apple and 1 apple and say you have 2 apples.

In the end, numbers are relative as you will not have number 1 if you will not know other numbers like: 0 or 2.... if you will have only number 1 it will not be even number.... you will not know what it is as you could not RELATE this to any other number... so everything will be 1.... just a thing not a number!<br>Have a great day!!!", "comment_date": "2014-03-31T08:03:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mikhail Romanov", "comment_text": "Relativity is relative, just your perspective is not.", "comment_date": "2014-03-31T07:58:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luis Augusto Fretes Cuevas", "comment_text": "Relativity, first, has nothing to do with subjects, as the video constantly gives the impression of.

Plus the &quot;theory&quot; that the Earth was &quot;created&quot; over 6 days is total BS. With all you religious fantards out there that say, &quot;The big bang theory is wrong, it is impossible to create something out of nothing!&quot; Well, let&#39;s say god was real. Where was he from? Is there a reason? He was just there? He created everything? If he created everything then he created something out of nothing didn&#39;t he? \u00a0Your point has been contradicted. The only reason religion hasn&#39;t been put to rest is the fact that nobody can prove that god is real or fake, although the theory of God just doesn&#39;t make sense to ME. Also nobody can prove that the Big Bang is true either, although for ME it is highly believable. So both could have been considered just made up. The only reason there is religion is because people use it to explain the unexplained. I have NEVER seen or heard of anyone who needed surgery but didn&#39;t have to because &quot;god&quot; healed his/her wounds. If you pray to &quot;god&quot; and he answers your prayers then you thank him, but if he doesn&#39;t grant you what you want then it&#39;s god&#39;s will, so why pray at all? Even if &quot;God&quot; loved us, then why did god send a flood to kill us ALL?

I\u2019m not quite sure though that the statement \u201cmost things are not relative\u201d is correct. Unlike True or False, Absolute and Relative are not attributes (qualifiers) OF statements (though they can certainly be used IN statements). One can say that the statement \u201cG.W. was the 1st president of the US\u201d is true or false, but not that it is absolute or relative. It makes as much sense as saying the statement is green or dry. \u00a0Same for WWI and Star Wars, and \u201cthis picture shows three apples\u201d. For this reason, they can\u2019t be used to validate the initial statement. Most likely everything is relative because definitions per se are always relational. (Try to define a word/concept without using other words/concepts). \u00a0For instance, the definition of speed (of light) depends on the definition of length and time in any reference frame. I wouldn\u2019t say that the speed of light is absolute, but rather \u201cconstant/invariant\u201d regardless of the reference frame. Same for the distance between two events in space-time, the energy and momentum of an object and the curvature of space-time. I think it helps to think of absolute as the opposite of relative, constant as the opposite of variable and not confuse constant with absolute.

The reality of the matter is actually the summation of many smaller transient realities. For instance (this is only an approximation of truth), there were many people alive in the late 18th century (also relative), who referred to George Washington as the President of the United States. Then, these transient beliefs of people were recorded onto paper, which were then picked up by people in later transient times and taken\u00a0to be true. Really, the knowledge that George Washington was the first president of the United States is a common belief held among a finite set of people at transient points in time. For the sake of simplicity, it is just easier for people to refer to George Washington as the first President of the United States to avoid becoming confused and having to endure unnecessary thought duress. However,\u00a0I am unaware of any absolute fact wall in nature which mandates that George Washington must infallibly be the first President of the United States.<br>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 As a side note, in binary, there are 11 apples in that picture.
