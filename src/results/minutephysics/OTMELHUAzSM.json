He explained the bending of light was caused by space rising from the surface of the Sun, as space rises light coming from the background constellation passing close to the surface of the Sun, enters the rising space at a higher level on the far side, and as the space rises it exits lower on our side as it travels toward us making, the images of the stars appear as if they are at a wider angle away from the Sun (the gravitation lens effect). He also said time slows in the presence of mass, with rising space coming from the core of the Earth (our gravity source) we move farther, faster toward the gravity source than matter moves away from it. With matter moving toward the core, matter applies pressure on the core, anything put under pressure radiates heat (long-wave energy) in essence elongating the fabric of space vertically to the planet&#39;s surface which allows light to make longer jumps per second. Change in momentum lags behind the change in velocity. Matter does not pull on matter, we are decelerating on the planet&#39;s surface at the rate of acceleration that the core is expanding new space as the surface pressure is heating the core.

THE MOON is ALSO manifest or shaped in balance WITH THE EYE. The Moon IS THEN manifest ON BALANCE as what is ALMOST invisible in RELATION to/with the BLUE SKY, AS the dome of a person&#39;s EYE is ALSO visible on BALANCE. Magnificent. Notice that the shape or curvature of what is the Moon matches that of what is the EARTH/ground (given what is a clear horizon, of course). SO, the ORANGE SUN is CLEARLY proven to be FUNDAMENTALLY in accordance WITH the setting, WHITENED, AND fully illuminated Moon; AS the INVARIANT form of what is the TERRESTRIAL or LAND BASED Moon is then clearly proven ON BALANCE. It is CLEARLY predictable that there will then also be the experience of less gravity in relation to what is the Moon. Importantly, BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=MA; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. So, it is also CLEARLY explained why objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Great !!! It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Notice that the Earth is also BLUE (as water), AND the Earth is also ORANGE (as lava). The composition of lunar rocks is, in fact, practically identical to that of Earth rocks. Notice the black space of what is THE EYE. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! (Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.) SO, it ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY F=ma. I now have mathematically unified physics/physical experience. Time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE; AS E=mc2 is CLEARLY proven to be F=ma in a BALANCED fashion. Again, BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. So, I have successfully and consistently used time in order to to CLEARLY PROVE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy must be gravity; AS E=mc2 IS necessarily F=ma in what is a consistent and BALANCED FASHION. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE. Therefore, gravitational force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Again, notice that the DOME of a person&#39;s EYE is ALSO visible. So, consider what is balanced BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE. Magnificent. INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper UNDERSTANDING of physics/physical experience, as E=mc2 IS F=ma.<br><br>The Moon is a universal reflection of the Earth/Sun BALANCE, as the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE AND the FULL DISTANCE in/of space are linked AND BALANCED; as gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites; as E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. <br><br>E=mc2 IS F=ma. &quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The Earth AND the Sun are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=mc2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Therefore, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON NECESSARILY matches it&#39;s revolution. Great. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY proven to be F=ma !!!! The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. GREAT !!!!! The EARTH and the Sun constitute and comprise the MIDDLE AND THE FULL DISTANCE in/of SPACE (IN BALANCE) in full and BALANCED compliance and conformity with the CLEAR and universal fact that E=mc2 IS F=ma, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Great !!!!!! Hence, it is CLEARLY proven, in fact, that the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON NECESSARILY matches it&#39;s revolution. Great. Obviously, what is THE MOON is subject to and constitutive of both E=mc2 AND F=ma. E=mc2 IS CLEARLY proven to be F=ma. &quot;Mass&quot;/energy involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma.<br><br>The following constitutes even further proof of the fact that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Very importantly, in dream experience, BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE is invisible AND VISIBLE IN BALANCE. Dream experience is/involves true/real QUANTUM GRAVITY, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; as E=mc2 IS F=ma.<br><br>By Frank DiMeglio", "comment_date": "2021-03-27T03:27:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Frank DiMeglio", "comment_text": "TIME DILATION IS FULLY EXPLAINED, AS THE ULTIMATE MATHEMATICAL UNIFICATION OF PHYSICS/PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE IS CLEARLY PROVEN:<br><br>A PHOTON may be placed at the center of what is THE SUN (as A POINT, of course), AS the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

in 300 years ago the Newtonian mechanics was born<br>during the modern industry germination times, basically the gravity, explosive<br>force or trajectory force was primarily studied. The industrial science<br>develops up today, as the kinetic foundation the Newtonian mechanics should be<br>developed followed by dynamic, have a complete theory system to face all<br>dynamical phenomenon (including personal force). Such as\uff1aelectromechanical dynamics, hot dynamics or<br>hydrodynamics and so on , it is the most important part in all personal living<br>environments. There will have some questions if they are interpreted by the<br>Newtonian mechanics. The most basic reason is that the Newtonian mechanics<br>takes the disposable use of force as the object of research but the modern<br>mechanics mostly needs to face the situation of the long-enduring use of force,<br>and photo-electrical and the Big Bang Theory\u3001\u3001\u3001", "comment_date": "2021-03-09T23:05:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "muhammad fauzi", "comment_text": "Gravity wrong in mechanica quantum, and mechanica quantum wrong in gravity.

For the earth to balance there has to be a lot of magnetic particle pulling the earth away from the sun to create that perfect balance. <a href=\"https://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2013/01/12/why-dont-atoms-collapse-if-they-are-mostly-empty-space/\">https://wtamu.edu/~cbaird/sq/2013/01/12/why-dont-atoms-collapse-if-they-are-mostly-empty-space/</a>", "comment_date": "2021-01-10T20:20:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "anil sharma", "comment_text": "How we found something common in gravitational and coulomb laws ?", "comment_date": "2021-01-10T15:33:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dondlo", "comment_text": "what if you test it in space, without earth or anything affecting objects", "comment_date": "2021-01-08T10:49:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Gede Yogadita Widiana Darma", "comment_text": "should we tell them a but a game that can simulate space. and someone already test 2 tennis ball 1 meter apart and can tuch each other in a really long time?", "comment_date": "2021-01-07T02:46:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Macy F", "comment_text": "Total the gravity.

It was concocted by a Freemason (Newton) in an attempt to prove another Freemason&#39;s theory of a spherical universe and earth. Eric Dubay writes &quot;Long before the theory of gravity was a glimmer in Newton&#39;s imagination, the natural physics of density and buoyancy already perfectly explained why apples fall down. Quite simply, objects fall or rise based on their relative density to the medium surrounding them. Apples fall because they are denser than the air, while helium balloons rise because they are lighter - no &#39;gravity&#39; necessary. This is why raindrops fall down through the air and air-bubbles rise up through water! Everything seeks its relative density and rises or falls until settling accordingly. This is why a tiny pebble sinks to the bottom of the ocean, but gigantic cruise-ships and aircraft carriers stay afloat on the surface, because even though a pebble is so small, its mass relative to its volume (its density) is more than water, so it sinks, and even though a cruise-ship is so large, its mass relative to its volume is less than water, so it floats.\u00a0If Newton&#39;s apple had landed in a puddle instead of on his head, he would have seen the apple only fell through the air because it was denser than the air, but then floated on top of the water because it was less dense than water. Have you ever noticed how its easier to stay afloat with your lungs full of air than it is when they&#39;re empty? Submarines float on the surface when their ballast tanks are filled with air, but when the vents are opened and seawater floods in, they begin to sink as the submarine&#39;s density becomes greater than water. Depending what depth they wish to dive sailors simply adjust the ratio of air/water in the tanks, and when ready to re-surface they blow compressed air into the tanks forcing the seawater out, lowering the density, and thus causing them to rise back to the surface.\u00a0We can also prove this fact of relative density by filling a balloon with approximately half helium and half air. Since helium is lighter than the oxygen, nitrogen and other gases that compose the air around us, filling a balloon with just the right amount of helium to compensate for and balance out the density of the plastic results in a &#39;gravity-defying&#39; levitating balloon at equilibrium that neither rises nor falls!&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-12-27T20:39:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Russell Stephan", "comment_text": "Folks do such a poor job of explaining what gravity is...

General Relativity and Quantum Electrodynamics are both gauge theories and together have been probed to precision of better than 10 decimal places on scales from electrons to neutron stars. That&#39;s an absurdly good coverage. So we can say that gauge theory works at all scales at which we can conduct an observation. If we can agree on which degrees of freedom have local symmetries, we can construct a field theory for it that will be correct to the absolute best of our combined scientific knowledge. That leaves two possibilities. Either Poincare symmetries, which lead to General Relativity as a gauge theory, break down at microscopic scale, or we can apply General Relativity until quantum effects kick in. And we would have seen the effects of the former, because it would actually break relativistic effects in QED as well, and these are some of the best measurements we have in physics! And sure, quantum gravity is a thing, so there&#39;s certainly a scale at which all of this breaks down. But evidence for universal law of gravity being applicable and correct for something like grains of sand is absolutely overwhelming. The kind of elephant that would have to be hiding in proverbial room for this not to be the case and for us to have not found a thorn in particle physics that indicates it is absolutely unprecedented. And a lot of it, like anisotropies of space that would indicate space-time symmetries being different at microscopic scales, people have been actively looking for with zero success for a long time.

Newton&#39;s mathematical treatment in particular needs a minimum of two bodies with a defined geometry in order to derive the mathematical artifact called \u201ccenter\u201d, without which there can be no measurable distance and therefore no force: F\u221dm1m2/r^2<br><br>What is never mentioned today though is, that Newton found it utterly absurd to think that the force of gravity is innate, inherent, and essential to matter: \u201cby their vis insita I mean nothing but their inertia.&quot; which means that the only intrinsic property of mass is its resistance to being set in motion, NOT to attract. According to Newton, that is done by an agent independent of, but acting on masses.<br><br>The often heard mantra \u201cwhere there is mass there is gravity\u201d is therefore absurd in a Newtonian context, especially when we consider that the same people who constantly recite it, will tell you without hesitation the exact contrary : that the most powerful gravity is where there is no mass at all (black hole)\u2026. the concept of something being massive without containing matter is grotesque in any context.<br><br>But once you get detached from reality to such a degree, there is nothing holding you back and you are free to fantasize whatever you need, anything but admitting you got it wrong in the first place. Such is the case with dark matter, a notion so devoid of sense and logic that it can only be called faith. It would mean that - together with the equally absurd notion of dark energy - 96% of the universe does not answer to what we call laws of physics, which is equal to saying we don&#39;t have physics at all, we don&#39;t have physicists with even a shred of a clue: per their own definition!<br><br><br>Another widespread misconception is that we can measure gravity, whence the certainty that it exists.   But the matter of fact is, nobody has ever measured gravity as such, it is only speculatively inferred from measurements of other quantities.   When a body falls, we can measure a rate of displacement of space, or when at rest we can measure a quantity called mass. We can never measure both at the same time, wich we would need to in order to convincingly talk about a gravitational force. When a body falls, there is no measurable mass, and when at rest on the ground then we cannot detect acceleration. <br><br>  Acceleration is the rate of change of displacement of space. Standing on your bathroom scale is NOT \u201cdisplacement of space in time\u201d. <br><br>The contortions made by physicists - notably Einstein - in order to make you believe you are accelerating while reading out your weight, are something to behold - especially in light of the fact that what you are reading out is your mass, not your weight.", "comment_date": "2020-02-22T14:29:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "pilgrimpater", "comment_text": "Its hard to grasp that such a weak force that can be overcome by magnetism, static etc can also keep a planet in orbit millions of miles from the Sun.", "comment_date": "2020-02-21T08:41:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sphakamiso Zondi", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTMELHUAzSM&amp;t=0m57s\">0:57</a> Flat earthers left the chat.", "comment_date": "2020-02-21T03:39:10Z", "likes_count": 47}, {"comment_by": "Daan Smit", "comment_text": "Wasn&#39;t general relativity confirmed by measuring the exact position of Mercury, which slightly deviated from the predictions one would get with newton&#39;s law?

In fact, due to the inductive nature of science, nothing can ever be proven, ever. It can only be disproven. Newton did not want to include gravity into his theories of physics, because of the very fact that he could not prove it. But, his other theories did not work without its inclusion, so he had to include it. And to his credit, as far as we can tell, it is a rather close approximation. But Newton&#39;s theory of gravity just wasn&#39;t good enough. In the early 20th century, Albert Einstein was studying the properties of light and realized there was something wrong with gravity. One of the major evidences was that the planet mercury just did not orbit the sun the way gravity would predict. This is really important because it only takes one counter example to prove something isn&#39;t true. This video pointed out that Newtons theory doesn&#39;t work on a very large scale, so it must not be that it is mass that attracts objects toward one another. So Einstein kept studying gravity to amend its inaccuracies and out of it was born General Relativity, the theory that superseded Newtonian physics and is one of, if not the most successful theory in scientific history. Without Einstein&#39;s contributions, our entire world would be different. And the difference between Newton&#39;s Gravity and Einstein&#39;s Relativity is minuscule (Newton really did come up with a highly effective approximation for his day), but, it is still substantial enough that Gravity couldn&#39;t predict the orbit of Mercury, nor even could our GPS systems work accurately here on Earth were they based on Newton&#39;s theories.", "comment_date": "2019-07-06T01:22:34Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "slice 1", "comment_text": "We need more precise instruments .", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T21:28:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "antonio salgado", "comment_text": "You\u2019re assuming that our gravity doesn\u2019t affect those small objects enough to not understand two unnamed objects.

Newton&#39;s Law is kind of an approximation, which holds most accurately when two massive objects are near each other within the same gravitational field, because gravity is not really the attraction between two masses, but between on mass and every other mass in the universe. So, the yarn and tape will have such a minimal attraction upon each other because the Earth produces much more gravitational force than them, and they&#39;re more attracted to the mass of your hands than to each other due to the larger mass. This confound of noise is part of why we have not and probably will not measure gravity to the same precision of other forces, because the only way to get a truly precise G constant is to measure the attraction between two neutrons in an otherwise massless universe. This is why the small scale is so uncertain, that and Heisenberg&#39;s Uncertainty Principle is a factor to consider at distances and masses that small.

For example the difference between different elements are simply the number of proton particles fused in the nucleus of that that system. Gravity B is also known as the Strong Nuclear Force and is the strongest Force abd acts only over very short distances (Quantum), and is stronger then the electrostatic force that would repel 2 positive charges coming together.  It its theorized that there exists denser &amp; heavier stable elements that are unable to be found on earth or produced in labs (the energy input required to produce even a remotely visible quantity of these heavy elements requires the energy capacity of an entire nation over its lifetime). These heavier and stable elements may form elsewhere in the universe naturally perhaps in binary star systems. It is purported that if photon particles are fired at heavier elements then they could possible create antimatter (annihilation) 100% energy efficiency and denser heavier stable elements when acted on could generate a Strong Nuclear Force that extends beyond the perimeter of the subatomic particles themselves which would then essentially warp space-time around it. If we could essentially create a medium to harness this energy source maybe an alloy meta as bismuth-magnesium, then we could essentially have anti gravity, a means of travel, a means if free energy as this would presume that only a couple hundred grams of a heavy element would be required for an extensive time of power ( 50+ years of continuous power).", "comment_date": "2019-06-30T07:28:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "mrmobius", "comment_text": "Mentions the electrical force as a million billion times stronger than gravity and somehow missed that gravity is not a thing separate from electricity and magnetism.

Because the tiny Ether particles are so much smaller than the particles in atoms (protons, neutron and electrons), this makes Ether much denser than atoms or their particles. And since the Ether fills all the extra space between those atomic particles within the atom, the natural consequence of this     is that the total volume of a given atom ends up being of a lesser density than the same volume of pure Ether outside the atom. <br>Therefore, the difference between the lesser density (due to less Ether) inside the atom vs. the greater density of (pure) Ether outside the atom creates a vacuum effect which pulls the outside Ether toward the inside Ether in an attempt to equalize the pressure. The outside Ether, in turn, pulls the Ether adjacent to it, and that Ether pulls the Ether adjacent to it \u2026 until it encounters the atoms of another solid object. It is just this series of pulling, then, that is the physical cause of gravity. That is, it is nothing more than all the elements involves trying to eliminate the vacuum effect created by the different Ether densities that exist inside and outside of objects. <br>When that second solid object is encountered by the vacuum-pulled Ether, the \u201ctug-o-war winner\u201d between the first solid object and the second solid object will be the object with the greater mass. This is because the object with the greater mass will have less Ether per volume, and thus a greater vacuum-pull on the Ether surrounding it. And since Ether is so densely packed, an object of lesser mass (lesser Ether vacuum) is pulled toward objects of greater mass (greater Ether vacuum) virtually instantaneously. [For the religious, the Ether is simply the Firmament created on Day 2 of the Genesis story. I.e. space is not a vacuum but is filled with Ether.

I think the bigger thing to keep in mind is that the &quot;force of gravity&quot; may be better to think of as a warp in space time so logically it makes sense to say that while we can&#39;t necessarily test extremely small scales of gravity we can make the observation that some form of mass should have a gravitational effect that causes some difference.

That situation actually exist: electron theoretically were predicted to travel at the same speeds as photon because they are a similar particle/wave but the fact that electrons not only don&#39;t travel at the speed of light but are also affected more by gravity than photon in a manner that we can test with Newton&#39;s Law of gravitation implies that it is fairly consistent at small scales as well.<br>True we can only get indirect evidence for this but that&#39;s not the same as no experimental evidence.", "comment_date": "2019-06-25T03:40:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kuppuswamy ts", "comment_text": "I agree.Yes perhaps even for attraction between two light masses independent of any other forces of gravity.I did not know this!Gravitational force is a invisible wonder of Nature of Universe.", "comment_date": "2019-06-25T03:34:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Carlos Grant", "comment_text": "I was waiting the entire video for him to explain that gravity doesn&#39;t exist (as a pulling force) and that gravity is a by product of the way mass distorts spacetime.", "comment_date": "2019-06-25T03:04:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "\u041b\u0435\u0432 \u041b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0443", "comment_text": "&quot;Our Ignorance About Gravity&quot; is a brilliant idea for a video.

While other physical phenomena are explained by forces, which are particle interactions whose influences on acceleration are inversely proportional to the mass of the things being accelerated, the spacetime model portrays gravity as a distortion in the spacetime coordinate system. Thus a thing doesn&#39;t move toward another thing because a force is pulling on it, but instead because its future (since time is just another direction in spacetime) leans into spacial coordinates. Or, with another approach, the &quot;closeness&quot; and &quot;farness&quot; of things is distorted in four dimensions in such a way that an object&#39;s perceived curved path around an object is really just a straight line when the coordinate system is &quot;re-normalized&quot;. Either way, what we have is that a thing just <i>will</i> go that way, and since we tend to agree that mass is the thing that resists changes, the &quot;force&quot; of gravity is something we essentially &quot;create&quot; to explain why a feather and a bowling ball accelerate toward the surface of the moon at the same rate. Gravity as a &quot;force&quot; makes the phenomenon easier to understand from our own basic experiences of forces.<br><br>The problem with the approach of perceiving things from our own experiences is that there are four (three? three and a half?) fundamental forces, but at human scale, pretty much everything we experience comes from the electromagnetic force. Ice is hard, and water is all liquidy? Electromagnetic forces. Your tongue detects saltiness? Electromagnetic forces. Your brain tells your hand to click the mouse to order more salt? Electromagnetic forces. You punch a brick wall and it hurts? Electromagnetic forces. Copper dissolving in acid? Electromagnetic forces. Aerodynamic lift? Electromagnetic forces. Radio transmission? Electromagnetic forces. Your CPU doing a billion things every second? Electromagnetic forces. An electric motor? Electromagnetic forces. Reading a floppy disk? Electromagnetic forces. Reading a CD with a laser beam? Electromagnetic forces. Reading an SD card? Electromagnetic forces. Using a radioactive isotope to monitor digestion? OK, the underlying radiation thing is not the electromagnetic force (I mean, it is a little bit), but the way we detect that radiation is entirely based on electromagnetic forces. MRI, X-ray, blood glucose, O2 saturation, hydrogen breath test? Electromagnetic forces.<br><br>Most of us don&#39;t &quot;experience&quot; the decay of an atom. And we don&#39;t &quot;appreciate&quot; the coherence of an atomic nucleus, a lump of positively charged particles and neutral particles that somehow doesn&#39;t explode into pieces instantaneously. <br><br>We intuitively understand electromagnetic forces. And with every other physical interaction we experience, we try to find a model that explains it in those same terms essentially. And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s nearly enough. That&#39;s not an original idea. That&#39;s why the fundamental forces are plural in the first place.<br><br>I do think that the inverse square law applies to gravity.

The empirical measure of weight, which scales measure as force associated with accelerated mass in gravitational fields. And the empirical measure of time, clocks demonstrating time dilation effect associated with gravitational fields. \r<br>\r<br>Ask yourself the question, what is the relationship between these two distinct empiricals associated with gravitational fields? Conventional theory does not span this conceptual gap. \r<br>\r<br>I know what the relationship is. Its really simple and it is empirically verified. It is an account of how force and time are associated with one another. Here&#39;s a clue, springs can serve as the primary function of scales and clocks. Scales that measure weight, and clocks that measure time both associated with springs! The explanation for why springs serve this dual purpose, also reveals the relationship between measures of weight and measures of time. \r<br>\r<br>All time keeping devices are force driven systems, and somehow this universal truth is entirely absent within conventional scientific accounts that would benefit from defining what the property of time is. For correctly defining what time is, is a means for extending Relativity theory. Relativity theory can be associated with a dilated value of atomic forces, that is empirically demonstrated by clock functions that are in essence &quot;force driven devices that measure the parameter of time. \r<br>\r<br>&quot;Time is therefore nothing more and nothing less than a measure of force driven change. There is a world of insight gained from this simple realization, and considerations of it laid alongside conventional theories. If theory contradicts this simple and unarguable observation, then you know it has gone astray. \r<br>\r<br>Force drives clocks, therefore clocks measure force.
