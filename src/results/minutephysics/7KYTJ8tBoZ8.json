That is not science its conjecture!  Science is the study based on facts, and until the unknowns are proven, thru repeatable science, then they are not &quot;fact&quot;.  There are so many, many, many conjectures going on in the Big Bang Theory that it boggles me that any true scientist would take it seriously at this point.  Some of the basic leaps are that for this origin of an instant, the physics that they use to explain parts of it are no longer relevant and are thrown out so they can move on with the rest of it.  Just for example for the Big Bang to have populated the mass of the universe in the very few stages in the beginning, matter would have to have traveled at several times the speed of light to make the expanse.  So, is E=MC2 real or convenient? They can&#39;t have it both ways.  I think they want so desperate to provide a solution they are not willing to wait on their ability to understand the science to catch up so they can indeed prove it.

It is not an event horizon exactly because it depends on energetic charge of the single wormhole bearing particle\u00a0to determine distance rather than mass.<br><br>The wormhole is unlikely to ever deliver a packet to infinity as probability begins at<br>0 an moves to 100% chance of being the optimal location to appear away from the particle, then begins to fall again towards 0 the farther the distance towards infinity.\u00a0<br><br>The distance to which the wormhole deposits it&#39;s output packet should depend on the amount of energy cycling through the particle that houses it. The stabalizing structure of the particle is what holds the input in place and collects the returning energy from free space.<br><br>When empty quantum space falls to the input aperture it carries a small charge that is attracted to the energy cycling through the wormhole from the particle. this feeds the quantum space in and the energetic state of the particle determines how far out the output will appear.<br><br>The actual output may be a single point but it will not necessarily be the same point every time. With a quantum wormhole there is a small radius around the input aperture of the wormhole where probability determines the output should reintroduce the contents of the wormhole back into the quantum foam.<br><br>When the quantum space particle reappears it carries off a small charge and reappears at the point of least resistance in a direction away from the particle that<br>transported it. should it appear closer to another particle it will instead be drawn into that particle and impart a portion of it&#39;s charge or withdraw a portion of charge from this other particle and reappear with yet another charge level as it is cycled out again.<br><br>this leads to energy passing between nearby bodies and a tendency towards kinetic equilibrium.<br><br>In the presence of multiple wormholes, for instance a large massive body, a virtual communal\u00a0inverse aperture is created with a very large distance although all apertures actually remain separate.<br><br>The virtual state creates a center of gravity devoid of free flowing space, a spatial area of negative pressure if you will, that reduces from the communal r0 as one travels outwards from it towards what is in practice the outermost bounds to which the free space can be flung.<br><br>the effect could be described as a perpetual flow of space towards the center that is constantly carrying just enough charge to transport itself back to exactly the distance it fell from unless further interaction with other mass/particles/flows occurs on it&#39;s journey to change it&#39;s charge level.<br><br>The effects of this being\u00a0an object of sufficient mass\u00a0will result in a flow of space so rapid that nothing can move through the flow of space at a rate to counter the flow, objects of any mass will spontaneously move towards each other and attempt to match velocities (measurable within reason, distance is a factor), this effect will quickly be drowned out as space is behaving as a fluid whose level can never drop.<br><br>an tangible\u00a0approximation would be taking a large pool of water and opening\u00a0a drain but instead of actually draining the pool out simply pump the water back in through random tubes encircling the drain.", "comment_date": "2015-07-29T12:51:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin Bigger", "comment_text": "@MinutePhysics <br>I thought there was %4 matter %21 dark matter and the rest dark energy.

Without some origin of the laws, there wouldn&#39;t be any laws of physics, or anything else.<br>.<br>As for &quot;hope&quot; for there to be a God, well, without one there would be no thing from which everything could come from. Science can&#39;t answer the question so it continually backs-up the chain of life as it discovers things in the Now. However it cannot answer the ultimate question of Being. I think scientists are frustrated at that paradox. Substituting the inability to answer the paradox causes such immense frustration that that vacuum is filled with a &quot;positive&quot; declaration that there is no God because science has no evidence. This however is an illusion because all being is the evidence.<br>.<br>I&#39;m guessing you see the problem. Hope is the expectation of good things to come, in the face of lack of evidence. Without hope, all that remains is nihilism - that being cannot be understood and life is meaningless.<br>.<br>Atheists in general - I know and meet with them regularly - seem to believe that people should be happy for some reason, without knowing anything about ultimate causes or eventual outcomes. IMO, this is absurd and dangerous as it opens the door for existential morality that anyone can define any way they like just because they think they can. They claim they are using science as a guide which is OK as long as they don&#39;t use the findings to justify some new morality that creates disorder and negative outcomes.<br><br>I&#39;ll copy/paste this to the top of the comments as threads often get lost as time goes by.", "comment_date": "2015-07-27T19:14:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rA rose", "comment_text": "Everyone saying we don&#39;t know so god did it lol...

It is not something, that tries to deny creationism, it is something exploring the world and trying to understand how it works. That means, if the universe was created by a god, that is what science would find ultimatively. That is the same reason why &quot;supernatural&quot; things can&#39;t posibly exist, because if they did, by definition they wouldn&#39;t be supernatural (because natural means things that exist).<br><br>Of course it may be, that science in the future will find, that a god created the world, but it is a common measure to make as few extraordinary assumptions in science as possible and until now there has been no known instance that a god is the NECECARY cause of something.

A lot of people are saying that when he says things like &quot;reasons unknown&quot; a lot that is pointing to some sort of supreme being or &quot;God&quot; if you will. That is not necessarily true, but it is not necessarily false either. Someone in the comments said &quot;It&#39;s like we have 75% of a puzzle, so we make up the other 25% in a way which makes the most sense to us.&quot; I feel like that sums it up really well. Think about it this way: A really bad car crash happens and there are no survivors or witnesses. The people tasked with investigating this crash have a lot of facts to go by, and can figure out pretty much what happened. However, without actually being there to see it happen they can&#39;t know 100% for sure exactly what happened. But they can make educated guesses based on past knowledge and research. The universe is sort of the same way. Yes that is a really basic analogy but what I&#39;m saying is that without being there to actually experience the creation of the universe, we don&#39;t actually know. Saying that because we don&#39;t have all the answers means that there has to be a God is ridiculous. Also, saying that because the big bang and evolution have been scientifically proven that must disprove a God is ridiculous. Almost every argument for or against a god can be countered by the same argument; for example if someone says &quot;well if the universe wasn&#39;t created by a god then what created it?&quot; that can be countered by &quot;well if god created the universe then what created god?&quot; and vice versa. So I say live the life you want to live. Explore the origins of the universe if you wish. Believe that God created everything in an instant if that&#39;s what you believe. Share your opinions with the world, but don&#39;t hate other people for not believing the same thing you do. Every single person has their own path to take, their own journey, and their own questions to answer.

It concerns the (higher than ten solar-mass) origin of intermediate-mass elements.<br><br>Using a basic prescription of the initial mass function it is easy to calculate that about 96% of all matter contained in (pre, peri and post) helium-burning stars will be on the low-mass (less than 8 solar masses) end. These stars will eventually end-up on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), after which they will blow themselves out in a beautiful planetary nebula (PN). During the AGB phase, some simple thermonuclear fusion is periodically (see thermal pulse (TP)) turning H into He and He into C and O. However, in the He intershell the s-process thrives, producing a wide spectrum of heavier elements up to bismuth and polonium. Via large-scale convective motions all this enriched material is dredged up (third dredge-up) to the surface of the star, where it is ejected via pulsations (kappa mechanism) and forms a cool, molecule-rich and dust-rich stellar wind. This wind increases in intensity until the entire mantle of the star is ejected, and only the bare C/O core remains (PN + white dwarf).<br><br>The interstellar medium (ISM) is thus primarily enriched with low- and intermediate-mass elements via this process.\u00a0<br><br>I hope I have provoked your curiosity on the matter, and anticipate the moment when you&#39;ll give some credit to the hard work of my darling AGB stars :)<br><br>\u00a0&quot;The cosmos is also within us, we are (mainly) made of (lower-than-eight-solar-mass) star stuff&quot;.", "comment_date": "2015-07-22T10:41:59Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Hannah Grace", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23KeepLookingUp\">#KeepLookingUp</a> \u00a0&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3", "comment_date": "2015-07-22T09:10:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bacchus2018", "comment_text": "Nice video!
