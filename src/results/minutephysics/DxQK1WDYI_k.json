Every time I encounter this, it seems the topic just zooms past the &#39;death&#39; part to get to the &#39;neat&#39; stuff. The problem is still real. If you deconstruct your atoms and move, copy, or clone them elsewhere... ~YOU~ are dead. A clone, that is NOT you (but thinks it IS you) has been created. You don&#39;t NOTICE it because you are killed at the same time the clone is made...YOU have died when your body is taken apart. YOUR future is OVER when you &#39;teleport&#39; and a clone of you starts living. You do not stop living for a second, then continue living again in the NEW location and new body. That is ...unbelievable. Your consciousness is a result of all your neurons interacting inside your body. (That&#39;s what consciousness is: your PHYSICAL neurons) You can&#39;t &#39;transfer&#39; consciousness. It is the physical makeup of your brain. Deconstruction ENDS consciousness. You are ONLY making a clone. How is this not understood? \r<br>\r<br>Think about it this way. You go into the teleporter and it &#39;teleports&#39; (makes a clone of) you across the room, but doesn&#39;t &#39;deconstruct&#39; you yet. (It just... waits for a second or two) You SEE yourself appear on the other side of the room, but YOU are still in the teleporter. You see the CLONE of you walking off, thinking IT is you... and THEN the teleporter machine you are standing in KILLS- er... deconstructs you. Ask yourself. Does your consciousness NOW suddenly fly over to the clone&#39;s body and ERASE the clone&#39;s consciousness so YOU can now control it? Does your consciousness exist in BOTH locations at once? Does the EXACT replica clone of you (with the same brain and neurons as you) somehow just stay an empty shell, a dead body, until your consciousness &#39;flies&#39; over to it?

When you mentioned what would happen to the original &quot;CAT&quot; once it was teleported you said it would be in a superposition with every possible three letter configuration but i don&#39;t see how that is possible since the original &quot;CAT&quot; was made up of the three letters c,a,t and in order to have any configuration of letters that contained letters beside c,a,t that would imply the teleportation process would have created new matter which is impossible since we know that matter cannot be created nor destroyed only change form. What would actually happen is the original &quot;CAT&quot; would enter a superposition of every possible configuration of those three letters c,a,t.<br><br>2. This would imply there is a chance the original &quot;CAT&quot; would remain in its original configuration even if the chance of that happening is extremely low, which would mean there is a very low chance that after the original &quot;CAT&quot; has been &quot;teleported&quot; by reconfiguring matter somewhere else to reform into the &quot;CAT&quot;, the original could end up not changing at all as if nothing had happened while the teleported version forms essentially creating an exact copy in other words a clone which earlier in the video you stated is impossible. <br><br>3. There fore either it is possible to clone using this method or the method is impossible to begin with and this doesn&#39;t even take into consideration the moral and or philosophical implications created by using this method.<br><br>4. This entire method is not necessary because using wormholes we can just connect two points in spacetime allowing for instant travel in other words teleportation as theorized by Einsteins theory of general relativity rendering this entire process redundant to begin with.<br><br>If i missed any thing or am wrong about something please correct me but as far as i know everything i have stated above is correct.", "comment_date": "2021-01-09T05:00:46Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Nika Pokrovsky", "comment_text": "So teleportation is just.. school level ptobability?", "comment_date": "2021-01-08T08:16:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christo", "comment_text": "Nasa just transmitted data over 44kilometers a week or 2 ago using this", "comment_date": "2021-01-07T16:10:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daleb", "comment_text": "Forgot the 4th kind, benzodiaz\u00e9pines.", "comment_date": "2021-01-07T08:33:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "OudeicratAnnachrista", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxQK1WDYI_k&amp;t=11m03s\">11:03</a> &quot;after we beam them the message...&quot; this is a pretty important bit that most people miss and instead think the teleportation can be done solely by manipulating the entangled pair without transmitting anything else.

If you&#39;d then understand all things are actually just wavy bits then why not just translate the waves and move them and technically this thing that exists as a wave on one side would simply be moving in a mode that is similar to being on a train. Once you get to the location you put the light back through the other end of the prism. Or the sound through the other end of the voice modifier. Or the atomic state of all things into a simp whole other worldly wobbly state. The reason why translation teleportation in the so-called Magic referred to in the beginning of the video has been ignored and quantum entanglement has been the only substitute is because translation of matter in this form of sinking of the part of holes and literally translating every particle requires a large amount of concentration on every single individual whole different and vastly varying components which are usually in a state of momentum like blood flow through your heart and circulatory system or neurons firing in your brain. But let&#39;s say that we&#39;re able to actually translate a person into this other dimension like walking in the window and ending up in a state of say one or two measures more or less wobbly and then reverting back to a single state of wobbliness. Say the atomic structure of hydrogen was wobbly state of one. The translation would make the hydrogen turn into a form of light resembling hydrogen or Red Spectrum light for example and carbon would be translated from its physical state into blue light. All it would take would be to turn down the amplitude at the arrival and you would end up with a teleported item. What was Hangul meant is seemingly more functionally realistic the idea of turning something or someone into a state of light can provide a faster mode of transportation or that is to say it could provide an answer to how to then use entanglement however that would mean you would have to be made out of entangled parts. Somehow all of your crazy and varying Parts would have to be made in a copy which really entanglement will not result ever improper teleportation so stop it. Because we already know the even if you can do that you will end up with something that is not the same as what you started off with from its destination. although you will be able to reorganize somehow and entire purse given enough functional control and focus you will never be able to ask the move said item. but then you say that experiments show that a complex atomic structure has been able to move over a certain distance which automatically just proves my theory of you can&#39;t. In order to know if you could move a person or any organism you would have to be able to move something that has a signal like a simple neuron and it has to be sending the same signal once it arrives. Or something like that. but then we still don&#39;t know what actually makes up the person&#39;s soul because it&#39;s not in the mind and it&#39;s not in the body but is connected to some part of the body and the body is completely replaced every so much time when you talk about all the atomic parts that make up it. if I were to tell you that the components of atomic matter that you were made of one year ago are completely alien to the atomic particles that you are made of now you would like the be startled. But we already know that this is the case. The head in a jar experiment is an analogy proving that it does not take your entire body in order to hold your consciousness. what if all it took was a part of your brain and a part of maybe some of your senses? what if the Consciousness could be limited to a smaller brain and our mind designed with a completely different set of blueprints like the size of a mouse brain but just as complex as required to hold a human in it. a slight genetic transformation would allow us to then change the person over time so that as they grow up they grow smaller. this would grant us the ability to make a purse who had the functionability similar to that of pickle Rick. only this can actually happen. so if we can transfer mind from someone who is Big to someone who&#39;s small technically we can do the opposite but we could also transfer our mind from someone to something. let&#39;s say that parts of my mind we replaced not with atomic particles but with robot like functions or robotics itself. our soul would still latched to the parts of our body that are normally associated with the human body but over time the control of our mind and the control of the robotic mind would be interchangeable. basically you can do the opposite of what they did with vision mine back into a body or the body into a mind. If a set of signals sense by your brain could be translated into a larger organism such as the internet? Isn&#39;t it then possible that anyone could be digitized. but it is not a simple or is it like the example of moving an object with your mind a sensor placed on the head allowing you to think about moving a drone or a hand and then watching that robotic hand for a drone move the way you wanted it to. and although you can send her your signal he that drone your soul does not go into drone or return from the drone to you. because it&#39;s as similar as you control a video game you get immersed but you&#39;re still in your own body. what would it take to actually extend your body so that you could move into a new house? this idea of moving the soul into a new house is in fact part of if not all of the solution for teleportation. ensuring that there is not a copy.", "comment_date": "2020-02-18T12:56:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chad Wolford", "comment_text": "Wtf I didn&#39;t understand any of that???

He builds a time machine, and accidentally kills his grandfather. Now what to do? He watches his video on the Grandfather&#39;s paradox to resolve the situation, but while he was doing so 3blue1brown captured him and forced him to work in the attic to upload a video on Feynman&#39;s Lost Lecture, all the while stealing the time machine to do things on his own. Eventually minutephysics escaped but he has very little time before the fleas become useless. So he tries to learn relativity to slow down time, but since he is constant pressure to upload videos he had to upload an entire series. With his now-useless cat in his hand and very little fuel in his rocket, he needs to find a way to get energy from a cat, which he researches, finding that Norway goes through 150 billion cats a year. He patents a new solution and throws the cat in a black hole. He also throws the fleas, in, too, since they have long since decohered and lost their special entanglement properties.

An orbital can hold two electrons, but they must face away from each other to fit because they are both negatively charged (think shoes in a shoebox).

If that&#39;s the case, then they&#39;re only teleporting data, not particles.

The Egyptians didn&#39;t count by 10s, or base ten, they counted by 12s, or base twelve because one of your hands has twelve joints along the fingers. My point is on the surface, it doesn&#39;t matter what base we use in our maths, but in critical functions of the universe, what if we needed to use base 4? It would make sense because there are 16 quarks, and the square root of 16 is 4, and in the video, they used two quark spin variables, producing base 4 states, which is also how quantum computers should run. The normal computer uses boolean logic which runs in base two, true and false (1, 0) but in quantum computers there are three states, true, false, and truefalse, but using the logic they did in the teleportation, then there should be 4 states not three, there needs to be true, false, truefalse, and false true. Also, on a 2D plane, you could only look in two directions, left and right, 1, or 0, just like normal computers, base two, but our universe is 4 dimensions, so you can look upon the three dimensions of space and the dimension of time.

We can entangle just two, or better, four atoms in pairs, and we can teleport just information (binary code), instantly, across whatever distance. This will revolutionize space communication. Imagine ultra-high-speed Internet across the entire Solar System, or even across different solar systems. Once you achieve that... you could just scan an object or person and build an exact same replica on the other side. Provided that you have all the materials to build it there.
