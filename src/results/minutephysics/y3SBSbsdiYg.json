I\u2019m just trying to piece this together. There\u2019s stimulated absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission. Let\u2019s say that we start with a row of 3 hydrogen atoms, all with electrons in excited states due to stimulated absorption. By my understanding, the first atom\u2019s electron will drop down to its meta state and then emit a photon, ultimately dropping down to its ground state. This emitted photon will go to the next hydrogen atom who\u2019s electron is sitting at the meta state level. Once this photon reaches that electron, it will cause stimulated emission whereby that electron will immediately drop down to the ground state and simultaneously release a photon. The reason for these spontaneous emissions and stimulated emissions is due to quantum mechanics. The air we breathe has ten septillion atoms per centimetre cubed, the best laboratory vacuums on earth maybe around 10 billion per centimetre cubed, interplanetaryspace at 10 million per, interstellar space at maybe a couple thousand per 10 cubic centimetres, and intergalactic space where a cube with 200,000km dimensions has the same amount of atoms as the air that occupies your refrigerator. There\u2019s a lot more particles that we don\u2019t know about though called virtual particles that pop in and out of existence. These excited states are extremely unstable, so it\u2019s theorized that virtual particles poppingin and out of existence cause electrons to fall back down. We also know that particles prefer to exist in a state that consumes the least amount of energy.  Now 2 photons are around. Then these photons will travel to the third hydrogen atom. Since some time has passed its likely that the electron in the third atom will have dropped down to its ground state before the 2 fore-mentioned photons arrive to relieve it of its photon. This means the third atom will spontaneously emit a photon, usually in a random direction, not the same direction as the 2 other photons in motion. This process happens over and over until there is a build up of photons - some of which can be emitted through the partial mirror. This is my basic understanding of it.", "comment_date": "2022-07-01T14:27:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "G Stone", "comment_text": "Photons do not always want to be together.

When i first learned about the uncertainty principle, i parsed it as &quot;we can only know position or velocity because of the way we measure&quot; implying that there was a way to measure both, even if only in magical theory land and never in reality. Because we tend to relate everything to what we can experience, i was still subconsciously thinking of electrons and photons as &quot;objects&quot;. But i later realized that the duality is litteraly unknowable, even theoretically, because photons and electrons arent like anything were used to. They arent lines or dots, and they dont operate on the kind of logic we do.<br><br>I once was watching a lecture on how one could sorta try to visualize 4D shapes, and it just became so obvious that stuff like this just operates on a completely different plane. We can try to kinda mush it into something that we can sorta make sense of, but in reality its as incomprehensible to us as imagining a new color. Its just beyond the ability of our brains.

Bravo for explaining Bosonic exchange in an easy to understand way, but that has absolutely nothing to do with stimulated emission. Hence why your phone flashlight doesn&#39;t randomly turn into a laser, and why the coherence you get from them are much, much higher than this argument implies.<br><br><br>As for how it actually works, when an electron is in an excited state, it can &quot;absorb&quot; a photon that matches the energy of an electronic transition from a lower energy state to the current energy state, and it when it does that it spits out two photons which are identical to the &quot;absorbed&quot; photon. This is stimulated emission, and because it turns 1 photon into 2 photons, you can use it to amplify light. You do this by first finding a material that can feasibly achieve a population inversion (more electrons in excited states than the ground state) and a couple of other desirable properties that are too technical for a youtube comment. Slap two highly reflecting mirrors around that material to speed up the stimulated emission (more photons=more likely for a photon to &quot;absorb&quot;=more stimulated emission=more photons=... ad nauseum). Congratulations, you have a laser. There are more things you can do to increase the quality of the laser/some important technical details are ignored, but that&#39;s the gist of it. &quot;Absorb&quot; was in quotation marks throughout this because it&#39;s not technically absorption, but thinking of it as absorption followed by emission of two photons is so close to what&#39;s happening that basically all laser people think of it like that in real life.", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T05:23:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CharlesThaDancer", "comment_text": "So its like the rainbow ball in Homescapes?", "comment_date": "2019-07-01T10:10:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "redstone craft guy", "comment_text": "How do you excite the atoms?", "comment_date": "2019-06-27T14:12:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yohan Salda\u00f1a", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3SBSbsdiYg&amp;t=0m36s\">0:36</a><br>They can either be in the same state:<br>\u2191           <b>\u2193</b><br><b>\u2191</b>           \u2193<br><br>Or in the different state:<br>\u2191           <b>\u2191</b><br><b>\u2193</b>           \u2193<br><br>Aren&#39;t they both in different states?", "comment_date": "2019-06-15T13:02:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Skumo Mcbee", "comment_text": "Here&#39;s my understanding. 1.
