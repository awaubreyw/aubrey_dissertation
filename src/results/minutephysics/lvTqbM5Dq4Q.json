So basically, encryption involves trying to find the factors of a very large number, but nobody has found a computationally efficient way to do that beyond randomly guessing factors. Shor&#39;s Algorithm makes a guess as well, but it&#39;s much more efficient under the right circumstances. It&#39;s been proven that you can take any two numbers that do not have common prime factors, and if you multiply them by themselves enough times they will nearly converge by being close by 1. Rearranging all that a bit with equations and you can define both variables as one variable called &quot;P&quot;, which is the number of times each of these factors would have to multiply themselves by to equal eachother (plus 1). Shor&#39;s algorithm tries to find P, and with that it can factor any number. The algorithm still isn&#39;t that useful for regular computers, but it works really well for Quantum computers. Quantum computers work with probabilities because quantum mechanics is weird. Basically, because of the probabilistic nature of quantum computers when you input the number and algorithm the incorrect answers cancel each other out, leaving you with P, and the ability to factor the number.", "comment_date": "2021-07-14T02:53:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thiago Lucas", "comment_text": "Other videos: Watch at 2x, no problem<br>This video: Watch at 0.75x, stop from time to time, think about the implications, press play again", "comment_date": "2021-07-12T00:33:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Silenced And Shadow Banned", "comment_text": "So can we use quantum computers to to keep our data safe?", "comment_date": "2021-07-09T23:51:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stefano Monni", "comment_text": "I love those videos, but I&#39;m impressed how fast  they are aging.", "comment_date": "2021-07-07T11:41:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phil Torrez", "comment_text": "So what will happen with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies alike if/when quantum computers become more accessible?", "comment_date": "2021-07-05T08:33:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Co0INaMe", "comment_text": "&quot;shors algorithm&quot; <br>soooooooooo<br>bathesda?", "comment_date": "2021-07-04T03:06:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lucien EADG", "comment_text": "&quot;If this makes you worried about your online safety&quot;<br><br>Yeah I&#39;m also very worried about that padlock I just bought, is it secure enough for my tent?", "comment_date": "2021-07-03T11:16:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jan Ra\u00dffeld", "comment_text": "I have a couple of questions :)<br>How does the Computer get from |k,g^k&gt; to |k,r_k&gt;: (at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTqbM5Dq4Q&amp;t=9m50s\">9:50</a>) We have to somehow manipulate the particles to achieve this via a Quantumgate but how does that work?<br><br>Moreover, how does the computer store the information in the particles which are used to compute?<br><br><br>I know, this video is simplified, but if you would measure the state at a given moment, wouldnt you get a 0 or a 1 because we are using Qbits, which are only 0 or 1?", "comment_date": "2021-07-02T23:18:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Habil Er", "comment_text": "Anyone Get Anything Becouse I didn&#39;t", "comment_date": "2021-07-01T11:05:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William John", "comment_text": "Investing in crypto now is very cool especially with the current rise in the market now", "comment_date": "2021-06-28T23:11:31Z", "likes_count": 24}, {"comment_by": "No", "comment_text": "17-minute physics", "comment_date": "2021-06-28T12:49:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maucaz alv", "comment_text": "<b>Use a quantum computer to enter to his old accounts where he forget the password</b>", "comment_date": "2021-06-25T12:42:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tanner Hageman", "comment_text": "Wait you said around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTqbM5Dq4Q&amp;t=14m15s\">14:15</a> &quot;as long as p is even.&quot; Did you mean to say &quot;as long as p is an integer,&quot; or does p just refer to an arbitrary integer?

So based off of that, I&#39;m guessing the idea of a quantum computer is that instead of just being 1s and 0s, it can be a 1, 0, or both a 1 and 0 at the same time. Last thing I think I get is a superposition is when something is in 2 of these mutually exclusive states at the same time.<br><br>   So with that all out of the way, the only thing I don&#39;t understand at all is why superpositions are necessary to perform this algorithm quickly enough. You said that multiple potential answers would be output from one input, and that &#39;negative interference&#39; will cause the incorrect ones to gradually cancel out until there&#39;s one left - I assume what is meant by this is that there will be multiple possible answers to begin with because there are unknowns that we can think of like unobserved particles in both states at once, but as we find out what these unknowns are or &#39;observe&#39; them we find contradicting information that means some of the answers can&#39;t be true and they assume one state or another. The sine wave you used in your example actually really helped me there, because I make electronic music, and that analogy helped me put this principle into a context I understand - the principle I think being that with enough &#39;samples&#39; (possibilities) the &#39;phase cancellation&#39; (contradicting facts) will average out the waveform at the correct &#39;amplitude&#39; (factor to break encryption).<br><br>   What I don&#39;t get is how that can&#39;t be done already by just storing all the possible outcomes and checking if they make sense without using superpositions, or is every possibility &#39;checked&#39; at once all at the same time in the same time it would take to check just one without superpositions?

This is relevant because it identifies a theme, as new quantum computing technology, or technology in general advances, we eliminate traditional options for ensuring security. To simplify, security is ensured via looking at the fundamental functionality of systems in place. The easiest explanation being encryption, as while it technically can be cracked, it works so effectively because we know that with current systems, it will take an amount of time to solve that is longer than the issue will be relevant. As this video shows however, due to the fundamentally different nature of quantum computing, traditional encryption is rendered useless by the fact that the amount of time to crack encryption with quantum computers is no longer too long to be viable.

When making the key stronger, if it adds two zeros to the time for my pc, it adds one zero to the quantum pc so 11 days becomes 1100 (3 something years) and the quantum pc takes 100 seconds or a minute and 40 seconds.<br><br>If you have a 2048 bit encryption key let&#39;s say it takes 1,000,000 years to crack the key with my PC (just pulling a number out of my ass for time). If you DOUBLE the number of bits to make it a 4096 bit key, it will square the time taken, which so happens to be the ratio of the quantum computer&#39;s time. So it would take a quantum PC that&#39;s just as fast as my pc the same time to crack a 4096 bit key as it would for my pc to crack a 2048 bit key.<br><br>As you can see, all you need to do to make encryption keys strong enough to defend against quantum PC&#39;s is double the number of bits used for the key, which is trivial. ALSO quantum computers are NO WHERE CLOSE to being as fast, operations per second-wise, as a normal computer, and it&#39;s thought they never will be comparable. Much faster for doing a specific task because it can do it in less steps, but far fewer steps taken in the same period of time.", "comment_date": "2019-05-17T10:52:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jamie lunes", "comment_text": "What?\ud83d\ude0e", "comment_date": "2019-05-17T03:38:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jamie Mann", "comment_text": "Dashlane installed itself onto my computer without prompting when installing other programs took me over an hour to get it off my system as it refused to uninstall till I found a site that told me what to do so I could get it off my system, it might be a good program as you say, But it&#39;s things like this that make me stick with other password managers I don&#39;t trust any program that behaves this badly.  otherwise this was a great video :) (Sorry to rant happened just yesterday so its still raw on my nerves)", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T23:45:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kamil Macieja", "comment_text": "Im High af and this is Way to long stop it right no", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T22:48:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cody Osborn", "comment_text": "I was lost about two minutes in, but kept watching because it was fascinating!", "comment_date": "2019-05-16T19:29:29Z", "likes_count": 113}, {"comment_by": "Samuel P", "comment_text": "I gave up somewhere in the middle...", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T21:36:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lionel Florit", "comment_text": "Fantastic explanation, thank you!", "comment_date": "2019-05-15T18:19:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blen Miner", "comment_text": "But even if you get the key isn&#39;t the decryption method always different?

Limiting the amount of numbers to this very specific equation effectively &quot;eliminates&quot; a whole third of the possible outcomes.<br>It&#39;s actually scary how easy it <i>seems</i> to break, now that I see that equation, but you do explain why it&#39;s hard for modern computers and that&#39;s precisely what my suspicions were.<br>My somewhat simple understanding of how quantum computers could work with this is it could effectively eliminate a portion of the numbers for P, so only then do you realistically have to guess a fraction of that third of possible numbers, g. Turns out, it scares me even more that you say that g and P are likely to share factors, too. Imagine only having 1/3 of numbers as potential outcomes, and that same 1/3 of numbers are ALSO what the factors of P could be. That would split the fraction of a third, into a half of a fraction of a third. EVEN BETTER YOU CAN TAKE THOSE SAME NUMBERS, COMPUTE MANY RESULTS OF MANY NUMBERS, CANCEL OUT THE FREQUENCIES OF LESSER PROBABILITY RESULTS, AND GET A RESULT THAT IS A FRACTION OF A FRACTION OF A THIRD OF YOUR GUESSES.<br>Goddamn that&#39;s insane. I wish I would have known of the equation a lot sooner because I never really understood how great a quantum computer could be at destroying modern encryption. Plus, knowing how a quantum computer could crack the encryption, you can start making equations that force quantum computers to take longer.

This is also called public-key cryptography, since the encryption key is public, but the decryption key is private.<br>What&#39;s the point of asymmetric encryption? It is an essential component of a Diffie-Hellman exchange, which is the most common way for two parties meeting for the first time to establish a shared secret over insecure communications. In other words, it&#39;s a method for two people or computers to settle on a password they both know, but making sure no one else knows even if they listened in on the entire conversation. That shared password is then generally used for symmetric encryption of the actual data over that same insecure channel.

Since they entire internet relies on this for secure communication, a man in the middle listening in with a future quantum computer could decipher most of the secrets they hear.

Even though I am, I urge you to check out the wikipedia page on Grover&#39;s algorithm, a random search algorithm that is the most efficient at breaking symmetric cryptography in O(sqrt(n)) time which brings AES256 to 128 bits of security; this is still momentous. <br><br><br><br>One thing that I would like to add. Near the beginning you said that encryption was like a lock, we can add more but eventually someone will get through. This is not quite true due to the vast size of the numbers we use and the rate at which the problem complexity grows with respect to the problem size. If we take a look at symmetric encryption (this is for simpler calculations. prime factorization is O(exp(sqrt(nlog^2(n))))) which would lead to less nice numbers but it is similar in spirit), the difficulty of breaking the encryption grows with 2^n where n is the number of bits in the key. This is important because a single bit makes the problem twice as hard. Because of this growth rate, we can extremely easily outpace the computational resources of the entire planet. Even if we took all the energy in all the stars in the observable universe to power computer chips made with every atom in the universe, it would still take longer than the age of the universe to crack AES256 encryption.

I believe that some kind of sinhronisation of many kind of quantum clocks could achieve quantum computation, but that is very complex achievement. Because this quantum superposition is too uncertain and unstable. But if we combine quantum clocks, like to aproximate every adjustable electron radiation state, and each phase detected as logic gate, with some kind of multiple sinhronisated computation for overcoming errors. Very complex machine, and very prone to errors. But that is only way. One clock that measure imput, one clock that count imput and multiple sinhronisated clocks in pairs, where each pair counts even or uneven number of counted imputs, something like that. And all this part of machine are adjustable sinhronisated, depending on counted imput and measured imput which is the most complex  part of machine, because there is determinated much of accuracy. Clock that measure imput, measure time between 0 and 1,second clock count this imputs in measured time, other multiple sinhronisated pairs of clocks make logic gates, and all are together sinhronisated with imput measured time. So in theory its easy but in reality everything depends on error estimation, so actually there should be one computer also with quantum clocks just to estimate error within the previous, and maybe one more computer to combine this errors with previous output, very very complex machine.

I&#39;ll be starting my PhD in computer science next semester working on (among other things) post-quantum cryptography, that is, crypto that is based on problems that (we think at least) are hard for quantum computers to do as well. Lattice crypto (problems whose security is based on the apparent hardness of some lattice problems) is a major player here, while also providing tons of advantages over current crypto (like making fully homomorphic encryption possible which I&#39;m really excited about). So I&#39;m mainly just commenting to say all is not lost! As you said, we have some time before quantum computers become a serious threat.<br><br>Secondly, I wanted to add that quantum computers (and indeed Shor&#39;s algorithm) not only break RSA by efficiently factoring large integers but also one of the other big asymmetric players: the Diffie Hellman key exchange, which is based on the apparent hardness, for classical computers anyway, of solving the discrete log problem (basically given g, p and x, it&#39;s hard to find a y such that g^y = x (mod p)).<br><br>Symmetric encryption, to my knowledge, seems to be somewhat safe. The biggest name in this field, AES,  (with sufficiently large key sizes) still appears to be secure against quantum attacks.<br><br>Anyway great video. Super clear explanation of Shor&#39;s algorithm!<br><br>Edit: oh one other interesting thing. You mentioned in your video that encryption doesn&#39;t make it impossible to access the underlying data, just more difficult. This is true for most encryption, but there does exist &quot;information-theoretically secure&quot; encryption which is literally for all intents and purposes unbreakable. However it is impractical in most use cases. The quintisential example here are one-time-pads (OTP). They require that both parties must start out with the same secret information (the pad) with which they encrypt/decrypt their message like any symmetric encryption scheme (already presenting some difficulty), but even worse the pad must be as long as the message itself and the pad can only be used once as the name suggests (this isn&#39;t just a weakness of OTPs though it is mathematically proven that all information-theoretically secure encryption schemes have similar disadvantages). One time pads are still used when absolute security is necessary though. During WWII phone calls between FDR and Winston Churchill were encrypted via OTPs. In order for both FDR and Churchill to end up with the same pad, armed soldiers would handcuf briefcases full of these pads to themselves and literally fly across the Atlantic to transport them.", "comment_date": "2019-05-01T11:56:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "THE Mithrandir09", "comment_text": "Awesome video!
