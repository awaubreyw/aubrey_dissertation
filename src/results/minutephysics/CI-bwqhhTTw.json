Three best examples had 3 wings (~0,8 m long each), 3 wings (1,1 m each) and my best - 5 wing (1,2 m each) design that worked at lower speeds than 3-wing (it was located low to ground with uneven terrain/trees around so only 1 lower wing (with 120 degrees between) had trouble to keep speed up and it lead to vibrations. 2 lower wings (with 72 degrees between) solved issue and it was smooth and worked as expected. And it was this time when got to figures how wind speed impacts power (not sure how precise but from that time used m/s^3 = W/m2 formula whenever wanted to know how much power windmill actually can extract - and that &quot;nominal&quot; power was based on ~9 m/s windspeed).
