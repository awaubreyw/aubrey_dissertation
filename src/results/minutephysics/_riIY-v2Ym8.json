They are the same size as what is THE EYE. INDEED, the tides are CLEARLY ELECTROMAGNETIC/gravitational on/in balance. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE (on balance), as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON/IN BALANCE. This explains F=ma AND E=MC2. This explains why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution !!! Great. Notice that the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE), as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON/IN BALANCE. TRUTH, reality, AND nature/natural experience go hand in hand. BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON/IN BALANCE. GREAT !!!!<br><br>THE TOP DOWN UNDERSTANDING OF TIME (AND time dilation) AND PHYSICS/PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE:<br><br>TIME AND the fourth dimension (WITH c4) may be explained (ON BALANCE) in accordance with the following, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY proven to be gravity ON BALANCE !!!!<br><br>Consider the fact that the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. Now, consider what is the Sun AND the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. NOW, think about what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE !!! Think about what is THE MAN (THE EYE) who actually IS IN what is outer \u201cspace\u201d. Basically and importantly, there is NO TIME. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as gravity is CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as TIME dilation ultimately proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! Carefully consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE !!! Magnificent. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites ON BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!!!!!<br><br>Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE (ON BALANCE), as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. This explains F=ma AND E=MC2. Therefore, I have explained why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. Accordingly, ON BALANCE, consider the role or relation of what is the EYElid !!!! (LOOK around.) Great. Very carefully consider what is THE MAN (AND THE EYE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. (Consider what is BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE on balance !!!!) The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE !! Inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! This ALSO explains F=ma AND E=MC2 ON BALANCE !!!!!!! The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky (ON BALANCE). GREAT. The tides are CLEARLY reflective of the fact that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE.<br><br>So, it is now time to turn to the BALANCED examination of what is the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE in relation to (ON BALANCE) what is the Sun AND the speed of light (c). Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky !!! Great. NOW, carefully consider what follows. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites ON BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity (ON BALANCE) !!!!!!<br><br>The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE !!! So, it is now TIME to turn to the DIRECT comparison of what is the orange (AND setting) Sun WITH what is the fully illuminated (AND setting) Moon. They are both the same size as what is THE EYE, AND these forms manifest (or form up) at what is EYE LEVEL/body height. Also, notice that the brightness of these manifestations appears to be the same. Moreover, the curvature or shape of said Moon matches that of THE EARTH/ground (that is, given a clear horizon). Lava appears orange, AND it even manifests as blood red. Excellent. I have proven that the sizes of said Moon, said Sun, and what is THE EYE cannot be a strange &quot;coincidence&quot;. In fact, consider the CONNECTION with the blue sky ON BALANCE; as the tides are CLEARLY proven to be electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE !!! I have mathematically unified physics. I have proven that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! Finally, notice the consistent AND BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of space that CLEARLY connects it ALL up (ON BALANCE); as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND necessarily proven to be gravity ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as TIME dilation ultimately proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity (ON BALANCE); as TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE !!! GREAT !!!! Importantly, ON BALANCE, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.
