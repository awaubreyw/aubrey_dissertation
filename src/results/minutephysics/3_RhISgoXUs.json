But, physics and in mathematics, still use \u201cForce\u201d as thou it were something physical that could enable the initial cause of motion making it counterintuitive. <br><br> Example:  Without applying the Energy from within you, choose an object of your choices to push and pull by simply applying \u201conly\u201d the Force or Net Force.<br><br> Meaning that Energy (applied energy) is the origin of motion and not \u201cForce\u201d.  Once Energy (E) is applied, it creates what is known as Momentum (p).  When this Momentum (object in motion) comes in contact with another object(s), it makes a surface contact that will enable you to push and pull.  Example:  Ep=ma, Ep=mv and so on.  Note:  Ep is not to be confused as Kinetic Energy in any way.<br><br>Momentum represents things like work, wave, gravity, light, lightning, tsunami, earthquake, current, electricity, motion, magnetism, etc.<br><br> Without Energy, there is no Momentum.  Without Momentum, there is no surface contact on an object(s) to push, pull, work, shaping objects, motion, etc.  Momentum does not and cannot exist without the applied Energy that creates it.

That is time is running slower in the center of a gravity well than it is in space. Because the speed of light is constant this also means space is measured differently (ct = d \u00a0so if c is constant and t changes d must change also).\u00a0<br><br>No astronaut is going to feel time running faster because:\u00a0<br><br>1) the effect is small for Earth&#39;s gravity well<br><br>2) EVERYTHING in the astronaut&#39;s frame of reference is moving slightly faster than it is on the surface of the Earth. Because everything is moving faster by exactly the same amount no one notices in the astronaut&#39;s frame. This is the same reason why a movie will still play out the same events whether it is fast-forwarded, running normal, or on slow. The entities within the movie won&#39;t know the difference but the relative difference between two movies running at different speeds can have an effect. This effect is the force of gravity.<br><br>In Quantum Field Theory fields develop by thinking of empty space as an infinite number of infinitely thin walls stacked up one after another with an infinite number of holes that are infinitely close. Free space is an infinite number of infinite slit experiments in that theory. This would form an extremely fine series of grids (the grids may have real thickness and the holes may not be infinitely small or infinitely close together but QFT assumes this; in any case they&#39;re very tiny). Each one of these grids would be one of the countries. Waves travel through these fine grids and interfere with themselves forming &quot;wave packets&quot; that can propagate like particles. A LASER, an LRAD, or a phased array radar also adds up a whole bunch of waves to make a particle like beam. \u00a0<br><br>Each one of the grids can measure something like space and time a little differently leading to a net transfer of momentum (force is momentum change over time). This net transfer is carried off by a force carrier.<br><br>A repulsive force can be thought of as a force carrier shooting from one particle to another. With this circumstance even macroscopic objects would repel. For example if I shoot a gun my body will want to recoil backwards and the object I hit with the bullet will recoil away from me. Myself and the object I hit will repel.<br><br>Attraction is a little harder to visualize and it can only form in a wavelike field (as I described above). A simple example of attraction: given the right wave structure two boats on an ocean can actually attract because the wave structure between the two boats is actually less intense than the rest of the ocean. If the boats are creating their own waves it can be more intense or less intense between them than neutral ocean depending on how those waves are setup. The attractive Casimir Effect would be a similar phenomena . The waves interacting between two charged particles can actually net cancel each other causing a negative transfer of momentum or they can net add creating a positive transfer of momentum. It depends on the modes of the waves (how they are vibrating/setup). There would still be a transfer of a photon in either case. Just in one case if would be a photon carrying a positive momentum and in the other a photon carrying a negative momentum.<br><br>The analogies I used here aren&#39;t exactly analogous to full quantum fields but they&#39;re as close as I could think of. Remember there&#39;s a wavelike structure within the transfer. The force carriers between two charges are also what&#39;s called virtual particles. That is they don&#39;t have to last long enough to fully exist on their momentum/mass shell.\u00a0", "comment_date": "2015-03-31T17:34:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "TheOmega983", "comment_text": "lets all go and buy sheep", "comment_date": "2015-03-29T22:21:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "johnny johnson", "comment_text": "i told my ex that size is meaningless! she just didnt buy it as she couldnt help but laugh", "comment_date": "2015-03-26T10:42:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Ma", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_RhISgoXUs&amp;t=0m04s\">0:04</a> omg", "comment_date": "2015-03-23T20:12:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Galik", "comment_text": "It should be called AwesomePhysics, not MinutePhysics ;)", "comment_date": "2015-03-11T10:16:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ScooterMcBean", "comment_text": "What I&#39;ve learned is that in Canada, sheep are nervous.", "comment_date": "2015-03-06T01:24:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "linds", "comment_text": "Wait since when have Middle Earth and Hyrule next to one another?
