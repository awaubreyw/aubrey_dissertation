What if the detector, in the process of observing the particle, were ever so slightly slowing it down, i.e. robbing it of energy in essentially the same way that a freezer robs liquid water of energy and turns it into ice? And what if this (albeit, comparatively minute) loss of energy were just sufficient to turn the wave (analogous to the macrocosmic fluid state) into a particle (analogous to the macrocosmic solid state)?

A photon resonates with the electrons of the outermost atoms of each slits edges. The addition of the charge of a photon sets up charge currents in the material where the slits are made or in the standing waves photons as in a synthetic slit consisting of energetic particle beams. That extra charge causes all of the electrons close to the atoms that captured a photon, to resonate the same, at any time this happens since the same set of atoms and their electrons are in the same over all positions over long lengths of time. So no matter when a photon is captured at any to the 4 slit edges, the same resonance acts on any photon. That then makes the photon leaving the slit to get bunched up , very similar to how air molecules bunch up to propagate a &quot;wave&quot;  of sound, pushed together which causes other paths to have less photons and then continue towards the far field bunched up into that pattern of more or less photon to make the pattern of bright and dark bars. The same resonance acting at the slits is what redistributed the photons into varying concentrations from a maximum towards the bright spots and no photons towards the the dark bars. There cannot be any such thing as destructive interference since, energy cannot be destroyed no matter the mechanism, be that photons or any other energetic particle. No waves required in the way it has so long been assumed. Those waves were never proven or demonstrated as being in existence. What was used to make that assumptions were observed waves, but only at the macroscopic level, such as waves on water. Under the surface, the water is turning in long cylinders. The top or surface part,  seen as waves, is just an artifact of the whole mechanism. The photon is much more accurately modelled like the rotating cylinders but, in all directions. to form a sphere of charge currents. Experiments purporting to have waves involved, were interpreted as existing by, first arranging equipment of the experiment as if the equipment was handling waves and then had the results of those experiments interpreted under the same assumption that the waves were acting in those same parts of the experiment. So set up the experiment by considering the waves as not there but as outlined in this comment, and see if the same experiment can be interpreted as acting similarly as outlined. It is all in how accurately one sees the topology the photon being modelled and and from there what the other parts of the experiment should be seen doing before the experiment is setup, or run or interpreted of its results. <br>Take away. It is all about how accurate the model of charged particle is. The more accurate, the less need to go into imagining weird things, like uncertainty. Without uncertainty, no need for entanglement and from there no way to construct q-bits. That is how to explain why q-bits keep decohering or stop being entangled in more than one state. The waves, at base of all that, are just modelled too inaccurately, is all. <br><br>No need to blow a fuse or mind, as some want to say when the experiment is hard to understand. Understood? If, yes, repeat after me, &quot;The photon is a sphere of charge currents that is captured by an electron in the atoms of the two slits and released in step with all other photons no matter when those photons are captured or released.&quot;", "comment_date": "2020-09-04T01:16:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Locke Sec", "comment_text": "scientists are a cat&#39;s worst enemy", "comment_date": "2020-08-27T03:42:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DraftScience", "comment_text": "response video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/KuQnnI8hm4s?t=372\">https://youtu.be/KuQnnI8hm4s?t=372</a>", "comment_date": "2020-08-26T11:25:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rainbow sally", "comment_text": "electron traveling backward in time (positron) repels the other electron so they can&#39;t cancel?", "comment_date": "2020-08-20T20:25:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Charley Morin", "comment_text": "If there are three slits then every particle goes through all three slits.", "comment_date": "2020-08-08T23:13:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ron Jagannathan", "comment_text": "The Cats just confuses someone who does not understand Quantum Mechanics.

As far as the tree\u2019s leaves reach to heaven is as far as its roots reach to hell. Many preachers of God have been found to also be pedophiles. Reality has no choice but to balance itself.

Collective Consciousness Arranging atoms into reality with thoughts in Balance. Enlightenment has arrived for mankind. That\u2019s why the United States is currently divided so greatly.

Reality Mathematics says a negative plus a negative equals a BIGGER negative. A negative plus a positive can equal positive if the positive is large enough. The lost are on the conservative side and this science of quantum mechanics shows us this as fact &amp; cause for division. They think MONEY/material (the real Tool of lust/Satan) is where the answer lies. Every decision being made today is regarded to money.

He proposes that if there were a steady stream of visible light coming through a double-slit apparatus, and that if all of the photons were observed, then you would be able to see, with your own eyes, 2 bands of light on the screen. I disagree - my thinking is that even if all of the photons were observed going through whichever slit they entered, the photons would still interfere with each other and create the same interference pattern as in the unobserved double-slit scenario. There are good arguments on both sides (we both have limited knowledge) and I haven\u2019t been able to find any resources which might settle the argument. Do you know which of us is correct?

I think the paradox can be summed as the following: If we established that both lights can be blocked by each other in the middle slits to make specific spots dark, so if A block B, then A shouldn&#39;t appear and B should appear, and if B block A, then B shouldn&#39;t appear and A should appear, but somehow they both showed up. The video then to explain that one of the valid explanation is that both scenarios that we went through are in superposition, therefore both events BOTH occur at the same time, in other words A block B and B block A both occurring for the same pair of particles, and that is a paradox. It goes to show how weird this quantum physics is.", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T11:14:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "quack", "comment_text": "Why do you have a addiction to cats?", "comment_date": "2019-03-01T08:06:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "hiker919", "comment_text": "An answer to the paradox: quantum ferrets.<br>They will both fit in the center slit at the same time.
