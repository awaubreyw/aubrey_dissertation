I know this video was made awhile ago, I just wanted to say that you did a great job teaching how pinholes work!

There are many ocular conditions that damage the cornea or retina and therefore pinholing will not help those people see more clearly.

The optician I had used long time and still use checked my eyes and told me that he can not get any good readings for my left eye and told me to go and see an eye doctor. So I called a local hospital and got an appointment. For reference I was 52 years old then. I went to the eye doctor who was lovely woman in her thirties. She checked my left eye and tried this and that and nothing worked. Then she went to her computer and I could get the gist that she was searching through various medical databases what to try. I could hear the lightbulb over her head when she came to me and took everything off from the front of my left eye and then told me that she had calculated all the correction my left eye needs without the axial correction and put those lenses in front of my left eye. Then she said that lets try this and put a pinhole lens in there and I could read the smallest letters from the table.<br><br>She told that the lens in my left eye is deformed and has multiple foci and that the problem was that these things are normally found when people are at the age 25 or so. And I asked that was that the time when I told the optician that my left eye sees double image and the reply was that I talk nonesense and she said yes. So she arranged me to have the lens replaced and told me that the luck in this situation was that the operation was much better now than 25 years ago.<br><br>So on 23rd of October 2013 I was asked to come to premiliary checking in our local university hospital. The eye doctor asked me that he thought that giving me a minus one lens was best option as I&#39;ve been nearsighted my whole life in which I said that I&#39;d prefer that too as an electrician I need to see clearly at close. When I went to get the time for the operation the nurse asked me if I can come the next day as there was a free space in line because of a cancellation. I said that it&#39;s fine. So on 24th of October 2013 I got a new lens into my left eye.<br><br>In the after checking the eye doctor told that he thinks that right eye&#39;s lens has to be replaced also because the imbalace between the eyes and asked if I&#39;m ok with that and I said yes. So 18th of March 2014 my right eye got a new lens.<br><br>Now I use glases at home only when watching the television. I use them outside but if I forget them it&#39;s not a big deal. I&#39;m still wondering how well I can see now and I&#39;m very gratefull that the cataracts operations have been perfected so that these kinds of miracles are available to us.", "comment_date": "2021-08-14T21:03:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u04221000 Youtube", "comment_text": "Cool", "comment_date": "2021-08-13T19:15:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rasel B.  2", "comment_text": "Oh f...k i can&#39;t just believe", "comment_date": "2021-08-06T08:30:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Unvoicedlive", "comment_text": "I don\u2019t have glasses but I can blur my vision!

Viola! I formed a crescent of an eclipse on the ground and on a white board with just my hand. I forgot about this little trick until tonight when I walked outside. I remembered watching Henry&#39;s video on the trick and wondered if I could see the disk of a planet. Jupiter is in the sky most of the night, since it is very bright and easily located, so I made the pinhole with my hand, located Jupiter and I could see a tiny but discernible disk. Skeptical that I really could see a disk I tried the technique with Sirius, a star located near Orion, but could not focus the light, that is, it just remained blurry.

I found this trick by myself a few months ago, but I took it one step forward.<br>I&#39;ve always had a good sight, so when one day I looked out the window and noticed objects far away were blur in my left eye I got a little bit nervous about it and tried different things (starting by rubbing my eyes). I like photography so I thought about the depth of field in a pinhole thing and it worked, but here comes the best. While looking to far objects through the pinhole, I started opening it slowly while trying to maintain the focus. If I do it slowly enough, I can get my fingers fully extended and the sharpness on far objects stays. So I&#39;m guessing in my case is a muscle thing. My eyes are getting too used to short sight (too many hours of computer screen maybe?) and the muscles are fixed for many hours, but with this trick I &quot;force&quot; them to relax. I even have a little sensation in the eye in the process (although it could be psychological), but the more I do it, the more my sight gets better. <br>Of course that is why eye doctors recomend resting the eyes by looking at the horizon.<br>Cheers!", "comment_date": "2016-04-23T21:53:24Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "rodrigo san roman", "comment_text": "didn&#39;t work for me", "comment_date": "2016-04-23T18:33:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Santos", "comment_text": "it gets a little bit better, but i still cant read.. i have 7.5 diopters and astigmatism", "comment_date": "2016-04-22T20:12:09Z", "likes_count": 12}, {"comment_by": "Anna H.B", "comment_text": "didn&#39;t work", "comment_date": "2016-04-22T17:06:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Borrelli", "comment_text": "My vision is being corrected at -8.75 and -9.

First is instead of the way shown here just use the diamond shaped hole you make as you place your fingers in the position you hold a pencil in your fingers but without the pencil, now you have a hole that works much better and to focus just adjust the size of the hole while the back of your hand is laid against your nose. Second approach is better in the sense that you widen your field of view and attract less attention to the oddity when in public, which is to place your index or pointing finger placed on your nose horizontally. Your aim is to put the text in line with the top side of your index finger which will give you a clear view from left to right and is clearly better when reading text or print at a distance. Feel funny about doing it in public? Having done this since about the age of 10 I have since come up with some responses. If your with a friend who is the type that may be likely to tease about it then make sure to use the finger that points in their direction and say something like &quot;I was just thinking if I was wearing a (I&#39;m with stupid shirt) which way the finger should point.&quot; Or if your with someone deserving of a compliment then use the moment to say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I was just thinking of who the (sexiest, coolest, nicest etc.) person in the room was and well... then raise your eyebrows and tilt your head to the side.

There is a circular muscle around the lens which is connected to it by small ligaments. When this muscle contracts the ligaments are  relaxed and the lens becomes thicker (and stronger) by its own elasticity. When the muscle is relaxed, these same ligaments pull the lens in flatter shape which results in less strength. The elasticity is also the reason why people have to hold everything farther from their eyes when they become older. The lens loses this elasticity over time.<br>Keep going with your videos, I love them. :)", "comment_date": "2014-05-07T16:51:55Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "EMAN VLOGS", "comment_text": "I&#39;m an optometrist and I find this offensive.", "comment_date": "2014-05-07T16:41:01Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Juan Arteaga Carmona", "comment_text": "Mind blowing!
