When broken, its contents would spill onto the floor of the box and eat through to the outside. In this then, there would be no observer opening the box but rather a chain of interdependent events which would at their end, in effect, be reaching out to the observer after the fact. In other words, the acid leaking from the box would only be possible were the cat dead and only dead. No dead cat, no leaking acid to alarm the observer that he might turn to observe. To illuminate further\u2026.that necessary for the Schroedinger version of this scheme is that there be no consequence of events of the cat\u2019s state as either alive or dead or even potentially one or the other. The cat\u2019s state as alive or dead is the end of the sequence of events contained within the box. In my version in which the cat\u2019s state is nested within a line of other deterministic events, those subsequent to the cat\u2019s state cannot be realized materially unless the cat were dead and only dead. The observer would not have looked at all but for the process having in a sense \u201creached out\u201d to alert him to its presence. If as might be claimed that his observation would cause the wave form to collapse and the condition of the acid dripping to manifest then how could it have been manifest already that it might capture his attention that he might turn to observe it then to cause the wave form to collapse so that it could be dripping which it was in the first place? This makes no sense and defies the same brand or current of logic by which the experiment was initially defined. I would venture that if this cannot be resolved by the proponents of superposition, one then has to question the ability of composite entities to be in superposition, ever. So, we see that here is no wave form here and thus no superposition of the cat. A great deal of physics would fall away in the exposition of such an error with this superposition theory, not merely inviting alternative ontological possibilities but rather demanding their consideration. Silly notions of multi-verses, cyclical universe existing back infinitely and human perception as a component of the means of material existence would all be dispensed with. \r<br>What do you think?", "comment_date": "2022-06-05T19:37:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EVIL Co.", "comment_text": "Simplified answer to a complex question.

This is what the SE is normally describing. In the other way to travel faster than light we have orthogonal tachyonic Brownian motion which averages away to nothing at the ensemble level.

Both possibilities are options at the same time, but the reality of cat being dead or alive has already been determined by time in the box, then revealed it&#39;s opened. One&#39;s viewing hasn&#39;t &quot;forced&quot; anything. The only thing forced is one&#39;s conclusion as to whether the cat is dead or alive. If you want to suppose the cat is both dead and alive until you view it, as a way of comparing the possibility of a photon acting like a wave or a particle until it passes through the double-split channel and reveals a position where it can be seen as either / or, why not just say it has both potentials and we don&#39;t understand which will manifest at which instance. Just seems like a bit of scientific hubris to say one&#39;s observation of nature,forces nature to do anything. Maybe human observational skills have their limits, even when augmented by computers/devices, and some truths can be catagorized as unknowable or inconceivable to the human mind, and that the wonder that certain things remain a mystery is okay and even beautiful. Some things can be understood in flashes of revelation in the heart, that sometimes even go beyond the ability to properly express in words, but that&#39;s another topic. Maybe nature is protecting us from ourselves, since it seems to be a trend in human history that when new information is discovered, the funders of the research many times consider how the information could be used to enslave or exploit people for profit/control, along with nature itself, for selfish ends.

Unfortunately, many popular science writers in our day continue to propagate the misconception that a quantum state (and therefore reality itself) is determined by conscious observers. They use this erroneous claim as a springboard into unsubstantial and non-scientific discussions about the nature of reality, consciousness, and even Eastern mysticism. To them, &quot;Schrodinger&#39;s Cat&quot; is not an embarrassing indication that their claims are wrong, but proof that the world is as absurd as they claim.

A lot of misconceptions there.<br>1) Schr\u00f6dinger didn&#39;t believe in superposition. The Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s cat thought experiment was his way of disproving it. The idea was to push the superposition theory to its limit to show how absurd it was (how could the cat be alive and dead at the same time). Well, Schr\u00f6dinger was wrong. We know today that superposition does occur. And it&#39;s kind of funny that nowadays people act as if Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s Cat was a way to explain superposition when it was, in fact, a failed attempt to disprove/ridicule it.<br>2) What makes the superposition collapse is not the fact that we look. It&#39;s the fact that we <i>may</i> look. We don&#39;t have to actually look. So the whole experiment is flawed. The superposition would never occur inside the box.<br>Let me explain a bit more this point. If you do the double slit experiment you get superposition (the photon go through both slits at the same time) but if you put some detector in one slit suddenly the photon go through either the one slit or the other. That&#39;s why people say we collapse superposition just by looking. But if you put a detector and never check the result (same as not opening the box) the superposition still doesn&#39;t happen. The photon goes through either one slit or the other. You don&#39;t have to actually look to force one result or the other.<br>3) The collapsing itself is not magical (people went mystic when they were told that quantum physics care about a conscious observer) but merely mathematical. The wave function of a single particle is quite simple an support easily superposition but as soon as larger objects are involved the wave function become very complex and the math predicts that a choice has to be made. It&#39;s a bit complicated to explain but you can look at it like a dice roll. If you throw one dice, who can tell which value you will get? Maybe one, maybe six, maybe anything in between. But if you throw a billion dice, you know that the result will be pretty close to 3.5 billion.

The Lorentz contraction \u02e0 represents the time dilation of Einstein\u2019s Theory of Relativity. We have energy \u2206E slowing the rate that time \u2206t flows as a universal process of energy exchange or continuous creation. Mass will increase relative to this process with gravity being a secondary force to the electromagnetic force.

We have to square the probability of the wave-function \u03a8 because the area of the sphere is equal to the square of the radius of the sphere multiplied by 4\u03c0.

It means, explanation shouldn\u2019t be made with magic, belief or with another way; otherwise it will not be count as \u201csolution\u201d\u2026<br><br>What is that mean? First arjenbij\u2019s one means, \u201cquantum mechanics must be understood as unexplainable\u201d.<br><br>How an unexplainable thing can be understood without expiation? The action of understanding must be made against a consideration. If there is no any faced consideration then action of understanding cannot be created. With this version of \u201cQM understanding\u201d can be either belief or stupidity.<br><br>Second one. A stupid thinks that everybody is like him and everybody are stupid.<br><br>If stupid cannot understand something then everybody is not able to understand anything, as a stupid result. Stupid thinks in stupidity, it is very simple. Belief is also same but Feynman\u2019s quote is putting it into narrow way by saying \u201cclassical way\u201d and belief is being out of the question.<br><br>A stupid is left in our hand who says for others \u201cno one is intelligent enough to explain this experiment like me\u201d.<br><br>We must understand that he is stupid by saying stupid not only for himself but also for us. If you believe in him you must be stupid also. In this case you brought \u201cbelief\u201d into the topic as believer of Feynman. This is not Feynman\u2019s fault; he is just an idiot think that he is the most genius man even in the future!!! But you are bringing the belief factor even he tells \u201csolution must be in classical way\u201d. You shouldn\u2019t believe in him, you must stay in classical way as classical way follower. <br><br>Feynman thinks stupidly that he is the most intelligent man. if he cannot solve this QM problem then everybody is not that intelligent. He is teaching you that you are less intelligent than him or simply you are stupid so you are learning to be stupid.<br><br>Overall this is stupidity in every way. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t write to you and if I think that you are stupid then I wouldn\u2019t try to teach you that you are doing mistake. But idiot Feynman did it opposite; he thought people are stupid and he gave lessons to them.<br><br>If any teacher would think that students are idiot, then that useless teacher must quit that job and give up being teacher. Feynman\u2019s situation is simple as this. To be a teacher for stupid people is also stupidity\u2026<br><br>We must think in classical way. in the knowledge history humanity didn\u2019t do nothing but explaining of unknown reality in classic way. But Feynman saying that the future of humanity will be opposite and you believe in him with \u201cunderstanding of unexplained QM\u201d\u2026 This is accepting lack of knowledge as \u201cknowledge\u201d!<br><br>If you are NOT stupid then you must say \u201cwe don\u2019t know yet, but we are seeking for it\u201d but if you are stupid then you would say \u201cwe know that \u201cto know QM\u201d is impossible and we are not seeking for any answer or solution for it because everybody cannot be more intelligent we believe in Feynman\u2019s acceptance of limited intelligence\u201d.<br><br>\u201cCat in the box dilemma\u201d created for opposite of \u201cthinking out of the box\u201d. Put a human in the box with the mercy for cat and give pen and paper next to him. Humanity is development of knowledge even if we are death. <br><br>You turned into a \u201cscience believer\u201d. Science turned into a belief system and you left behind to be human by turning into a \u201cscience believer\u201d. You are accepting stupidity created by an idiot teacher. Science stopped seeking answers for not to ruin the \u201cscience belief\u201d. <br><br>If you are not stupid, there are answers about everything not with magic or by belief. Proof of solution is classic as soap balloons. A soap balloon has a sphere shape alone but when they are together, they turn into a new kind of shape with faces.<br><br>If sub atom particle are thought with its own emptiness, to understand QM, its main experiment double slit, even gravity or time can be understood.

Fox made a mistake. This movie is Back to the Future 1. In the movie, back in 1956, if someone was ran over, like a man in the case, then the wife falls in love and fails to say no. When Michael arrived from 1985, he tried to save his father from being ran over as just a small thing, but he did it not knowing about the custom, and well, they almost fell into a marrige, but throughout, he knew what would happen, and he kept squirming and finally escaped WITH IS LIFE! I know he wanted to save his dad, but he probably would be beter off helping him afterwords, or just help him not go across the street, and the paradox would be fixed", "comment_date": "2015-07-14T17:19:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wibisono Indrawan", "comment_text": "Bioshock Infinite brought me here", "comment_date": "2015-07-13T20:28:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maciej Ma", "comment_text": "Other Interpretation Double Slit \u00a0<br><br>Em \u00a0wave is hiting electron and backing to Slit ( wave is more faster than electron )<br><br><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1kiLUNIA0zk/VQKtkz5l-uI/AAAAAAAACSI/3kGuQloeYHw/s1600/CIMG3721.JPG\">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1kiLUNIA0zk/VQKtkz5l-uI/AAAAAAAACSI/3kGuQloeYHw/s1600/CIMG3721.JPG</a>", "comment_date": "2015-07-12T06:17:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PS Studios", "comment_text": "Everybody saying that reality doesn&#39;t change if you&#39;re not looking should really do some research in quantum mechanics, and in particular the &#39;&#39;double slits experiment&#39;&#39;<br>I know it sounds weird at first, but just look it up. and it will change your mind...

Schrodinger couldn&#39;t stand quantum superposition - the supposed state where every possibility (quantum wave function) exists at the same time like the cat being alive\u00a0and dead inside the box. So he bought up his thought experiment to prove his point and debunk the non-sense of quantum superposition.<br><br>However, Schrodinger actually didn&#39;t debunk anything, not even by a long shot. His thought experiment was actually nothing more but misleading and quite a distortion to what QM actually tried to point. What Quantum Theory really says is that\u00a0reality in a quantum sense actually lacks definite existence until observed/measured.\u00a0This lack of existence encompasses from the smallest (quarts) to atoms that make up the macro world. Only when the quantum world is observed, does it become real and remain in one or the other but not both state. You may as well reject this as nonsense and insist that they are real regardless like Schrodinger&#39;s cat, but whether you refuse to believe so or not is completely irrelevant when trying to comprehend the real reality.<br><br>It is safe to reject the cat being alive and dead at the same time since literally speaking it is not part of the quantum world for all practical purposes, but\u00a0the same cannot be said in the quantum world. In the quantum world there\u00a0is actually no such thing as definite existence independent from observation. Consider the\u00a0wave-particle duality in the\u00a0double-slit experiment.<br><br>What is the reality of photons? Is it a particle or a wave? Truth is they are both. Yet their reality is far stranger. When\u00a0the photons are\u00a0not measured in a double-slit,\u00a0they behave as a wave and\u00a0later form an interference pattern. In this reality the photons are a wave. Yet, put a measuring device in and you will see a different reality. Instead of behaving as waves, they actually behave as solid billiard balls - forming only two parallel lines with no interference pattern. Wait, how can a photon be a particle or a wave? Welcome to the real schrodinger&#39;s cat story. What really happened was that the photons were actually\u00a0behaving as\u00a0particles and waves at the same time. That is because the quantum superposition state forbids them from being one or the other due to the lack of observation/consciousness. They actually don&#39;t exist in a definite sense, but rather exist in a probable wave-like (half/half) sense just like Schrodinger&#39;s cat. This says a lot about reality<br><br>If reality lacks definite existence until it has been observed consciously or at least measured, then that would imply that everything we see in this world was actually created by observation. If this is true, then what or who is this observer exactly that started everything in the first place?

If the bomb explode the cat is dead. It doesn&#39;t metter if we look after her or not. It is dead. ( DX ) Maybe these multiverses of states of things are to far away for my brain to think about it, but I think that there are problems in this thinking experiment. First: if the bomb explode and we are outside of cat&#39;s prison and wait to look after it in some time, we have to hear the explosion. Okay, I know it isn&#39;t a real problem of Einstein&#39;s cat, but it&#39;s a problem. That&#39;s why I prefer to take the poisinous gas of Schr\u00f6dinger. The next problem is that there couldn&#39;t be more than one state for the cat or for the bomb or gas. If there really be another state, then it have to be another cat, because the cat&#39;s state is that what happend with the cat. And if we film the cat with a camera, so we can see, what cat&#39;s state is. So the only way that there could be more than one state for the cat is that these states are only in our minds. And this &#39;illusion&#39; breaks if we loke into cat&#39;s prison or cat&#39;s grave.<br>So why do people try to say that if this is so and so in my mind then it have to be so and so in the world and the universe and everything? I don&#39;t understand what these people think? Or is my thinking about that only on a really really lower level as them?<br>Oh. If I think about that I have another idea. There could be more states in more universes, what is a little bit like the word I used at the beginning - multiverses. But then the entrance to cat&#39;s prison (I love this formulation) have to be a door to another place what implies that the cat must be another one as the cat we have looked. So we know the state of another cat and we don&#39;t know the state of OUR cat. That&#39;s why it doesn&#39;t make any sense in my mind to say that the cat we jailed is haveing this multiverses of states. It&#39;s only our nescience about its state and our thirst for knowledge why we try to solve this puzzle.<br>Okay, I see there are many different kinds of thinkings about Schr\u00f6dinger&#39;s cat. And maybe I don&#39;t understand the true background of this experiment.<br>And know I go to jail a cat together with poisinous gas. Muhahaha!

Please note the word &quot;probably&quot; in the previous sentence. Those of truly great intellect are less likely, statistically speaking, to insult another person&#39;s intelligence. For two reasons: first those of truly great intellect know how little they know (whereas most others don&#39;t even know what they don&#39;t know), and second they are actually more likely to underestimate their own intelligence. I believe it is Vsauce who has a great video discussing this phenomena. \u00a0<br><br>But the greatest reason I laugh when I see people say &quot;you must be a great mind then that of Einstein, and other great mind connected to these theories&quot; is because so many times in science have our &quot;theories&quot; been proven wrong.

This phenomenon is completely causal in the quantum world, even if there is currently no mathematical model to explain it, and every particle in the universe could be entangled with any other particle in the universe, but since we can&#39;t see every particle in the universe, it is just easier to interpret the evidence we CAN see as probabilistic.", "comment_date": "2014-01-04T14:39:33Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Iim Cornell", "comment_text": "It&#39;s just like a video game.\u00a0 Until the avatar &#39;turns the corner&#39; to &#39;see&#39; the next scene, whether it be it machine-gunning evil-doers or\u00a0a nifty race car speeding down\u00a0the\u00a0track or a..., it&#39;s all nothing more than a bunch of amorphous electro-magnetic pulses capable of being anything the program allows.<br><br>In other words,\u00a0WE are in a video game and our creator/god is a bored, teenage immortal whose pops decided to give him a toy to pass the time (and the time and the time and the ...)\u00a0\u00a0", "comment_date": "2014-01-04T00:55:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "medic2009guy", "comment_text": "I do have one question about this theory, what if its a loud cat? \u00a0like meowing at a high decibel? \u00a0does that then prove that the cat is then observing us, or that the higher power is a kitten? \u00a0Or does it then prove that cats are the actual controlling factor who control mother nature to give a choice? \u00a0I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a question thats been answered theoretically but I can&#39;t find the answer anywhere on the web.", "comment_date": "2014-01-03T19:49:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Dexter Coffey", "comment_text": "I just--- my day has officially been made.", "comment_date": "2014-01-03T16:21:38Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "atv008", "comment_text": "How do you create something that has an exact 50% chance of &quot;exploding&quot; or &quot;realeasing <i>__</i>&quot;", "comment_date": "2014-01-01T23:39:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Rok", "comment_text": "@minutephysics I still don&#39;t buy that the cat is alive and dead at the same time, that is just making an assumption that cannot be proven.

Your brain has to receive the information first. Remember that you always live in the past, so to speak.. because you never get instant updates on what&#39;s happening. So when you are observing something, you are actually way later with your analysis and the event has already happened. By contrast, if you go to the quantum level and mix the observer and the observed, so that you can say the observer influences the observed by observing it, then he is not an observer anymore, by definition. Even if something does happen where as the &quot;observer&quot; would influence the observed, it would be because of the quantum power of the observer since the observer and the observed live in the same system. For instance : imagine a mirror but not just any mirror. This mirror can show you the actual particles that float in your brain so that they generate thought. Now imagine you look into that mirror. You&#39;re observing it and get information for your next behavior, but as you do, the particles change and you get new information about it and so on and on. It is because you are not an observer. For it is by definition, that an observer must NOT interact with the observed environment.

When you measure it (opening Schrodinger&#39;s box) it will &#39;lock&#39; into one of those two phases.\n@minutephysics Correct me if I&#39;m wrong. :)", "comment_date": "2011-09-26T10:16:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Martin K", "comment_text": "&quot;No cats were harmed in the making of this video.&quot; \nAre you 100% sure???", "comment_date": "2011-09-26T10:13:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthijs de Wit", "comment_text": "Chuck Norris is watching us", "comment_date": "2011-09-26T10:11:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Wilson", "comment_text": "Wut", "comment_date": "2011-09-26T10:08:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Danasa", "comment_text": "uuuhhh........ i like cats", "comment_date": "2011-09-26T09:59:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Overwatch93", "comment_text": "Soooooo, is this saying that just because we don&#39;t know what is in there both universes exist?
