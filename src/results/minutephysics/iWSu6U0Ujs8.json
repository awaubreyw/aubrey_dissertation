Within its diameter you have to find the correct I, right, or is the one I good enough for both the rotation and run-away planet? Or does that only apply for density and shape changes, not pivotal points? So if the sun disappeared, it would just go in a straight line, but wouldn&#39;t the rotation of earth still continue? Would it be necessary to factor in both angular movements, or just one? Because the spin on the earth is is around itself, that doesn&#39;t really matter, correct? I guess, at the end of the day, there is no energy being transferred, and it will continue to have angular movement until something intervenes. But I&#39;m just confused about the object moving around itself, and the object moving independently to who knows where at the same time. <br><br>So if the sun disappeared, Earth would no longer be influenced by its gravity, and would continue to just move whatever direction, keeping in play a perfect proportion, thus validating the law? <br><br>So. Ugh, I&#39;m a tad confused. Please understand this is like my 3rd or 4th hour with physics (the study of) ever in my life, and I&#39;m 30 years old. I&#39;ve taken a liking to it. Is it called angular momentum because of the proportional calculations that can be made based off the sun that is no longer there, and the further the distance the more angular the lines get? If this is the case, and the Earth rotating is also angular momentum, because its the same object, calculations, specifically for I, don&#39;t change, correct?<br><br>Does angular momentum occur on earth, with all the forces that act on an object in motion? This video makes it seem like it&#39;s a space thing. Does it do the same thing on the ground, except it just doesn&#39;t go on forever?  Or does it happen on a smaller scale where everything just doesn&#39;t care about the laws from a (spooky) distance? Or, is angular distance simply just a force that is stopped because of the introduction to an outside force, such as air, etc, but as long as it was spinning, it had angular force? Or does angular force have to be powered, by like an engine? Or the wind, etc.?<br><br>Please don&#39;t bust my chops. I&#39;m just very curious and I don&#39;t know anyone who can answer these questions, and the internet has been great so far, as you can see by the amount of questions I have.

This video isn&#39;t completely accurate and correct. They are mixing product and cross product. This has A HUGE impact on what they said of the Earth rotating around the Sun- because its trajectory is an ellipse, not a perfect circle. <b>There is a fun fact about the conservation of the angular momentum hiding in there which explains the Earth&#39;s moving speed</b>. Here&#39;s a short, simple explanation in 5 steps (skip to 5- main part if you don&#39;t feel like reading much or you don&#39;t seek an explanation because you already know the basics):<br><br>1) Position and velocity<br><b>Position of an object</b> (r) <b>is</b> presented by <b>a vector</b> (for instance- in Cartesian coordinate system- it has 3 dimensions according to X, Y and Z axis... or in Polar coordinate system which is generally used for object with trajectory within a plane- its dimension is 2).<br><b>Velocity is</b> defined as <b>a derivative</b> of the position vector with respect to time, thus it is <b>a vector</b> as well (dr / dt).<br><br>2) Difference between scalar and vector<br>Momentum is defined as a product of mass (which is scalar) and velocity (which is vector), and scalar and vector cannot be multiplied as a cross product. Cross product is defined ONLY with vectors, and it looks like:<br>vector1 <b>x</b> vector2 <b>=</b> intensity_vector1 (scalar) \u2022 intensity_vector2 (scalar) \u2022 sin(angle between vector1 and vector2)<br>and it represents another vector, orthogonal to plane built by vector1 and vector2.<br>You CANNOT multiply <b>scalar</b> (mass) <b>x</b> <b>vector</b> (velocity) because angle is defined only between two vectors, scalar is not defined in vector space.<br><br>3) Momentum<br>Soooo... due to this, you can write momentum only as mass \u2022 velocity, so it is a vector itself:<br>mass (scalar) \u2022 velocity (vector) = momentum (vector)<br>m \u2022 V = K<br><br>4) Angular momentum<br>Angular momentum is defined as a cross product of a <b>referent position vector</b> (we take the Sun as the reference) and momentum:<br><b>r</b> (position- vector) <b>x</b> <b>k</b> (momentum- vector) <br>......or:<br>r <b>x</b> k <b>=</b> L<br>......or:<br>r <b>x</b> (m \u2022 V) <b>=</b> L<br>......or:<br>m \u2022 (r <b>x</b> V) <b>=</b> L<br>.....or:<br><b>m \u2022 r \u2022 V \u2022 sin(angle r, V) = L</b><br><br>5) Fun fact<br>If the Earth&#39;s trajectory is an ellipse, and its velocity has a tangential direction on that ellipse- then there are ONLY FOUR CASES <br>when angular momentum equals exactly <b>m \u2022 r \u2022 V</b>, and that is when the angle between position vector and velocity equals 90 degrees because sin(90) = 1, or:<br>L = m \u2022 r \u2022 V \u2022 sin(90) = m \u2022 r \u2022 V \u2022 1 = m \u2022 r \u2022 V<br>Those four cases are: two when the Earth is furthest, two when the Earth is closest to the Sun (just look at the image of an ellipse and you&#39;ll easily see it).<br><br>THE MAIN PART: <b>if</b> the <b>angular momentum</b> of the Earth <b>is constant</b>, <b>and</b> if we take the <b>mass</b> as <b>constant</b> (even if the Earth&#39;s mass slightly changes dues to stardust, gasses being blown away or brought by solar winds, etc)- and if we conclude that <b>sin(r,V) \u2022 r is NOT CONSTANT</b> (it takes some geometry and mechanics calculations to prove)- then what effect does it have to <b>the velocity???</b><br><br>L (constant) = <b>sin(r,V) \u2022 r</b> (non-constant) \u2022 m (we take as constant) \u2022 V (is it constant?)<br><br>Logical conclusion brings that the <b>velocity&#39;s intensity</b> MUST <b>NOT</b> BE <b>CONSTANT</b> because it has to negate the changing <b>sin(r,V) \u2022 r</b> influence (in order for L to be constant). When sin(r,V) \u2022 r is decreasing- velocity increases, when sin(r,V) \u2022 r is increasing- velocity decreases- and only this way the angular momentum remains the same, remains constant.<br><br>This is a mechanical explanation why the <b>Earth increases its speed when it moves closer to the sun</b>- <b>and</b> why <b>it slows down when moving away</b>. Earth&#39;s speed would be constant if its trajectory was a perfect circle- or if it crashed into the Sun and remained there (r = 0 <b>=&gt;</b> L = 0 = constant).<br><br>Thanks for reading, oh, and sorry for my poor English language knowledge/ typing mistakes :)", "comment_date": "2016-07-22T01:16:37Z", "likes_count": 11}, {"comment_by": "Livin4thelamb", "comment_text": "Wow...

I listen to the idea of conservation of angular momentum and it makes this connection in my mind. Its an odd sensation.\u00a0The same thing happens with stuff in relativity. The idea that things obviously increase in mass as you accelerate that connection with riding in a car with the same forces that alter the local experience of time. It somehow makes it feel bigger when you can feel the power of it. Or if you\u00a0consider that the same idea means that charging a battery makes it heavier. How much electricity would you need to pump into a battery to add the weight of an average person? And how much &quot;electric weight&quot; is added after accelerating. So my body&#39;s mass increases when a car accelerates to 60 in lets say 3 seconds, how much weight is added plug it into E=mc^2 and that&#39;s how much &quot;power&quot; the engine has converted from gasoline into forward motion\u00a0added into my body&#39;s mass. It would have to increase the mass of the battery too.\u00a0So does\u00a0that mean the individual electrons have more mass? but if they are moving near the speed of light the local time would slow down ...??? I think I broke my understanding of youtube\u00a0physics.\u00a0would\u00a0it increase their energy level?
