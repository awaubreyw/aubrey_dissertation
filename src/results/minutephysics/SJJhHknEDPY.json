The basic crux of the book is that in a 2 dimensional world the creatures that exist would not be able to recognise a 3 dimensional object. <br>Simplest example, if a sphere passed through flat land it would start as a dot, keep getting bigger, reach its maximum diameter then start shrinking until just  a dot remains, then nothing. Observing  this outside of Flatland we see a dot become a circle, reach its maximum then shrink away to nothing. The Flatlanders on the other hand can only only exist on 2 dimensional plane, so for them all they would see is a dot appear, expand to its maximum, then shrink away and be gone. <br>The point is, would we even recognise another dimension?", "comment_date": "2014-01-29T01:31:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alephnot000", "comment_text": "our F^3 space might be a subspace U of a Vector space V over a field F with higher dimension.
