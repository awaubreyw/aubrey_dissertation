You haven&#39;t given these experiments. And there ARE deterministic models that DO explain quantum mechanics as such, accurately. So, yes. We can predict everything. Also, the past happened and it happened only one way, and the universe behaves only one way according to laws of behaviour. Whatever ends up happening happened one way because that is the only way it possibly could have... because it did. The universe is deterministic because laws determine how it acts. We need better models than &quot;we don&#39;t know&quot;. The universe isn&#39;t arbitrary. It has laws. It has rules. It follows them. It may seem appealing, for the sake of free will, to say &quot;hey, it&#39;s completely random&quot;, but you can observe, empirically, that the past happened in one singular way. The universe doesn&#39;t exist at a 75% chance. There&#39;s no &quot;it&#39;s random, and there&#39;s no mechanics or reason causing a specific result, but a result will inexplicably happen on its own without the universe having a say in it&quot;. That&#39;s so fucking stupid. We HAVE better models with a deterministic grasp of quantum phenomena.

But on the other side, I&#39;m also familiar with the idea of that every theory about the universe is correct until they fail to work so (this is rather a philosophical interpretation of the subject). Latter idea means basically that e.g. equations explaining the free fall of an object work until the time the object rises instead of falling under the effect of gravity (which seems to be highly impossible, but no one can suggest that it will NEVER happen, since no one lived until the eternity to prove it so).<br><br>Comparing these two, all you can say is, whatever we observe is true. This is the one and only axiom in science in my opinion (because if we start the idea of questioning whether our observations are true or not, things start to get very complicated). Other than that, every outcome resulting from the observations (assumed to be true) are just predictions on the modelling of the system behind the universe. With better observations we have better models, which eventually disproving the previous models.<br><br>For example, during the days, in which people believed the earth was flat, probably it was never argued for some time (either 10 years or hundreds of years).
