This explains why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution !!! Great. Notice that the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. The sky is blue, and THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE. Consider what is the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites (ON BALANCE), as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON/IN BALANCE.

Now, consider what is the Sun AND the speed of light (c) ON BALANCE. NOW, think about what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE !!! Think about what is THE MAN (THE EYE) who actually IS IN what is outer \u201cspace\u201d. Basically and importantly, there is NO TIME. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as gravity is CLEARLY and necessarily proven to be ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy ON BALANCE. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as TIME dilation ultimately proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! Carefully consider what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE !!! Magnificent.

This explains F=ma AND E=MC2. Therefore, I have explained why the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it&#39;s revolution. Accordingly, ON BALANCE, consider the role or relation of what is the EYElid !!!! (LOOK around.) Great. Very carefully consider what is THE MAN (AND THE EYE) who IS standing on what is THE EARTH/ground ON BALANCE. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE. (Consider what is BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE on balance !!!!) The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE !! Inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! This ALSO explains F=ma AND E=MC2 ON BALANCE !!!!!!! The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky (ON BALANCE). GREAT. The tides are CLEARLY reflective of the fact that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE.<br><br>So, it is now time to turn to the BALANCED examination of what is the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of SPACE in relation to (ON BALANCE) what is the Sun AND the speed of light (c). Again, the stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky !!! Great. NOW, carefully consider what follows. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites ON BALANCE, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity (ON BALANCE) !!!!!!<br><br>The sky is blue, AND THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE !!! So, it is now TIME to turn to the DIRECT comparison of what is the orange (AND setting) Sun WITH what is the fully illuminated (AND setting) Moon. They are both the same size as what is THE EYE, AND these forms manifest (or form up) at what is EYE LEVEL/body height. Also, notice that the brightness of these manifestations appears to be the same. Moreover, the curvature or shape of said Moon matches that of THE EARTH/ground (that is, given a clear horizon). Lava appears orange, AND it even manifests as blood red. Excellent. I have proven that the sizes of said Moon, said Sun, and what is THE EYE cannot be a strange &quot;coincidence&quot;. In fact, consider the CONNECTION with the blue sky ON BALANCE; as the tides are CLEARLY proven to be electromagnetic/gravitational ON/IN BALANCE !!! I have mathematically unified physics. I have proven that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ON BALANCE !!! Finally, notice the consistent AND BALANCED MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of space that CLEARLY connects it ALL up (ON BALANCE); as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY AND necessarily proven to be gravity ON BALANCE. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, as TIME dilation ultimately proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity (ON BALANCE); as TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE !!!

ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. This is proven by F=ma AND E=mc2. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND describes what is possible/potential AND actual (IN BALANCE). So, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity is ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Therefore, invisible AND visible SPACE in FUNDAMENTAL equilibrium AND balance IS the MIDDLE DISTANCE in/of space consistent WITH/AS what is fundamentally balanced GRAVITATIONAL/ELECTROMAGNETIC force/energy; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Accordingly, inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE is proportional to (or balanced with/as) GRAVITATIONAL force/energy; as this balances AND unifies ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy AND gravity; as this balances gravity AND inertia. (This explains F=ma AND E=mc2, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.) ACCORDINGLY, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GREAT !!! A PHOTON may be placed at the center of the Sun (as a point, of course), as the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the speed of light; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. (The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky.) &quot;Mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent WITH/AS what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL force/energy, as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. E=mc2 IS F=ma. So, time DILATION ULTIMATELY proves that electromagnetism/energy is gravity. BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. INSTANTANEITY is thus FUNDAMENTAL to what is the FULL and proper understanding of physics/physical experience.<br><br>BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Great. Touch AND feeling BLEND, as GRAVITY AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY are linked AND balanced; as gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY; AS E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND balanced IN AND OUT of SPACE AND TIME, as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. E=mc2 IS F=ma. This is entirely proven by the mathematical unification of Maxwell&#39;s equations AND Einstein&#39;s equations (given the addition of a fourth spatial dimension). Indeed, this explains why Einstein&#39;s equations predict that SPACE is either expanding or contracting. Moreover, this is why Einstein&#39;s equations allow for (or predict) &quot;black holes&quot;. Balance and completeness go hand in hand. Einstein&#39;s equations are NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL. Notice the term c4. GREAT !!! ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This is proven by F=ma AND E=mc2. I have provided top down, true, and overwhelming mathematical proof AS WELL that gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. So, It is now abundantly and quite clear that Einstein never nearly understood gravity AND physics/physical experience. (Obviously, E=mc2 is DIRECTLY and fundamentally derived from F=ma.) Sir Isaac Newton now ranks second.<br><br>Very importantly, outer &quot;space&quot; involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black.<br><br>In fact, the ROTATION of the moon does MATCH it&#39;s REVOLUTION. ACCORDINGLY, gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. SO, a given planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times; AND this is THEN consistent WITH F=ma, E=mc2, AND what is perpetual motion; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Therefore, GRAVITATIONAL force/energy is proportional to (or balanced with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; as gravity is electromagnetism/energy. So, &quot;mass&quot;/energy involves balanced inertia/inertial resistance consistent WITH what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL force/energy; as ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. It ALL makes perfect sense. E=mc2 IS F=ma. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. (&quot;Mass&quot;/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. E=mc2 IS F=ma.) It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense. Objects fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. BALANCE and completeness go hand in hand. E=mc2 IS F=ma. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.

The surface tension generates objects that tend to be circular. Space&#39;s surface tension generates objects, this force is called gravity. This is my own theory on how gravity works. Space is not empty, space is the base aggregate state of energy (e=mc\u00b2), if it is heated, it will increase the ammount of matter it produces (virtual particles), like water produces bubbles, if it is boiled. In the beginning (big bang) space was very hot, so it created matter, which spread out in a circular way around the origin of the big bang, further and further like a circular tsunami in 3 dimensions. That process is still happening, and every matter is spreading in all directions, because it wants to reduce the surface matter reserves in space. The closer matter gets towards the actual big bang wave the faster it will move (it will never be able to reach it thou), that is why scientists say space is expanding, but it is not space itself expaning, it&#39;s the distances between objects only instead. While spreading out, accumulation into bigger clumps of matter is a way to reduce the surface tension already on the way toward the increasing ammount of matter, that is being generated by the big bang wave.

I believe every black hole in existence is the actual birth of a universe and the reason why is black is because we cant see into it and since it was the beginning of time not even light could or will ever escape it and the reason we cant see beyond it is because its the moment of creation just like we cant see a baby before it was crwated but we know the cells sre there. think of a black hole as a the father gravity as the mother annf the baby as the universe. I may be wrong this is just a theory . One more thing i BELiEVe that the reason why planets move and there is motion is because of the blackholes gravity influencing the motion. like a bathtub full of water is pretty much stable then when the plug is pulled all thr matter bubbles rubber duckies that are in that tub (universe) begin to show signs of motion and the closer they get to the center the motions start to swirl. I believe the speed and direction of the black hole influences the motion of matter and ironically so far every universe or solar system we know of has a black hole which makes my theory make sense. if there was no such thing as a black hole i dont believe gravity woulf exist and there would be no universe or energy to grt things going. it woul be like a bathtub full of soap and bubbles with the plug in it.

The phenomenon is explained if only the mechanism behind &#39;how Gravity attracts things&#39; is explained. And the scientists of the mediator period have made it more complex to become a paradox by their philosophic definitions which could never be proven practically or mathematically. I firmly believe Scientists of the 21st century can solve this paradox unless they really want to conserve it as a paradox for the future generations to solve.\u00a0<br><br>Students of logical thinking should ask the questions;\u00a0<br>1. Why Gravity does only attract things and why it doesn&#39;t repel ?\u00a0<br>2. Why Gravity attract only &#39;atomic mass&#39; and why not &#39;energy mass&#39; like photon, electrons, solar wind etc?\u00a0<br><br>Before answering above questions we have to clarify &#39;what are the three fundamental space matter?&#39; Soils, Liquids and gasses must be the sure answer from a student of junior secondary level. But we know that are the three phases of the atomic mass.Then what matter is electron&#39;s, light and heat etc? Do not they posses a mass? That category of matter has to be recognized as &#39;Energy Mass&#39;. Solar wind too belongs to that category because it is made up of weakly charged \u00a0energy particles emitted from Sun. Then what is the third category of fundamental space matter? It is the &#39;Space Medium Matter&#39;. The space is densely filled with this invisible static matter and it has a density and a pressure.<br><br>Now only the mechanism of Gravity can be explained because the different behaviour of energy waves and energy rays could not be distinguished until a space medium of matter is accepted. Energy rays like light, heat X-ray etc. dont need a medium to travel because they are line projection of energy particles like photons. But waves such as, natural sounds, electromagnetic FM or AM sounds, TV etc always need a medium to travel.<br><br>Gravity too is due to a medium wave and how could it born?\u00a0<br>Put a fly in to a calm water and you would observe tiny waves round and round. That is how atomic masses produce gravitational wave in the space medium. A single atom can be considered as a rotary engine in which electron clouds are rotating round the nucleus. Any rotary machine in the world makes a vibration and a bigger collection of atomic mass makes a stronger vibration to transmit a stronger wave through the medium. That is how the gravitational waves are born but how on earth it can attract another mass?<br><br>When the wave strike upon any secondary atom in the field, the rotating electron cloud is a bit pushed more closer to the nucleus from the direction at where the wave strikes from. Thence the Coulomb&#39;s electromagnetic force at the side of wave strike becomes bigger and the resultant force makes the atom move towards the gravity source. Electrons and photons are not responded by gravity because they don&#39;t have internal rotary systems to be affected.\u00a0<br><br>Other most important thing is that, dynamic behaviour of gravitational fields has not yet even touched. Only the static gravitation was explained in Newtonian Mechanics.But you know Sun is rotating and its gravitational field is not static at all.

Universal laws endeavour to unite everything to a singularity - meaning &#39;nothing&#39; - including time itself, and therefore uniting bodies to within the same reference time-frame, and so we have gravity - not too dissimilar from surface tension on water. Consider gravity from that perspective then you can start to unify gravity, inertia, photons, energy, etc. Taking this further, I believe the traditional notion of a black hole having gravitational force where not even light can &#39;escape&#39; is\u00a0the\u00a0product of misguided science\u00a0- particularly as gravitational force is mostly attributed to a dense neutron mass at its centre, yet we have enormous x-ray radiation along the perfect axis\u00a0which is simplistically dismissed as... &quot;a lensing effect&quot; at the border of the event horizon. HOWEVER, consider conservation of motion and the rapid rotation of that dense neutron mass\u00a0where, therefore,\u00a0time dilation\u00a0imposed by\u00a0surface velocity of the nucleus simply\u00a0cannot be ignored. When particles approach the black hole the electrons are &#39;squeezed out&#39; under what we observe as gravitational force, but the resulting quantum&#39;s of energy are absorbed and projected forward in time through incredible time dilation due to the spinning core. Unlike a pure vortex however, the speed of spin of a mass approaches zero as you move towards the axis of rotation, therefore diminishing time dilation to near zero - allowing us to observe intense X-radiation as it effectively\u00a0stacks up and ejects from the black hole along\u00a0its axis. Much of the radiation we observe today may be attributed to atomic energy rapidly projected forward in time to our time, from millions (or billions) of years in the past. The blackness of the black hole\u00a0can be attributed to\u00a0time dilation, where light intensity (let&#39;s say... photons per second) reduces as we observe time dilation through the slow-down in the presence of high gravitational field - as covered in the video. As time dilation increases, the number of photons per second decreases,\u00a0until we have &#39;blackness&#39;. I accept my theories\u00a0are just that, but what is there to suggest that it&#39;s this mysterious &#39;gravity&#39; and not time that governs\u00a0our universal laws - particularly as established mathematics holds true.", "comment_date": "2013-11-30T22:16:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "William Radecki", "comment_text": "You should do a video about the math behind gravity! :D\u00a0", "comment_date": "2013-11-27T07:11:18Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "SCRedstone", "comment_text": "Happy ~1.6 birthday from your first video!!", "comment_date": "2013-11-24T19:49:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BROWNYBOY", "comment_text": "There is a big difference from you most recent videos to this better voice better animations/draws and better lighting ", "comment_date": "2013-11-24T11:19:11Z", "likes_count": 26}, {"comment_by": "npc", "comment_text": "So, that was a description of gravity.

We don&#39;t feel the moon&#39;s gravity, because together with the earth we are in a freefall orbit around the moon-earth centre of mass. The same thing happens with astronauts in orbit around earth. On the other hand we feel the earth\u2019s gravity on the ground, because the earth\u2019s surface stops us from freefalling. And the tides that are caused from the moon, is a much weaker effect than the gravitational pull itself, but it is an effect that is present even in freefall.", "comment_date": "2011-09-06T14:55:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Belger", "comment_text": "what about magnets?", "comment_date": "2011-09-06T03:43:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Katekyo", "comment_text": "thank freddiew that i reached here!", "comment_date": "2011-08-09T19:41:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "g.s.", "comment_text": "this is very cool. its like xkcd, but videos instead of comics", "comment_date": "2011-08-09T16:42:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Selotrum", "comment_text": "I&#39;m watching this and i hate physics.", "comment_date": "2011-08-09T00:01:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Archana Burra", "comment_text": "i love you", "comment_date": "2011-08-08T07:28:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dr. Chester Zoda", "comment_text": "I already like ur videos just from watching one.\n\nThe drawings can be a bit irrelevant, and you speak a little too fast before I think xD\n\nEither way, keep the vids coming", "comment_date": "2011-07-25T16:14:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sean Aquilina", "comment_text": "@Macihnima That&#39;s still quite a new idea, its not gravity though, its called dark energy", "comment_date": "2011-07-18T14:38:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Karen Caulfield", "comment_text": "You did great, but I have no fucking idea about physics still.", "comment_date": "2011-07-17T18:45:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Caed", "comment_text": "Bloody hard to click that annotation.
