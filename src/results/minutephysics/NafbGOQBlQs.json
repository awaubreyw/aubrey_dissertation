IF YOU go to the book of Exodus, when Moses goes up Mt Sinai in Saudi Arabia, There is Three beings on the Mountain of YAHWEH, The Voice from the Bush that did not burn, his the Shikina of YAHWEH, HIS LIGHT EMISSION, THE SON YESUHA WAS THERE DOING THE SPEAKING. Moses asked at a point to see YAHWEH, YESHUA TOLD MOSES, YOU CANNOT LOOK UPON HIM AND LIVE, HOWEVER, PAY ATTENTION HERE ITS IMPORTANT, YESHUA SAYS &quot;I WILL PUSH YOU INTO THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK AND YOU WILL SEE HIS HIND PARTS&quot; SO MOSES WAS THERE, YESHUA WAS DOING THE PUSHING AND THE ABBA FATHER PASSED by MOSES&quot; Moses Was Face to Face with the Earlier name of YESHUA AS THE ANGEL OF YAHWEH. HEBREW WORD &quot;ANGEL&quot; IS MESSENGER. ELO-HYM. ELO IS YAHWEH, ELOHYM IS PLURAL Like letter S in English.  All of Moses interactions was with Yeshua in the Image of CHADOM OR we know as ADAM.  YESHUA WAS BASED ON GOSPEL OF JOHN 1:1 <br>the Elohym that formed Adam from the Clay of the Eretz, Hebrew &quot;Earth&quot; this is verified also witnesses by Apostle Yahkonan &quot;John&quot; when YESHUA confronted by the blind man, YESHUA picked up the Clay of the Earth, Spit into it, and placed it on the eyes of the blind man.  This descriptor was proving that. CHRIST WAS MAN&#39;S CREATOR, HE was fully Elohym and Fully Adam, WE are Sons and Daughters of Adam.  YESHUA&#39;S  BLOOD HAS BEEN TESTED GENETICALLY, THE RESULTS ARE ASTOUNDING. HIS CHROMESOMES COUNT IS IN TOTAL 24, If you view the Chomesome Record, there are 23 MYTDNA and one &quot;y&quot; this is too very interesting above the fact HIS GENETICS was lacking 22 Chomesmes. <br>In Hebrew, there are no Capital letters, the &quot;y&quot; Chromosome expressed resembled the paleo Hebrew letter yud or &quot;y&quot; the chomesome was very similar to the &quot;y&quot; or yud.<br>, CHAVA or Eve, means Life Bearer. All humans came from CHADOM &amp; CHAVA. Proven by Genetics, the Very Same &quot;y&quot; Chromosome from Adam, is in Every Male today.  The woman is the passer of Mitrochondrial Gene&#39;s from All of the males/female off spring since , Eve.   She has X X chromesome pair, male is X &amp; Y.  All fetus the first 6 weeks of life are Genetically Express XX, Then the Male X Becomes sex determinanate and a Male, develops.  GENETICALLY ALL MALES EVER BORN OF WOMAN, FOR THE PAST 6000 YEARS ARE TRACED DIRECTLY TO YESHUA THE FIRST ADOM&#39;S IMAGE.  I personally believe the Anti-Christ, after he receives the Headwound and sinjazzel to who ALL SIN HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TOO, in dwells the physical body of the Male, whom very well be a cloned person,[ This is purely subjection on my studying the Word Picture of the Man of Anti Christ means substitute not against, the Genetic lineage is the serpent seed of Genesis 4, Genetically Kain&#39;, lineage, as there are two genetic LINEAGES in the Genesis 3 &amp; 4 narrative.  The Prince of Wales, Prince Harry is my favorite filling those shoes]<br>for WE are the Temple of the Holy Spirit. Not a Physical Temple destroyed in 70 AD. Sinjazzel is trying to get Redeamed back to where HE WAS CAST OUT FROM, HE HAS ALWAYS USED SECOND WHAT ELO-HYM FORMED FIRST. Listen to John 8, When CHRIST SAYS YOU ARE OF YOUR FATHER THE DEVIL SATAN, means ADVESARY IN HEBREW. HE WAS A MURDERER FROM THE VERY BEGINING. HE WAS A LIAR, AND THE FATHER OF LIES ONLY KNOW LIES. Who was the first murder truly? The Nakosh, the shining one in the garden. Adam/Eve would of seenAngel&#39;s, Cherubs Seraphym When YESHUA walked with Adam in the Cool of the Day, The idea that Adam/Eve never had seen an Angelic Being BEFORE the FALL, Eve may had even spoken to sinjazzel previously, why she trusted His words.  HE knew, that HIS deception could lead to THEIR VERY DEMISE. HE WAS THE FIRST MURDER, HE KILLED EVERY PERSON THAT HAS BEEN BORN, THATS WHAT I TRULY CALL A MASS MURDERER <br>HE KILLED, THE SON OF YAHWEH,  BUT DIDNT KNOW THE TRUE POWER OF OUR CREATOR. <br> Sinjazzel was the most annointed Cherub, HE was kin to everything ELO-HYM discussed. So, when YESHUA made a clay facsimile of himself and breathed life into it, YESHUA made a Exalted race ABOVE the angelic host, and Adom was told HE would Judge Angel&#39;s.  Sanjazezel was subordinate to the CREATOR. There was no way he could ascend above and inherit the nature and being of YAHWEH.  Like on Earth currently EVERYTHING IS IN A STATE OF DECAY, LAW OF ENTROPY, and ITS RUN OUT OF TIME. <br><br>CHRIST&#39;S THRONE IS DESCRIBED AS SITTING ON SAPPHIRE BLUE STONE, THE TABLETS GIVEN TO MOSES WERE WRITTEN FROM THAT VERY STONE BY THE FINGER OF YESHUA, INCLUDING THE SECOND SET AFTER MOSES BROKE THE FIRST SET.  <br>EVERYTHING, I MEAN EVERYTHING WRITTEN IN THE BIBLE IS YESHUAS WORDS &amp; NATURE AND WE WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THE BIBLE AS TWO WITNESSES ARE REQUIRED. We are surrounded by ANGELS recording our life MINUTE BY MINUTE. If you deny THE RUACH OF YAHWEH, THE DEVINE WIND, HOLY SPIRIT. The very person who will be your WITNESSES to the Rejection of CHRIST, IT WILL BE YOUR OWN ACTIONS that are in the Angel&#39;s Records of your life. <br> I bear  witness that YESHUA Audibly SPOKE to me, and saved mylife when I was 25, I&#39;m now 64, I was HIS when I was  3 years old, HE came to me in 3 visions in dreams over 6 weeks. It was like yesterday as a memory.  Those small voices that you call intuition, it is your Creator speaking to you. This Earth has nothing but the Law of entropy and Death. YESHUA IS LIFE, HES PROBATION TIME IS ENDING, CHOSE HIS GIFT OF REDEMPTION FREELY, HIS FATHER AND OUR FATHER IS SOVEREIGN, HIS CLOCK HAS RUN OUT OF TIME, YESHUA IS PREPARED FOR HIS CHILDREN TO TAKE THEM TO THE PLACE HE&#39;S PREPARED FOR HIS BELOVED ONES, A NEW EARTH. HE HAS REVEALED HIMSELF TO MILLIONS, THEY HAVE ACCEPTED THE GIFT, YOUR SIN RECORDS WILL BE DESTROYED AND NEVER REMBERED IF YOU CHOOSE ETERNAL LIFE, IT IS HIS LOVE GIFT TO YOU.

You said that the greater the frequency of a wavelength the more it scatters by the air particles it hits and thus the less frequency a light has the more that type of light will reach our eyes when we look directly at the sources of the light (because it scatters the least). So by your explanation the sun should look mostly red when we look at it or around it, but it looks mostly yellowish-white and not red, how&#39;s that possible?<br>2) At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NafbGOQBlQs&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a> You say that there are more air particles around when the sun sets and thus even more higher frequency wavelength light will scatter because more air particles are present for the light to scatter and so we get even richer orange-red colors at sunset. But why aren&#39;t the sky even more blue at sunset? By your explanation there are more air particles presents and so more blue light scatters, so when we look away from the sun the sky should look even more blue at sunset than at 1 pm for instance but in fact the sky looks reddish and not blue, how&#39;s that possible, since red light scatters the least? I understand the explanation on why the sun looks more red-orange at sunset when you look directly at it or near it, but I fail to understand why the sky themselves are painted yellow-orange-red even way you look away from the sun, shouldn&#39;t they be more deep blue when you look away from the sun? <br>An explanation would be much appreciated.", "comment_date": "2018-09-19T21:31:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "XPJV", "comment_text": "Water is blue, sky is blue.

The sun was setting and on the opposite side the moon was rising. Because of what @MinutePhysics explained in this video, the sun and the sky around it looked orange-red. What was interesting was that the moon w,hich was full, also appeared orange, but it faded into normal white as it got higher. <br>My theory is that the same thing that happens to light coming from the sun when it is setting happened to the moonlight.

While visible light showed up to 55 km to the cooling towers of the Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant, the IR spectrum showed the Pova\u017esk\u00fd inovec mountains, about 100 km away. The atmosphere did scatter all the short wavelengths of (reflected) light of the visible spectrum from far away, but the longer near IR light passed, or at least a part of it. IR is less affected by Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering, by mist and by haze than all colors of visible light (the entire visible light range). That is why the IR image shows also the distant mountains. And no, you can try to boost contrast on the visible light image as far as you want, there is nothing there (I tried it when processing the RAW files, believe\u00a0me).<br><br>Another funny thing: Notice the sudden drop in contrast in the IR image at the level of the nuclear power plant? You might expect that this line forms the horizon behing which we cannot see due to earth curvature. We can find out:<br><br>The picture was taken from a height about 400 meters above sea level and the power plant is about 175 meters above sea level. Taking the elevations I wrote here (got them from a hiking map) and\u00a0using\u00a0basic geometry maths taking into account also the refraction of the atmosphere (used the values defined\u00a0for visible light also for near infrared as there is little difference), the calculations say the horizon (or the nuclear power plant on the horizon) should be 58,5 km away. This nicely fits with the measured distance of 55 km using google maps. It is so nice when things work out!<br><br>But how do we see the mountains in the background? Well, they are high, reaching up to 640 - 900 meters in height, so they &quot;rise&quot; behind the horizon. Basically the IR photo shows everything up to the horizon at a distance of about 58\u00a0km and then the background at a distance of roughly 100 km. You cannot see anything between the horizon and the hills due to earth curvature.<br><br>But you would not see the background\u00a0anyway as you are limited by your eyes to the part of electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light. The visibility was rather very good when I took the picutres, the conditions are\u00a0often much worse, so you cannot see even the cooling towers of the nuclear powerplant. Even the visible light image taken at a rather very good visibility conditions has just a faint picture of them.<br><br>Next time I will try to &quot;see&quot; (using\u00a0both visible and near IR) the Apls in Austria from Dev\u00ednska Kobya.
