Sounds to me suspiciously like: (a) confusion between  Julian Date and Modified Julian Date (and its derivatives), and (b) confusion somewhere between standard time and daylight saving time, or [more likely] between  EST (Florida) and CST (Houston). The combination of (a) and (b) could produce 11, 12 or 13 hours error. It&#39;s an easy error to make since astronomers use Julian Date (starting at 12h UT Jan. 1, 4713 BC) and NASA has tended to use some form of Modified Julian Date, which is 12 hours less than JD, minus some large integer (e.g. 2400000 or 2440000) to produce a smaller number for storage in a computer.  Converting CST to JD, for example, would produce a +11 hour time error relative to converting EST to MJD (ignoring the integer part). Perhaps the time was fed to Starliner from a computer running on CST, and the wrong definition of Julian date zero point was used.

At times they indicated firing opposite directions on the same RCS-pod at the same time - which doesn&#39;t make sense at all, so I figured it was just a thing with the temporal resolution of the display (i.e. seperate firings in opposite directions within the same display frame). Firing at such a high rate seemed strange; you don&#39;t need that high accuracy during coasting (not even to align the solar panels correctly, it wont matter if they&#39;re off by a few degrees). The only time where you need it is during OI, which at that point still was several minutes away.<br><br>But first I was thinking that they&#39;re just running some tests of the RCS (which would in fact explain firing opposite thrusters at the same time as to not affect the craft&#39;s attitude). Turns out my gut feeling wasn&#39;t all that bad...<br><br><br><br>Regarding the last comment about clocks: as a software engineer myself I can say: clocks by themselves are simple (it&#39;s just a counter). The hard part is a) reliably synchronizing clocks and b) dealing with time zones (if possible just run everything in UTC or Unix epoch - it makes life so much easier). And commenting on the reporter&#39;s question about redundancy in the clock: that would add c) how to tell which clock is correct. That&#39;s the edge-case for redundancy - it&#39;s simply impossible to have 100% redundancy for everything; at some point you just have to trust your hardware. Even if you have 3 clocks, you have to make a &quot;2 out of 3&quot; decision (thereby trusting that the majority is correct, which isn&#39;t necessarily true, and trusting that the comparator works properly) and switching over to a &#39;correct&#39; clock (trusting in that handover to work correctly).<br>And if you switch/change/reset clocks you also have to make sure that no part of your system relies on the clock always counting upwards, but can deal with clocks jumping back to the past (e.g. correctly handle events that must only happen once, even if you see the same timestamp twice).<br>Sometimes, adding redundancy introduces way more new problems than it solves.<br><br>For example, at work we had an issue with redundant databases, where the problem wasn&#39;t the two separate database instances but the piece of software keeping them in sync (which screwed up and shredded the data in both databases). Since then we just run with a single instance but do filesystem snapshots every hour, so that if it fails we can just start up a new VM, load the last snapshot and have the system running again in a matter of minutes.
