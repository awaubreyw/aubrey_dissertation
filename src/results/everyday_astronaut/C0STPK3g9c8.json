And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T06:52:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ze Boss07", "comment_text": "THE CAKE", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T21:29:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SEFUX", "comment_text": "I&#39;m watching it today and today (for me) Return to Sender launched.

Due to its smaller size, not only can the RocketLab Electron put payloads into customized orbits far easier than putting them onto a Falcon 9 with hundreds of other satellites, but there are other factors involved too.  Most significantly is the payload integration costs, where stuff launched on a Falcon 9 requires the small sat/cubesat customers to undergo some incredibly expensive testing and qualifications before they are permitted on the flight.  Costs like that are trivial if your satellite costs millions or even billions of dollars (such as some GEO telecom birds) but can be incredibly expensive when you think of the cost per satellite as it turns out to be a pretty flat charge regardless of the mass of the spacecraft.  A cubesat which cost $30k to build but has a $100k testing fee significantly overwhelms the $3k/kg or so launch costs on something like the Falcon 9.<br><br>Other factors come into play, where the Electron for smaller payloads really is a huge deal for customers wanting to build spacecraft in the market that RocketLab is focusing upon.

I can&#39;t reach them (rocket lab) -- maybe they will read here -- but I&#39;d love to suggest a couple of ideas for their engineers to ponder:<br><br>(1) Landing the first stage: Figure out how to make rotating blades (in place of grid-fins, or a ring-fin) that can dump energy back into the first stage batteries by rotating once low enough in the atmosphere; no other rocket has a means of energy storage like this, so they&#39;d might as well try using it.  If the blades could be made to counter-rotate, then there would be no torque on the body, and stored energy could be sent back into the blades to land the vehicle much like a helicopter (with possible assistance from Rutherford or gas thrusters).  This would make use of the batteries a second time, making up for the fuel their weight displaces and allowing a recovery of S1.<br><br>(2) Second stage energy generation:  Use the temperature difference between exhaust gases and cryogenic oxidizer, combined with the much larger surface area of a vacuum engine, to produce power using thermoelectric generators.  It&#39;s true they are not very efficient, but at the temperature differentials here they might be able to produce enough power, especially considering there is only one turbo-pump.  Because the Rutherfords are 3-d printed, incorporating the generators into the bell may be much easier than trying to apply them to a machined bell.  It would be interesting to see if this could produce enough power, and if so, how much payload it would free up by the removal of batteries.  Perhaps if they make it light enough, even a partial offset of power could be achieved on the first stage using a similar system.<br><br>I think ultimately, powering the second stage turbo-pump with a heat differential, helicoptering stage 1 back to earth, and being able to reuse it, will make the electron the ultimate lightweight launch system.  [edit: forgot to mention, with cryogenic oxidizer they could also use high temperature superconducting components in the turbopump motor]<br><br>In the far future, once they&#39;ve figured out how to helicopter S1s back down, they could do an Electron-Heavy!  Like a mini- falcon9!  How cool would that be!!!!!???
