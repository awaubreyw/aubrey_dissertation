I have one big disagreement though, and that&#39;s about when to cut from one shot to the next.  In general, when it comes to videos, especially rocket videos, the temptation to cut should be resisted more than it is.  Less cutting and longer shots allow the viewer to get a better immersive sense of what&#39;s happening.  To my mind, a longer single shot is more enjoyable but that&#39;s not what usually happens.  Specifically, the shot from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kTdpzVaSu4&amp;t=6m35s\">6:35</a> should not have been switched at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kTdpzVaSu4&amp;t=6m41s\">6:41</a>.  That degraded the experience, at least for me.  The shot from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kTdpzVaSu4&amp;t=6m35s\">6:35</a> should have gone, uninterrupted, all the way to contact with the ground at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kTdpzVaSu4&amp;t=6m44s\">6:44</a>.
