OK!  And then PLUNGE!<br><br>If there was sufficient reentry burn fuel to continue this process with a carefully controlled course, would it not actually be practical to reach a high in-atmosphere altitude without the atmospheric braking used today.  I expect the Earth&#39;s rotation would be a significant factor in the reentry profile - far less velocity to lose if reentry is same direction as rotation of earth&#39;s surface.<br><br>Then, no heat shields of any significance need be required?  Actual re-entry to atmosphere would be a very comfortable ride without dangers except those technical associated with engines and flight control.<br><br>I have no experience or knowledge of space flight matters Tim.  But if there were plenty of fuel-tanker resources in orbit around the planet, would this not be a way to minimize the complex and expensive external thermal protection required for most reentry vehicles today?<br><br>Leave it with you as I am somewhat reclusive and do not know where else to lodge such a question.<br>Loved your SpaceX 2-part tour.

And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T06:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "manisha gangawala", "comment_text": "Poor narration, like a 4 yo retelling a story.", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T05:22:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Angel Leal", "comment_text": "Nice tshirt, where do we get it ?", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T04:58:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Iarwain Niblack", "comment_text": "You\u2019re show would be cool if it wasn\u2019t about you.

It seems you would still be able to maintain enough speed to control the capsule&#39;s trajectory on reentry, and if the heat/plasma buildup was somewhat lessened, the heat shield would also have a longer lifespan.

So where did Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, with this medical information ??<br><br>4 - God said: (And the heavens we built with hands, but we are enlarged) Aldhariyat: 47<br><br>And modern science has proven that the sky is constantly expanding, so who told Muhammad, may God\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, of this fact in these backward ages? Did he own telescopes and satellites? !! Or is it a revelation from God, the creator of this great universe ??? Is not this conclusive evidence that this Qur\u2019an is a right from God ???<br><br>5- God said (And the sun runs to settle for her. That is the appreciation of the dear, the most knowledgeable) Yes: 38<br><br>And modern science has proven that the sun is traveling at 43200 miles an hour, and since the distance between us and the sun is 92 million miles, we see it as a constant that does not move. These are scientific facts that we were not able to learn from until recently.<br><br>6 - God said (He who wants to lead him astray makes his chest narrow and critical, as if he ascends in the sky) Al-Anam: 125<br><br>Now when you get on a plane and fly you and go up in the sky, how do you feel? Don&#39;t you feel chest tightness? In your opinion, who told Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, 1400 years ago? Did he own his own spacecraft, through which he could know this physical phenomenon? Or is it a revelation from God Almighty ???<br><br>7 - God said (And what night do we have the day from which we should flush from the day, so when they are wronged) Yes: 37<br>And God said (And we have decorated the earthly heaven with favors): King: 5<br>As the two generous verses indicate, the universe is drowned in dark darkness, even though we are in broad daylight on the surface of the earth. Scientists have seen the earth and the rest of the planets of the solar system illuminated in broad daylight while the heavens around them are sunk in the dark. Darkness is the dominant state of the universe? And that these galaxies and stars are nothing but small and weak lamps that do not nearly dispel the darkness of the surrounding universe, and it looked like decorations and lamps, no more?<br><br>8 - God said (And we made the sky a preserved roof) the Prophets: 32<br><br>And modern science has proven the presence of the atmosphere surrounding the Earth, which protects it from harmful solar radiation and destroyed meteorites. They quickly extinguish and disappear, and this is what we call the meteors. Who told Muhammad, may God\u2019s prayers and peace be upon him, that the sky, like the roof, keeps the Earth from meteorites and harmful solar radiation? Is this not from the definitive evidence that this Qur\u2019an is from the creator of this great universe ???<br><br>9 - God said: (And the mountains as pegs). News: 7<br>And God said: (And put my mind on the ground to stretch out with you) Luqman: 10<br><br>Since the Earth&#39;s crust and the mountains, plateaus and deserts on it rise above the liquid depths and the moving mollusk known as the (cinema layer), the earth&#39;s crust and its on it will expand and move constantly and will result in massive movement and earthquakes that destroy everything .. But nothing of this happened ... Reason ?<br><br>It has been evident recently that two-thirds of any mountain is planted deep in the ground and in the (Sima caste) and only a third is raised above the surface of the earth, so God Almighty likened the mountains to the pegs that hold the tent to the earth as in the previous verse.<br><br>10- God said (And you see the mountains counting them as rigid, and they pass by the clouds, God made them who mastered everything) Ants: 88<br><br>We all know that the mountains are fixed in their place, but if we rise from the earth away from its attractiveness and atmosphere, then we will see the earth rotating at a tremendous speed (100 miles per hour), and then we will see the mountains as if they are walking the clouds, that is, their movement is not subjective, but is related to the movement of the earth just like the clouds that do not move Himself is driven by wind, and this is evidence of the movement of the earth.

I watched this video after seeing your coverage of the landing of DM-2. Over and over you would talk about how decreasing velocity causes the capsule to come closer to the surface of the Earth without explaining why in an easily understandable way. I think if you created a graphic that shows altitude vs. orbital velocity - rings of different altitudes that show each with a different stable orbital velocity - it would show how decreasing velocity causes the capsule to &#39;fall&quot; into a lower stable orbit. And that eventually the decreased altitude places the capsule into the thicker parts of the Earth&#39;s atmosphere, causing more slowing, causing more falling, etc. This could save a lot of potentially confusing words. <br><br>As is often said, a picture is worth a thousand words. I think a well constructed graphic could really decrease a lot of verbal explanation that loses us in the weeds, or in this case, the vacuum of space. <br><br>Thanks Tim,  for listening, and for all your efforts to keep us in the know about space! :))", "comment_date": "2020-08-03T09:56:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Poppy's Video Collection", "comment_text": "Why is it necessary to keep the nose cone open until just before re-entry?", "comment_date": "2020-08-03T09:56:13Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brent Jabri S.
