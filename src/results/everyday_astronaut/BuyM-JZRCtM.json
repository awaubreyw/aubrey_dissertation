Maybe you know or you might be able to ask? Are there any recurring stress dream archetypes specific to rocket scientists or the engineers who spend years working on something like James Webb? Regular people experience variations of the same basic stress dream archetypes. Like, the brakes or steering wheel on your car not working. Trying to throw a punch at your bully, but your arm moves in slow motion. If a student fears public speaking and they have a speech to deliver next week, they&#39;ll dream they accidentally showed up to school naked. That&#39;s a common stress dream archetype. If they&#39;re very worried about their grades, they dream they showed up on finals day realizing they forgot to study. That&#39;s another standard common archetype. There are others that are occupationally specific. An athlete missing the free-throw to lose the big game, or running in slow motion like the air is impossibly thick... An airline pilot flying 200 people, forgets how the controls work and crashes because the other crew members can&#39;t hear and won&#39;t respond. A doctor doing surgery on your child, forgets to use anesthesia. etc. etc. Are there any shared stress dream archetypes specific to astronauts? Accidentally pushing a button and blowing a fellow astronaut out an ISS airlock? The capsule door falling off during reentry? How about the people responsible for building the rocket that takes them up? Do they wake up panicked because they dreamed they killed everybody by forgetting to carry the one or inputting non-metric data? Dropping a tool in to a rocket engine and not telling anybody? Waiting years to find out if your lander will touch down successfully, I imagine engineers must have a common stress dream archetype about the lander cratering because they made a mistake and the two hundred other engineers all turn and look at you and shake their heads... <br><br>A massive army of people have been devoted to working on James Webb, since 1996. $500,000,000 and who knows how many hours of hard work (probably a lot). Does someone dream they left work and forgot to turn off the machine that polishes the mirrors and now they&#39;re all destroyed from scratch marks? Used the wrong type of polish and scrubbed the mirrors with sand? Or just knocking the whole thing over with the scissor-lift and shattering all the mirrors while your supervisor is watching you? Do they see news reports, like an Everyday Astronaut video showing their face and explaining to the world how everyone was counting on them but the trust was misplaced and they screwed up and destroyed the telescope?<br><br>Don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard someone like Buzz Alrdrin talk about it.
