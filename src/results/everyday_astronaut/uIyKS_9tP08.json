The drive and desire Elon has in space flight is what gives me so much faith that he will continue to drive space industry into more and more uncharted territories. I only wish other space companies/agencies would wake up already and step up to the plate of innovation as confidently and as much as SpaceX has. The space industry needs competition and innovation and not the stagnant cozy comfort money pits that the industry has been for so long now.<br><br>Other space companies and agencies have got to be scared over the direction and incredible pace, determination and innovation that Elon is driving SpaceX in. Just goes to show how a team driven by someone (as well as others on the team) who truly believes in and loves to do what he does can accomplish so much, very inspirational and more leaders of companies and industries should really be taking notes. Just don&#39;t forget the people working for you that pulled the cart.<br><br>Other companies I feel need to step up to the plate and start innovating soon or risk becoming obsolete without the funds and means to keep afloat and we know where that leads, lack of competition.", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T01:09:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jimmyjam C", "comment_text": "The very best audio recording of a rocket launch that I have ever heard without all the distortion!!

If so, that would have certainly have added to the fireworks on impact. But wow, that flight is something I will not forget. Amazing to see all the hard work coming together, and seeing her fly. That flight profile is something totally new when it comes to rockets, and it worked flawlessly. And when you consider just how big that thing is, that is just amazing. Such a shame she lost pressure at the end, I wonder if the sudden transition back to vertical was just a bit too quick for the fuel to settle back in the bottom of the header tanks? If so, maybe a slightly slower transition - using the flaps to start with would help in future? But I am sure the folks at SpaceX gathered a ton of data about the flight, and can work out from that the cause of the low fuel pressure. But all in all, everyone involved with the design and building of these prototypes should be feeling very proud of this achievement. Thank you so much for bringing us these wonderful views of the launch and flight, the quality was amazing.", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T01:01:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dave Hennessy", "comment_text": "Is there footage of the fall and transition back to vertical flight from a normal perspective, the zoomed in parts are great but you have no reference for speed.", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T01:01:04Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Spacex Nerd", "comment_text": "It hurts to see how close it got", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T01:00:12Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Darrell Cherry", "comment_text": "I loved the video.

I wonder if they were afraid of over rotating and loss of control?  Falling backwards like that, the way they did it makes it more stable, for sure, but I&#39;ll be looking out what (hopefully) SN9 does, see if they try using the draglets more with lessons learnt from this flight.
