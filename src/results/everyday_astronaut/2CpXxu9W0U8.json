Knight", "comment_text": "Hi and thanks for another good video. I am posting the following on here and will copy/paste on others as well since I cannot post on Elon Musk&#39;s twitter account due to my account being suspended, while I still await for an explanation for my suspension and hopefully be unsuspended in a brief future. So now that this it out of the way, here&#39;s my thoughts and opinions on  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  successes and failures. Personally I don&#39;t really see failures in SN8, SN9 and SN10 flights and specific maneuvers and landings because after only 2 launches and explosive landings, SN10&#39;s mission was successful in all it&#39;s maneuvers from launch, belly flop, descending to hitting where  <b>&quot;X&quot;</b> marked the spot. Thus proving that these maneuvers is the way to go and just needs tweaking&#39;s from what they&#39;ve learned on each launches/landings and now adding/counting SN10&#39;s success up to the 8th minute where it exploded. So technically SN10 did everything right and proved all competitors/detractors that these methods of maneuvers are the way to go and are definitely possible to achieve. <br><br>\r<br>The biggest issues are about the landings which is just a matter of a short period of time before all is resolved.  Now, my technical opinions and positions on what keeps going wrong no matter what other issues they fix on present and future  <b>&quot;StarShips&quot;</b> . \r<br>In my opinion,  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b> , is the only spacecraft/rocket ever launched that has this kind of engine bay/skirt that has it&#39;s engines within a skirt, has no firewalls to protect the upper parts of the engines and other important components, has no water prevention system and is extremely slow at takeoff to clear it&#39;s launching point. Even it&#39;s two little brothers, Falcon9 and Falcon Heavy benefit from all those supportive systems at launch and lets not forget that Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy&#39;s engines are outward and not within a skirt like  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  and probably gets damaged at launch due to not enough ground clearance. Meaning, all the flames, heat, sound vibrations and even debris are bounced back upwards towards the inside of the skirt and engulfing the engines and the total inside of the skirt and due to it&#39;s slow ascendance it gives all of those issues mentioned above more then enough time to cause damages during it&#39;s launch. <br><br>\r<br>So basically,  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  launches already damaged which makes it hard to get a 100% successful landing, even if all the maneuvers went according to plan and looked nominal. When <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b> lands it faces the exact same issues upon touching ground, <b>&quot;NO GROUND CLEARANCE&quot;</b>  because the legs are way to short, so short that when SN10 landed due to a faster speed than desired/wanted, it crushed the legs that were locked in while the other 3 legs were totally useless due to never having locked in the right position. Even with all these issues, SN10 still landed upright and stayed so for 8 mins while laying on it&#39;s skirt. And unfortunately, since there wasn&#39;t even an inch of ground clearance, they couldn&#39;t get the water to reach the inner skirt, just no way to get to it and the rest is history. Elon Musk has mentioned that they might re think the landing by capturing  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  like they intend to do with the  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  booster. In my own (don&#39;t matter) opinions. All the major issues resolve around the launch and landing ground clearance with a few preventive proven method to assure a good launch without any early damages by increasing the ground clearance at launch, installing a firewall that protects the engines and other components from the flames, heat, sound vibrations and debris bouncing off the ground and going upwards into the skirt with nowhere else to go due to being caught within the skirt until  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  gets high enough to clear away from those issues.  \r<br> \r<br>\r<br>Next the landing! Elon Musk and his incredible teams of brilliant engineers must deal with the biggest issue which is the legs of  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  .  These little legs they have on right now, just won&#39;t cut it. Don&#39;t forget that we&#39;re dealing with a  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  that&#39;s empty and these legs can&#39;t handle dry weight so imagine if it carried a few tons of cargo. True that a returning  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  would be empty and that if it had any cargo on, it would be at launch from Earth and landing where there&#39;s 0 gravity, so those legs might be able to handle a landing on the Moon or Mars but is it something you would want to find out when landing on those two celestial bodies or know right now if they can handle a loaded or dry cargo bay? If they can create legs that can handle Earth&#39;s gravity while giving it enough ground clearance to not damage the engines and other components within the skirt, then BINGO!! All problems solved in regards to creating a  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  that can be used more than once, just like they did with Falcon9 after a decade of RD, trials and errors and now sending Falcon9 rockets at a rate that rivals the UFC fight cards which used to be on a few times a year to now a fight card every weekend.\r<br> \r<br>\r<br>So, bottom line is... 1) give  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b> more ground clearance at lift off, add a firewall within the skirt to protect the upper parts of the engines and at the same time protecting other important components, launch from a pad that has a water preventive system like all other rockets do (build one), try to clear the launch pad a little faster (easier said than done I know), so basically it all comes down to giving  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b> as much ground clearance as possible so that the flames, heat, sound vibration can escape instead of being stuck within the inner skirt of  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  and causing damages that will affect  <b>&quot;StarShip&#39;s&quot;</b>  landing. \r<br>2)  <b>&quot;LEGS, LEGS, LEGS !!!&quot;</b>  ... We all know that the present scrawny little legs that are on right now will never cut it, 1st they are too short and too small girt wise and 2, the longer you make those legs, the weaker they will be. I know that the legs issues are causing  <b>&quot;SpaceX&quot;</b>  engineers serious headaches due to reentry in Earth&#39;s atmosphere and the heat shield components are made to be on an even flat surface which makes it hard to even contemplate using the same kind of proven legs of Falcon9. You just need to find your way around it and develop a similar leg system that can be protected by heatshield tiles (easier said than done, I know).<br> \r<br>\r<br>\r<br>I know that Elon Musk has said that the reasons they launch they way they do, without better ground clearance and no other preventive methods/systems is to simulate a launch from uneven ground and no preventive system because that&#39;s the way they would launch back from the Moon or Mars. Ok good reasons, but you need to facilitate the earth launch using all the methods with all the systems available for a earth launch so that nothing gets damage at launch. Once landed on the Moon or Mars, everything changes due to the lack of gravity, the  <b>&quot;StarShip&quot;</b>  will clear a lot faster on the Moon than on Earth and with the legs issues solved, should have a soft landing. You need to make the launch easier to assure no components to be damaged from Earth launch using everything at your disposal, like a firewall, water preventive system, higher ground clearance and so on. <br><br>\r<br>P.S ...This is Elon Musk and  <b>SPACEX</b>  we&#39;re talking about, they can resolve everything and anything!", "comment_date": "2021-03-14T22:27:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0410", "comment_text": "\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0437\u0438\u043d \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043a\u0430\u043b \u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044f", "comment_date": "2021-03-14T22:03:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Don Sander", "comment_text": "Why Don&#39;t They Just...? augment the Autogenous Pressurization System with electric heater elements in the header tanks, powered by the Tesla batteries?

Now we can do all that with robotics and once they realised the moon is lifeless the sensible idea was let&#39;s not spend billions chasing nothing we proved that we can do it (secretly that was the primary reason for moon landing, we cannot allow a communist nation to put us on show,we must show the world the difference between the state muzzling your citizens vs our way of free market, allowing dreamers to be whatever they want... and they did,  living under the government thumb for set wages and jobs gives people no motivation to create or be better hence the reason the Chinese tech is literally just copies of stolen tech they have personnel literally in every part of the world with their only goal is to steal technology and feed it back to China, without stolen tech the only thing their army would have is numbers because of population.  And just take a look at the space rocket launch failures some have leaked out,  we talking recent failures in last 10 yrs, with many deaths hidden and this one single failure leaked out of an unmanned rocket which caused the deaths of more Chinese civilians than the entire US SPACE DEATH TOLL..imagine the failures they managed to keep hidden . Communism removes the motivation to be your best self, why should I bother if whatever I create or invent would be stolen and i not paid a cent . How about I not even try . That&#39;s the reason why a full Communist  or full socialist countries cannot progress like capitalist(free market ) the only reason China started to boom is their population mixed with implementing capitalism into their economy and becoming the land of the copyright. There is a reason the major inventers in last 2 centuries were from free nations with free market and the last 200 years of invented technology alone changed the world  so fast that the thousands of years prior was all pretty much same using horses buggies. Soon as the US turned to full capitalism around 1900 , go look at all the inventions that happened since 1900 basically everything you see today was invented after 1900. Ask yourself why for thousands of years before 1900 humans didn&#39;t progress much, they were still humans with same brains . It&#39;s due to the environment around them.

Probably upper bulkhead. <br>That reinforces the hypothesis that the main even was LOX bulkhead rupturing.
