I assume once the velocity vector is sufficiently changed from eastward to westward, the booster can throttle down to a few motors to complete the trip back. And once the booster has returned, it now has to land. Given all this motor activity, about how much of the total fuel load in the booster has to exist at the time of Starship separation? I&#39;m guessing around 30% of the total fuel load at launch.

The merlin engines aggregate doubled because the thrust effectively doubled (47 tons to 96 tons) while the weight and ISP remained relatively the same (+/- a few percent). Raptor 1 however, weighing 2000 kg, with a thrust of 185 Tons and an ISP of 330 seconds, doubling that aggregate would be synonymous with reducing the weight to 1000 kg or increasing thrust to 370 tons or increasing ISP to 660 seconds. For simplicity&#39;s sake, the aggregate (of Raptor 1) being thrust (185) divided by weight (2000) multiplied by ISP (330) would give you an aggregate of 30.525. The aggregate of Raptor 2 is 47.00625 or a roughly 54% increase in aggregate. To get a 100% increase or an aggregate of 61.05 (vs Raptor 1) would be something like a weight of 1350 kg, thrust of 255 tons and an ISP of 318 or a combination of changes thereof. If the goal is 250 tons of thrust, weight would need to come down to 1365.85 kg with no change to the ISP (327) which I believe is doable (~235 kg of weight savings).\r<br>\r<br>(As a side note, you cannot compare aggregates across differing engines IE the aggregate of Merlin to aggregate of Raptor to determine which one is the &quot;better&quot; engine. While a higher value does mean &quot;better&quot;, it is better in respect to a previous version of itself. Merlin (specifically 1D) has a higher aggregate due to it&#39;s crazy thrust to weight ratio when compared to the Raptor 2. Merlin engines cannot power the booster or starship because they have a higher aggregate is what I am getting at.)\r<br>\r<br>I think it is possible for SpaceX to get there the how is the unknown. Tim stated material sciences as a factor and I think that is be the biggest factor. Graphene, or a derivative of, could be used to make a newer version of Raptor engines stronger while being of lesser weight as one example but only if graphene could be produced competitively price wise. Changing the mechanics is a trade-off, expansion ratio to ISP being the one talked about in the video above. Changing the mechanics without changing materials is usually a &lt;5% change in overall efficiency or aggregate as seen in the use case above. We have seen SpaceX innovate heavily in this area, specifically the alloy of steel used for the construction of the Starship + Booster and the many known and unknown alloys used in the Raptor family of engines. \r<br>\r<br>Lastly, one thing that is not mentioned in the video and should be, is the weight decrease to Raptor 2 is partially semantic. Some of the parts were moved from the engine to the mounting plate for reliability and ease of maintenance. While the engine itself did decrease in weight, the weight of the booster increased, negating some of the weight savings which is not mentioned. This by no means undermines what SpaceX is doing but context is needed to fully understand what is truly happening. Just like landing legs being taken away from the booster and stage 0 getting a pair of reinforced chopsticks to catch the booster, some of the mass reduction is not simply the mass disappearing due to efficiency gains but rather being reallocated elsewhere.", "comment_date": "2022-07-14T19:42:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ian Valentine", "comment_text": "Loved it Tim.

Second, there will be space-only engines with nuclear-powered combustors, which will be fed by a fuel that will expand at high heat in the combustor at a high pressure, higher than Raptor 2, and thus have a higher exit velocity, but with comparatively low to very low fuel consumption. This will allow to significantly increase the speed of the spacecraft. In the development of combustion chambers for fusion reactors, stable energetic fields are already being used to prevent high temperatures from reaching the walls of the combustion chamber. This must be the goal for modern high-performance engines for spaceships. <br>Chemical engines will be necessary for a long time for the boosters in order not to contaminate the atmosphere of the earth with atomic air components. Space is already radioactively irradiated by the sun. A nuclear engine cannot do any damage there.<br><br>Ich denke das zwei Dinge geschehen werden. Erstens Spacex wird Raptor 2 verbessern. Das hei\u00dft das Triebwerk wird Leistungsst\u00e4rker, sicherer und leichter werden. Zweitens es wird Triebwerke geben die, nur f\u00fcr den Weltraum bestimmt, mit nuklear betriebenen Brennkammern arbeitet, welche von einem Treibstoff versorgt werden, der bei gro\u00dfer Hitze in der Brennkammer expandieren wird mit einem hohen Druck, h\u00f6her als Raptor 2 ergo eine h\u00f6here Austrittsgeschwindigkeit besitzen wird, aber bei vergleichsweise geringem, bis sehr geringem verbrauch Verbrauch. Das wird es erm\u00f6glichen die Geschwindigkeit des Raumschiffes bedeutent zu erh\u00f6hen. In der Entwicklung von Brennkammern f\u00fcr Fusionsreaktoren arbeitet man heute schon mit stabilen energetischen Feldern, die verhindern sollen das hohe Temperaturen an die Brennkammerwandungen gelangen k\u00f6nnen.
