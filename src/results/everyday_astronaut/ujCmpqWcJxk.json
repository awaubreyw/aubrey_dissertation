My discovery is the first system in the world capable of automated welding of reactive titanium alloys. Double symmetrical and perfect integral welds by laser technology of paramagnetic titanium alloys. The first system in the world that manufactures rockets and spaceships. Hypersonic aircraft in a modular and robotic way in optimal strong, light and reactive materials. My system allows you to remove massive amounts of mass on Starship. It is highly convenient through my system to retrieve the accelerators through Earth orbit over the airport. Vector control is ideal for the Moon and Mars but unnecessary for Earth&#39;s atmosphere. The stellar vehicle has a lot of orbital speed and can glide like an old orbiter over the airport. 100% recovery on the runway with advanced avionics.

Which is the wrong colour - as everything went gloriously orange while I observed that my own mission profile had made me stand up and jumping up and down harder than I did in the 90s watching &quot;Rage against the machine&quot; live on stage. <br><br><br>It was the most glorious high-altitude test-flight ever (being aware that when the first hot-air balloon went up more than 500 feet probably was bonkers to watch at the time - I sure watched the parachute test by a crazy person jumping off the Eiffel tower to test the aero-breaking capabilities of some tailored bed-sheets flapping around - humans are awesome, Franz Reichelt, even if tailors did not always get aerodynamics completely right)<br><br>I mean - SpaceX knows how to land rockets screaming through the atmosphere with flamy end down. They managed to belly-float this dad-bod down at strolling pace and turn the flamy end down - after power-sliding a rocket laterally at 30000 ft for fun for an extra minute. <br><br>Glorious.
