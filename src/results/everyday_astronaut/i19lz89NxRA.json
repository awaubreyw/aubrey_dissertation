The amount of energy you need to pump the fuel/oxidizer is proportional to the mass. Thus the weight of the batteries has to be scaled directly with the size of the rocket. Assuming the mass to be pumped is about equal between the electric pump and the turbopump designs,  there will be a crossover point where the turbopump design is more effecient mass-wise.", "comment_date": "2018-11-13T05:30:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mr. Olinad", "comment_text": "The best part was when they used your music.<br>It will be awesome to listen to your album while working.", "comment_date": "2018-11-13T02:57:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "rgerber", "comment_text": "what a sexy, fire spitting hunk of metal", "comment_date": "2018-11-13T01:33:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaystarz2000 gaming", "comment_text": "The staging is similar to MECO and other staging to the other USA launches.

Both SpaceX and Rocket Lab seems to have gone pretty near the optimal route to carry out their strategy, they are BOTH going to dominate their areas unless something surprising happens IMO.<br><br>SpaceX-things that go well together:<br>Making your own market demand at the heavy end of the launch spectrum<br>Optimizing for &quot;cost of kg to LEO&quot; above all else.<br>At the time Merlin was made it REALLY wasn&#39;t time for batteries<br>Keeping proven tech like Merlin around until something better is available makes 100% sense, it is an awesome engine, mainly because of the high thrust to weight(often neglected form of effeciency).<br>Having an upcoming engine that is hyper efficient and uses only liquids and uses all of it for propulsion is not only good for refuelling on Mars, but for reusablility.<br>Going big to get extra margins until reusablity is within reach and then keep on going as big as market will support makes sense since it will drop the cost of bulk mass to LEO and help dominate that part of the market.<br>Flyng people around is a much smaller extra effort when you are building a very complex set of machines already AND eventually intend to take people to Mars.<br>Taking on weird funding that come with strange demands, like parachutes for landing and artists as passengers<br><br>Rocket Lab-things that go together:<br>Rocket Lab is a reaction to the huge list of small sats waiting for a ride, the first Falcon from SpaceX was going after that market but it wasnt there at the time - now it is.<br>Economy of scale in terms of production quantity per time. They are optimizing the &quot;typical minimal mission cost for a truely independant mission&quot; above all else.<br>Making the minimal rocket that will just about reach a worthwhile orbit with the smallest meaningful payload makes sense because there are lot of them who want a ride ASAP.<br>You can get a little bit more performance from an engine if it doesn&#39;t have to be reused and instead focus on the tradeoff between cost/time to produce vs performance<br>Making every part a little bit better, even to the point of taking some irreparable damage for each launch can be worth it when the rocket isn&#39;t intended to be reused.<br>Since batteries can be sonsidered part of a complete rocket when the rocket is expendable, you don&#39;t need to worry about providing further batteries for subsequent launches<br>Batteries age and many materials do also, producing the whole rocket including batteries and then having some sort of overall expiration date within which to launch(EDIT: specifically inside which the &quot;final&quot; launch has to happen compared to a reusable vehicle which has to last years) it makes it logistically much easier(EDIT: and possible to reach lower mass).<br>Not ridesharing\r means freedom for the smaller sats to get into the orbit THEY want<br>Being on a shorter term plan than the space tugs and orbital fuel depots and those things that might make it easier to get to the stranger orbits via a large lauch vehicle with very low cost per kg.<br>Not flying meat\r means not having a million extra things that can cause delays for safety reasons, which means you can reach &quot;sufficiently reliable&quot; much much easier and cheaper AND be on time.<br>When tech improves, the margins at the low mass end can be &quot;reinvested&quot; into delivery to more fancy places rather than simply delivering more mass that could be sent up cheaper on SpaceX.<br>(extra speculative) It might even make sense for Rocket Lab to scale their system DOWN rather than up as a response to the progression of technology - imagine a future where payloads have gotten smaller, the engines and batteries and the carbon construction has gotten even better, then imagine an &quot;Electron&quot; with fewer engines on the first stage and, say, only the kickstage on top or something like that taking REALLY small payloads to orbit even cheaper and launches every day after.<br><br>Try in KSP ;) Both strategies actually work for accomplishing missions - you can go big and do many missions per launch or you can make the minimal size mission to accomplish each mission individually...If you do you end up with radically different designs that work similarly well at earning money, just like I think SpaceX and Rocket Lab have..\rAh fak - I wrote a book..", "comment_date": "2018-11-11T23:04:30Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Christian O.
