This completed picture forms a ball. A  moon to be exact. Once orbiting this planet, the tidal engine of a water planet with no land, and by the amount of water here today about 2 kilometers deep. Thriving with life that would infect a barren moon and give rise to the generation of land dwellers. These land dwellers would be of many different origins and many different branches in the evolutionary tree. We were told in the Bible, the core belief of many of this generation that &quot;God created man in his own Image, Male and Female created He them.&quot;  I contend that this planet would not host &quot;MAN&quot; until many alterations were made. The Life of Dino&#39;s are not contested nor should there be a dispute as to the age of the land we walk on, because EVIDENCE gives us these answers. The Land contains Dino bones and the land was here before them. \r<br>\r<br>Follow it further back and this planet was a molten mass, unable to host life until cooled by water, forming a shell to surround a molten dynamo already in motion by a natural moon. ALL  natural born life on this planet have several things in common and testify to what I say here. All events are Parallel and coincide between science and life and the Bible story of Creation. Translated across Millions of years a testament to our beginnings and the truth the Bible the core of many religions tells a story no man could be here to witness. The Only discretion between the Bible and Science is the matter of time, but God lives forever, not so of man. However, it may sound strange to quote the Bible and say there is NO TRUE RELIGION, but how else can you say that God, Created the World, is a God, but doesn&#39;t want to be &quot;WORSHIPED&quot; and didn&#39;t tell you to worship him? History, Our History to be exact belongs not just Humans, every &quot;Earthling&quot; no mater their roots, and branch. For Surely other branches dominated this planet before the age of man, in the Millions of years if it&#39;s existance.\r<br>\r<br>So as the age of this planet grew so did the cracks that we now call Tectonic Plates, trying to heal itself to level out the weight of the moon crushing down and the molten core melting the bottom of the moon and increasing the overall mass below the cracked crust, pushing up through the cracks, the growing pains of a planet, locked into a cycle affected by an orbit around the sun and hindered by the lack of an orbiting moon. A Moon was brought here and any Scientist will tell you that if it wasn&#39;t for our moon in the Perfect Position and Orbit the relative calm and temperate mood of this planet would just not be. Be it really a moon, or a space craft or something in between, it was given to us and placed just where we needed it, by the same entity that brought the water, and that same hand placed the Life in the water and on the land. \r<br>\r<br>The dog and pony show of Politics MUST STOP. Born onto an Ancient planet ruled by division will surely prevent this generation from reaching maturity. Politicians get rich off the populations they manage, categorized into section controlled by the Religion of their Geographical location. Each Geographical Location coincides with one religion or more. Each Religion says We are the right ones and you are misled, Kill those not of your religion because MY DIETY HATES THE INFIDEL. All Religions are Wrong!

I invite you to take one more major step on this path:<br>- This is NOT actually rocket science.<br><br>The utter irony in the cliche &quot;It&#39;s not rocket science&quot; is that &quot;rocket science&quot; itself is not rocket science.  People who use that term either don&#39;t understand the difference between science and engineering, or they know but don&#39;t care.  But the difference is quite simple:<br>- Science is learning about nature (from the Latin <i>scientia,</i> meaning knowledge),<br>- Engineering is building cool stuff to help us do things  ...like land on the Moon.<br><br>The word &#39;engineering&#39; has the same root as the word &#39;ingenious&#39;.  You created something that is clever, and useful.  The difference between engineering &amp; science is along the lines of the difference between invention &amp; discovery.  Science finds out more about things that were already there.  Engineering makes new things so you can do new things.  Conceiving of, designing, building and launching rockets is the creation of new things.  It is not science at all.<br><br>NASA is only doing science when they use space probes to take measurements of natural objects found across the Solar System and beyond, which happens long after the rocket boosters have been jettisoned.  It is doing science with the help of rockets, in the same kind of way that a bunch of PhDs ride a bus to their lab.  The bus enabled them to do the science.  But it would be absolutely silly to say they are doing &quot;Bus Science&quot;.  The bus was just the vehicle that was engineered and got them into the position where they were able to use their instruments to take scientific measurements.<br><br>And this is the same role rocket boosters play when NASA does a scientific investigation.  The rocket is the thing that was engineered which enabled your scientific instruments to be in a position to take their measurements.  So what people mean when they say this term, whether they know it or not, is:<br><br>- Rocket engineering.<br><br>Tim, it is clear that you are passionate about educating people through your videos.  And a key role of education is to identify and isolate myths, and then be diligent when separating fact from fiction.  It is like stacking blocks when building a pyramid.  If some of those blocks are spongy instead of rock solid, if you continue on your merry way without making the effort to fix things, then this is setting ourselves up for a big fall at some point down the line.<br><br>I&#39;ve long been a huge fan of your channel, and will look forward to more great stuff from you in the future.

I\u2019ve noticed that you\u2019ve done a number of videos centered around SpaceX launchers and I understand why you have. They shown a capability that may allow space exploration to be much easier. However, I feel that the Artemis Program may have a lot of potential. I understand that  SLS is not reusable and would probably have been a lot more useful if it launched in 2017 as planned but as far as I know it may allow us to go back to the moon a lot sooner than any current option. I do not think it is the best vehicle for lunar exploration but it seems like a good start. They may even start using Starship/Superheavy for lunar exploration\u2014 a task I think it would be better suited for than Mars exploration. Only God knows what incredible things could result from this program. Because of this I would really appreciate some videos centered around SLS/Orion. Please don\u2019t take this as me being vehemently against SpaceX and in total support of SLS.", "comment_date": "2019-06-18T16:55:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Damian_ai9", "comment_text": "I just love The Future", "comment_date": "2019-06-16T17:09:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jaime Duncan", "comment_text": "A magnificent roll", "comment_date": "2019-06-16T15:21:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "robercar1482", "comment_text": "Beauuuuutiful  promo video!!!
