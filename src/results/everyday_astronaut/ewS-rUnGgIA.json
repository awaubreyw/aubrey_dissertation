Since Psyche is believed to be the core or a core fragment of a larger body, and mostly metal, it sounds like quite an exciting mission, especially for any would-be asteroid miners in the crowd.

I have a video suggestion/question or two for you.  1) Skylab, the forgotten missions. I&#39;m old enough to remember seeing men on the moon, and was a space nerd back then. I was glad to see the news that NASA was putting Skylab into orbit. But Youtube and the world wide web really didn&#39;t exist back then, so Skylab news was few and far between. So my question to you is: Could you give a history of it&#39;s inception, design, launch, missions, and overall history. I&#39;ve been scouring youtube, and found only a few videos, none of which are all that encompassing.  2) &quot;Cool stuff still up there.&quot; What happened to all the stuff that&#39;s been launched, and what cool stuff is still up there. Like Snoopy, and other things. I&#39;d love to see a episode of the top 10 things still up there, with a short story of what it is,  how it came to be &quot;still up there&quot; , etcetera.  Just a couple things.

You provide uncommon and uniquely illuminating technical detail most appreciated. Your rocket motor video - excellent!  Another technical detail- Weld joint integrity and weld joint design seem to have caused Starship problems. A weld joint can be a stress concentrator. Perfect welds are expensive and almost impossible  in sub-optimal conditions. I wonder if lap weld joints might spread out the load, add some redundancy, and reduce heat distortion.  The doubled area of the  lap joint could be designed to create a toughened transition area in a high stress zone. However the welding joint problems are solved, It would be great when they are that you would make a video about the learning steps to create a reliable structure for the welded Starship hull. It reminds me of Liberty ship construction in early WW2. They started out with riveted joints, and by the end of the war ended up welded joints. There were some costly failures in the learning curve.

The boostback burn reverses the HORIZONTAL component of its motion, the vertical component of its motion follows a ballistic path still going upwards, with Earth&#39;s gravity slowing it down and then pulling it back down. The re-entry burn later cancels out much of the acquired descent velocity. Such plumes are normally seen due to illumination by sunlight at dawn or dusk,  but here it&#39;s unusual in that it doesn&#39;t illuminate more of the exhaust plumes of both the first and second stages, so perhaps this is self-illumination by the first and second stage motors. It is a long time exposure, of course, so I wonder whether viewers on the ground saw anything like this instantly. The usual dawn or dusk solar-illuminated plume displays can be seen in their full glory by eye. However, the amount of plume seen in both the first and second stage on-board cameras seemed quite unusual for a night launch,  so I wonder if there wasn&#39;t a beam of sunlight present around staging, perhaps governed by cloud configurations on the horizon at &quot;sunrise&quot;.", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T08:04:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Annie E", "comment_text": "Vale Ron.. now with the stars", "comment_date": "2020-03-07T07:52:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Tyburczy", "comment_text": "On John Kraus&#39; awesome photo, I think the left is the very end of stage 1 firing, the gap is MECO, and the arc that continues to bottom right is stage 2 ignition and burn.
