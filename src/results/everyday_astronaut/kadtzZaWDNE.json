SpaceX $50B per year revenue is based on 40.000 Sats .. profit potential of that is probably $5-10B per year (no where near enough to fund a Mars colony, LOL). Using only Falcon 9, SpaceX must launch about ONE Falcon 9 per DAY, for the next several years. Their launch pace must be greatly accelerated, because the average Sat life is only 4 years .. with a 40K network, 30 Sats per day will dropping from orbit.. just to maintain the Network will require several Falcon 9 launches per week .. and therefore the operational costs will be rather high .. UNLESS, SpaceX can get Starship deployed quickly!!! .. which IMO, is the main purpose behind Super Heavy + Starship right now, the future viability of Starlink depends on Starship getting operational within 2 years.  After that, Starship may morph into other cargo and LEO mission ops for NASA/ESA and others .. and eventually become human rated and replace SLS/Orion about 10-15 years from now.
