A high side crash is when the rear tire loses traction then regains it within a second, flinging the rider off the bike. It would take one hell of a rider to recover from a low side with that system.

It&#39;s already ridiculously overpowered for street-legal use, and it won&#39;t need any help to out-duel any stock ICE vehicle on the planet.  Further, performance-impacting cold gas jets <b>will</b> be strong enough to strip paint or take off your skin, and at very low temperatures to boot; no regulatory authority is going to approve such a thing for street-legal uses.<br><br>But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s where Elon Musk is aiming.  I think he has in mind track racing.  And I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll put half the thrusters aiming out the back, either.  What race drivers most lust for is <b>control,</b> not <b>acceleration.</b><br><br>Gas thrusters that prevent the car from spinning out on a hard turn, that help slow the vehicle in emergencies, that provide a modest boost to acceleration (for a vehicle that&#39;s already over-endowed with acceleration, you don&#39;t need much of a boost), distributed all around the vehicle, is what I think Musk is considering.<br><br>It makes perfect sense to put the COPV in the vehicle where the rear seats are if the vehicle is going to be used for track racing.<br><br>And really, this is what the new Roadster is about.  Musk is going to offer a stock race car that is simply better than anything on existing stock car racing circuits.  He is going to take a wrecking ball to ICE vehicle bragging rights, which is pretty much the purpose of stock car racing in the first place.  Big name auto companies play in the racing game to inspire consumer lust for their production cars.  Equipping his Roadsters with cold-gas thrusters as a racing option just rubs salt in those wounds; he&#39;ll have a car that can handle tough track conditions with less concern about losing control than any other vehicle.<br><br>The SpaceX &#39;secret sauce&#39; isn&#39;t really so much in the COPV or thrusters.  It&#39;s in the software and algorithms.  Using SpaceX tech, an on-board computer will figure out exactly when thrust is needed to enhance control, and do so many times every second.  Depending on available thrust, COPV capacity, pressure and circumstances, it is indeed possible for a vehicle to &#39;jump&#39; and land safely.  I could see a Roadster <b>jumping over</b> an unfolding accident just ahead.  Crazy to think of it, but really, it&#39;s technically no more challenging than landing first stage boosters on a postage stamp in the middle of a heaving ocean.  Can you imagine it?  The first time a Tesla hops over a dangerous accident in a race, the world of racing will be forever changed.<br><br>Hey, McLaren, how come <b>your</b> race cars can&#39;t do that???<br><br>Musk is aiming to make ICE vehicles obsolete, from top to bottom.

This ginormous spacecraft (and for ginormous I mean 400m of length) is designed to reach mars and get back and also be fully reusable.
