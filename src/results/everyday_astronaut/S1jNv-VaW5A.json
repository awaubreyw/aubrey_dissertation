I did this years ago long before the reddit challenge.  I was trying to use the asteroids to make a sort of fuel base.  I got 2 of the biggest asteroids thinking that their incredible mass would make a base for my station that would be more stable than the flimsy constructs KSP allowed at the time.  In the end it didn&#39;t work as the whole thing was apparently made of explodium but docking the together was easy once I got them anywhere near each other.  Long story short if you can imagine I had a claw, then probe body, then rcs fuel with 4 rcs on it, then docking port.  I had another one of these elsewhere on my ship.  Once I had the asteroids near each other I detached the docking port from the first claw from the front of my ship and backed the ship off.  Then I detached the docking port on the second claw and used the rcs to fly it over and dock it with the first claw.  So now I had two claws on one asteroid with one attacked and the other facing outward.  Also 2 rcs tanks, and 8 rcs.  From there it was incredibly simple to use the rcs to fly that asteroid towards the other.  Once the claw touched it was a done deal.  Basically what you did only without the shuttles in the middle.  I know this is an old video, but just a thought in case you ever do it again.", "comment_date": "2019-06-01T15:50:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jonathan allen", "comment_text": "i thought reddit was just for pron", "comment_date": "2019-06-01T05:57:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jazz21977", "comment_text": "How cold is solid hydrogen?
