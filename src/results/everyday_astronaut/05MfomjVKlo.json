There are a heckuvalot of 747 rated airports worldwide...<br>Point 2 - The Boeing 747 can take off in weather conditions that would see most if not all  vertical launch systems grounded. Then, once airborne, if there&#39;s bad weather at the planned launch location, it&#39;s comparatively easy to move the launch location. No more weather holds? That can be extremely important to launch customers.<br>Point 3 - Once Virgin get the infrastructure in place (spare launch vehicles, support vehicles &amp; ground crew), they will be able to launch FAST. Given a couple of years to work on things, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they could launch a standardized smallsat within a week of the request being made.<br>Point 4 - Rate of launches. The turnaround time for a 747 is a couple of hours. If Virgin can get several launch vehicles ready to mount &amp; launch in a day, the plane can do it. Potentially, they could launch 4 to 6 times a day with just Cosmic Girl. But, Virgin has/had many 747&#39;s in their fleet. If the demand is there, who&#39;s to say they won&#39;t convert a couple more? It&#39;s entirely possible they could have several planes launching several times a day each, based out of regular airports worldwide.<br>Admittedly, they are a few years away from being capable of all of the above, but given the time to develop the systems (building more launch vehicles, training ground &amp; launch crews, etc), this style of launch system has many potential advantages to customers when compared to more traditional vertical launch systems. This is a first step. Potentially, there could be many more to come.
