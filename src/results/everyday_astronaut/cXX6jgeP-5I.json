From videos that I have seen of his reactions, he was over the top and I just loved seeing his reaction.  Also, all of the young people taking part in this mission are doing more for our country and humanity and at the age of 61, I am thrilled to see that. They are doing more for our society than any of these angry rioters are doing now.  I look forward to many more SpaceX launches.

I have followed the SpaxeX live stream all day on my Mac and yours on my TV. I will follow everything, until they get onto ISS... Let\u00b4s cross our fingers, that all the planned maneuvers go well and the automatic docking procedure works. Has anybody announced yet, how long they will stay? I understand, 117 days is max due to Dragons solar panels. So, close to 4 months. Could they overlap with Crew-1? I guess, not because Demo 2\u00b4s re-entry and landing needs to be evaluated before Crew1 can launch? I am some kind of confused here about this. Also, can an uncrewed Starliner dock ISS, while Dragon &quot;Endeavour&quot; is still there? Or Crew-1? I know, there are 2 international docking ports on ISS. Maybe you have talked about these things, while I had muted your audio and watched the SpaceX stream. Dont\u00b4t worry to comment here, I am sure, I will get the answers. Keep On!
