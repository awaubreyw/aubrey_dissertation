Also, do you think life would be easier for everyone getting people and cargo in and out of the Spacex lunar lander if the tanks were higher (with downcomers) and crew/cargo compartment below. It would seem the lower and more stable weight distribution would be an advantage with nearly empty tanks during landing. What is the status of a mobile vertical integration tower at the Cape? Would the old shuttle tracks be of use for that in pivoting as the shuttle access platform once did? What is the status of newly designed Starship legs, especially for the lunar lander? Would a thrust <b>bulkhead</b> and flexible connection to the tanks be worth the mass penalty and make the vehicle safer than mounting Raptors directly on a thrust puck on the LOX tank? Possibly the protected area above the bulkhead would be a more protected area for flight equipment? Are sea level Raptors necessary on a lunar lander? Would one vacuum Raptor be sufficient for a lunar lander for trans-lunar injection burn and lunar orbit?
