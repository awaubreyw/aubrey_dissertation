The show is all about the colonization of our solar system and the very first alien encounter (alien as in life not from this Earth) and it takes place in and around the year 2350 and Mars is its own independent Planet with a Military every bit as powerful as Earth&#39;s. You are really missing out on a fun TV show that isn&#39;t based too far into the future. They even use familiar rockets still, but far better Fusion based rockets where the fuel is 150 times more energy dense per 100kg than the entire Falcon 9&#39;s total fuel capacity.
