I am a 3-time college drop-out myself. I finally decided to watch for when the timing was right for me to finish my degree.

I was eventually awarded Senior of the Year by Herff College of Engineering. I say this not to brag but to let you know that you don&#39;t have to give up on college altogether. Just watch for the right time to go back. Having seen your skills, I believe you have now developed what it would take to become a solid Engineer or Engineering Technologist. Having seen you passion and personality, I would recommend Engineering Tech. You would fit right in.<br><br>I be hanging around in case you need more advice.
