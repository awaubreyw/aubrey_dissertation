They are playing a balancing act.<br><br><br>With 145,000 subs they get $14.5 million in gross monthly income or $175 million a year.

The problem I percieve is taking the masses from moon orbit down to land on the moon surface?<br>When man is on the moon, the more toys he has the happier he will be (as if being on the moon isnt enough).<br>Any comments?", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T08:14:49Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tesla pete", "comment_text": "what do i think that bezo&#39;s doesn&#39;t even shop up to his program except to launch events?", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T02:54:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jammer1", "comment_text": "Thank you for not just the tour but giving us all a inside look at elon musk raw !", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T02:51:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PixelDimond", "comment_text": "Thanks for these awesome videos!", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T01:35:24Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "P R E", "comment_text": "Can someone explain why a pointy tip on the starship wouldnt be better for aerodynamics?

What You should worry about is a situation, when the weather doesn&#39;t play ball? To properly steer the rocket, we would need many 3_D inputs of real-time wind indicators, precise measurements at multiple heights (multiple balloons?), to have a 3_D model of the actual winds encountered by the returning rocket.

The most impressive thing IMO about Elon musk is he could have done many things with his money and yet he chose to use his money to help Humanity with Electric Cars (which forced other car companies to do the same), to make Humans Multi-planetary and a few other projects that will hopefully come to fruition. He did all this while making a few bucks for him self which is fine. There are just not enough wealthy people with that attitude. Too many wealthy people use their money in a way that hurts us, not helps us. I think Elon will go down in history in a very positive way.

Of course, they&#39;ve already been taken down, and returned to respective high-bays / assembly areas for &quot;Finishing&quot; touches.  What we see here is that what Mr. Musk said on Parts 1 and 2 is absolutely critical to understand:  The launchpad (Stage 0?) is far more work, and far more critical to get right than any of the particular rocket iterations.  Building a rocket is relatively simple and straightforward; building a launchpad is hard.<br><br>That said, the &quot;Urgency&quot; question is also quite interesting.  Our NASA programs were &quot;Tending to zero&quot; Mr. Musk said (no astronauts launched on American made rockets for over a decade).  So, we are now working as if there could be a meteor headed for earth in the next week or so.  Interesting, interesting, interesting!  The workers were actually told that!  They are finding it difficult to keep up the frantic pace, as the manufacturers cannot seem to supply them with enough parts to keep all these guys busy!  Well, at least it sounded like there was a somewhat of a shortage of things to do for some of those guys down there.  They were going to clear the area around the orbital launchpad while they hoisted the base onto the towers, and send all the workers over to the tank / propellant farm to work over there.  He called it &quot;An army of guys&quot; that they would be sending over there.<br><br>It&#39;s interesting, it&#39;s impressive, it&#39;s all the hallmarks of a dedicated force working together to achieve a common goal that is very far out there in the future, but is perceived to be a real problem here and now today.  Not just any old problem mind you, but a WORLD CRITICAL problem that they are trying to solve!  In my career, I worked on a few projects that had &quot;World critical&quot; status, and the government generally sits around watching, cataloging and documenting every single step in the process, which as you can imagine, massively slows things down.  The rate of change and progress at SpaceX is therefore more than impressive, and is exceedingly refreshing to watch!  <br><br>The government winds up with $300 hammers and $1,500 toilet seats because of the massive amounts of oversight and so on in those world critical programs, and people flinch.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever see that from a program such as SpaceX is putting together.  From what I&#39;ve seen, they are continuing to innovate and improve designs, steadily, and cost effectively, in order to continue to drive the costs down of taking a pound of material (or bodies) to space, and ultimately to other planets.<br><br>My hat is off to Tim (Everyday Astronaut) and Mr. Musk here.

But it you cut the cone of the engine into 8-10 parts and then make them fit so thrust doesn&#39;t escape from holes between the parts and move them along side the rocket while it&#39;s flying you can make them have a smaller diameter while launching for peak water level efficiency and then make the move with servos/hydraulics &quot;must have enough strength to prevent the parts from separation while allowing them to fold and open like petals of a flower&quot; so it gets wider and keeps the efficiency along side the altitudes increases. That wait even thought it&#39;s adding a lot of moving parts to the &quot;already complicated&quot; engine but it might allow you to have more cargo &quot;more power thanks to increased efficiency&quot;/have more flying time because you are at peak efficiency all the way from water level to space and while dropping you could also manipulate the thrust this way at the landing stage.<br><br>It would be like having the atmosphere and the space optimized engines in one + all the steps between.<br><br>Also that might be the answer to have peak efficiency at different atmosphere levels like earth, moon, mars and the perturbations in space.<br><br>If you read this thank you and sorry for the block format.", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T17:10:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marco bull", "comment_text": "Safety helm... ?", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T17:06:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u042d\u0440\u0438\u043a \u0425\u0430\u043c\u0438\u0434\u0443\u043b\u043b\u0438\u043d", "comment_text": "\u041a\u0430\u043a \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0442\u043e \u044f \u0441\u0430\u043c \u0442\u0430\u043c \u043f\u043e\u0431\u044b\u0432\u0430\u043b. \u041a\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0441.", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T17:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nicolas Lebedeff", "comment_text": "Thanks Elon and thanks to you!", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T17:03:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mar\u00edn", "comment_text": "Masterfully done, thanks so much", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T17:03:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "K Danagger", "comment_text": "Elon is so driven that it boggles the mind.

He&#39;s done amazing things with Tesla, and with Starlink, to advance technology for the immediate benefit all of humanity, but I&#39;m really questioning whether it makes sense to build a Mars colony for the sheer sake of becoming an interplanetary species. I think there needs to be a better reason for us to become an interplanetary species at this time. Mining, or low gravity manufacturing may provide some reasons to colonize somewhere besides Earth, but so far, orbital space stations seem to make more sense than Mars, and I think it would be wiser for Elon to be spending resources on things that would provide a more immediate and concrete benefit to society. <br>Of all the billionaires, I like Elon the most, but frankly, this is yet another example of why it is such a bad idea that a small number of individuals are allowed to be entrusted with such large portions of the total wealth in the world.

Once the boosters are landed and temporarily secured. Another ship comes in and cranes it off of the barge and into locks on the carrier ship. \r<br>\r<br>The carrier ship can carry a dozen or even dozens of boosters at once, whatever is projected to be required, and some of the refitting procedure can actually be started at sea on this bigger more stable ships, like the deep cleaning and preparation for the engines to be refit. \r<br>\r<br>When the storage ship has enough boosters to justify a trip it returns to shore, and it&#39;s sister ship now stands by to offload the landing pads. If we are going to be doing multiple launches per day, or even several per week, at a certain point the logistics justify a carrier type ship designed hold and move multiple boosters, and to be stable for working on them, perhaps with hydraulic outriggers that can be retracted for the journey to shore but deployed for crane operations and refitting operations. \r<br>\r<br>The storage can be as easy or as complicated as is desired, but I would err towards a little complication since a lot of prep work can be done with proper locks and moveable maintenance bays that are designed for cleaning and partial disassembly of certain components to speed the refit process on the other end. When the booster gets to shore, it is already decontaminated, partially inspected, and if it helps, the engines can be removed or partially dissassembled to speed retrofit onshore. \r<br>\r<br>It just seems that when things speed up and there are more moving parts, this extra component will be required, and as long as you are transporting multiple stages, which means days on board, you might as well have a dedicated crew cleaning them and prepping them for refit.  \r<br>\r<br>As things go forward we might even see storage ships that can not only transport and store, but land boosters as needed.  Currently the barge style landing pads can only land and hold one booster because of size considerations and probably safety.  It is inefficient to make the trip for only one booster I would think, when many boosters are coming each week. Then again, I don&#39;t really know how far they have to travel. \r<br>\r<br>Just some random thoughts I had. Perhaps the Ship should replace the barge completely, and have a reenforced upper deck to land, that can open up and that has an elevator system to move the landed booster to another part of the ship, eliminating the barge completely. \r<br>\r<br>This should be safe if the outside of the ship  is armored for mishaps and the crew is in safe keeping for the landings.  Thoughts?  \r<br>\r<br>Even if the distance to shore is not too distant, you can never predict what restrictions the idiots in power may levy in the future. This would give Elon more flexibility to get around regulations designed to slow down his freedom loving ventures. Certain people will never accept ideas and industries that they cannot control and exploit and they would rather inhibit them. But I digress.  \r<br>\r<br>A bigger ship might require a pier or dedicated dock. I do not know what the draft or facilities are currently near the refitting shops. But I assume it would be worthwhile to build whatever simple conveyance required that would allow the larger ship envisioned to offload its cargo of multiple boosters of multiple types, in an automated fashion that would have them on custom trailers and down the road to starbase in a matter of hours.

I hate canned talk show interviews where they are clearly following a rehearsed script. But I think if you are lucky enough to have a chance at interviewing Elon again, handing him a list interview topics, a list where Elon could cross off topics he isn&#39;t willing to talk about... doing this a minute before starting the interview could save some awkward moments. If you ask him to circle topics he is the most interested an expanding upon, all the better.<br><br>2) it might be wise to keep in mind the phrase &quot;always leave them wanting more.&quot;  For all I know you were promised four hours with Elon, and maybe the idea didn&#39;t even occur to you to end the interview earlier than planned.<br><br>All I know is there is an entertaining a series of commercials about &quot;the most interesting man in the world.&quot; To me and probably many others, there are few candidates in the real world deserving of that honor.

Tim\u2019s persistence in pushing for it, and getting enough backing from his supporters, no doubt was an element, but if the real key was him, or if there was a player within space x that finally made the difference. So hugely valuable to see how casually yet passionately engaged Elon is in his world. He is such a visionary, and very few of us will ever be exposed to someone of his brilliance, let alone be afforded such an intimate look at how he thinks and what motivates him. <br><br>It was apparent when Sam started right in on briefing Elon on progress that the tenor of his engagement with Tim switched gears, and he consciously found himself stuck between two roles, hence his somewhat superficial responses to Sam\u2019s input. He quickly regained his role as PR man when Tim stepped in and reestablished himself as the reason for Elon\u2019s presence on the site,  but it seemed he was already stretched thin by that point, and he had to abruptly cut the tour. Tim could\u2019ve kept at it for days. Wonderful to get a glimpse of how Elon relates to his crew, and despite the cameras and the reason for their presence, it seemed reasonably genuine how the exchange with Sam was, but hard to ignore how exhausted he seemed after having to try to play both roles simultaneously. He no doubt was additionally internally processing the percentage of his capacity each role was robbing from the other, and given what he feels is at stake, and how precious little time he has, how he can\u2019t afford to squander his contributions.<br><br>This was mind blowing to take in. <br><br>Hope Tim gets another chance for an update.

To fix that, they first shimmed the top approximately with steel plates, and then used 6 x 200 ton hydraulic jacks to level the &quot;launch ring&quot; accurately, shim it, and then weld in place. One 1&quot; deep weld is enough to hold the whole rocket stack securely in 40 mph wind.<br><br>The steel is very thick and welding it is very slow. They have learned that some fabrication procedures did not work very well, and will use different techniques in the next version of the launch ring. The weight will be reduced.<br><br>Three different systems are all driven by the same hydraulic system: launch ring hold downs and hoods, and the quick disconnect arm.<br><br>---<br><br>In the car, Tim was also asking questions about the stuff around them, and got a bunch of interesting answers too:<br><br>The yellow thing is definitely the &quot;Quick Disconnect Arm.&quot;<br>The ocean platforms are not presently thought much about.<br>People asking not to interrupt beach access for the public seem to have been a surprise for SpaceX, and this will be an operational constraint for launches.<br><br>---<br><br>Elon is focused on creating the momentum for colonizing Mars.

But he is also a man on whom all this is taking a huge toll - certainly physically, possibly mentally as well. Perhaps the most revealing moment in all three episodes was when he said Mars wouldn&#39;t be ready in his lifetime and then pointed out that he still had a while to go. Looking at the man we&#39;ve been watching for the last week, I couldn&#39;t help but think that, if he wants that lifetime to be long, he needs to sort his work-life balance out pretty pronto.
