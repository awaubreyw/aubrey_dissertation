But we have had a \u201cmassive breakthrough in physics\u201d that is definitely underreported by the mainstream media. Most chemical rockets are limited to around 10 km/s, and the vortex combustion \u201cbreakthrough\u201d could add 25% more to that speed, so that\u2019s maybe 13 km/s? But let\u2019s compare that to a real breakthrough, Solar Wind driven Plasma Sails can go 40 to 80 times faster than chemical rockets alone. That means SpaceX Starships to Mars in a week, and asteroid 16-Psyche in less than 2 weeks. The breakthrough is self-inflating magnetospheres. Fusion scientist Dr. John Slough discovered that small charged conducting coils can entrain Solar Wind Plasma in a Magnetically confined sphere 1000 kilometers in diameter or more, just outside the Earth\u2019s magnetosphere, just out past cis-lunar space, around L-2. And the one more thing? That artificially created magnetosphere automatically GROWS in volume as you move away from the sun, as the solar plasma gets less dense! So it provides CONSTANT THRUST all the way out to the edge of the solar system, with zero propellant mass! You still need to megawatts of power to charge the 2 meter coils, and you have to find a way to navigate and slow down, but Dr Robert.Zubrin thinks he\u2019s solved part of that with his Dipole-Drive concept, and former XCOR CEO and physicist Jeff Greason thinks he\u2019s solved the multimegawatt power problem with his Q-Drive concept. You can read more about the details of Plasma Magnet Drive, Dipole-Drive, and Q-Drive at the Centauri Dreams and Nextbigfuture websites. But if Elon got excited about this, we could see his Starships getting to Mars in less than a week instead of 3 or 6 months, and the 2.2 year \u201claunch window\u201d is eliminated. That\u2019s a big breakthrough in my book. You can launch to Mars three times a day, everyday, and expect to be at Mars in one to two weeks ALL YEAR LONG! Elon could have a million colonists on Mars in less than ten years. At the same time, Gwynne Shotwell can have her Starbase at 16-Psyche building INTERSTELLAR STARSHIPS!
