At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I-MWSGmeeM&amp;t=37m17s\">37:17</a> in the video there&#39;s something below the booster, and moving in the same direction. (Just left of the outter edge of the grid fin on the left side of the screen). It goes out of view as the booster rotates around. Then a little later at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I-MWSGmeeM&amp;t=37m31s\">37:31</a>, something similar comes into view. (To the right of the same grid fin, just above the bottom edge of the booster). It&#39;s visible until the camera switches views. The only thing I can think of that comes off of the rocket near this time are the 2 fairing halves. But they come off of the second stage, a bit after the booster separated. These 2 things are below the booster. Does the booster &quot;pass&quot; the fairing halves as it coasts up for awhile? Is there enough drag at that altitude to slow the speed/climb of the fairings as they coast after separation in comparison to the booster? Just wondering if anyone has any idea what may be going on. (I&#39;ve already ruled UFO&#39;s as &quot;unlikely.)
