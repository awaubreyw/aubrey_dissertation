Elon mentions lowering mass of 2nd stage with a heat shield balloon.  What about doing similar with the fairings?  Like after separation, have it sprout additional gliding surfaces similar to the old 1950&#39;s &#39;lifting body&#39; (really a gliding body) and have it fly back to soft landing area.  They can have guidance with GPS.  Or simpler, just inflate a very large balloon using helium left over from the pest pressurization tanks? Fill it to near max but still negative lift for fairing.  That way as the balloon sinks back into atmosphere it shrinks as the helium compresses.  Could even top it off just before landing to create 0 buoyancy at ground level.  Though it may take a lot of people to grab it (like the old air ships).  How do you like my &#39;Retro&#39; idea. \u263a. Aloha, ukeboy57.

I might be wrong on some of these:<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFLGps_N2U&amp;t=8m28s\">8:28</a> - The S-II center engine normally shuts down slightly early before the S-II finishes its burn.  However, the S-II center engine did shut down a lot earlier than expected due to POGO.  If they had lost another J-2 on the S-II, they would have aborted (probably a Mode II abort).<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFLGps_N2U&amp;t=13m46s\">13:46</a> - I believe Apollo 13 was the first Apollo mission to used a modified lunar trajectory.  Apollo 11 and 12 did free return trajectories.  When the O2 tank explosion happened, they used the lunar module&#39;s descent engine to put Apollo 13 back on a free return trajectory.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFLGps_N2U&amp;t=25m48s\">25:48</a> - Stirring cryo tanks were done to ensure accurate readings.  They removed the cryo fans after Apollo 13 because of the fear of another explosion.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFLGps_N2U&amp;t=26m39s\">26:39</a> - The cryo O2 was for breathing and for the fuel cells.  It wasn&#39;t fuel for the service module&#39;s SPS engine.  That was fueled by hypergolic propellants (MMH and N2O4 I think).<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFLGps_N2U&amp;t=26m57s\">26:57</a> - I think Apollo 13 only had two O2 tanks.  They added a third O2 tank after Apollo 13.  One O2 tank on 13 exploded and the other was damaged and leaking.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFLGps_N2U&amp;t=28m36s\">28:36</a> - Actually, they didn&#39;t do the abort burn because it would have required the SPS.  It was actually faster to do the abort burn to return home.  However,  mission control feared that the SPS was damaged during the explosion and might either not work or fail during the abort burn.  If that happened, they could have been left on a trajectory that crashed them into the moon.  Therefore, they decided to enter a free return trajectory, which would take longer, but not so long that they couldn&#39;t survive the trip, and ensure that they could use the lunar module descent engine for all of their necessary burns.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFLGps_N2U&amp;t=41m50s\">41:50</a> - Passive thermal coasts were done during every Apollo mission.", "comment_date": "2018-04-21T05:17:25Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Freediver HD", "comment_text": "How about an update on the Mars Rovers?
