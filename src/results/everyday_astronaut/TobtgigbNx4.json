This should have permitted the transfer ship to make the meeting using its 3mm per second ion engines.  My calculations show that if they thrusted toward the ascent vehicle for 1 hour, they would have reduced distance by 19km.  Coasting for another hour would gain them another 38km, and decelerating another hour would gain another 19km, or a total of 76km.  if they ran the engines continuously, they would meet in less then the 3 hours, and have velocities matched.  The worst case would be to have the initial positions vertically offset (relative to Mars).  Second worst would be to have lateral offset, and best case would be directly ahead or behind.
