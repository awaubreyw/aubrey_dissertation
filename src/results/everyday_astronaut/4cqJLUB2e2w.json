This has been a misconception about the aviation industry for years, i.e. you just push a button and sit back and relax.  There is so much procedural work to go through at critical phases of flight and these kind of comments just demean their jobs and skill level.  One day it will be like that and the tecnology has probably been good enough for some time now but it&#39;s certainly not implemented to that extent in aviation and at this early stage of Space X I imagine they&#39;re VERY busy during the launch phase.  When the astronauts say they&#39;re &quot;monitoring&quot; it doesn&#39;t just mean they&#39;re sat there waiting for something to happen, there will be very specific things they have to work through and communicate.
