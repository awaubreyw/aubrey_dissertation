Yea this has production by this producer etc has info..but as far as launch vechile and load Sx has the info.  If im not multi tasking then I usually pick Sx more than any other production of the launch.  ...when multi tasking and live I often Sx and add a production commentary...this or others that have been mentioned on previous shows/launch.<br><br>I prefer Sx or other coverage because its the best source for launch info during the launch...or Blue Orgin...Rocket labs...nasa...etc etc.  I dont mind commentary and I think I really have enjoyed some like falcon heavy...Starmans launch......but still a bit to much talking about non related launch/payload info.  I hope it doesn&#39;t go quiet....and I do like commentary...  ...I guess to say it short I could say just a little less non related stuff during last minute before ignition would be pretty AWESOME!!! ...I think.   again I really liked falcon heavy...with Sx on my iPad and EA on my iPhone.<br><br>A new and awesome launch like the shuttle.....any of the Sx launches..especially successful ones...and other new and awesome stuff can get distracting with all kinds of ppl.   Its Kinna like a large auditorium for those launches...what was it 100k viewers at the same time just on this channel... watching Starman ride on FH?  ...that was comparable to when I watch the first shuttle take off and land...but with chat too...really fun.  ...actually FH Starman was more fun even though it wasn&#39;t as amazing as the first shuttle...it still was like how cool? ..really cool...fun interacting and dang I still remember those boosters land &amp; Starman cruseing...fun. an wow", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T04:07:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TraditionalAnglican", "comment_text": "Fairing recovery missed - Good news for Starlink - We have another fairing available for Starlink launches...", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T04:02:09Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Poplar Preparedness", "comment_text": "\ud83d\ude22Please stop posting spoilers in the title for those of us who have to watch afterwards...takes all the edge and drama out.
