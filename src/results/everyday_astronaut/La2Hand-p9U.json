Specific impulse of 380 seconds is certainly high (no doubt the vacuum value).  You can&#39;t compare Raptor to RS-25, because RS-25 burns LH2. There are some kerosene burners getting close to 350 seconds in vacuum (e.g. the RD-180 again, and Merlin Vacuum 1-D), so the methane-burning Raptor with its all-round excellence  could conceivably hit 380. So yes, the Raptor numbers are terrific, and it&#39;s clear from Elon&#39;s video that it already can run quite a while without blowing up.
