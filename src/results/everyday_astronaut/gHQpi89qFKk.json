It perfectly sums up the hope that outer space can generate. It was done decades ago, talking about the original moon landing, but the same could be said of this launch as well. We can now do this. We&#39;ve proven it is possible. Now we just need to make it *routine*. <br><br>The Falcon Heavy has the capacity to put a LOT more into either LEO or, more importantly, GTO than the Falcon Nine did, meaning they can now pick up bigger contracts. Heck, with the payload of the Falcon Heavy, we could probably start setting up a Lunar Base as a stepping stone to space exploration. Think about how much easier/cheaper it would be to launch from the moon than it would the Earth. <br><br>Not just having 1/8th the gravitational influence to get up there, but lack of atmospheric drag means you can create craft that are not aerodynamic, because it will never enter an atmosphere. You can create large vessels that would never survive reentry or be able to even get off the ground, with a thrust to weight ratio that would never work on the earth, and still function marvelously in going between, say, the moon and Mars. <br><br>Moon rock already makes an excellent cement, so you can construct building infrastructure with concrete fairly easily on-site once you have your cementworks up and running, and since you don&#39;t have atmospheric interference, you can run the dang thing on solar without a problem. This also gives you an excellent testbed for life support modules that is close enough that we can recover the people if an accident occurs, but in an actual vacuum environment that it is supposed to operate in, as well as testing the techniques for building a mars colony by first building a lunar one.

The relative believes of someone don&#39;t mater. Space gives overview to everyone, just by going.<br>Please accept my language. I hope you can translate it, to whatever language you use, and to whatever aspects of the universe you are able to see.<br>In the agent tantra, Space is known as the Goddess Dhumavati. She is like the cosmic Grandmother, the most ferocious and violent, but the most compassionate. She is Death, and Machine. If you go in Space you die without the Suit of Her grace. What is only reviled in the moment of death to some, is reviled by Her, when the gentle smile of mother Earth wakes us up. -Entirety-. Krodha Bhairava, the fierce manifestation of lord Siva, meets with Grandmother, and recites Her mantra \u201cDhuM\u201d accompanied with sounds like \u201cTattimtheimtaumtim\u201d. Bhairava manifested in the inspiration of man, because He herd mans question: \u201cWhat is there?\u201d this question is of such value, that the anther must follow, because He can no more hide His Excitement when we remember him Her. And such He manifested in the form of fire. Beirava is the best friend of Man, and the form of strong active compassion. This is what I see, when the Heavy Go.<br>Once, Mangala(Mars) took birth out of the ocean, and now, we want to follow the son of Earth. We want to get birth as a species. That car is like a red flower in praise, -it is written in the Tantra, that Dhumavati knows the best jokes. <br>People where in ignorance, and had no love, they herd the freight-full names of the Goddess, but saw there one evil inside, and could not see sat She is all good. Such they manifested the same sounds trough war, and not in relation to Her Beauty.<br>THX Tim. You always praise the real manifestations of my Divine Grandmother, and Bhairava. It&#39;s very beautiful. Space is for all. There is no nonsense sect, and no place for fake religious people who just want to control others.

Some of my earliest science books were &quot;Was ist Was&quot; (the German version of &quot;How and Why Wonder Books&quot;) about space, engineering and general natural sciences. Next big thing for young me was watching Carl Sagan&#39;s Cosmos series, thanks to my aunt and uncle who were equally inspired by it when they were young. And what can I say, it instilled in me the same kind if awe and inspiration and made me share your view about how science and space exploration not only brings out the best of humanity, but unites us like few things can.<br><br>However, the more I watched documentaries about the early space pioneers, Gemini, Apollo and the Moon landing (which I think is still one, if not the most  important point in human history), the more I got the feeling all cool stuff happened way before me and nowadays nobody seemed interested in the final frontier anymore. There was no moon landing moment for my generation. Politicians cut space agengies&#39; funding year by year, all while making big speeches about a new launch system they were ordering, which would ultimately get us nowhere. No long term commitments, no vison, no risks being taken. And often I had the feeling that if Apollo had happened today, we would never have gotten close to the Moon. The program would have been cancelled 5 times over due to politics, budget or the risk to humans being to high.<br><br>And so I became somewhat disgruntled and disappointed. The lofty plans I had seen and read about as a child were shelved and cancelled on a monthly basis and the possibilities and dreams of a better future with them. There was endless money for stupid Hollywood movies and celebrities but not for the future of our species.<br><br>And while I&#39;ll state I still think this is mostly the case today, SpaceX came and at least tried something new again. They dared to do things different, take risks and have a grand vision. Making humanity a multiplanetary species. Bold, maybe too bold, with no guarantee of success, but they committed to it anyway. That&#39;s the stuff I can get behind. That is the heart of human ingenuity and spirit of exploration. Using our technlogy and science to reach out. <br>I&#39;ve watched SpaceX grow from a tiny company of visionary fools to one of the biggest launch service providers. Testing, failing, but - and here it is - getting back up again. I&#39;ve watched them pull off the &quot;impossible&quot; again and again. And when for the first time an orbital rocket booster landed back on the pad like &quot;god and heinlein intended&quot; - THAT for me was the first time my generation got a tiny bit of a moon landing moment.<br><br>Orbcomm-2 was the beginning of something beautiful to which Falcon Heavy is the next big step. FH further pushed the envelope with a dual landing (tripple will come in time!) and further reduced the part of ships that were expended. And while that is the most important part from an engineering standpoint and in regards to making humanity a spacefaring species, the livestream from Tesla and the Starman is the cherry on top of it.<br>Not only did it generate a giant media frenzy and exposed millions of people to the world of rockets and space exploration, it inspired all of them at the same time. It gave them an easy way of watching our planet from this unique perspective. And while I hope there will be more and greater moments to come, for me Orbcomm and FH at leat brought back a glimmer of the times of Apollo.<br><br>And that&#39;s why I&#39;m as excited as you are and why I always can shed a tear of joy when our beautiful species of advanced apes can for a brief period of time forget our stupid conflicts and troubles to once again gaze at the stars and be one.

I didn&#39;t know anything about what was going on in space exploration in our generation before that time.<br><br>Since that first launch 6 months ago, I was awe inspired. I researched everything I could about SpaceX. From there I found this channel and others including TMRO, Fraser Cain, Isaac Arthur, Vintage Space and of course space agency official channels among others. I became obsessed with space exploration and what we are capable of doing now. <br><br>I branched out from there. I researched other start-up companies that are trying to build or mine in space like Made in Space and Deep Space Industries. I am now super excited for the James Webb telescope and the Solar Sail project.<br><br>Now the Falcon Heavy just launched. Of course it would grab a lot of peoples attention for it being the most powerful rocket today but its also launching a car?! This is crazy...awesome! Like me prior to 6 months ago, I don&#39;t think the majority of people really care about space exploration. Why? Because that last time we were innovative, that last time we were able to dream about the future was during the space shuttle days. But now rockets land themselves and the costs have being cut many times. However, its hard to reach the majority of people to dream again by doing just that. But people can&#39;t ignore a car into space.<br><br>The Falcon Heavy launch was all over social media, the internet, and the news. It woke up people that ignored space exploration since the shuttle days. After the launch I watched many videos of super excited people including many kids. Space has become so much more accessible and with so many companies and projects to actually travel, build, mine and explore space now....how can we not be excited? The kids that were inspired by this launch may be the the ones to land on Mars, mine asteroids or create technology that will further our future in space.<br><br>This launch woke up and inspired a generation.", "comment_date": "2018-02-20T16:54:21Z", "likes_count": 433}, {"comment_by": "Potato", "comment_text": "Why the Tesla?
