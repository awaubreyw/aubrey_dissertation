[{"comment_by": "Luke Ranieri", "comment_text": "Question for you, Tim! Why do Falcon 9 boosters have that pattern of black soot on them after reentry? It seems to be strangely unequal, very dark at the bottom and then suddenly white again, with some more tint towards the top. I figure it has something to do with the different burns for reentry and for landing but I haven\u2019t been able to think of a clear explanation.
