In addition, it will benefit the astronauts - getting used to weightlessness is much better to endure in the spacious compartments of the ISS than in a cramped spacecraft, but even this is not the main thing. The main thing is that this method of flying will be useful in the near future, when new orbital stations appear.

For only through him are you able to be with the Father.

Repent and Believe the Gospel (Mark <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr_zfpzGxQQ&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a>). By this Gospel you are saved...that Christ died for our sins...that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15:2-4). The Gospel is the power of God for the salvation of all who believe it (Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr_zfpzGxQQ&amp;t=1m16s\">1:16</a>). If you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and with your mouth that you confess and are saved (Romans 10:9-10). Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation (2 Corinthians <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr_zfpzGxQQ&amp;t=7m10s\">7:10</a>). These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, in order that you may know that you have eternal life (1 John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr_zfpzGxQQ&amp;t=5m13s\">5:13</a>). Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God&#39;s wrath remains on him (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr_zfpzGxQQ&amp;t=3m36s\">3:36</a>). Jesus said, &quot;I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, no one can snatch them out of my Father&#39;s hand&quot; (John <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr_zfpzGxQQ&amp;t=10m28s\">10:28</a>-29). God&#39;s gifts and His call are irrevocable (Romans <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr_zfpzGxQQ&amp;t=11m29s\">11:29</a>).

I am sad that I will not be able to see this launch in person.  But I will be watching YOU Tim Dodd, for the launch.  I will be watching with my mom here in St. Louis.
