Strangely, it&#39;s difficult to find statistics online for Falcon-9 landing crashes vs. success..<br><br>Also, just for extra thought for another video, consider every event that has ever caused a launch abort or delay while on the launchpad - and consider how many of them could be corrected when launching from the moon and how many would leave a stranded crew on the Lunar surface.", "comment_date": "2020-12-12T13:20:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Duane Dieterich", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t watch Scott Manley anymore.
