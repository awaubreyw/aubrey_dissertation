Guess what, I am now writing the manuals FOR REAL ROCKETS. You cannot imagine how exciting that is. I am watching this and I have a lot of the parts right in front of me.

I have one really big one that i can recall, i was born in 1965, so just about old enough to remember watching the moon landings live on Tv. My biggest misunderstanding of the Apollo missions was basically how the whole launch/space vehicle worked, this ultimately led to my massive disappointment when the astronauts returned to Earth, i remember sitting there watching the tv waiting for the re-accusation of signal after re-entry blackout, and waiting for the first pictures of the craft descending through the atmosphere. For some reason my 4 year old mind was waiting to see this massive rocket come tearing back to earth - (that beautiful beast i had seen lift off), i was so disappointed to see just a tiny looking capsule hanging below the parachutes! What happened to the big beautiful rocket? lol, i was so confused at the time. But i must admit that the massive misunderstanding sparked a life long keen interest with anything space and launch related. So, did you ever have any similar misunderstandings to start with?

So double the current you have to size up wiring and hardware-cooling or size up by factor of four.<br>So either you rise your voltage in your batteries but that makes your electric controls and Hardware(like motor, switches, etc) LOTS more complicated and expensive. You do also need more weight and room for electric isolation.<br>So you (as always in life) end up with a compromise. For Electron it comes out OK because they need about 110Housepower(Tim said that) which is 80.9kW that&#39;s very OK and common for electric motors. But I think other (bigger) rockets need a LOT more pump-power to do their job.<br>And since room and weight are recources in rockets the best solution for them is to bet on combustion driven turbo pumps.
