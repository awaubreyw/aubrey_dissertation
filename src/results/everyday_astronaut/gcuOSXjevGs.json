That opens two possibilities.<br>As mentioned in the video, Falcon 9 was designed to fit down a highway and Neutron will do away with that, as Neutron is intended to be launched from the factory.  It doesn&#39;t have to be constrained to there.  The booster alone with a partial load of fuel should be able to relocate itself from anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world with a suitable landing pad autonomously.  Modern transport airlines are not constrained by ground transportation, and have grown massive once freed from that limit.  The same could be true of boosters that can move themselves.  They can launch anywhere the ground support is provided because the booster can move itself there.<br>The other opportunity is a much higher performance out of a return to launch site mission if the two portions are separated.  The booster could land at a down-range turnaround site.  No fuel has to be carried aloft and accelerated for the boost back burn.  Since most launch sites send the rocket downrange over the ocean, this could be a dedicated island turn-around facility.  After boosting the second stage up, the booster could land with reentry and landing only burns on the island.  Then with a re-fuel it could come back to the original launch site with a fresh partial load of fuel. <br>Taken to the extreme and with appropriately spaced facilities around the world, such a booster could just keep circling the globe launching to the east, landing and taking off again to the east from a down-range facility.", "comment_date": "2022-01-04T23:05:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dva Nerdi v Kanad\u011b", "comment_text": "Awesome video! $RKLB \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "comment_date": "2022-01-04T01:45:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Day", "comment_text": "Am I the only one who saw Neutron launch out of a volcano in a bond film?", "comment_date": "2022-01-01T18:24:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Day", "comment_text": "Peter\u2019s such a great ambassador for the whole industry.

I also have to critique the product launch video and the demonstration of the impact testing on the different materials, looks impressive to the lay person but people who do actual engineering know a: Carbon fiber composite damage often happens in the inter-lamina regions and isn&#39;t visible externally b: The demonstration would look totally different if the materials were brought down to cryogenic temperatures (which is the operational condition BTW).

Some points that I&#39;d love to see covered:<br>- Peter talked about a hot outer skin as thermal protection. Would love to know if he&#39;s considered active cooling (using methane as a coolant)?<br>- Its not just the landing feet, its also the part of the lower body that (if you believe the CGI) has a convex surface towards the airflow. More outer skin, or carbon foam?<br>- So you have an umbilical from the launch pad. Does the umbilical move to where the rocket lands, or (I think more likely) do they use a crane (or lifting vehicle) to move the rocket into position?<br>- Integrating the second stage + payload would presumably mean a mobile crane. But you can&#39;t close the fairings completely because you&#39;ve got lift cables in the way. How does the process complete?<br>- Still not quite comfortable with using a whole Archimedes&#39; engine for the second stage. If it has to be throttled down, then presumably its not optimal mass wise. Plus where does the efficiency go with throttling down?<br>- Is there still a use for electric pumps in terms of feeding the gas generator and making startup simpler?<br>- Getting the methane to evaporate in the cooling channels (so it can be guaranteed to be a gas at the injector) requires a thermal balance. Doesn&#39;t this restrict throttling?<br>- I don&#39;t necessarily follow Peter&#39;s logic about his market. He seems to be relying on large constellations. I&#39;m skeptical about the viability of comms constellations but leaving that aside, if the payload you are sending into orbit is just multiples of the same satellite, then you need a really cost effective launch to compete with much larger rockets. Cost per unit of theoretical mass may not be the most valid metric at times.. but when you are sending lots of the same satellite? Also how much delta-v is left over in the second stage for multiple relights?<br>- Oh and further to the question about moving the rocket into position, is there a separate launch and landing pad? It occurs to me that the former needs fixing lightning diversion.
