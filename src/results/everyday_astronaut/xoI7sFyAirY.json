Unlike the SRBs on the shuttle that landed in the ocean via parachute &amp; required refurbishment for re-use, SpaceX claims that the Ocean water causes too much corrosion on the boosters. A simpler plan however would be to erect enormous nets where those landing pads are, use a main parachute and simple small thrusters on the side to aim the boosters back to a reasonably soft landing in those nets (doesn&#39;t have to be upright, it can tip over, come in awkwardly, it just has to catch the net). The bulk of the weight is being lowered by parachute instead of rocket thrust and fuel.<br><br>That would save massive fuel for landing, vastly increase the mass to orbit, and significantly simplify the landing procedure for the boosters.
