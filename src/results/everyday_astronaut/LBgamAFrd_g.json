SpaceX and Blue Origin are not the same kind of companies. They do different things.<br>Their original motivation to start making rockets is to be applauded and supported. It doesn&#39;t matter what accomplishments have been made, what the rate of progress is or what plans for future efforts have been announced. They are both moving forward.<br>I am thrilled that these two high visibility companies are developing launch technologies. Technological success breeds more technological success. Their differing visions and plans currently offer no competition to each other, each proceeding on it&#39;s chosen mission without distractions. <br>I was born before Sputnik and I am thrilled to see this resurgence of Space Interest!

The first reason is that the Raptor is a full flow staged combustion engine it can reacher higher pressures with less harmful conditions reaching the turbo-pumps. Secondly the BE-4 is engaging in gradatim ferociter, the BE-4 is the first stage of a reusable booster that is aiming to be reusable many times on the first flight,. They have deliberately not designed a vehicles and rocket which require bleeding edge performance to work, once operating the engines can always be upgraded, remember it is the cost of the vehicle, how many times you can use it and how much maintenance it requires that is important not fuel efficiency.", "comment_date": "2018-07-19T00:05:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "joolian feline", "comment_text": "YOUR CAT IS SO CUTE.", "comment_date": "2018-07-18T23:56:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "llorttaf", "comment_text": "Jeb would be so proud.", "comment_date": "2018-07-18T23:51:41Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "David James", "comment_text": "Thoes landing legs!
