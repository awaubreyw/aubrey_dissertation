Getting a very small amount of Helium Three He3 from the moon without mining it will give us the material to do it.  One approach is to get Hydro gel/hydrophilic form that attract water and just drop it on the moon so it will fill with water and helium from the intermittent atmosphere caused by the sun.  Pick it back up a few years later with the fuel we need.  We could 3d print the reactors about 30 cm by melting and ink jetting the superconductor ceramic in the sintered metal powder layer.  It would allow complex plumbing for cooling and liquid nitrogen, and even boron chambers for deuterium/tritium reaction.  However, Helium Three He3 will produce protons be safe to be around not damage the superconductor coils, and allow us to test plasma in radical Stellarator like designs in an open classroom.  Cost thousands of dollars instead of billions to iterate the designs and get us to fusion faster.  So, we have used hydro gel to pull particles from space before why not use it on the moon to pull He3 without mining it.", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:34:05Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "simcha denderowicz", "comment_text": "Thanks Tim, u joining him?", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:33:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Abyssopelagic Acatalepsy", "comment_text": "Yay!!!", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:32:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wanderlany", "comment_text": "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83e\udd1d", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:32:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Senkrechtstarter", "comment_text": "Thanks Tim!", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:31:23Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ahnaf", "comment_text": "How are you doing", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:30:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kyle Sweet", "comment_text": "Jared will inspire many people!", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:30:55Z", "likes_count": 18}, {"comment_by": "jull1234", "comment_text": "Can\u2019t wait for more privately funded trips!!", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:30:52Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Joshua Hodge", "comment_text": "2", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:30:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ahnaf", "comment_text": "Hello", "comment_date": "2022-02-15T15:30:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Space Peacock", "comment_text": "So excited for these missions!
