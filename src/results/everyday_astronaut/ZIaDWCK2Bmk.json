Manual catching with a helicopter has too many factors that can cause an unsuccessful catch,  as in the pilot missing the catch, or trouble with the helicopter visibility.  If the Booster is making a safe splashdown on water with the parachute i do not see the need of the helicopter at all. Seems a bit overkill.  With the cost and effort that has to go into the catch with helicopter it will out weigh the benefits of a reusable booster.    Not to mention adding a pilot in a helicopter when a booster is falling  add a risk for a emergency accident or collision.  granted a extremely low chance of such.

Apparently it would burn a hole through the ozone layer that took a couple weeks to close up again; this means basically that the ozone layer was thinning to disperse and fill the void. This is an important environmental impact as the ozone layer determines the atmospheric oxygen concentration. Since the age of dinosaurs all living things have gradually become smaller and smaller because the ozone layer is naturally thinning slowly with time; in fact atmospheric oxygen is depleting with time. The thinner layer today makes it harder for the metabolism of a larger animal to survive; being small makes metabolism easier. If we thin the ozone layer at a faster rate than the natural rate it could impact our metabolism negatively. We are concerned with the depletion of atmospheric oxygen, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), in addition to green house gasses and other impacts when completing a Life Cycle Assessment model. I would recommend making a video regarding the environmental impacts using the LCA model standardized in engineering; following the full model you should include the impacts of manufacturing the rocket parts, the fuel, the depletion of any resources, the energy consumed, the impacts along the way, and the disposal method and final destination. It is not adequate to simply study the impact of the fuel type or combustion process in different engines alone. <br><br>For example an aluminum can does not impact the environment seriously being burned, or in it&#39;s actual use. However, to actually make an aluminum can from raw material requires a large quantity of electrical energy and generating that energy has significant impacts that need to be factored into the impact of the aluminum can. Compared to the can&#39;s disposal and use, the manufacturing and refining of raw material is significantly more impactful.", "comment_date": "2020-06-16T03:14:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Subhash Chalapati", "comment_text": "Why don&#39;t they use landing gear as heat shield, just by opening then little more\ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T15:58:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Stellular Nebulla - Daniel Davies", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIaDWCK2Bmk&amp;t=10m04s\">10:04</a> Ohh, why &quot;formerly&quot;? <br>That&#39;d a cool tribute to Hawking", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T09:09:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rick H", "comment_text": "When I was stationed in Hawaii in the 80&#39;s, there was a C-130 unit that &quot;caught&quot; satellites.

I guess this is all a long way of saying that I&#39;m VERY CURIOUS about what the referb process might look like if it does manage to make it that far and how they hope to tune the referb process to make it a net win as far as overall cost. Making refurb a net win on cost was a long road for spaceX, and that is a WAY easier problem (repulsive re-entry and materials which are less ridged so less prone to permanent deformation from stress).", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T17:47:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kotaro kojima", "comment_text": "super heavy rocket cant catch  by helicoter", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T13:24:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cris Madla", "comment_text": "Well they just did a test and it worked", "comment_date": "2020-04-14T01:50:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Alexander", "comment_text": "Now that rocket lab has done the air capture with parachute you should update on whatever they did", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T20:42:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Shepard", "comment_text": "I hope it works....Great for Helicopter Manufacturing and Space reentry.....", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T19:35:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Clockdistrict", "comment_text": "Yes.
