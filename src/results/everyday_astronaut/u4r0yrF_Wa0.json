UK still often gives body weight in stone, Australia still uses pints, and cheval-vapeur can still be found used as a measurement of power in France. A lot of these units persist as they correlate with observed human experience rather than scientific rigor, and are therefore more often suited for day to day life. An example I&#39;d give is that a mile was derived as being roughly 1,000 paces which when you&#39;re walking makes it simple enough to estimate how far you&#39;ve traveled if you simply count your steps, where-as the meter was originally defined as one ten-millionth the distance from the North Pole to the Equator, doesn&#39;t really mesh with how the lay person experiences the world, and for me using 620 paces/km when I&#39;m hiking is a more difficult conversion. <br>SI is certainly useful in science, and trade because it is a widely agreed upon standard (and I do advocate for its continued application) however I would say the whole base 10 argument for unit conversions is a bit of a red herring, if somebody asks you how far to the next gas station you&#39;re not going to tell them the answer in centimeters anymore than I am going to tell them in inches, because even though the cm to km conversion is simple for all practical applications they are separate units used for different applications. Not to mention in my experience many publications or designs use solely one pre-fix for measurement to avoid confusion, leading to measurements being listed as 1350mmX775mm or 78inX36in.<br>At the end of the day, all measurements are arbitrary ways of viewing the world and nature stubbornly refuses to fit neatly into anyone category. Materials all have different thermal expansion properties that require different coefficients, Avogadro&#39;s number is off doing it&#39;s own thing despite being so critical to chemistry, and the fact that the gravitational constant means I have to multiply my kg&#39;s by 9.81ms^2 to get force in newtons has always annoyed me.

Just as it would be convenient if everyone just spoke English and nothing else, I think there&#39;s value in knowing multiple languages and being able to translate between them, and so with metric systems, it&#39;s nice to know multiple ones and there is some value in being able to translate between them.  For instance, if you ask someone how many cm long a 10-inch widget is, their answer will let you know if they are a mathematician (25.4) or an engineer (25 or 30, depending on how pedantic they want to be).  Sure, you can say that imperial units have weird conversion factors, but 5280 feet per mile is fundamentally no more weird than 0x3e8 meters per kilometer.

The French adopted it as a part of their &#39;rational&#39; revolution, and Bonaparte then imposed it on half of Europe. So, when our technological development reached the stage where we obviously needed a more rational and universal system, there was an &#39;obvious&#39; one waiting to be chosen. We didn&#39;t think about designing a more useful and appropriate system, we just took the one that was already there - with all its drawbacks. <br><br>And there are plenty of drawbacks. First it&#39;s base 10 - presumably because we have ten fingers. So we have a wonderful, modern, scientific measuring system, based entirely on an accident of nature that gave us five digits on each hand and foot. The end result is that we have a universal system that can&#39;t be divided by 3 and 4 - two if the most basic requirements of any such system. It&#39;s no accident that so many of the original measuring/counting systems were based on 12 - it&#39;s just so much easier to use.  If only we had 12 fingers! <br><br>OK, measuring things in twelves doesn&#39;t give us the principle advantage of decimal - the ability to just to move the decimal point - but, had we bitten the bullet and switched to base 12, we would have had the advantages of both systems. <br><br>Then there&#39;s the size of the units. Meters are too big, centimeters are too small, and millimeters are just plain silly.  My father worked as an engineer for Ford Europe, dealing with both German and British engineers, and he had constant problems with German parts that weren&#39;t machined accurately enough, because they worked in millimeters, whereas their British counterparts used thousands of an inch. And in everyday life you need &#39;human sized&#39; units - it&#39;s no accident that the old system tended to come up with measurements like the inch and foot - much more useful than the &#39;too big, too small&#39; bloody metric system. When we originally went metric, we chose the centimetre as our base unit, as it was more human friendly than the meter and miliimetre, but then we moved over to the &#39;proper&#39; units, and now you have the bizarre situation that trailers  and railway waggons, which are 20 to 30 feet long are measured to the nearest millimeter!!  And in some counties, food is sold by the decagram, because the gram is just too tiny to make sense. <br><br>Humans need &#39;hunan sized&#39; units, like the pound, pint or foot, something they can understand, weigh in their hands and vislualise. Then they need a way of dividing that unit by halves and quarters, possibly even eigths - not just by halves and tenths (let alone fifths!). <br><br>And lastly, there&#39;s nature. Why haven&#39;t we switched to a decimal clock, for instance?  Simply because physics has given us a year of (roughly!) 365.25 days and a satellite that has a cycle of (roughly!) 28 days. Impose any measurement you like on time, and it will just keep doing its own thing. <br><br>Metric was a brave, and badly needed, attempt to impose &#39;scientific&#39; order on a natural world, and it has its merits.

Those didn&#39;t even exist in name in Great Britain for 50 years after the US Declaration of Independence. Calling US units &quot;Imperial&quot; is a political statement that attempts to conflate imperialism in general with something that superficially seems to resemble something that just happens to have the root word &quot;imperial&quot;. That slur is used to somehow elevate metric as more politically correct, and thus somehow, more scientifically correct.<br>And though they are both based on customary English units, there remained significant differences well into the latter 20th century, and volume measures are completely different, although they use the same names for the terms. Namely, US Customary units (the system of the US since the 18th century) had been tied to metric units since the 19th century. That didn&#39;t happen with the Imperial system of units until the 1960s.<br>BTW, because of that difference in fluid volume measures, Amy Shira Teitel would get different answers depending upon whether she was visiting her parents at home in Canada (which uses/d Imperial) or if she was at her home in LA. An Imperial pint is 20 ounces of a different size to the 16 ounces in a US Customary pint. A USC Gallon (of 128 fl.oz.) is defined as 231 cubic inches, where an inch is <i>exactly</i> 25.4 millimeters. An Imperial Gallon (of 160 fl.oz) was originally defined as the volume of 10 pounds of water at a specific temperature. So an Imperial gallon/pint is 1.20095 USC gallons/pints and an Imperial fluid ounce is 0.96076 USC fluid ounces.<br>All practical units are arbitrary.

I was certain I would at last be working in metric. That was not to be. Our laboratory had some test instruments dating to the Apollo era, and so it was still doing work in the imperial units from that effort.

Asking a fifteenth century carpenter to calculate to the nearest tenth of a unit would have resulted in a funny look and little work getting done. Metric units are great for engineering because they are easy to layout on paper and easy to transfer when it comes time to build the actual machines. One major issue arises when working in the field, however. Metric tapes only go down to millimeters and if the calculation requires finer measures, regular old joes will not have the tools in their toolboxes to make those finer adjustments. Regardless, for aircraft and spacecraft or any vehicle in general, matric is the way to go.

Dr. Farquhar suggested that a space shuttle could bring it to the ground. NASA even signed an agreement to donate it to the National Air and Space Museum. The rest of NASA, however, was not thinking that far ahead. Now 81, Dr. Farquhar is collaborating with the rescue effort, and he is still thinking ahead. He wants to send ISEE3 out to visit yet another comet. Mr. Wingo protests that it would cost too much money. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the comet,\u201d Dr. Farquhar said. \u201cTrust me.\u201d  &quot;This Island Earth&quot; - No longer a shot in the Dark, Deep Space Tracking time has been confirmed.. Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid will steer their dishes skyward in order to send a high resolution signal to precisely locate ISEE3 and help it set course for home. &quot;Something tugs at the heart&quot; - Comets come and go, but something about this little satellite warms my heart. Originally sent to study our nearest Star, it was steered off course and left our Earth-Moon system to rendevouz with Halleys Comet.. and now with luck, it might be.. finally.. coming home. &quot;Contact&quot; - something about the Arecibo Radio Telescope coming to the rescue seems poetic. &quot;After Decades Of Silent Wandering, NASA Probe Phones Home&quot; May 29, 2014 &quot;Make way for a Time Traveler - Coming Home..&quot; the orbit is calculated, they only need fire the thrusters one last time. &quot;Have you Traveled far..&quot; been to Halley&#39;s Comet, the Suns North and South Poles, wandered the Solar System for 36 years and now a chance one last time to return to Earth. Thirty Six years ago engineers tossed a Time capsule into the Ocean of Space and now &quot;it could be&quot; washing up on our shores once again. &quot;Countdown&quot; - Only 4 days till ISEE3 attempts a braking maneuver to re-enter the Earth-Moon gravity well. And makes a daring pass just above the Lunar surface. It then has to fly into the Moons shadow and race against time, through freezing temperatures, around the darkside.. to catch daylight on the farside, all systems will loose power for the first time in 36 years. If she makes it, the first traveler from Earth to ever visit Halley&#39;s Comet will finally settle into an Earth standard orbit at one of the Lagrangian points.
