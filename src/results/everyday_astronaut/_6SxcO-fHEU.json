(I think that&#39;s their decision - not sure) Anyway, I remember when the Challenger exploded, it was discovered that the crew survived the blast, and only died when the crew compartment hit the water. The lesson I drew from that was that it shouldn&#39;t be assumed, now, that a similar explosion would be non-survivable. What if the crew compartment of the Starship were designed to break as a separate section, or with explosive charges set to separate it from the engines, so that the crew compartment weight was minimized. There would be three or four parachutes packed in it, as with the Dragon, designed to deploy automatically. Somebody would have to make the weight calculations, but why wouldn&#39;t that be possible? If the Challenger had had one or two chutes, how much weight would that have added? Not that much, probably, and I&#39;ll bet those astronauts would&#39;ve taken their chances of survival with a parachute from K-Mart, over free-falling with nothing at all. Chutes don&#39;t weigh that much, do they - relative to the weight of the Starship? I would imagine their weight would be negligible.", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T20:47:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "allan churm", "comment_text": "hey tim your on \r<br>DeepSpaceCourier ..short clip  as a crew member on space x the next generation ..lol", "comment_date": "2020-11-03T10:20:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doug InOrlando", "comment_text": "Rocket lab is an exciting company and I suspect electric pump engines with low weight structure will be the ideal solution for \u201cspace tugs\u201d that deliver payloads from low earth orbit to geosynchronous, or any other orbit, or any satellite recovery/repair missions, or a reusable stage to boost any payloads requiring escape velocity.

Any guess on the starship\u2019s landing trajectory modification to avoid kicking up dangerous debris? We all saw what 1 raptor can do to the ground. When 3 raptors together are blasting the ground, the impact will get much worse FROM A MUCH HIGHER ALTITUDE.  And with many Raptors landing the superheavy, debris will be kicked up from a mile up.  SpaceX needs a landing trajectory that keeps the exhaust directed onto the debris proof landing pad ... i.e. a vertical descent from a couple miles up. What\u2019s your thoughts?
