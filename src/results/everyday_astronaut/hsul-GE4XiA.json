And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T06:55:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "solomanwill1", "comment_text": "I&#39;m not sure how comfortable and shock absorbing the landing can be if the fins are doubled as landing gears.

I assume some of you may build and fly the Estes model rockets that have been around for 50 years.

And you can learn a few things about rockets without sitting at the computer all day in you jammies! Outside, in the fresh air, as it were. But just for fun try to design and scratch build one that looks like this starship. If you can get it past your rocket club&#39;s range safety officer, it will have &quot;interesting&quot; flight characteristics! So, try it alone, out in a desert, or big park, with not too many spectators! Then you&#39;ll know why, despite weird (aka unstable) fin configuration, rockets have guidance, engine gimbals, and gyro systems to make them stable (aka safe) in flight. And yes, many modelers &quot;fly&quot; their rocket designs on the computer too, especially for the big powerful ones that are flown by the folks in the LDRS club!! BTW, that club is named: &quot;Large and Dangerous Rocket Society&quot;, and their mile high plus flights are really awesome!! Watch some on YT.

So for this first  prototype iteration it seems six legs in a ring and two lower &quot;fins&quot; is  more appropriate. Saving mass seems to be a high priority at this stage as the thing is already overbuilt like a battleship and has literally been slapped together as cheaply as possible. They just want to learn how to launch and land the thing at this stage and see how it holds up to re entry heating. The next iterations should be lighter and this will open up more options as to how the legs will be arranged.

Even worse, they might have generated their own shockwaves that impinge on various parts of the structure, creating localised hotspots leading to burnthrough of the structure. <br><br>With only 2 wings, the wing roots are situated more further back relative to the airstream and generally fit the contour of the body and the deflected body flaps a lot better.
