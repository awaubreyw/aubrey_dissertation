How much energy is stored in the rocket fuel, now much stress rocket engines put on frame of the launch vehicle, etc. Clearly you saw thunderf00ts video on it, as you addressed the boat ride issue. <br>Elon looks to the heavens, but fails to hear his engineers. A much better application of the tech would be a high ballistic trajectory with a lifting body that glides in during the last 3rd of the trip, and power on for the first 2/3rd. At least with a lifting body or plane, there doesn&#39;t need to be a launch abort per se as the vehicle can fly unpowered. Furthermore having a plane with 8-12 merlins onboard and running each flight at say 65% of full throttle, but for 20 mins instead of 100% for 8 mins, would give them a hell of a lot more data, a safer method to perfect the rockets, and turbo pumps and plumbing, and get them a money maker with 99.9%+ (I checked 434/435 successful engines is 99.77%) safety immediately. Hell they could probably get Boeing or Lockheed to design the aircraft and supply the rockets. People would probably be okay with a rocket plane that thats 1-2hours for most trips thats substantially cheaper and safer for the right now. <br>Elon is really taking this one a step too far too fast.

Even the smaller trajectories like NY-London aren&#39;t really viable via a suborbital hop, as the apoapsis of such trajectory will be about 1000km: well into the Van Allen belts. EDIT: it is possible to do balistic trajectories with limited apoapsis, but then the delta-v requeriment is higher, surpassing orbital delta-v earlier.
