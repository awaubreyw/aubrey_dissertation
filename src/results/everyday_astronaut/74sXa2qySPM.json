It&#39;s cool to watch this - but the physics of it are impractical. The only way to give yourself a safety margin is to catch this thing at altitude. And helicopters, much more so than fixed-wing aircraft, don&#39;t handle altitude well. As you get into thinner atmosphere, you&#39;ve got to be running the engines all out just to stay airborne. If you cut the air density in half, the rotors have to spin 4x as fast to produce the same amount of lift. And the only way to maneuver effectively is to go into a descent and trade altitude for extra airspeed.<br><br>But the big-problem: once you catch the booster, isn&#39;t the extra weight. I&#39;m sure the anchor on the bird is designed to shear away if it takes any load that might jeopardize the rotors or the airframe. The big problem is you have to precise dampen that load&#39;s desire to start swinging around like Tarzan. And the critical thing that cannot happen: that booster cannot be allowed to oscillate around any axis at a rate that is periodically resonate to its periodic oscillations in any other axis or resonate to the sum of its oscillations in any combination of its other axis&#39;. If that payload even approaches a condition of harmonic resonance (which is hard to avoid because the physics try to take it there), well - harmonic resonance is what destroyed the Tacoma Narrows Bridge - it&#39;ll rip that helo out of the sky before you can even see what&#39;s happening. And not only can that booster pitch, roll, and yaw, it&#39;s trying to swing forward and aft, and side to side. So you have to dampen out all 5 modes of oscillation without approaching any harmonic convergences while maintaining controlled-flight in a vehicle that relies on the tail-rotor to perfectly counter-steer the torque be imparted to the aircraft by the spinning of the main-rotor in such a way as to essentially turn your helicopter into a giant, flying tuning-fork.", "comment_date": "2022-05-04T09:48:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gijbuis", "comment_text": "Peter Beck tweeted &quot;Incredible catch by the recovery team, can\u2019t begin to explain how hard that catch was and that the pilots got it.
