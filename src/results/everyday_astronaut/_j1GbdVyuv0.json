Only the Starship would land back at the launch site or even simply drop down to land in the water where it could float until help arrived. The heavily loaded Starship would simply sink down into the water about halfway instead of tipping over like the Falcon 9&#39;s booster has done a few times. Then as propellant boiled off Starship would slowly tip over to lay on its side like a huge lifeboat. Though I hope Musk builds a very big ship for it to land on in case of an abort.  The Starship could also land across the Atlantic at dozens of possible Airport runways in an Emergency though I have not heard anyone talk about that possibility yet.
