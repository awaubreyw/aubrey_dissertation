I mean, how much different is that than a design meeting where department heads get together to try to work out some of the issues with each\u2019s parts/systems fitting together and the solving of potential issues. It\u2019s almost like Elon could get a ton of good engineering ideas by just talking with people that are passionate about this stuff, and not just people who went through schooling to do this stuff because it was a rapidly expanding field, or there was potential for job security or whatever other reasons individuals enter a field that they aren\u2019t IN LOVE with. I\u2019m sure he probably does pay attention to a lot of other people\u2019s chatter, but I guess I was just marveling at the fact that it\u2019s refreshing to have such a (fairly) open business that\u2019s willing to take suggestions or look outside the box, or even make public their designs and technology, where other businesses (competitors, potentially) could take some of the market share. Granted, it\u2019s basically the top-tier of engineering (it\u2019s why the term \u201crocket scientist\u201d is used the way it is), so it\u2019s not like the average person can do much with the \u201ctrade secrets\u201d, since you would need MASSIVE funding, but it\u2019s still refreshing to see an innovator and businessman doing it for reasons other than just trying to get rich. The world would be a much better place if more business owners and executives had any agendas aside from wealth or temporary success. It seems like he\u2019s looking to make advancements whose rewards won\u2019t be fully realized until long after our time. I can\u2019t see the future, so maybe he has some big flaw that undoes all the good he has done, but I doubt it, and I hope that\u2019s not the case.

But it you cut the cone of the engine into 8-10 parts and then make them fit so thrust doesn&#39;t escape from holes between the parts and move them along side the rocket while it&#39;s flying you can make them have a smaller diameter while launching for peak water level efficiency and then make the move with servos/hydraulics &quot;must have enough strength to prevent the parts from separation while allowing them to fold and open like petals of a flower&quot; so it gets wider and keeps the efficiency along side the altitudes increases.

It actually makes me more excited about the first few launches KNOWING they plan on blowing them up to test the limits and find failures. Looking forward to the videos that will be done on the failures and possible solutions to improve the rocket. As someone that plans on the one-way trip to Mars because of my age, I&#39;m super excited that rapid progress will give me a chance to begin colonization, even though the living will be very tough and limited. Great time to be a human thanks to Elon.<br><br>Edit: I&#39;m super happy you are going to be doing updates in a month or two like this so we can follow the successes and failures. I could tell his back and neck was really hurting him during the tour so I hope he&#39;s had a chance to sleep and heal some on the next tour.

If he was showing you high orbit motors they would have almost no nozzle.  The other thing that stands out is improved traducer and wiring harness.  Looks like he is monitoring the engine in more spots.  Given the change in time between 1 and 2, he changed over the electronics system to better processors and buses.<br><br>I would tell him he needs to higher some air force engine techs to come in and look at his raptor 2 upgrades.  They would have a lot of experience in producing and working on long hour flight time engines.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA8ZBJWo73E&amp;t=5m02s\">5:02</a>  This is the part I don&#39;t like about Elon.  It&#39;s not that it wasn&#39;t good electronics.  It was different.  Everything was analog based.  Electronics were very robust and just about every old air force tech and electronics professor I have ever made Elon&#39;s comment to were very defensive when they responded to the statement.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA8ZBJWo73E&amp;t=5m44s\">5:44</a>  There can be no failures ever.  The Russians designed their motors and motor assembles expecting failure.

There are going to be many fundamental.  Travel is just one of them.  Next will be environment sustainability.  Then there will be exp-manufacturing and product proliferation.  There is also human limitation.<br><br>As I watch and see the dog in the manufacturing space all I can think of is FOD control.  Pretty sure Lockheed doesn&#39;t allow bring your pet to work day at the 35 line.<br><br>Something I am not seeing in his high bay assembly is top gantry crane for loading and assembly while standing.  Nor am I seeing  a moveable rack to take the rocket to a launch point.  Vertical assembly, then laying the rocket flat is not advisable for transport to launch pad is not advisable.  And the use of rented cherry pickers at vertical assembly.  He&#39;s asking for damage.<br><br>Big rotating things can move just as fast as small rotating things.  It just takes longer for it to occur.  Fundamental slip of the difference between concepts of motion and change in motion.  The problem will be once his rocket gets spinning fast in space, will it have enough internal strength to stay together.  If he builds it well enough, he could make the worlds largest human martini maker centrifuge.

From there, I wondered, wouldn&#39;t the trip be shorter if the passenger rocket would attach to this tank which could provide much more fuel and therefore go faster? The tank could stay in orbit of Mars and on its return stay in orbit of the earth. It would not need to face the lift-off.  During the journey, the rocket would be filled with fuel allowing the landing on Mars as well as the takeoff.  And join again, the mega tanks.  I think that within a few years, there will be assembled in orbit, a sled with two mini nuclear reactors developed by a company funded by Bill Gates.

They share their problems and failures openly and this allows more people to try to contemplate the problems, contribute ideas.  They should actually set up a website where they post their technical issues and problems and the general public can comment, offer ideas.  For example...<br><br>All those problems with the heat shield tiles, Elon almost had the idea when he said &quot;Don&#39;t they look like dragon scales?&quot;  Would designing heat a heat shield where the tiles were shaped and arranged like fish scales make the heat shield better?  Fish scales are rigid and attached at one point, yet they accommodate all the bending and changes in the fish&#39;s body without ever creating a gap in the scales.  The scales attachment at one point, shape and they way they are overlapped allows the scales to slide over one another with changes in shape.  Its seems like this biological solution to a similar problem could make the heat shield on Starship better, more reliable, easier to manufacture and install.  Fish scales also produce some hydrodynamic properties skin alone does not.  Some kind of roller bearing effect in the boundary layer.  I also think one shape of scale/tile could cover the fuselage and the nose cone using the same overlapping pattern with adjusted attachment point geometry.  A slightly different scale may also solve the problem of protecting the joints on the aerodynamic flaps.  A system of tiles that slid over top one another to some degree could provide the needed protection and range of motion.  The flat sides of the scales could be machined or shaped such that the total thickness of tile at any point on the hull would be more or less the same.  Thick sections were just one tile covers the area and thinner sections on the same tile where it overlapped or went under another tile.  Maybe smooth changes in thickness could be designed in these transitions from one thick tile area to 2 or 3 overlapping areas.<br><br>Well anyway, just a thought.  Good job Everyday Astronaut!  Keep it up.   I&#39;m 62 and have been a fan of spaceflight for over 50 years.  I saw people land on the Moon and hoping to see people land on Mars.  (You wouldn&#39;t believe how little we knew about the solar system before spaceflight.)  In all these decades I have never learned so much about the technical side of spaceflight as I have from SpaceX&#39;s open exhibition of all their work.

And we all deserve Hell because we all have sinned and fall short of God&#39;s glory (Romans 3:23.) Nobody is righteous, nobody is sinless, and God will justly give us what we deserve by casting us in Hell for eternity where there is no rest. But even though we deserve Hell, God is still gracious and loving to us. He sent his only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to give us another chance. Jesus lived a perfect sinless life, He was tempted in every way as we are yet He never sinned. He paid the price for our sins when He was crucified and died a horrible death. Isaiah 53 says His appearance was disfigured beyond that of any man and His form was marred beyond human likeness. Jesus suffered to take the punishment we rightly deserve. Then, He was buried for 3 days, but He conquered death and rose again on the 3rd day. Jesus offers you the free gift of Eternal Life. He wishes that all would come to Him, and He will never turn you away. If you simply believe that Jesus did die for your sins and rose again on the 3rd (1 Corinthians 15 1-4) , and if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart God raised Him from the dead (Romans 10:9-10) then you are saved. No matter what you have done, Jesus loves you, He wants you to accept His free gift of Eternal Life. Now, you&#39;re probably laughing at me right now and scoffing, but I only say this because even though I don&#39;t know you, I love and care for you. I don&#39;t want you to end up in Hell. You know in your heart that this is true, Jesus is Lord. Don&#39;t suppress the truth, your eternity is at stake. Please just think about it.\u00a0\u00a0 Revelation 3:20 &quot;Here I am! I stand at the door and knock.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019 .", "comment_date": "2021-08-09T00:15:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Javier Zapata", "comment_text": "What is up with his body twitching?

In fact, it is very often quite obvious that the person is consciously evading any sort of inference that a valid obvious negative attribute could be associated with them directly. Elon, for me, with the sort of immense influence he wields undeniably, just shattered any notion of him not being simply an extraordinary ordinary guy. Yes, mountains of personal wealth often does create odd behaviors out of shear capability of pushing ordinary limits. But Elon is just different from your normal rich guy. He is fully immersed in every detailed aspect of what he pursues and is not just one that delegates or outsources intellectual creativity. It comes right from him as a primary collaborator, warts and all, and doesn\u2019t hide from a chip in the armor here and there.

If/when you do another video with Elon I&#39;d be very interested to know whether flatter domes, particularly the one on the ship just below the payload bay, is still on the to-do list. Also, the official SpaceX user guide mentions an extended payload option, up from the standard 17.24m to 22.0 metres. I&#39;d be interested in knowing more about that.

Elon has a reputation for being super busy, understandably, juggling multiple companies, each with their own industry leading projects all running at blistering paces.

Just watching the videos feels so intimate and personal, I feel like not only are we getting a better understanding of Starbase and Starship, but of Elon as well. This wasn&#39;t a press release, or a meticulously planned tour like you would normally expect (or at least it didn&#39;t appear to be).  I have to imagine there was a corporate-type or a lawyer they had to either lock in a room, restrain, or otherwise subdue in order to get you this level of access.  Every time Elon reiterated the fact that his answers may not be correct, or they may be right for now, but things could change, there&#39;s a corporate lawyer on the verge of a heart attack.  You guys weren&#39;t even wearing safety helmets for crying out loud!  When he told you not to let anything fall on your head, an OSHA inspector developed a kidney stone!  I&#39;m not going to say that you&#39;re lucky to have been offered such an opportunity, because I doubt he drew your name from a hat.

As we have seen so far, the booster is skirt-less (raptors are exposed), while starship has a skirt. What is the purpose of the skirt? My guess is structural support and protecting the raptors on descent. But for protection you would only need the front halt of the skirt (the one with the heat tiles). So my question is,  would it be a good idea if spacex cut the skirt in half and putting half of it on the ship and half of it on the booster? By doing so, my reasoning says that they would be able to carry more cargo since the dry mass of starship would decrease and the mass of the booster would increase.

I bet there are some things he wouldn&#39;t show Tim or talk to him about. Elon knows that millions of viewers will watch these videos. Some viewers are pessimistic and skeptical to the point where they will criticize even when success has already been proven, so he likely wants to be careful in his dialogue and humor. Tim was also asking a lot of questions, and many of them very technical and tough. Obviously Elon wanted to answer the questions as accurately as he could. All of these things could make the interview a little stressful after awhile. Likely if it was just Elon and Tim kicking back and having conversation with no interview or video involved, there would have been much less stress involved and more fun and just plain old good conversation.

Cooling the hinge by pouring on methane and oxygen. &quot;Even if it burns, it&#39;s already detached.&quot;   YouTube science channels: How much can you cool down a red hot surface by blowing some combination of  oxy methane (acetylene ?) on to it even though it all ignites and burns?  (You should get, from a distance, a much bigger fireball, but where the gases are ejected the temperature should drop) Then again how hot does the tip of an oxy-acetylene torch get? <br>If this all is just a simulation than Elon Musk is simply the avatar being used to accelerate technological progress, which means he&#39;s no more important or essential than anyone else.

With Elon talking about margins in terms of thrust to weight, residual fuels and the like how large the margins are he is working from? For instance if he is working just on the ship/booster and such is he wanting massive margins when you have to take into account all the &quot;upcoming&quot; internals in terms of piloting the ship for people and the actual cabins and radiation area and mess etc. Does he have any conception yet of the masses involved of all those internals? Concerning the booster, with the grid fins always being out due to their not being a folding mechanism to save on weight and fault count. If I have it right the center and 8 around all gimbal to provide directional capabilities in the ascent. Given that the &quot;Dino-traps&quot; have enough control authority to help guide the booster down does it not follow that they have enough for the upwards journey too? So you could maybe get rid of all the gimballing engines or maybe just have the single center one gimbal helping reduce the complexity and accordingly larger chance of something failing? Looking at them with the pointy bits facing down, I imagine for some aerodynamic considerations, given they can rotate they could provide the same benefit going the other way. When in future they are building the human varient of the ship will they build the ship and then put in all the interals or would they use the same processes that they use to build massive ships like aircraft carriers and such and build chunks with all the stuff already installed and then just put the bits togehter and weld. I mean will they make each ring section and have everything there that would be when assembled? If I remember from something I have seen previously Elon may have mentioned that the TPS system would only be needed for lunar or other planetary re-entries due to the massive increase of speed but the steel on its own could handle orbital speeds re-entry without losing integrity. Given how starship is so much more than a dumb rocket as it is coming back in from the moon or Mars etc could it not do a flip and burn to shed enough speed before re-entry, getting back into landing orientation after this, to negate the need for the TPS system altogether or will the TPS also provide some benefit when in transit ie thermal/radiation protection etc?

Having spent 18 years as an engineering infrastructure manager at high tech companies in Silicon Valley, I&#39;d be really interested if you were able to query Elon about how he (and other leaders) engages with SpaceX&#39;s process.  In other words, there are &quot;emergency&quot; or &quot;immediate&quot; interventions/involvements that are required, and then there are &quot;contextual&quot; involvements where the team and its managers monitor the organization&#39;s processes and make sure that the ethos/philosophy/engineering processes of the organization are operating as they should.  Another way to think of this is &quot;what are the organization&#39;s guardrails&quot; and how do they operate?   Elon touched upon the learnings of such a process in the first episode of the interview when he discussed examples of getting it wrong.  Like the challenge of &quot;building the factory&quot;, building the ethos and mindset of SpaceX&#39;s team and monitoring for divergence from those processes strike me as core aspects of SpaceX&#39;s success.

If I found anything &#39;disingenuous&#39;  (probably not the right word)  in what Elon said in this 2nd part, it was his explanation for the &#39;why?&#39; that SpaceX is being so public about their process and progress.  Yes it is hard to &quot;hide&quot; the tower arms when Starbase is located on a public road, but SpaceX CHOSE to put Starbase on a public road.  And Elon has chosen to provide an in-depth tour and interview.  Why?  I submit that  SpaceX NEEDS the support of &#39;everyman&#39; as it undertakes making humanity multi-planetary.  It NEEDS popular support to push the FAA to be more responsive, and to ensure that NASA is supported in its support of SpaceX.  And inside its own organization, SpaceX NEEDS to drive home the importance of SpaceX&#39;s core design, build, iterate, don&#39;t be afraid to fail philosophy.
