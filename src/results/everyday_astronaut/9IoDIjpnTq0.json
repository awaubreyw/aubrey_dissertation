Huge fan. Thanks for doing this live launch coverage. I just wanted to chime in on your SSTO comments around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IoDIjpnTq0&amp;t=55m35s\">55:35</a> because I think SSTO offers two main advantages, at least for Reaction Engine&#39;s Skylon/SABRE SSTO concept.<br><br>1) Reduced complexity. Having two huge powerful craft attached to each other and detaching part-way through flight like the SpaceX BFR/BFS, leaves very little margin of error. If you don&#39;t detach, everyone is dead. If the 1st stage crashes into the 2nd stage, everyone is dead. Mechanical parts have to work flawlessly every single time on every flight, which is very hard to guarantee.<br><br>2) No engine-out option. Yes the BFS is going to have two or more engines for landing so there will be redundancy, but if there&#39;s a common component that stops all engines, everyone is dead. Aircraft/The Shuttle/winged craft in general at least have the final option to glide to a landing, even if it is a crash landing.<br><br>There may be other advantages but I think those are the two biggest ones. I do get what you&#39;re saying about total payload into orbit is likely to be higher with BFR/BFS but I guess time will tell. It&#39;d be nice to have all the solutions available and then just pick which one is better for the mission profile!<br><br>Keep doing great work dude.
