PLEASE READ.  I have a story very similar to yours, I was about 7 when I slept on a trampoline under the stars in my backyard except. I couldn&#39;t sleep! I was absolutely ENTHRALLED with the stars! Then when I was about 11 my church in Texas threw a Space-Themed cake walk sale and our lead pastor walked out of a cardboard model hung to the roof and it inspired me. I then looked at star charts and bought astronomy books. Then... we moved to Tennessee and I could see the stars even better without as much light pollution! So I suddenly found myself almost obsessed with Astrophysics and rocketry at 13 and then now 14 years old. Last summer I even took rocketry courses from NASA and now I joined the BMAC astronomy club! But even more than the stars, the ROCKETS are the thing that amazes me. You should try getting Universe SandBox two, I have it and even though it&#39;s pricey it&#39;s an awesome and realistic astrophysics simulator, (Soon to have rocketry) Anywho this is ChanceTHEBOSS, Out!<br><br><br>-Chance <br><br>P.S.
