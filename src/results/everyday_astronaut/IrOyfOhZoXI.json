Why is it that a water landing would compromise the fairing? They seem to have recovered this one in pretty good condition as reported by us launch report. You wouldn\u2019t think that it wouldn\u2019t be much of a stretch to refurbish it, especially at $3000000 for the half section.

The larger nozzle is not primarily used for the exhaust gas flow direction out of the nozzle. The larger nozzle is in order to increase the expansion ratio from the nozzle throat to the nozzle exit (difference in throat area and exit area of the nozzle). This allows the engine to convert more thermal energy (heat) from the combustion process to kinetic energy (velocity of the gas flow). This equates to more overall thrust and increased efficiency. <br><br>The reason we can&#39;t use these large nozzles at sea level is due to the pressure losses described in this video. If pressure leaving the nozzle is lower than ambient pressure (outside air) there are pressure loses that play a negative role to thrust.<br><br>This being said, there is a component of losses to due non axial flows, it is not the real reason for the large nozzle though.", "comment_date": "2018-06-05T04:46:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glockout", "comment_text": "The bfr is going to be such a game changer in the space race.", "comment_date": "2018-06-05T03:38:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "tom porat", "comment_text": "the planets behind you are beautiful", "comment_date": "2018-06-05T03:11:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TechTog", "comment_text": "Thank you so very, very much for not wearing the orange suit.

Since so many of my favorite youtubers are always so kind as to answer questions a few occured to me while watching your cast. <br>  1,  I know after launches they dump the 2nd stage into the ocean, with the high cost of putting stuff into orbit wouldn&#39;t it make sense to find an &quot;out of the way orbit&quot; to leave the 2nd stage until it can be recovered and recycled. I would imagine they would have at least a few thousand liters of fuel/lox that would be useful plus all the material actually used in the construction of it.... heck there is a &quot;space&quot; rocket engine that could be strapped to a asteroid to move it to a more useful orbit.<br>   2, I love rockets and space and can&#39;t believe we haven&#39;t moved farther along in devoloping it  as a place to work and live. I watch at how much money we spend on developing different rocket systems and don&#39;t understand why no one has done much work on building a electromagnetic launcher. I see the US military has a em railgun that can shoot a (if i remember correctly) 7kg shell at 5000 kph. sounds to me the technology is there just needs to be ramped up a bit. Everything i have ever read on the subject suggests we would immediately go from 1000s a kg to $s a kg . I know there was a proposal to build one for under 20Billion with a suggested price for a mass only (no people) for 10 billion. Is there no one actualy working on this? it seems like a total no brainer, heck Mr. Bezos could do it all on his lonesome.
