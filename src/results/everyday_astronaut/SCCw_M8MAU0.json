There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. Every drop of water will be recycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T04:49:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cody trim", "comment_text": "Bfs: Bellyflopping spaceship", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T02:14:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Cunningham", "comment_text": "i am biased to the idea of mars but isnt cheaper", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T20:35:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "StronZo", "comment_text": "They are designing newer space shuttles for space travel, but apparently no mechanic in the country can figure out why the horn stopped working on my 2014 Subaru.

Even small Cessna 152, 172, 182 many use the elevator once on the ground as a air break,  giving full up to give more drag, it also takes some load off the noise wheel. This is not the same but it is to a point. It you put some drag on the air going over the wing, it slows down the air,  when you slow down the air over the wing it gives less lift. When an airliner wants to get down faster they can put the spoilers up and the wings don&#39;t give as much lift and it goes down faster, not used all the wings only parts of it. I don&#39;t know much about the game you used but the right amount of drag added at the right places can make a lot of difference. Thank you for the information.

If they do the subsidies, I would hope the president would reciprocate to protect SpaceX from their uncompetitive practices as should have been done with our TV electronics, auto industry, and he has now done through the WTO to impose billions of dollars in retaliatory sanctions on European imports that Europe had illegally subsidized, including the aircraft giant Airbus who received 18 billion to the detriment of Boeing.  This begs the question is why our government has not protected these entrepreneurs from the theft of their business and technology for the past 50 years.

The &quot;really&quot; big difference between a SpaceX rocket and the space shuttle (garbage) is that the SpaceX rocket will reduce speed before entering the atmosphere.  The reduction in speed will be so great that re-entry friction will be close to nil, thus requiring nothing in landing wheels and almost nothing in thermal protection.  You do good work, Tim.  Now go out there and catch up.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=12m55s\">12:55</a> i do...and i&#39;ve already told you.  Slow down enough and you require almost nothing to re-enter or land.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=14m05s\">14:05</a>  That was Elon thinking...&quot;How do i dumb this down more?&quot;  I know he&#39;s a genious and all but there was a time when people who did things &quot;differently&quot; were called witches and burnt.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=14m45s\">14:45</a> The belly of the shuttle was assembled by the people who brought us 3D jigsaw puzzles...didn&#39;t anyone else but me see the problem with that?  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=15m12s\">15:12</a> Pica-pica?  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=15m30s\">15:30</a> &quot;SpaceX has had great luck...&quot;  Really?  Do you even know how SpaceX started out?  I&#39;ll bet you $10.00 that the word &quot;luck&quot; doesn&#39;t appear in their biography.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=16m10s\">16:10</a>  Again...no.  Once you&#39;ve slowed down enough you won&#39;t even need the heat shield...something the space shuttle couldn&#39;t live without.  I&#39;m starting to think that you WANT the space shuttle to come back.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=16m20s\">16:20</a>  So many &quot;thousands of hours&quot; not spent on tiles means that much more money available to do something else like, i don&#39;t know, how about R&amp;D?  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=17m10s\">17:10</a>  Please stop referring to KSP (i love that game and can&#39;t wait to get KSP2), it makes me want to scold you and send you to your room...wait, aren&#39;t we already in your room?  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=17m20s\">17:20</a> &quot;some of the headaches the space shuttle had&quot;?  That&#39;s nothing compared to the 30 year depression i went through waiting for that program to end.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=18m05s\">18:05</a> Futurama...good news everyone.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=19m50s\">19:50</a> &quot;Merchandising, merchandising.

I am not sure i want to be on the first passenger flight. I would think it would be a couple of monkeys named Larry Mo and Curly. If Egon Musk invited me to join him on this maiden passenger voyage around the moon and back to where we took off from id take him up on the offer. <br><br><br>I don&#39;t think the earth is flat, and after watching some you tube videos i am not afraid to fly anymore. If i had won that recent billion dollar lottery id try to buy one of these tickets. I would have a lot of work to do catching up on modern rocket science, but if Eon was on the flight. Id still ask my million questions and double check some of their math. Anyway i watched their last successful failure. LIVE!  and when the first stage started spinning out of control i was pissed off that they cut only the 2nd stage footage. Yeay it crashed into the ocean like it was suppose to if it couldn&#39;t land on the platform, but i thought it was cheap and manipulative the second they knew something was wrong they cut that footage to us. <br><br><br>Anyway I challenge Eon or Egon or whatever his name is to be on board his first passenger flight. Ill wager balls and bragging rights that he won&#39;t be on board. That he will take a ton of $$$$$ + a release form. They should have a contest or lottery for the first passenger seat. You shouldn&#39;t have to be the Russian billionaire from the movie, &quot;2012&quot; <br><br><br>I think space X is awesome. An independent contractor. Watching that falcon rocket take the dragon payload to the ISS; &quot;totally far out&quot;. What an awesome event to witness in real time, but then again screw them for cutting that footage. I did not know what space X even was before i caught that launch by luck. After the launch no one had to touch a single button, except to cut our view of the stage one section crashing into the ocean. The contingency plan worked perfect, but we were cut from seeing it, because it could have crashed into a populated area, or not?(so what were they afraid of) I only know Eons name because my mom mentioned him and associated it with space X. She seems to think that their rockets blow up on launch pad. I think maybe she was mislead because of a semi successful failures, or early test with new technology. Note that is a lot of reading and it would be easier to just say its all a lie and the Earth if flat.

That is the big difference having people on board vs cargo when we talk turnaround.    Shuttle long turnaround was because of the extra care with humans on board.  These were new technologies at the time and we were still learning of the additional stresses on the vehicle which were not completely known. The shuttle was only meant for low orbit and could do things no other vehicle could and still have not done, (launch, retrieve, and repair satellites, major component in the building of ISS, allowed for innovations derived from the shuttle for everyday use and so on).    Were they perfect, no, but in my opinion that were great machines.  Anyone who had a chance to witness a Shuttle launch, knew it was very awe inspiring experience.   Still enjoy spacex launches, but I do not get the same feeling as I did when a shuttle left the launch pad, (the sound, the site of it climbing towards the sky).

He&#39;s building an off-the-shelf plug-it-together-and-go system. According to inside sources, literally everything will be plug-n-play. Bad heat shield? 247 bolts. Pop it off and bolt on a new one. One of the quark-level identical 3D printed engines bad? Six bolts on each feed line, four bolts to hold it in and three electrical umbilical cables to unplug and you can swap it out in two hours even on Mars. His concepts work. Think about it; since perfecting the landing of the F-9 there hasn&#39;t been one landing failure. Granted, there were a few crashes in the beginning but once the process was perfected it will stay perfect barring any equipment failures, of course. Having covered, as a reporter, over a hundred shuttle launches at KSC, I can tell you that the STS was the most complicated thing ever made. Not from an engineering standpoint but from a paperwork standpoint. For every hour of actual work on it, there was six hours of paperwork; forms, documentation in triplicate, inspections, inspections of the inspections. I once saw a team of six people spend six hours soldering six wires together. An engineer, his assistant, a solderer and his assistant, a manager and an official inspector discussed each connection for an hour, decided how to do it (do we twist or solder side-by side?), rehearsed it, did it, checked it, measured voltages, inspected it and signed off on it after writing a lengthy description of how they made each connection. Space X would document the process with video, use two guys, one to solder and one to double check, measure the voltage and move on. On that job, SpaceX would save at lease five hours or thirty person-hours. NASA comes up with new ways to weld stuff together. SpaceX comes up with new ways to innovate. NASA says, &quot;We have a tin can with a porta-potty, we can send four people to Mars.&quot; That&#39;s engineering driving your actions. &quot;Let&#39;s send a hundred people at a time to Mars and build a city. All we have to do is figure out how.&quot;  That&#39;s innovation driving your engineering.  All that is why I say, when NASA finally does land on Mars, Elon will pull up at the Musk Spaceport in his Martian built Tesla Roadster, pick up the four smelly astronauts (porta-potty), drive them on the ElonWay Marspike to the Musk Hilton for a nice shower, and dinner at Marshorn Steakhouse or Marsnara Bread both just a short ride via pressurized tube from the Hilton; proudly displaying on their lawn their logo and corporate slogan via incandescent Mars worms spelling out, &quot;Hilton - Come for a Day, Stay for Six Months, Because You Have To.&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-12-01T22:48:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mejhul", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCCw_M8MAU0&amp;t=17m25s\">17:25</a> they will fall off, if you just looked at them wrong.", "comment_date": "2018-12-01T09:14:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Azzari", "comment_text": "Craft file plz", "comment_date": "2018-11-29T21:15:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Marlo", "comment_text": "Hundreds of aircraft use this.

Parachutes maybe but they would or could tear off plus it would still hit hard on landing.

Assuming the BFS shell was entirely made of carbon composite without in internal metallic alloy frame,  could it  achieve the sufficient rigidity and structural strength necessary to sustain the high g it will experience during Earth re-entry after a Moon or Mars mission ? Another problem : even if Mars atmosphere is not very dense and, assuming the BFS will aerobrake in Mars atmosphere at a more gentle angle than 90degres, Mars atmosphere is actually more abrasive than Earth&#39;s. Tiny grains of sand could penetrate the heat shield at high speed and damage it much more than its lower density would suggest. And finally, the fact that the BFS has to land vertically seems like a problem if you have to unload voluminous and heavy object 50 meters above the martian ground through a small hatch. It seems that laying down the BFS on the ground would make things easier to unload a Rover or big objects like that.   Thank you for your excellent videos. For some reason, SpaceX and Musk, despite his own personal weaknesses (who is perfect ?) are producing a thrill and exhilaration that are totally absent from NASA. I found this idea of a Moon flight with artists onboard total genius. And like many, i don&#39;t even understand why NASA&#39;s SLS is still being developed when the near future promises New Glenn from Blue Origins, Space X BFR, Boeing, not forgetting the Dream-Chaser from Sierra Nevada,  and in the worst case scenario there is still Falcon Heavy.", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T14:34:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Stoleriu", "comment_text": "You really under-sell what Scaled Composits&#39; SpaceShipOne achieved: dynamic geometry to scrub off a massive amount of speed on re-entry, so that they could use cheap and simple materials instead of a complicated heat shield.

That is, if I were to hold a piece of it in my hands, what would it be like?  Would it be semiflexible like a piece of plastic or rubber?  Or would it be stiff and crumbly like a foam?  This sort of thing makes a huge difference in how easy it is to handle and apply to the spaceship, as well as in what ways it can be damaged and how visible such damage is.<br><br>For instance, the shuttle&#39;s tiles would be some sort of low density porous ceramic, and as such high fragility is expected.  Worse, a brittle material tends to crack and shatter, and visually inspecting such a material for hairline cracks is difficult.<br><br>Another huge issue is how hard it is to remove the tiles, and also whether you have to replace single damaged tiles, or if they wear uniformly without mechanical damage, allowing you to replace them all at once.  With the shuttle, I can&#39;t help but imagine someone with a hammer and chisel carefully digging out a bad tile, and then scraping off the adhesive, all the while having to be very careful not to damage adjacent tiles.  In this way, being able to replace them all at once would help all by itself since it&#39;s easier to remove them if you don&#39;t have to worry so much about damaging other tiles in the process.<br><br>The last issue is how easy it is to machine the tiles.  There&#39;s a huge range in difficulty here, and I rather suspect that the shuttle tiles are made of one of the more difficult materials to work with.  One other <b>huge</b> advantage not related to material for the BFS has over the shuttle simply has to do with modern computer controlled milling systems.  It&#39;s pretty easy to imagine putting a Pica-X blank into the milling machine, punching in a request for tile D176, and in 30 minutes you have a freshly milled tile of the specific shape you need.  Back in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, the machinery was a lot more primitive, requiring much more manual control.  A related issue is what sort of post processing is needed after milling.  Do you have to do special treatments and such in the factory, or can you literally just have a milling machine sitting at the end of the refurbishment building?", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T01:28:06Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Coffin Man", "comment_text": "Globeling delusionalism.", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T01:28:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Sorenson", "comment_text": "Love your Videos Tim!", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T01:25:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "carbon273", "comment_text": "This is my favorite space channel", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T01:18:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "craig miller", "comment_text": "Great show- well done with your sim", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T01:11:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RD Simmers", "comment_text": "Another excellent episode!<br>\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d from Bangkok", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T01:07:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Blitz Alex", "comment_text": "Im calling mild clickbait", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T01:01:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "goreignak", "comment_text": "Just stumbled onto your channel for this vid, it was awesome!

Using large surface areas to scrub off speed during re-entry just works, plus it requires zero fuel to accomplish. The shuttles main engines only managed to scrub about 1% of the speed off (thanks to a highly intelligent everyday astronaut guy for that info) and the body did the rest, just as the Apollo missions used the capsules entering bottom first to do so.
