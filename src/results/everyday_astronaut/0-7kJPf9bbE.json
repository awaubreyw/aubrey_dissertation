The Space Shuttle reused the most expensive parts, yet was more expensive than Apollo for launching people. (I&#39;m not even going to get in to launching satellites, because the Space Shuttle really wasn&#39;t good at that - it had to carry the complexity of a man-rated vehicle even when it was only launching satellites.) The Shuttle was great - but cost effective it was not. SpaceX Falcon 9, in reused/reusable configuration is the cheapest launch vehicle - but it&#39;s not the reusability; for a given payload, a throwaway Falcon 9 is cheaper than a reusable Falcon Heavy, per SpaceX price lists.  So obviously reusability doesn&#39;t make it even 3x cheaper, much less 10x or more.  (Since if reusability were 3x cheaper, Falcon Heavy reusable would be the same price as Falcon 9 throwaway.)<br><br>I don&#39;t doubt that in the very long term, reusability will end up being cheaper - and that improvements in rocket technology will allow it to be even cheaper still; but as yet, reusability is not making spaceflight orders-of-magnitude cheaper as has been promised for decades.<br><br>Last quibble - the fact that SpaceX makes things &quot;in house&quot; does not inherently make them cheaper. Their improvements in manufacturing have.  Most manufacturing industries don&#39;t make every single part in house. They realize that for many things, sourcing parts from a company that specializes in that type of part is cheaper than making the part on their own.  The &quot;in house&quot; isn&#39;t the cost savings, it&#39;s the design and manufacturing. They could just as easily have sourced the same parts from external companies with contracts specifying a certain price per part - and there are many companies that would be able to provide at similar cost - possibly cheaper if they are also allowed to sell those same parts to other companies.", "comment_date": "2018-01-02T08:29:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Halsey Lynn", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-7kJPf9bbE&amp;t=14m19s\">14:19</a> I really appreciate the use of &#39;humankind&#39; instead of &#39;mankind&#39;.", "comment_date": "2018-01-02T08:26:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Halsey Lynn", "comment_text": "Thank you for making this rundown! &lt;3", "comment_date": "2018-01-02T08:25:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anonymous Freak", "comment_text": "Sort of minor correction - the eclipse hit Oregon in Lincoln City, Oregon.
