There is a engine like the 4 cylinder car engine that uses a combination of 50/50 radiator fluid in combination with oil, and gasoline, and a fan. The engine will always be hot because kinetic energy is similar to oxidation energy where they both create friction which causes heat. However, a rocket engine doesn&#39;t have to be cold. It&#39;s just something that these engineers keep doing.  The rocket engine does not need to use frozen gasoline. Either way, exhaust is hot, it&#39;s like cooking. Always need ventilators ect. Heat exchanger or heat sink. I think that rocket engines could exchange metal halides or exchange gases without flammable explosions. Like sulfur triple bonded oxygen. Or atmospheric compression or magnetic leverage. This would take obviously, a lot of time to implement but would have virtual no burn ratio. Stoic chem is the same or similar it&#39;s all chem. Stoic chem is the measurement of energy not explosives.<br><br>I also think there could be a light beam engine with kinetic pulse like a microphone. With combined rocket chem this could be possible. Electret engines or I coin the term light beam engines. Lights travel into the speed of sound and electrical energy which causes a floating power that creates a pulse and after burning could be limited and be used to float or even shoot a rocket incredibly fast into space.

The stronger F-1 had 100% perfect record with 65 engines and 13 flights. No other rocket ever so perfect. No other rocket stronger, even today. But we never hear about our best, strongest rocket motor anymore. We&#39;ve begged the Russians for their weaker rocket for 40 years. Why? It&#39;s a scandal after all that was spent on developing it. Then 15 years waiting for Shuttle engine to replace it, but weaker. The F-1 only needed 7 years to fully develop. We could reverse engineer the one in the museum. Why 60 years wait with weaker rockets? The F-1 took us to the moon, yes! And 60 years waiting for the Musk and Bezos&#39; with their almost-as-good copy of the F-1 we ALREADY have! Why the long wait for the same thing we had in the 1960s? The F-1 was plagued with problems early on, then became 100% reliable, 65 engines, 13 flights. I wish we had that for the last 60 years. And even today.

This only really works when you have a liquid hydrocarbon fuel, since the additives are liquids too. This has been done using tetraethyl orthosilicate, which is a liquid silicate ester which dissolves in hydrocarbons. Another option is silicone oil, which has been tested the same way but with rockets using ethanol or methanol as their fuel.<br>In both cases the silicon-containing additive decomposes at any leaks or hotspots to form silicon dioxide, which either plugs the leak, or locally increases the thickness at a hotspot, effectively curing it. Of course the resulting silicon dioxide itself can get ablated away by the heat, but since there is always a small percentage of the precursor additive in the fuel, it is continually re-deposited for as long as the engine is running and fuel is flowing.<br>This only takes a couple of percent by weight of the silicon-containing additive in the fuel, most of which burns perfectly happily along with the fuel, so the engine performance is not significantly reduced. This is no good for tactical missile applications since the rocket exhaust will contain some silicon dioxide smoke, producing a persistent, trackable exhaust trail.

Excellent work. Only criticism - in the description you said &quot;[Rocket engines] only real purpose is to convert the chemical energy... into thrust&quot; I would have to disagree :P They also serve a ritualistic purpose as we gather around them and are filled with awe as they create thunder that would make Thor jealous, and build pillars of flame in the sky on which brave explorers climb into the heavens like more successful sons of Daedalus.<br><br>Another factor that isn&#39;t usually appreciated when talking about propellant choice is prospective propellants&#39; properties as they relate to regenerative cooling. Such as whether or not the coolant is chemically stable at elevated temperature. Hydrogen for instance is stable at elevated temperatures, meaning it won&#39;t break down into something other than hydrogen. Hydrazine on the other hand is not, and will break down into something other than hydrazine by the time it gets to the injectors. Of course temperature and pressure effect this question greatly. Another pair of factors are the volumetric heat capacity and conductivity of the propellant/coolant. Of course they have to be effective enough to keep temperatures in check, but there&#39;s actually more to it than just &quot;Good enough&quot;. <br><br>The F-1 burns about 2.5 tons of propellant a second. A substantial portion of that must be pumped through all of those tiny tubes that are brazed together to form the body of the motor. The turbopumps already have the monstrous job of stepping up the pressure of the propellants high enough that they will flow into the combustion chamber, with that previously mentioned 2.5 tons/second flow rate. That&#39;s quite a powerful pump, even Grady from Practical Engineering would be impressed. But on top of the pressure rise necessary to make the propellants flow into the high pressure combustion chamber, there&#39;s an additional large increase in pressure needed to make the propellant flow through those hundreds or thousands of tiny tubes. And the power required to run the pump scales directly with the number and diameter of those little tubes (And the viscosity of the coolant). but what else scales with the number and diameter of tubes? Cooling performance. So more, smaller tubes = better cooling performance, but also more power required to run the pumps. So if a propellant is a more efficient coolant (I.E. better heat capacity, conductivity, lower initial temperature, and higher max temperature before chemical instability), it can keep things cool enough with fewer, larger tubes instead of more, smaller tubes. Meaning that the cooling properties of the propellant directly influence the size of the turbopumps, and the amount of the fuel&#39;s chemical energy that needs to be expended in the preburner to run the turbines. You have many levers to pull, and many of them move each time you pull one.

Although the parts about soot being dark because it hasn&#39;t had time to react with O2 is not quite right. The major reason has to do with incandescence (i.e. black body radiation) of the particles present in the exhaust. This is the same mechanism that causes the nozzles of say MVAC to glow bright red. <br><br>The reason there is a difference between the Space Shuttle Engines and the Delta IV engines is because of the absence of soot in the Space Shuttle engine exhaust. When there is no soot, how the exhaust looks is dominated by electron transitions emitting photons at very specific wavelengths. For the Delta IV engines, the ablative coating being shot out the engine is achieving high enough temperatures to become incandescent. This is similar to why Bunsen burner flames are bright blue (pre mixed flames emitting photons through electron transitions) versus why candle flames are reddish (soot particles at the diffusion flame front become hot and glow incandescently).<br><br>The reason the turbine exhaust on Merlin engines is dark has more to do with the soot density and relatively low temperature of the exhaust than anything else. Soot density is also related to how complicated the fuel molecule is. Longer chain hydrocarbon fuels such as RP1 will generate a lot of soot and so the exhaust will glow bright whitish-red. Simpler fuels like Methane have a much lower soot density and so do not burn as brightly. In the case of Raptor where they&#39;re operating pretty close to stoichiometric, very little soot is generated and the dominating emission is then again by electron transitions.", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T19:49:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bobby Milo", "comment_text": "Hey Tim, love this video.

Has me wonder two things for the futre if cyrofluids can be used for supercooling to create superconduction effect and second if quantum entanglement can create some type of quatum cooling effect.", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T18:21:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Sawyer", "comment_text": "Hey Tim Awsum videos of the Tour can you do a Video on the different orbits and why as Elon says it&#39;s so difficult to get Starship to &quot;ORBIT&quot;  surely they are doing this already with super heavy and Dragon on falcon9", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T18:20:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Clayton", "comment_text": "You are outstanding at this, keep it up!", "comment_date": "2022-01-13T18:18:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "How Does it Really Work", "comment_text": "As usual from Tim, this was a pretty good lecture -- quite clear, well illustrated.

Not states is this raises ISP - I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what you meant.  I think this is something that many miss; often off stoichiometric often results in a higher ISP.  Rich is less &quot;efficient&quot; on the thermal efficiency side, but where all propellant comes from the tanks, the ISP is the most important.  With hydrocarbon fuels, running rich is definitely more efficient when measuring ISP.  Complete combustion of the carbon in the fuel results in CO2, running rich makes lots of CO.  CO2 is much more dense, having a molar mass of 44 vs 28 for CO.  For the same mass flow, CO accelerates to a much higher velocity than CO2 does.  Running CO over CO2 results in a lower temperature though, so the peak efficiency is somewhere around 50/50 CO2/CO.  <br>On regenerative cooling, closed cycles can also recover the heat and turn it into pump energy in addition to expander cycles.  If the same propellant that is used for cooling is used as the pre-burner majority fuel, then the heat recovered in the regenerative loop is added to the turbine input.  In Raptor the methane is boiled and warmed before it enters the pre-burner and takes less oxidizer there to create the same level of turbine power.
