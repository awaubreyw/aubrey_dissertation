Anyway, Tim, I have a question that has been bothering me since SpaceX erected one of is&#39;t rockets in front of their Hawthorne, California location. I live nearby and every time I drive by there, I wonder why they didn&#39;t put the second stage and payload housing on top of that rocket, so it looks like a rocket?

It appears they\u2019re now designing a BFS just for tourists. Previously the tourist was going to fly in a dragon capsule designed for taking crew to the ISS.  With a tourist version of BFS, after its first lunar flyby cruise, they send in the housekeeping staff and soon it is ready for its next cruise.  In that case they need to minimize training and maximize convenience. Perhaps put 12 cabins in a rotating section in the rear, each cabin having a bed, eating area and bathroom, then when zero-gravity nausea occurs just go your cabin and try to sleep it off. The dizziness-inducing effects of the centrifuge shouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re sleeping or moving slowly, and should be preferable to the nausea-inducing effects of zero gravity. It would not be good for space tourism if the first group of space artists documented how difficult it is to be a space tourist.", "comment_date": "2018-09-22T15:32:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "t3mpLarz", "comment_text": "Brilliant question, and observation!
