Also wondering if they use any dynamic ballasting to make it sit lower in the water.  There are things called &#39;flappers&#39; that are two plates of material with a hinge in the middle that only folds one way, when dropped in the water column they fold and move easily, when pulled upward they do not fold and thus create a large plane of resistance.  When deployed over the rails of a boat or ship they hold the rail of a vessel lower in the water when a swell tries to lift it, as the device is lower than the center of the wave energy in the water, so for large swells and a small boat it has little effect as it rides up the wave with the vessel.

Higher performance is also achived due to regular thermal expansion of the air inside engines allowing more thermal energy to be used for propulsion then in conventional design. Also if your craft is designed to injest boundry layer all around your craft (which it really should be as it lets you avoid air turbulence behind it reducing drag in the process) and you are using evaporative cooling starship style, you can reuse that fuel for propulsion too.<br><br><br>Apparently NASA looked into that back in the day, it isn&#39;t something new and seems like a perfect fit for an ssto as the main advantage of those is utilizing atmosphere to reach orbit with thrust to weight ratio less than zero and way less propellant due to high specific impulse only bested by nuclear engines.<br><br><br>All of that looks really good on paper, wonder why that design never flown (to space, apparently there are missiles using this kind of engine now).", "comment_date": "2019-03-02T13:16:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Captain Jack", "comment_text": "Didn&#39;t you manage to catch the re entry of the first stage?
