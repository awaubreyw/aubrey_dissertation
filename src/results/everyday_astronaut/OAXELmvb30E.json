FH has had all the issues regarding central core loading and has essentially required a redesign of central Falcon core. The side cores essentially just require longeron upgrades. The software updates would also be somewhat interesting. I assume (this being somewhere along my expertise) that the central core is a master and the two side cores are slaves - becoming autonomous for landing upon separation. BFR is essentially an enlargement of F9. OK, so there are some fundamental differences... New rocket motors - Raptors instead of Merlins and new fuel system - Methane instead of RP1 (kerosene). Both fuel and oxidizer (oxygen) are super densified (i.e. cooled and liquified) so little change there. The main problems for BFR are those that occur when approaching the limits of materials. Obviously F9  pushes these boundaries - more in the Merlin motors than the rocket itself. Further over simplifying the BFR task, a rocket is essentially a structural cylinder that  contains the rocket fuel vessels, supports the payload and mounts the rocket motors and avionics. Really, you &#39;only&#39; have to package 2 fuel tanks, some pipes, a couple of valves and a bit of avionics in the structural cylinder - all within the limits of material science at the lowest mass possible. The Raptor engines encompass most of the complexity of the overall problem and could (and probably do) obviate the need for external valves. I expect to see BFR (not BFS or BFT - tanker - notice &#39;RST&#39;) in 2018 (in some variant if not partially built) and I expect test flying 2019 - not from a conventional pad, but more &#39;just&#39; hopping in Texas - McGregor initially and then most likely real testing from a proper pad in Boca Chica.", "comment_date": "2018-01-17T13:50:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LightRealms", "comment_text": "Every time I hear someone mention the Texan launch facility, I both die inside and get hyped for the cheaper launch costs.
