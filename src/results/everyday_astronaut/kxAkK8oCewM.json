Of course when the craft is no longer accelerating (decelerating) you feel normal earth gravity, e.g. level flight, constant velocity with parachute deployed or of course after landing. Having written all this, I never gave any thought to being weightless in the first phase after engine shutdown, despite being an engineer and all that.

Its one thing to say that &quot;BO isnt designed to go to orbit, so its silly to compare it to a orbit rocket&quot; But the issue is that Blue origin advertises it and sells it in a way that TRICKS people. If you ask 95% of people out there to describe what &quot;being in space is like&quot; they will describe the effects of being in orbit, With further digging you can verify they have NO idea of the difference between the two and think that BO could dock at the ISS if they had permission. So when Blue origin sells flights as &quot;going to space&quot; and tries to claim to be the first to land a land a rocket that went to space. It is exceedingly misleading to most people and seeks to claim accomplishments they have not achieved by TRICKING people because those people dont understand the difference between suborbital and orbit. So its VARY important to remind people of this distinction. IF blue origin were not advertising this in a way to trick people then i fully believe that NOBODY would talk about it. It shouldnt be up to random people to teach others what a company is offering, they should be honest in the first place.<br><br>regarding the &quot;official start of space&quot; ie. the karman line, Blue origin isnt selling &quot;flights to the karman line&quot;, they are selling &quot;flights to space&quot;. I find it absurd that Blue origin wants to say &quot;You arnt really in space, because you havnt gone high enough&quot; when they have been playing word games from the start to trick people.<br><br>Regardless of any official definition of where space starts, you can orbit the earth at 80K and stay up there, That is vary much in space. <br><br>Blue origin would take people into orbit if they could, but they lack the ability so they settled for their toy rocket. Of course there wouldnt be any negativity pointed at blue origin if #1 they had been honest about what they were doing and #2 had not tried to claim achievements via tricking people. and #3 not given musk a &quot;backhanded compliment&quot; ie. a insult that sounds like a compliment. There was no public rivalry between musk and bezos until bezos posted that on twitter and the entirety of the internet jumped all over bezos for his BS.  This is why people are all over blue origin. This is why people were rooting for BO to lose. BO made it about winning, they made it about lies and they made it about this childish &#39;look at me&#39; behavior rather then letting people be excited for space. All Jeff bezos had to do was keep his mouth shut and let people be excited for what he was doing.

A Total Idiotic Waste, all so Branson can milk tourist dollars and feed his vainglory.   .....

When accelerating up the crew experiences more than 1 g because inertial force is acting in the same direction as gravitational force but after engine shutdown they should be experiencing normal 1 g gravity not weightlessness.
