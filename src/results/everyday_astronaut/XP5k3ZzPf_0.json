I know it&#39;s your dream to have a fully reusable ship. and my proposal is not really that.<br><br>.You apply a plastic wrap enclosing, under vacum, a water-absorbent fiber which, in its final form, gives the necessary thickness to contain the heat of re-entry.<br>To create the sheild the astronault expose it to the sun and inject water into the envelope than turn it to the shadow to freze it.<br>You don&#39;t have to worry about the weight of the water as it can be delivered by tanker.<br>You can use the technic to create a fully enclose ship to conter acte radiation.<br>Whit the webb heat sheilding thecnologie you could probably keep it frozen for long duration trip adding structural strengt agains impactoide.

There is very little life on earth that can comprehend how long there has been life on earth. There is no reason to suspect that life on earth won&#39;t proceed into the future at least that long. And life&#39;s actual duration is about 80 years. It is really silly to think about this as a lifeboat on a sinking ship. <br><br>What if Elon looked to the oceans instead of the sky to focus his energy. He gains an earth 4 times bigger that way. And it&#39;s right there for the taking. <br><br>As far as starlink goes? Starlink could be configured more robustly and at less cost by deploying it on the oceans as well as land.

It is always, and only, created by traders like you and me making such promises. It doesn&#39;t exist before the promise creates it. And it doesn&#39;t exist after delivery destroys it.

For example, refuel before reentering or bring more fuel up, so that main engines may provide trust for max deceleration in vacuum and thin air. Exhaust gases might protect engines from incoming hot air, while landing struts might be used as aerodynamic attitude controls (like canards), as airbrakes, maybe even create shockwave that deflects incoming air away from the body (if that&#39;s possible), and be used for landing.

He has virtue, wisdom, and intelligence. He understands the creative spirit within us. Wealth is not made by taking anything from anyone. It is created by people like Elon (maybe not as gifted, but still same attitude, virtues, and perspective). Those of us less gifted get to participate in the creation process by earning every dollar we make, when we work for people of genuine character. If the company or job you do does not somehow support the creative process, then start making plans to find an occupation that does not violate your conscience.  Entertainment could encourage virtue, creativity and healthy recreation; instead of pleasure that is destructive. The food industry could make healthy food that tastes good; instead of food that only tastes good.  Consumer goods makers could make products that don&#39;t waste our time by malfunctioning or failing.<br><br>I do seriously hope and pray that Elon is not alone in the world, that he will find friends who are his true equals in virtue and genius in the quest for viable commercial space transportation.

I like to recall that picture of you back in pre pay pal days, smiling in front of your one computer, and think how could anyone including you/Elon yourself accomplish this much in this amount of time. And far far more to come, sure there are countless business owners, entrepenuers etc past and present who truly care for humanity and earth before themselves even. Yet none quite so astounding as you, personally i know Elon haters are greedy, ignorant egoic fools, and the world could be all an ecoparadise if we allowed Elon and his many talented co workers... i really cant call them employees and am sure Elon feels the same way. We are all one people, on one earth, and if we can complete our evolution to at least the point of cooperation, acceptance of others (no racism etc), worked toward common good the outcome is almost unfathomable. In no time hunger, thirst, homelessness, most crime, simply would not exist... and what we would create with all these minds, fed, clothed, housed and taught the truth is beyond comprehension. Everyone could quite literally be as &quot;rich&quot; as they desire, although I assure you most would desire little personal assets. When you are truly free, and the actually truth will free you as the saying goes, we do not desire things primarilly, sure we want clothes, health, transportation, a home but all those things everyone would have, there is more than enough to go around allowing all to be filthy rich. Yet all those petty adolesent things would dissapate into the delusion they arise from and be replaced with enthusiasm, inspiration, the will and drive to create new incredible things, art, science, crafts, tools, and many would be content, happy and peaceful doing more remedial tasks. It sound utopian for it is utopian and it is not an impossible false dream. In truth it is our natural state, once we evolve past this adolecent phase we have been struggling through for thousands of years. Many have broken free and some never fell under the trance of what some teachings call the veil of delusion, which is basically our ego self taking hostage of our life. I feel Christ never fell under the spell, likely neither did Lao Tsu and countless others throughout time, many of whom led peaceful, harmonious, joyful lives never experiencing the veil of delusion but no doubt observing its madness in others. More people such as Buddha, Eckhart Tolle, Deepok Chopra, Katy Byron to name a few i personally am familiar with experienced enlightenment at some point in their lives. Some monks worked dilligently towards it and some never achieved it fully until death when we all see the truth. I led a life outside the norm, a ski bum/instructor, chef at night, and roofer in summer then picking up other trades until becoming general contractor building gigantic custom homes in Santa Barbara CA, Breckenridge CO, and Paradise Valley/Scottdale etc in the valley of the sun in AZ. It was in Santa Barbara though when my awesome life of skiing, mt biking, climbing, fishing, hiking, mountaineering etc reached a level unimaginable really, that made all my life of fun and adventure up until that point at 35yrs feel literally like hell in comparison. I was pondering why I wasn&#39;t even happier, having such an amazing existence up to that point I knew inherently something was missing, like there was just something i was overlooking holding me back. So I took a vacation, my first in a decade for I loved work and we made that fun as well... I did learn early most everything can be fun IF YOU ALLOW IT TO BE we make work not fun by simply not enjoying doing it... when it is actually all our choice... we have that power inherently. So I bought this little book I had thumbed through years before that rang of truth, and a 2nd book the author had just released. The author was promoting the book on Oprah Winfrey a show I never watched but happen to see and advertisement about this author and his new book the same day I was questioning my level of happiness... or perhaps my tendency to feel boredom or mundane blah. The first day of vacation i read the book, it isnt a long difficult book but I noticed many times I had to stop reading and go back a page or 2 because it turns out my mind went on autopilot, and kept reading while i was thinking of other things. Like when your driving and dont recall sections of the drive, your mind wandering about tomorrow&#39;s work or yesterdays mistakes, maybe resentments, or past great times even... yet we drive just fine... most of us, some of us lmao, the whole time. Anyhow so i really liked the book it just was oozing simple logical truths yet my ability to really read and only do that single thing was an effort. So on day 2 I restarted reading the book, focusing on reading only and not letting my mind wander, about halfway through the 2nd read something clicked within me, well it was more like something clicked into the correct perspective/function, which in turn clicked something else into its proper &quot;place&quot;, clicking another and another and another through this seeming tidal wave of perfect prestine allignment. Bliss and the wisdom of all the universe poured into my being like a  huge waterfall of amazing bliss, and from within me seemed to shine the most brilliant light that seemed to illuminate the world with depth, color, textures and resonating life in all things including thing we normally see as stationary, such as trees, rocks, earth etc, all was alive, connected, interacting, relating with colors brighter and more vivid than i could have ever conceived possible, the world looked 4 dimenional or 5,6 etc dimensional instead of our 3 dimensional typical view. I understood EVERYTHING in how the the universe truly worked, its prestine, absurdly simple perfection, and how we tend to &quot;miss this fundamental universal function&quot; that makes EVERTHING makes perfect sense, no more confusions of why this or that, why rich or poor, sickness or health, addiction, homelessness etc.... all replaced with absolute, simple, prestine, honest truth that is incredibly challenging to put into words. Thus many teaching call it wisdom beyond words.... our language evolves naturally as our species does so someday it may be easy to put this wisdom into words, in fact its quite possible we may evolve telepathy of sorts and not need words at all, or even technological devices such as nueralink that allow us to &quot;mind meld&quot; like spock in star trek. I was not as fortunate as some to shift to enlightenment and simply remain there, not long after enlightenment a friend came by and I tried to explain the astounding experience/change that had just occured to me, and just a few words into my explanation attempt I shifted back to my &quot;previous/normal&quot; concious awareness level... which up until that day I had felt was pretty awesome comparitively, I thought i was living the dream yet relative to how the state of enlightenment felt, my normal reality literally felt like hell. Not because it was bad, only enlightenment is incomparably &quot;better&quot;, it is absolute, prestine, perfect, simple perfection that puts you in a &quot;base state&quot; of peaceful, harmonious contentment, up to enthusiasm, inspiration, joy and even absolute bliss.... not emotions but states of being. I wont get into the difference here other than to say emotions are not meant for us to feel them and become angry, sad, or even positive seeming ones such as what we tend to call happiness of say getting a car, some vanity, or other ego serving things. <br>    After shifting from bliss back to the hellish feeling of normal consciousness i was horrified.... i had &quot;lost it all&quot; in an instant.... and I had no idea if that was it, or if I could return somehow... I knew it was supposed to be our natural state, but i wasnt yet aware of what keeps us from experiencing that state yet.... some teaching call tbose things we do or dont do which keeps us from experiencing what Christ called &quot;heaven right here in the midst of you&quot;. I though ok, reading the book got me there so maybe it can bring me back, and sure enough it did.... i didnt realize exactly how at the time but in the next decade of me studying many wisdon teachings/spirtuality teachings/religion core teachings without the dogma crap i learned much and gained much &quot;personal power&quot; as one teaching refers to it, so that I can return to zen, stay in zen, etc more or less whenever i wanted. So one othe the thousand heads of the beast it turns out is being fully present, something most of us are not typically great at. Our minds wander all day long, even when doing thing which you would think would require all/most of our intention like driving but nope... we can go on autopilot with most anytbing we have done quite often.... you could compare that to the honeymoon period, and not just with people but any task or doing, it could be learning a new fun thing like biking. Initially intense focus and intense happiness when getting it right or frustration/anger etc when getting it wrong. Notice emotions all have opposites, and they are their truly to guide us back to being centered, balanced, harmonious and peaceful so that we can rise up in states of being... instead of being emotional wrecks throwing tantrums or over exubrance etc. Humanity maybe the first being to consciously evolve as a species, it is what is occuring now, if we can save ourselves from ourselves.... and Elon is a huge part of this equation. Anyone who made it this far, I sure hope something clicked, nothi g would make me fill with joy more than assisting another human into experience enlightenment even for a moment.

If they have the accuracy of the landing worked out to a small enough margin of error that they can put a booster down next to the tower and in range of the gripping mechanism, I would assume that they could also land it within hollowed out cylinder in the ground. by landing within a &quot;sleeve&quot; there would be no risk of the booster tipping over, the catch/grip could be accomplished many different ways given 360 degrees access around the booster and touchdown might even be softer with some creative venting and management of engine and air pressure (by the silo, not the booster).", "comment_date": "2022-05-27T18:19:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Birdhouse Friend", "comment_text": "&quot;I&#39;m told it&#39;s the biggest thing south of San Antonio&quot;...yup, Elon&#39;s officially a Texan lol Love it, fire that badboy up and let&#39;s scoot around the cosmos!", "comment_date": "2022-05-27T18:19:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cryto-Alex", "comment_text": "It&#39;s amazing how detailed Elon is.

Watch the feet, the hands the way they communicate with a touch, the choregraphed action it is practiced but also an integral part of the dance. Watch it again.  Think about the tower, the Starship, the Tower the Booster.  Think about the grace and elegance of the dance independent of the partner - watch it again - see how they each continue on their own path yet intersect during the dance, over and over.  It is a challenge to express the delicacy of the union.  Sorry.<br><br>-- I said a while back a pogo stick.  Think about how that works.  Actually get a couple and try them out.  The center of gravity, the amount of jump, weight of the rider ... a very good analogy to the tower.  I respect your team moving the landing platform up in mid air.  How is that zero defined.  Hopefully not a base and displacement.  The concrete + 100 -  I am serious.  You can make it easy for the equipment to calculate and or more difficult.  Look at it again.<br><br>Too bad the giant remains with feet buried in the sand on the beach.  Waiting.<br><br>What do these guys need to know?  Hold on.  <br>I think there is more to those two words than we know.  Do you know what a no bounce hammer is and how it works?  The cable system should absorb the shock, take up the slack. But the thought for the day, for the hour, for the moment is repeatability.  Lets go back a couple of steps when we started work.  Do you remember me suggesting horse shoes?  The game?  Guess not.  It has a root in the flip and burn.  Be that as it may.  Here is a story for this time.  When you first build a horse shoe pit (there are always two btw) the shoes bounce all over the place.  As, over the years, we play the area around the pit becomes contoured.  Each season we add a bag of sand or improve the surrounding area by planting grass, removing stones (buy a new beer cooler, ice chest).<br>The game changes, we are not so frustrated with horseshoes rolling away or skipping off our landing zone, end over end out of control.  The toss, our game improves as we shape the horse shoe pit, one toss at a time.  It develops into, idk kind of like a slide.  We can pitch the shoe right in there and it sticks.  Hard to explain, I hope you get my drift.<br><br>Now the analogy is not ended.  The game of horse shoes is not just about numbers or aerodynamics.  The real joy (not just drinking beers) is the partnership.  Four players in all but two on each side from opposite teams.  I get to talk and discuss (strategy, technique, skill, luck, tease, enjoy the company) of my adversary - for this game.  We do not throw the horse shoes at each other.  You can actually play with just two but that is more walking.  With four it saves a few steps.  Anyhoo, get to the point.  No no no.  The point is the journey, the point is the story, the point is the dance.  We spend time together.  As we play - over the years, through the seasons, the pit changes but with a little TLC in the spring, with a bag of seed and sand, our playing field improves, our game gets better and  continues.  We learn and develop friendship and respect for other players and make new ones.<br><br>If you bang up the landing tower or platform - leave it.  Baseball gloves, shoes, many things benefit form being broken in.  We are not done.  We the startiles are incomplete - I keep thinking Nickelodeon green slime, but that is a story for another time.<br><br>Oh my there is so much more.  I am only nine minutes in.

Incase of sudden windshear or gust like in airplanes , will the rocket be able to abort landing and instead land on the open ground to prevent tower damage?<br>3. There was a lot of rust on the structure when Tim went to the level where the arms were, what kind of maintenance tests/ are done to make sure the tower&#39;s structure does not fail ?<br>4. How many starlink 2.0s can starship carry at one time while still able to land?<br>5. How much hydraulic pressure is required to move the arms and how fast are the arms able to reposition in m/s2 ?<br>6. Are the engineers planning to build a sound/vibration dampening structures around or under the towers in the future to reduce vibration and sound frequencies?<br>7. Does starship use radar/cameras/gps/ proximity sensors to land accurately or do they use AI based software that utilises sensors and gps data? <br><br>Man as a 22 year old from Malaysia I could go on and on about these questions, id literally cry if I even stepped foot on starbase.
