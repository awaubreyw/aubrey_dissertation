And speaking of mars. 2.) Will the flip data profile translate to martian atmosphere and be able to compensate for the increased velocity and less air resistance when making the flip. I feel like they need to do an early Venus slingshot trip with two Ships. One as a sacrifice death dive to beam data back to the 2nd one in orbit.

We need to remember that there have already been 68 successful landings of the Falcon 9 first stage, and as Scotty would say &quot;You cannot change the laws of physics&quot;. Or aerodynamics too, in this case. The control software is very similar - rocket needs to know its&#39; attitude, already done on F9. Rocket needs to adjust to change Attitude - already done on F9. The difference is the physical way the attitude is controlled, the fins would have to move one way or the other. Also, because the burn phase is practically the same, that means this has been even more successful than could be imagined.  Any information of exactly when the F9 first stage performs landing burn would help in understanding this?  I think Mr Manley&#39;s reasoning that the fuel mix became too oxygen rich, causing the engine to destroy itself, is the most convincing theory here.

Also having a flame path in the pad where the flame could escape from under the rocket would have helped keep heat from building up under the rocket.  The rocket legs need to be able to be able to absorb more shock from a hard landing (just incase).

It\u2019s about SN8\u2019s Green Flame of Death.  We know that the fuel header tank pressure was low, so presumably the fuel flow to the two Raptors that ignited for landing was low.  We also know that one of those two flashed green and moments later stopped firing, while the other heroically hung in to the bitter end, even as its copper innards were melting and burning.  Ok, got it.  Here\u2019s the question.  \r<br>\r<br>I keep reading accounts by fairly technically knowledgeable folks that offer this explanation:  Low header tank pressure caused low fuel flow, which caused the combustion-chamber mixture to lean out, leading to the presence of excess O2 which oxidized (burned) the Cu liner.  And, yeah, yeah, yeah, I get what an oxygen torch is all about, so let\u2019s not go there.  Sounds plausible, but... given the complexities of just what exactly goes into creating the fuel/oxygen mix at the injector of a full-flow staged combustion engine, I\u2019m not entirely clear if this would matter much.  Us laypeople can\u2019t really know, right?  \r<br>\r<br>So, when I heard of Elon\u2019s tweet about the low header-tank fuel pressure, I immediately thought... COOLING.  IIRC, the Raptor combustion chamber and nozzle are regeneratively cooled with fuel flow, which has to be kept at a fairly high rate to manage the incredibly high heat flux at the chamber wall and prevent overheating \u2014&gt; melting \u2014&gt; burning \u2014&gt; Green Flame of Death.  So, which is it?  Lean combustion running too hot, or diminished cooling?  \r<br>\r<br>And yeah, gang, please don\u2019t just say \u201cProbably both\u201d - even though it well could be.  Is there a reasonably well-informed case to be made for one or the other?  I mean, let\u2019s talk turbulent-boundary-layer heat transfer coefficients and the like.

After the &quot;belly flop&quot; the liquid fuel started flopping in the tanks and made the fuelling system to misfire and cut out (resulting in engine 3 to not ignite). The de-acceleration was unsuccessful due to having only one and a half (burnt) engine operating. Some would say it was a successful test.
