I have watched all the test carried out on Star Ships including vessel pressure tests and flight tests. So far, vessels have proven their pressure capacity and I must say Congrats to the team for being persistent enough to cross that hurdle. Another significant hurdle that was crossed successfully was the belly flop maneuver and and descent control, again, Congrats to the team. However the team is yet to cross a next major hurdle of landing. From my observation of all landings so far, I noticed one thing in common and that is the angle of the vessel at the final descent stage before touch down. This is likely due to the angle / position of the engine carrying out the landing burn in relation to the center of gravity / mass, despite is ability to gimble. As a result of such, the landings achieved with SN 5, 6 and now 10 has left these vessels standing with a tilt, as the crushing forces was biased to one set of legs on impact. So it might be safe to say that, just changing the landing legs my not provide spectacular landings as with the Falcon boosters. The key thing is to work with the center of mass which is what enables the success of the F9 boosters. This may require a fourth engine to be placed at the center of mass to handle the final descent burn and a balance balanced approach at 90 degrees to the landing pad. It them appear that the legs are gonna have to housed in secured pockets covered with heat shield for re-entry and then ejected for landing. &#39;&#39;Keep It Simple&#39;&#39;", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T17:25:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "smichelsen", "comment_text": "One video showed that maybe 3 of the 6 legs didn&#39;t deploy correctly.", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T17:16:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lance Beare", "comment_text": "How will Starship rehearse for landing in different atmospheres and gravity?", "comment_date": "2021-03-06T17:05:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tiger Ente", "comment_text": "I see, this landing manuver is all about fine tuning, but what happens if they&#39;re flying with cargo?
