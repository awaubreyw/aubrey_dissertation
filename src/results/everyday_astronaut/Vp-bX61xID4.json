Este homem ser\u00e1 o respons\u00e1vel por salvar milhares de pessoas. A Nasa vem a anos estudando pra explorar um planeta e chega Elon Reeve Musk em pouco tempo j\u00e1 conseguiu reaproveitar\u00a0 seus foguetes de lan\u00e7amentos. Fazendo com isso a viabilidade de explora\u00e7\u00e3o deixar de ser um sonho e tornar realidade. Hoje estou aqui escrevendo a minha opini\u00e3o sobre esta\u00a0 realidade. Elon Reeve Musk voc\u00ea vai passar por v\u00e1rias\u00a0 barreiras, mas nenhuma delas ser\u00e3o o suficiente para que fa\u00e7am desistir dos outros planetas. No universo existe sim vida al\u00e9m de n\u00f3s. Podem ser iguais ou diferente de n\u00f3s, mas isso n\u00e3o importa o objetivo e migrar para outro planeta porque o nosso aos poucos esta se modificando com os passar dos anos. N\u00e3o podemos dormir e esperar que tudo sempre continue como esta a cada dia que passa modifica\u00e7\u00f5es acontecem. Precisamos buscar outro caminho al\u00e9m das estrelas. Neste imenso universo existe sim vida igual a nossa sim! Apesar de que algumas pessoas defendam que isso \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel. Voc\u00ea Elon Reeve Musk acredita que existe vida em outros planetas? Ent\u00e3o acompanho sempre seus passos sou super f\u00e3 admiro sua coragem em perder seu tempo precioso em busca de uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o para humanidade. Quero lhe agradecer e lhe dizer que voc\u00ea vai encontrar o que procura em breve neste universo imenso. A humanidade s\u00f3 tem a lhe agradecer por nos ajudar. Talvez eu e voc\u00ea Elon Reeve Musk n\u00e3o estaremos aqui pra ver a conquista espacial no futuro. Mas estaremos na hist\u00f3ria eu Luiz Paulek por escrever esta carta a voc\u00ea Elon Reeve Musk por conquistar o espa\u00e7o e salvar a esp\u00e9cie humana. Bom meu amigo Elon desejo todo sucesso do mundo a voc\u00ea e nunca desista v\u00e1 em frente. Precisamos de voc\u00ea lembra disso. O primeiro passo voc\u00ea, j\u00e1 deu o segundo ser\u00e1 pousar em Marte com seres humanos a bordo de uma nave que voc\u00ea vai construir. Marte \u00e9 s\u00f3 o come\u00e7o da explora\u00e7\u00e3o espacial de longa dist\u00e2ncia. Lembre de mim quando for lan\u00e7ar as pessoas rumo a Marte.

Would it be possible to launch rockets off the ground with the use of a roller track system? Something like a roller coaster. Imagine a long roller track in the dessert, this track would have a slow ramp from horizontal to vertical. The rocket itself would be mounted on multiple coasters to allow for the curved path and not distort the shape of the solid rocket. To propel all this weight, use electro magnetic rail system to begin moving all this mass which I believe is the most demanding stage of lift off. Once the rail is moving fast enough have the rockets engage and take over and once rocket is vertical detach from the coasters and proceed into space. It would also be a good idea to have a solar panel plant to build charge  over time to power the electro magnetic rail system. Something like this could at least get the rocket off the ground at maybe 300-600 mph, could this idea actually be beneficial? Just a thought.
