Mankind achieved the impossible.  Now two years later, watching the footage of the launch here on youtube, seeing Falcon Heavy&#39;s engines roar to life, carrying it into the heavens gave me chills.

A time where little ol&#39; me was so invested in everything space, watching The Universe on TV on the weekends instead of watching cartoons, the surprise trip to the Kennedy Space Center and the Johnson Space Center in Houston that my parents took me to, looking up towards the heavens through a telescope, wearing my NASA hat with pride (which I still have and wear to this day), and wishing to become an astronaut. Memories like those bring a smile to my face. I wish I could have seen that launch live on TV, feeling the excitement and pride that all the employees of SpaceX felt that day. <br><br><br>To this day, I will keep this monumental event in mind every time I hear a distant roar from outside my own home.

Amazing. <br>Think about traveling to the year 1276 in Europe or 6000BC Northern Africa and telling people what we do regularly today. <br>Gratitude.", "comment_date": "2019-08-05T21:26:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Pastor Rich", "comment_text": "B R I L L I A N T ! ! ! !", "comment_date": "2019-08-03T16:11:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Declan 6914", "comment_text": "Sweet divine mother of f@\u20ack Tim, I wasn&#39;t expecting that.

The first look at the spaceman and his Tesla made me laugh with joy.<br>I&#39;ve seen lots of launches but this one was special. It was as emotional as Apollo 11 but the fact it was being done by a private company run by an entrepreneur who was not sure it would be successful and had been advertised in the open media really moved me. American ingenuity and flair. Elon Musk restarted interest in space and high goals that had languished in America and if for no other reason came alive. He is to be saluted.

There was a mistake with the live stream and the video feed for the side boosters was for the same booster, initially the streaming staff didn&#39;t think this was the case and were adamant about it despite both feeds appearing to be the exact same, it was chalked up to both sides mirroring the other, which would make sense, except as we now know both sides use the same parts so they are not mirrored, which makes more sense from a build standard. however, by the end of the stream when the rockets were landing, it became obvious it was the same feed as anyone familiar with the landing pads knew they both looked different and on the stream they were both landing on the same exact pad and they both had another rocket to their left.... within 24 hours the stream was pulled and replaced with the correct footage. Im not sure if anyone even has the original footage anymore, there really wasn&#39;t any point to keep it and no reason to think spacex would get rid of it, I never would have thought they kept all original footage from each camera and would be able to rebuild it.<br><br>Additional trivia: The landing cut outs on the barge are not actually real, they are done on purpose. everyone loves to see landings but seeing something go boom can take away from the attention the primary mission gets, souring the mood for those watching(when they should be celebrating!) and with media coverage its just bad PR. this lets them avoid that which is honestly quite understandable, before spacex there wasn&#39;t anyone showing launches and landings like they do, so its not shown initially until they are sure the stage landed safely. Its worth noting however that they are not shy about showing them go boom, they have an entire blooper reel on their youtube page showing all of the landing failures.
