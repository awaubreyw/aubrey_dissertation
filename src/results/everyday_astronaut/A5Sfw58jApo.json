It WON&#39;T matter when starship is build and operating. Your analogy with the semi-truck and the scooter falls short when the semi-truck would be far CHEAPER than the scooter. I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t seem to have thought this through, while it&#39;s quite easy to grasp. With starship EVEN if you only paid for one mini-satellite on a dedicated flight, you&#39;d only need to pay for the fuel costs, as it&#39;s fully reusable. A small launch rocket won&#39;t be able to do that. Fuel would set you back maybe $200000, while the cheapest small launcher would still cost you $2000000!<br><br>And this will remain true until the point they can create small launchers that are cheaper then just <b>the fuel</b> of a bigger launcher...which is extremely unlikely, since you always have to throw away at least the upper stage. So, in your analogy, it would be like paying for the fuel of the semi-truck, or paying for the fuel of the scooter AND the scooter itself every time you order something.

We can heat up hydrogen to the hundreds of millions of degrees and confine it in a magnetic chamber in fusion experiments. Even a fracion of a fraction of that temperature should be more than enough to outperform the current speeds. If we manage to make the exhaust go x10 faster, it means you will need x10 times less flow to get the same impulse, which means, you need x10 times less fuel to get the same payload to orbit or, you can keep the engines running x10 times longer.
