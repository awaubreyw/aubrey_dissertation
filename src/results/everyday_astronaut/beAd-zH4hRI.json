Thank you Tim, in advance. <br><br>To whom this should concern on the SpaceX team: A curious thought just entered my mind: I&#39;ve looked at  Boca Chica and the surrounding area from satellite photos, and it appears to be a very sandy place. Also, from many videos I&#39;ve watched, I&#39;ve additionally noticed it is also a very sandy place as well, with lots of seriously blowing sand. My question is this (and I&#39;m sure this subject was probably already worked out a long time ago, but asking can sometimes prevent future disasters...): Have the issues of blowing sand build-up, and contamination between moving parts, been factored into the safety models?<br><br>I&#39;m positive that Elon, one of the greatest engineers in the world, has had a handle on this for years... But just thought I&#39;d ask... <br><br>EXAMPLES: If somebody possibly had called NASA before the Challenger launch and asked about the effects of freezing weather on the solid-booster o-rings; or if somebody had called and asked what would happen if a piece of foam material broke off the side of the main fuel tank and struck the orbiter, like the Columbia accident; perhaps we would still have 14 wonderful members of the NASA management team, making manned spaceflight that much safer (who knows, perhaps a few of them might have been working for SpaceX by now)!<br><br>I don&#39;t know if any of these questions I ask ever make it beyond the YouTube &quot;miscellaneous comments&quot; graveyard or not, but it would certainly be my sincere wish that this one would at least make it to a ground-supervisor at Boca Chica, if only just for safety&#39;s sake.<br><br>Once again Tim, if you think this might be &quot;a thing&quot;, I trust you implicitly to pass it up the ladder to the correct team / team-supervisor.<br><br>God bless you, and keep riding high!

Your enthusiasm is infectious.<br>One thing you&#39;re less than convincing about is your estimate of the existence of life elsewhere.<br>There are thousands of millions of planets around stars - that&#39;s one statistic you&#39;ve set your &#39;proof upon that&#39; there must be life elsewhere.<br>Have you considered the statistics against there  being life anywhere, including here?  They&#39;re infinitesimal - in other words impossible!<br>There has to be an intervention for life to exist - no man can create even the lowest form of life.  You can bring together all the components of the body, but, cannot build a body without having a starting block - like growing new noses and ears - can be done, but you need life to start it - even if you could build a body you&#39;d never put life in it - impossible.<br>So, there is no life out there and the only people who surmise there is are either being disingenuous, or suggest it to get funding to go and see.<br>I&#39;m really excited about the prospects of going to the moon and Mars.
