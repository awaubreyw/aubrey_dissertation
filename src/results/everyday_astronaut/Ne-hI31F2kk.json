Thanks so much for all the time and money you put into this channel and your live streams.  This is what you should do for sure. If you\u2019re going to be at a launch then obviously you should record it but only live commentate. Post your videos afterwards because people like me who enjoy your content (aside from live events) want to watch you no matter what happens with your live stream. Getting to watch the launch again from different angles a few days later is something I look forward too. Getting to listen to you talk about rockets in general is why I subscribed.  I\u2019ve learned a ton from your channel so please don\u2019t worry about your technical difficulties live streaming. 99% of us understand and don\u2019t fault you. We appreciate the effort and honestly want your commentary more than we want live shots anyhow.  I don\u2019t want to be disrespectful to your effort but I feel like most people watch space x stream during launch/landing anyhow. They have the best video feeds. So for me I didn\u2019t care that you live stream cut out because I was watching space x anyhow. I watch you before and after.

But, I have to offer some constructive criticism. Pick one thing and do that. While I know some of the issues on your live stream weren&#39;t your fault, a couple items were, and were likely due to you being task saturated. So, either do your main video live stream and concentrate on actually providing footage (ie, following the ascent, decent, etc, with the camera so viewers can actually see, and paying attention when someone is blocking the shot) or, get someone to help run the second camera. <br><br><br>I enjoy your pre-launch banter and your informative commentary, but the primary reason I watch launch live streams is to watch the launch. I&#39;m not sure if the launch lock-up was just due to wireless issues, or of you bumped something when you ran around (in front of the camera) but I really wish I had watched the SpaceX stream instead. Even worse was the landing, where the camera was fixed on an empty part of sky, you&#39;re hooting and hollaring about how awesome the landing approach was, and then we got to see an empty sky, followed by a flannel shirt. I&#39;ve bought stuff from your shop to help support you (I&#39;m laid-off so cant patreon) so I really do appreciate your work.

Also, once the boosters decelerate to &lt; speed of sound, no more sonic boom is being produced. Im not sure at what point the boosters were no longer supersonic, but I suspect they were slowed down long before they got close to earth&#39;s surface.. but its almost as if the sonic boom was traveling just behind the boosters, such that when the boosters landed the sonic boom (shock waves) arrived just a few seconds later..<br>im trying to envision how this happens..", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T02:31:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Elopeous", "comment_text": "Landong only 5km away..", "comment_date": "2019-04-14T02:25:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bamm86", "comment_text": "Have they landed the center portion and shuttle yet?
