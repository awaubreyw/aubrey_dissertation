Here&#39;s another thought. By having SLS, future models and having commercial options, help insure that we continue everyday going back to space continuously , instead of the 10 year gap we had.  My belief is we need to get into space, stay in space, branch out, colonize other worlds and explore what&#39;s out there. By making a base on the Moon or Mars, that will also help science here on Earth for many reasons.  I grew up with Star Trek, Star Wars, and all those other shows, and I believe we can do that, at least some of that still in my lifetime still.  I remember The Apollo 11 launch and moon landing as a 4 year old and was in awe of what had happened, and Skylab as a kid.  I remember the Space Shuttle and all it accomplished.  And then it seemed we just stopped.  There is so much out there and it never should have taken 50 years to go back to the moon.  We should be in other solar systems by now.

What is your answer to letting a contract which was completely inovative meaning there were times the research and development that went into bidding for contracts  a) would have to be eaten by the company that did NOT get the bid and b) would have to be changed along the way because of unforeseen consequences. That is the reason you can not put a money cap on this sort of project. And the contracting vehicle, as you say, has &quot;baked into it&quot; the flexibility one needs to succeed.  Yes there are contracting officers (CO&#39;s) responsible to watch the funds after the contract has been let to make sure gigantic cost overruns are necessary to the fulfullment of the project and he has the power <br>to STOP a project dead in its tracks. He is often dependent on TR&#39;s ( Governemt technical representatives) who, depending how strongly they present their case, can guide the CO&#39;s to the right conclusion.

Rockwell, who built the Shuttle,  promised huge savings through reusability.  What we got was a less efficient system, that could only reach leo.  As our Shuttles got older, the maintenance became even more expensive than Apollo&#39;s disposable approach.  The Shuttle did bring some unique abilities to NASA&#39;s tool box.  It was the most expensive way ever devised to get a human into leo.  After the accident with Space Shuttle Columbia,  it seemed a good time to wind down the Shuttle program.  We learned alot, including the fact that the Space Shuttle was a Lamborghini, not the efficient work truck we needed. NASA is no stranger to cost overruns,  they are an aerospace research and development operation, not a business.  Commercial space flight is based on the science that the Russian and American government run space programs have learned.  Now that spaceflight has been solidified into an engineering challenge, it should be clearly a commercial application. NASA should, instead, be always focused on the mission, and the science.  A good rocket, like a good truck, should be outsourced; when possible.  Until Starship actually flies, the SLS program should continue. If we want to be spacefarers, we must remain committed.

The regulator, thanks to good lobbyists, does not say anything or even changes the rule to give a further advantage to the oligopoly; innovation stops and cheap (for the oligopolists) solutions are preferred. Money is preferably used for lawyers, lobbyists and &quot;gifts&quot;, rather than for investments. <br>Situation changes only if government finds the way to break the cartel or if external and powerful subjects enter into the game, determined to make a space for themselves in the oligopoly or to replace one (possibly all) oligopolists with themselves. <br>In my opinion, the facts that Artemis is finally moving on and that space industry is undergoing a dramatic change is no coincidence: because the industry is evolving so fast with powerful newcomers, then traditional fat cats have been somehow forced to move on and contracts also had to change (i.e. the number and relative force of lobbyists is changed, and we see the result). Should newcomers have not grown in number, capacity and size (with one new major player already emerged and another one growing, backed from almost unlimited funding) now we would probably see the re-enactment of the Constellation Program tale, with traditional large player spending money for lobbying and law cases rather than to develop new systems, giving less and less for more and more money, literally recycling over and over old stuff and eventually coming to nothing, in order to restart the game again with a new program name. <br>Also, the growth of Chinese space industry is a powerful stimulus: pressure on government agencies and politicians now does not come only from domestic lobbies. Something had to change.<br>Still in my opinion, considering constraints (uncertain funding, hard lobbying and political pressure to shower powerful companies with money while ensuring to pepper as many States as possible with some contracts), the best solution would have been for NASA to please the political/lobbying constituency with the dumbest possible update of the Apollo program (allowing even more profits for the companies, and maybe getting in exchange a shorter development time and a semi-obsolete, but altogether functioning launch system), considering it just a &quot;sunk cost&quot; to get something which would have at least avoided the ten-years humiliating gap in ISS cargo and crew support capacity, while going on with the commercial programs to get really innovative stuff from newcomers. <br>If the point was just to give out money to Pratt&amp;Whitney, Boeing and Lockheed Martin etc, using a contract which provides a premium for delays and costs overrun, at least they could have chosen to recycle/revamp the best performing stuff, not the leftover from failed or disputable programs.  <br>Once said this, yes, Artemis will be probably something really different from Apollo on steroids and will really represent the dawn of a new era in space industry, but the loads of money and time wasted before arriving there will be horrendous...", "comment_date": "2022-01-08T23:04:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grater Good", "comment_text": "It&#39;s not a government project if it doesn&#39;t waste money.", "comment_date": "2022-01-08T13:35:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zrrickert", "comment_text": "Fun fact: Neil Armstrong actually said \u201cone small step for A man.

After making his famous speech about landing on the Moon within the decade (Which Congress approved thanks to the political influence of Lyndon B. Johnson), Kennedy realized that support for such a massive/expensive program wouldn&#39;t last. So he wanted to cancel Apollo even before it got off the launch pad. It was President Johnson who kept the program running and NASA saw it&#39;s largest budget during his presidency. President Nixon carried out the inertia of the program. But, After Apollo 11 landed on the Moon NASA had to flight to survive. Due to the Vietnam war (excuse me, CONLFICT) and the social atmosphere at that time, it wasn&#39;t popular to spend a lot of money in the space program. That&#39;s why After Apollo 11, Nixon slashed NASA&#39;s budget and the agency entered a slow decay that went all the way through the Space Shuttle program until today. Skylab was conceived using the scraps of Apollo. The last Apollo spacecraft was waisted on the political shenanigan called the &quot;Apollo-Soyuz Test Project&quot;, which did NOTHIN to advance space flight nor to improve the Soviet-American relationship. The space shuttle was barely approved by a single vote. After the Challenger disaster President Reagan wanted to keep the shuttle flying due to its military potential for DOD missions. Finally, after the Columbia disaster Congress saw an opportunity to cancel the program and the only thing that kept it going was the building of the ISS. After the ISS was completed it was game over for NASA and I knew that the space shuttle was going to be NASA&#39;s last manned spacecraft for a long, LONG time. SLS doesn&#39;t have, not even near, the political drive Apollo had. Unfortunately, today not enough Americans are interested in space exploration for x, y or z reason and it painfully shows. Spending a lot of money on the space program is still hugely unpopular. Which is why today Americans are flying into space on vehicles made by everybody, but NASA. After the shuttle it was the Russians and now SpaceX (Well, at least SpaceX in within the US).", "comment_date": "2021-11-15T06:17:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Severyn26", "comment_text": "Do I really need to explain why government contracts are always ridiculously overpriced and behind schedule?", "comment_date": "2021-11-13T22:59:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Kerry Freeman", "comment_text": "I have news!<br>Starship has been cancelled!

SLS is not at all sustainable because for Artemis to do something truly new and unique, we need more than 10 people per year to land on the surface.

And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T05:01:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "anhtshrm", "comment_text": "I would really like to see a remake of N1 Rocket.

Then they could be brought back using a simple low cost crew vehicle like SpaceX&#39;s Crew Dragon, or Boeings capsule. Which has already proven it can handle the re-entry phase.<br><br>This means you only need to have a transfer vehicle to the moon side gateway. and you could assembly and send cargo on these transfer missions. to build a larger and more useful gateway, that could eventually send a lot of its resources to a potential lunar base.<br>It would also get you a larger more capable vessel that doesn&#39;t try to do it all in one go. but builds its capability with every mission, and can handle a much longer-term mission and more science done on-site, rather than through a relay of materials from the surface.<br><br>All in one go, works for exploration, but not for colonization.

I suspect SpaceX will have multiple ways to conduct refueling in orbit and beyond.

If Starships can refuel mid-flight they could increase their speeds allowing for quicker flights, and for changing their flight paths. This could be helpful in emergencies. I believe the Butt to Butt refueling will be too slow for many missions and SpaceX will want to offer orbital refueling as a service to other businesses and governments. Future craft may just want to strap on some fuel pods for their flights out of earth orbit to wherever they&#39;re going.  SpaceX could have several orbital fuel pod farms with hundreds or thousands of fuel pods in orbit and traveling back and forth to the Moon and other destinations where fuel can be made. It won&#39;t be long before fuel is being delivered from our Moon and other moons to bring fuel to earth orbit to feed the fueling pod farms. Self-driving spaceships won&#39;t care about the flight times and on Elon scales he&#39;s going need more fuel for his future plans. He&#39;s hinted at flights to other moons for a reason.

A lot of the stuff was never documented and the people that built it are either dead or probably don&#39;t remember why something was done the way it was. There are stories and anecdote that when Artemis was announced there were NASA engineers going to scrap yards and museums tracking down Apollo era hardware just to see how some of the stuff was done; to see how certain problems were solved by the Apollo engineers. I heard one story of how the current engineers came across a pipe that had an unexpected bend in it. There didn&#39;t seem to be an obvious reason for it to be bent that way but it was clearly shaped like that for a reason. The managed to track down the engineer who worked on that part of the rocket and he told them it was shaped like that so they could have enough room to get a tool in there to access something nearby. Things like that were never documented and only discovered through trial and error. Saturn V was built fast and &#39;good-enough&#39;, they were in a rush and decisions to do things a certain way were likely done ad hoc and on the fly just to get the rocket out the door on time. The amount of effort to reverse engineer the Saturn V would probably be similar what&#39;s been done developing SLS.", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T03:56:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marshall Fischer", "comment_text": "I thought this was a comedy show at first thinking NASA would stay within budget and timelines.. my guess is three times each.", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T02:09:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RANGER \u2022 7y ago", "comment_text": "I watch the whole video", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T01:52:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "O-man The Human", "comment_text": "&quot;no cost overruns&quot;<br><br>NASA: laughs in sunken cost fallacy", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T01:35:37Z", "likes_count": 286}, {"comment_by": "Ethan Massey", "comment_text": "I need a pair of moon boots.", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T20:58:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Tomb", "comment_text": "People don\u2019t understand government contracts nothing is ever fixed price.

Try to use these two things in any other capacity other than \u201cgoing back and forth from the Gateway\u201d and their capabilities fall off the map. Only the SLS can justify its existence more because it can launch into deep space, except each one costs a billion dollars to replace and they are not reusable. Meaning they are horribly inefficient when it comes to space travel.<br><br>The best case scenario is if NASA completely abandons the Lunar Gateway and focus on direct lunar injection.

We stopped going to the moon because NASA is a government agency. It is financially dependent on the politicians and the reasons we stopped going to the moon were political.  Musk makes the rapid progress and innovation, he does, because he is financially independent; he doesn&#39;t have answer to congressional committees about cost over runs and schedules, or fight politicians determined to keep voters employed in their own states.  <br>Do you think NASA would have cut the last three Lunar landings of its own free will?

The operational phase of SLS should be much cheaper than Shuttle. You design a vehicle very differently if you intend to use it once as opposed to using it over and over. You have to be absolutely sure it will work perfectly one time, vs. having to be sure it works perfectly multiple times it launches.<br><br>For shuttle, we had to basically reinsure the vehicle was in as close to pristine condition as possible each launch.  The cost of that was incredible. And regardless of how much inspection, repair, upgrade and replacement that was done, the vehicle had a limited design life.  Shuttle ran something like 10 years past its intended design life for the major structural elements.<br><br>So we could design another Shuttle like system, knowing the associated costs and problems with a reusable vehicle, or we could return to a more Apollo &#39;like&#39; vehicle where the expensive parts of it were disposable.<br><br>That being said, we discovered that some portions of the Shuttle that were reusable were actually relatively cheap and safe.  The SRBs.  After Challenger, that may seem like an impossible statement, but with all of the redesigns and improvements made to the SRBs over the decades, they are very well understood technology.  The cost compared to the thrust of SRBs is hard to beat with any other possible system.  So we kept the SRBs and went from 4 segments to 5.<br><br>And the capsule.  Relatively, the capsule is a small portion of the entire stacked vehicle.  If there is a portion that can be inspected, repaired, and refurbished enough every flight in relatively inexpensive fashion, it&#39;s the capsule.

These are not only SLS contractors, but also ESA is surely having the same problem, wich put Ariane 6 and the organization under the magnifying glass, and even nations like China og Russia as they surely learning now from the outside competitors (such as SpaceX, even Virgin Galactic plans on future astronauts). So HR deffenatly changes the and organize companies of the space industry, however, it will be alot more of HR also involved in futurespaceflight, and it will surely start with both Virgin Galactics astronauts, Blue Origins craft and Starships all around lower orbit and to the moon. dearMoon will problaby have a MAYOR effect on how we look at Space Travel, a thing the Space Shuttle tried hard to but partly failed to. This is hugely important, and is surely has alot of &quot;feelings&quot; where the main goal is to give regular people the so called overview effect, andwhere people now will be able to have reference to space. This is also what will save Space Industry. There is to mentions all those rockets you barely mention on this video that will also participate on the Artemis program that will also start what I vision to be the fifth industrial revolution. SpaceX Starship, and possible Blue Origin will have to carry numberous part time and specialized astronauts that will work on the Moon and lower orbit.

The tests included PD&amp;C, power distribution and control, EDS, emergency detection system, and General Networks, the program to validate all IU interface wiring, Sim Plug, which ran the simulation of disconnecting the IU from ground power while connecting to onboard battery power, and Sim Flight, the program that simulated the entire function of the IU up to  stage separation of the S IVB stage. We used ATOLL, automatic test to launch language and  typed our own 8080 punch cards, assembled the Atoll format programs into machine language using the IBM System 360, and ran the programs on a RCA 110. The IU&#39;s computer system consisted of a LVDA and LVDC, launch vehicle digital adaptor and launch vehicle digital computer, both about the size of a very large suitcase.

The tooling all has to be redone and to standards that generally are no longer extant, plus the supply chain has to source parts that are no longer made meaning they have to pay over the odds to sub contractors to even consider restarting a production line because quite simply restarting the logistics to build a system that is no longer extant is actually extremely non profitable, therefore everyone involved has to raise their costs massively.

But some that are now riding a wave of growth enthusiasm are very much in the shadow of decline. Others that are thought of as seasoned growth industries have actually stopped growing in every case, the reason growth is threatened slowed or stopped is not because the market is saturated, it is because there has been a failure of management. The failure is at the top. The executives responsible for it, are those who deal in broad aims and policies&quot;. \r<br>We all can see the differentiation from NASA to Space X. and come up with similar rants, however... Another reason why I have written this, is because of the 5% of mission success. This mere 5% represents nothing when compared to the weight of expectation, desire, and purpose, of Apollo and the shuttle, a gift for NASA. \r<br>When Apollo and the Shuttle stopped, guess what (read above quote again). NASA has become over time protectionist, a safety drowning/drenched organisation. A complete role reversal of Apollo and the shuttle programs.

I agree with virtually everything stated for the reasons articulated. I would however, like to put some of these numbers in perspective. When discussing government programs, you can get &quot;billions&quot; insensitive. It is hard to understand how much the totals actually mean. For example, the USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), a 100,000-ton state of the art nuclear aircraft carrier, is estimated to cost at least $13 billion; $5 billion for research and development plus $8 billion to build. $31 billion for Artemis 1?!!!! That is the cost to construct four Ford class aircraft carriers. Lots of people from Boeing and NASA should not only be fired but be in jail for accepting those incredible costs. As said, the SLS is nothing much more than a collection of used and old parts. For it to cost that must deserves more than a rant. The Orion is perhaps not totally comparable to Apollo, but it is loosely akin to the Crewed Dragon. The Dragon 2 is not designed for the precise mission as is Orion, but It could be and could have been. The Dragon 2 funded development costs were around $2.6 billion. Perhaps to make a Dragon 2 version that could do what Orion is supposed to do would cost twice as much or $5.2 billion to be unkind to SpaceX. However, $13.6 billion for a capsule is so utterly outrageous that again people from NASA and Lockheed should be fired and jailed. The lack of being good stewards of the taxpayer\u2019s money makes one&#39;s blood boil. Artemis is not sustainable. A permanent manned settlement on the moon is not possible with Artemis.

What should have happened was NASA should have done what Elon did in reinventing how we got back to space, using a far better sustainable strategy. instead, it feels they just re-used some old concept designs and just made it better and certified with less degree of risk (as you mentioned Tim).  I would have liked it if they found a better way to redo the shuttle by flying it on top of a rocket instead or found some other way to make it safer and sustainable. But that&#39;s all moot considering, Elon has done the work for them with Starship. I always think Nasa should have their own capabilities, but I think it should be a design in which is modeled more like SpaceX and Blue origin in having a fully reusable system.  That&#39;s the key, reusability. I always thought that dumping these engines in the ocean or having them burn up upon entry is part of the reason why the cost is high (let alone having to build new rockets and having to have a higher rate of inventory. Don&#39;t get me started on Boeing/Northrop Grumman/Lockheed triopoly stranglehold on the government sector... these guys have had a monopoly among each other and taking advantage of the whole &quot;it&#39;s a govt contract, let&#39;s charge what we want&quot; credo just to justify the cost and now it&#39;s catching up to them when outside companies innovating like SpaceX and Blue Origin are giving them a run for the money. Boeings spectacular fail on Orion is just an example, or the ULA (Boeing and LM) delta heavy last-minute abort launch. I get it, they&#39;ve been tried, tested and true, but when you have SpaceX running circles on them just launching rockets and landing back one after the other, doesn&#39;t look good. It just makes it like NASA looking old again, and these good old boys defense companies like NG, Boeing and LM companies needs to die or reinvent themselves to be like SpaceX or up and coming companies like RocketLab etc. Hell even countries are calling Lockheed Martin out for the whole F-35 program debacle and relying on other countries and/or smaller weapons and defense contractors, and this way of manipulating the govt system to funnel contracts and money needs to stop. Look i know none of this is going to be bargain 99 cent store cheap prices, but at least if you spend this much money, might as well make the toyota camry of rockets, and have it last as long as it can, and be reused as much as possible. ROI is obviously one term people tend to forget is critical.

This is going to happen again. I think success will breed instability. NASA will like something that happened with Blue Origin as example and they will just hand them money to do great things. Blue Origin or anyone will accept and make something awesome. Over time get complacent and then we will be in the same cost issue again. We need NASA to structure differently so this does not happen again. No more favorites, Just lowest bid and proven track records with money dedicated to new ideas and companies. Believe it or not Blue and SpaceX need more competitors and we should fund more companies once Blue and SpaceX can stand on their own.", "comment_date": "2020-09-14T17:40:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Brandon Warren", "comment_text": "Finally!

However, when you look at a Mars Mission, different components can easily weigh more than 50 tons and Delty-V requirements for capture and return are much bigger. Giving Orion a Service Module big enough to accomplish all those goals would be hugely inefficient and would turn Orion more into a crewed space tug than simply a manned capsule. All the pushing-around would be done by high-energy transfer stages like the blie Origin lander one.

Your stuff is always top notch.<br>I have been enraged at NASA ever since SLS (Senate Launch System) became a thing as a jobs program, not as a science and exploration program. Sorry, but the Shuttle, unique as it was (my uncle worked on the Dyna-Soar, where the concept came from) was almost as much of a disaster waiting to happen as Apollo was. My objections break down like so:<br>1) Re-use tech that was designed 45 years ago, but still wind up paying a premium for it, AND still have Boeing play kick-the-can on schedules. That is offensive.<br>2) Having worked for Lockheed on AEGIS, cost-plus is alive and well. I left that job as soon as I could when I realized I was working for a company that was happy to be part of the problem, instead of part of the solution.<br>3. We&#39;re the only country fool enough to crew-rate a launch vehicle with SRBs. We also kill our Astronauts more often, and the chain of causality is pretty clear. You want to put up a satellite? Great...use SRBs. You want to put a crew on top? No. I dislike Elon Musk personally, but he is not wrong about liquid fueled systems.<br>4. It took a SpaceX to make a monkey out of the ULA and the &#39;military industrial complex&#39; and display technological innovation. Going back in time isn&#39;t the answer: Going forward is. (I say that as a huge fan of the F1 &amp; Saturn V stack.)<br>5. With the surfit of options in commercial space coming up, explain to me why we need SLS again? Maybe run 8 or 12, and then be done with the clunky thing, having bought enough time for commercial space to really innovate, and offer better products with a variety of distributors and get NASA out of the hardware business.

Just a comment about your repulsion of Cost/Plus contracts...apart from the fact that the United States Space Program is indirectly a tool used by the political establishment to maintain jobs in various regions of the country as are Military spendings, the difference between a cost/plus contract and a fixed cost contract is about who is taking the risk.  On risky projects where there is a lot of innovation and unknowns, the &quot;Client&quot; must evaluate if he wants to transfer the risk to the supplier and pay a significant amount of money for it with a fixed cost contract or take itself the means to control the risk and have a cost-plus project where there is no amount allocated for the risk by the supplier.  On top of that, we can add the fact that in the vast majority of cases, when the risk was incorrectly evaluated by the supplier, the supplier fails and goes bankrupt.  When this happen and there is no other supplier that can fulfill the place left by the bankrupt supplier (which is usually the case with space programs), the project is Kaput...Then the client, in this case the american government, supports the supplier by injecting even more money for it to fulfill the contract...So, in the end, what is the difference?  I think the solution is competition where the supply of solutions is not at the mercy of only one supplier whether it is a fixed cost or a cost/plus.

Still, it is way more capable and goes far further than the shuttle ever did. A, when compared to Apollo, remember Apollo was about &quot; getting to the moon ahead of the Communists cost be don&#39;t&quot; that&#39;s why the budget rose to 282 billion by 72 was because of war. We will never have such a budget again. And remember lower budgets make everything harder meaning lower production runs mean more People Run working on the same product and when it comes almost evenly to delays you still have to pay all of them ther salaries this is partly why the main core is so expensive because that Program runs for a decade. But even so, if you Projections of Program cost Pan out at 61 billion (and I do not think so) we will have landed the same number of time than Apollo 6 but for abutting have the cost over the entire program and if we continue the Program further it will be cheaper on the programme-cost/mission-number scale. The thing is SLS is a big investment but we will be using the hell out of it in the next decade to Justifie those costs we will have to use it for a lot of missions and these a long time lets hope we can get that mission number in the hundreds as we did with the Shuttle.  Wich will depend on how long congress will want to continue the program. Also speaking of political risk the biggest risk is that it is an election year. However, wins let&#39;s hope that they change the Political winds not while the president changes the Target of the moon back to Mars and our loos and decade.

Then they would transfer the samples and whatever over to the shuttle craft, and make their way back to the ISS for a short period of rest before transferring the samples, tools, and/or etc. back over to the launch vehicle (which is now called the &quot;Earth-return vehicle&quot;).\r<br>\r<br>After a few days/weeks rest and possibly some physical tests, they say their goodbyes to the ISS Crew, then ingress the Earth-return vehicle, and descend back to the surface of the Earth, either on land or in the ocean.\r<br>\r<br>But here we are about seven or eight years later (or perhaps even longer). The name of the vehicle has been changed to &quot;Artemis&quot; (the twin-sister of Apollo - which is like, super-cool)!\r<br>\r<br>But I&#39;m not seeing a completed &quot;Artemis&quot; launch-vehicle (there&#39;s bits and pieces strewn about about the confines of the VAB, in Mississippi, even in Utah, and probably other locations, but no completed genuine article mounted on a crawler-transporter, ready to go make the Saturn V look like a kindergarten science project...\r<br>\r<br>And I can&#39;t help but wonder &quot;Why?&quot; - I mean there&#39;s the usual words and phrases we became familiar with from the days of Mercury and Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and the Space Shuttles; such as over-budget, miscalculated final costs, parts made by one company don&#39;t match up to the parts made by another (Apollo 13 air-filters come to mind...), inadequate testing, magnificent desolation, &quot;The Eagle has Landed&quot;, and &quot;One Small Step for Man&quot;. Then we all held our breath and each other&#39;s hands until Jim Lovell, after the Command Module of Apollo had taken too long to emerge from radio silence, finally uttered the words, &quot;Houston, 13&quot;; and immediately the entire world drew a breath of relief, suddenly realizing that we were going to get our astronauts back home, alive, uninjured, and safe!\r<br>\r<br>But now we have to look at SpaceX, that got off to a small bit of a rocky start, but is now, along with the Soyuz, the most dependable human-rated spaceship on the planet. And along with the fact that SpaceX and the Soyuz in-general, along with ULA, Northrup-Grumman, Arianespace, ILS, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, ISC Kosmotras Rocket Lab, Spaceflight Industries, and Eurockot Launch Services are all leading the way in satellite and space exploration services; it&#39;s a shame there isn&#39;t one company listed by the name of NASA currently on the list.\r<br>\r<br>Additionally, with names like &quot;Jeff Bezos&quot; and his &quot;New Glenn&quot; rocket, along with Richard Branson&#39;s &quot;Virgin Galactic&quot;, which intends upon becoming the first private company to take customers to space, one begins to wonder if there&#39;s even a spot, or a need for what seems to be a nearly defunct NASA.\r<br>\r<br>I hope I&#39;m wrong, I seriously hope I&#39;m wrong... Although right now I have to admit my heart belongs to SpaceX, which is pretty much the most exciting thing going on in the realm of space exploration (who else can land a spent booster-rocket on a platform roughly 200 miles from the launch point, which is like shooting dead-center a mosquito with a needle at a distance of several hundred feet?).\r<br>\r<br>Along with the goings on at Boca Chica, SpaceX is definitely presently carrying the torch, they have been for quite some time now (let&#39;s not forget about the Falcon Heavy), and if NASA doesn&#39;t do a &quot;Headline Maker&quot; pretty soon, I&#39;m very much afraid that Kennedy Space Center may become the headquarters of SpaceX, and NASA may simply become an encyclopedia article.", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T21:53:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Daniel svedlund", "comment_text": "love that rant got it own section.. he he he", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T21:53:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maverick Dano", "comment_text": "Great job Tim!

Its easy to look at SLS with hindsight and go &quot;Yeah, how did NASA not expect private companies to do the impossible and start landing rockets back from space and bring the cost down an order of magnitude?!&quot; When in reality when SLS entered production, nobody had anything comparable in performance, or even really cost, Falcon 9 hadn&#39;t even successfully landed yet.<br><br>As it is now, it&#39;s in the unenviable position of likely being completely obsolete by the time it actually flies, but it was still the best option at the time, and is still the best option until those other options are actually flying. Hopefully once something like Starship, or New Glenn is flying, NASA kills off the SLS program in favor of those, since they&#39;re vastly more cost-effective and far less wasteful in the long run. I really hope Bridenstein and future NASA administrators realize that another NASA developed vehicle like the Saturn-V, Space Shuttle or SLS isn&#39;t viable anymore and that SLS is the last time they do this.

The fact SLS needs to use SRBs opposed to just having 5 massive engines for the first stage combined with the fact the SLS is LESS capable to me is just inexcusable.  But I am familiar with this being in the Aerospace industry where in the light general aviation field Cessna spent MORE for a far less capable aircraft (the Cessna 162 sky catcher), than they did for the venerable Cessna 150/152.  (actually the 152 is just a revamp and re-engining of the venerable Cessna 150, which had THE SAME ENGINE, Continental O-200, that decades later would power the Cessna 162).  It just seems like those at the helm of these big companies lack the common sense of seeing how when something costs more, but is less capable than an already tried and trusted design....there is something amiss.   The Orion is just baffling as well.  I totally get going for solar power opposed to power cells, but why a service module that again is less capable than the Apollo&#39;s SM?  Again, common sense would suggest the SM for a CM that is bigger and with more crew capacity would require either an SM of the same power and DV, or MORE, not less.  The lunar landers I think are the only aspect of this program that make any sense.  I LIKE the Starship, but I also like the lander that seems to only jettison two tanks....but if things were done different perhaps there would be no need to even do that.  Re-usable landers in this day and age are a must, so the fact all three are either fully or partially re-usable is a good thing to see.  But...the SLS.

Does anyone have concrete information indicating that the Transfer Element (TE) will be reused? I\u2019ve closely parsed the initial publicity text, and it only mentioned the TE being used to get the other elements to low lunar orbit. It said nothing about any rendezvous to return the ascent stage to NRHO where Orion will be waiting. One might assume the TE would be involved in the latter, but is that more than an assumption? (In the Dynetics design drop tanks are used in one direction only, and the lander gets itself back to NRHO. It\u2019s at least theoretically possible that the National Team have made a similar design choice. Though, it\u2019s not clear why such a choice would make sense for the TE, aside from eliminating the need for a rendezvous, and avoiding the need for another docking interface.) / In the case of the Blue Origin landing stage, there are indications that BO is thinking about reuse. In an interview with representatives of each team, the rep from BO said the lander would not use a \u201ccrushable\u201d design in the landing gear, since that wouldn\u2019t support reuse.", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T19:53:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Burnett", "comment_text": "Video looks great, shame you couldn&#39;t iron your t-shirt, it&#39;s letting down the whole presentation!!", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T19:52:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alex Lang", "comment_text": "Excellent, absolutely excellent!", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T19:51:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike", "comment_text": "If SpaceX had this budget, we&#39;d have a small city on the Moon!", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T19:51:31Z", "likes_count": 124}, {"comment_by": "Tim Robinson", "comment_text": "Why does the SN6.. go up at an angle?", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T19:51:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Konrad Andrag", "comment_text": "i really love how Tim is being really honest and also say why it is bad and not just going with feelings", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T19:49:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Guy Pehaim", "comment_text": "I think that the current, publicly funded NASA program is just so much space pork to maintain the manufacturers of otherwise military hardware.", "comment_date": "2020-09-13T19:48:59Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Raghav Hari Krishna", "comment_text": "I like how you have a separate section called RANT.
