I really don&#39;t have any friends, just my cat Tina, she is sweet and loving and is my best friend..My hybrid has a potential of running for 24 hours without needing to be plugged in, if gas is even needed, what about power outage or damaged charging port, (I came up with wireless charging) or vandalized charging stations,and able to change a flat tire in 30 seconds. The police and highway patrol have to buy them to keep up. I doubled the sales before the vehicle is built.. is there sensors that prevents driving off with the charging port plugged in? My job skills are mostly flooring, but my last job was being a day Porter. My hobbies are playing with my cat, and golfing at the putting green. I do trick shots for fun such as one handed behind the back. I like problem solving, how do you mix oil and water and seperated at the same time? Put it in the same container. The math division remainder fix, cut odd number in half, you have two equal parts, technically, divide each equation and add together, round up a digit, it&#39;s .5 when others give up and say something is impossible, I like to prove them wrong. I like a challenge. With an open mind and a positive attitude anything is possible. I am looking for a new job and an investor. I would like to guarantee no recalls, I really do not like back tracking.. I like to move forward, and productive. I would really like to be apart of the Tesla team. I currently live in 6812 Kittery Ave citrus heights Sacramento CA 95621 is the zipcode. I am willing to relocate. I&#39;m on Twitter @ChrisaBetz3<br>To conclude, thank you for your time.

In fact, I\u2019ve told the SpaceX team is not \u2014 it is not simply the top priority. It is the only priority.\u201d<br><br>\u00a0Well then, how does your company&#39;s &quot;only priority&quot; now involve the explosion of a fueled SN4?  Sure, there&#39;s zero connection between what&#39;s happening in Texas and what&#39;s happening at 39A, but it <b>is</b> an unwelcome distraction to blow up a SpaceX space ship just 25 hours before the public watches 2 American astronauts board another SpaceX space ship. <br><br>\u00a0It won&#39;t matter one iota once DM-2 is safely at the ISS, but this distraction could likely have been avoided by simply postponing fueled SN4 tests until next week and instead focusing on SN5 or 6. <br><br>\u00a0Yes, I&#39;m aware that SpaceX has only certain dates and times in which to do specific testing, but discretion is often the better part of valor when you run a company that depends upon both public perception and political whims, at least for now.<br><br>\u00a0This also isn&#39;t just about Public Relations.  Elon and his team have undoubtedly been nervous for the past couple of weeks as DM-2 approached.  It&#39;s even possible that Elon and other team members have missed a fair amount of sleep this week.  Well, how well do you think they are sleeping on this Friday night before the next potential DM-2 launch with the fresh image of SN4 become an instant fireball in their heads?

Can&#39;t be certain, but it seems the methane was all up under the ship due to a leak from ground services.  In any event, after the explosion starts, the ship &#39;jumps&#39; upwards as evidenced by the exterior circumference going up... but the mass at the top did not move with it.  This seems to have caused a stress overload at the top of the LOX tank, and it failed... right at the mass.  The mass now has a lot of pressure to push it up and away.  The resulting pressurized LOX being forced out the new exit on top is clearly evident, and causes SN4 to have a negative trajectory instead of &#39;launching&#39;, as it were, like SN1 did..  This in turn seems to rupture the Methane tank, which then shoots methane up into the LOX tank, which makes things even worse as the subject topples over.<br>Spectacular RUD.
