I have yet to see any information regarding the role NASA @JimBridenstine or any other government agencies (FAA) roles would be in regards to the regulation of SpaceX point to point transport. I&#39;d love to see some information regarding a plan for this and the steps the Government would want to see SpaceX take to make this a reality. This would be a great subject for me if you get another chance to talk with Jim Bridenstine. I&#39;m not sure how much would fall under the FAA and how much would fall under NASA but I&#39;m guessing a large portion of both agencies. I&#39;m guessing they would need a much more rigorous standard than just the standard Human-rating certification that are given out considering the large amount of civilians that would be traveling at any giving time. I&#39;m so excited for this opportunity in the future but at the same time I worry about it significantly. A single RUD could cripple SpaceX plans to reach Mars and further. With Elons goal in mind I feel like this direction while it does increase profits might be more risk than it is worth. I believe that it may be best to just focus on Starlink to mitigate risks and in turn Elon has a much higher chance of success in his ultimate unwavering goal to make humans a multi-planetary species.

He should be pressed, publicly, hard and repeatedly on Orion/SLS.  They are direct linear descendants of Apollo/Saturn V, with no substantially new or different technology of any significant nature.  SLS first stage is a rework of the STS External Tank &amp; SDCV, which was a rework of Saturn V.  Merely expanding the diameter to accommodate a couple more passengers and stay aloft a few days longer, is not some radical advance from Apollo.  So, Apollo/Saturn V went from final concept to launch in five years; Orion/SLS has been in the works for more than 20 years (previously named Ares V) thus far without result, and <b>nobody</b> is asking, answering or being held to account for this Highway Robbery of the Taxpayer.  Bridenstein is especially vulnerable to this question as a former Deficit Hawk in Congress.

OK..  i feel ya.. but let me give you  a little scenario to work with.     Right not currently in reality, you are on MARS!!  the once dream of earth dwelling people.  long ago, the people which resided on the planet earth drempt about life on Mars,  and now.  we are here.  Fully colonized, fully sustainable.  we created an atmosphere built cities and everything is pretty much as it was on earth...    now what?...   whats different?   the gravity?  well its been hundreds of years of life on Mars.  and Mankind has long adapted to this environment.  we no longer know the difference.   SO whats truly different?   just being here?  How has that improved our lives,  ourselves,   people still fear one another,  mankind  pretty much has remained the same,  maybe a bit worst.  since much of what exist here on Mars is what was once known as the Elite class of man.   The most wealthy , the most gifted,  what we defined as the &#39;better classes&#39;  those worthy of starting a new world.    We left the degenerates the unwanted the undesirables behind.   we&#39;ve basically milked the earth for all its resources and as the earth began to falter, we the chosen saught to start a new world without the issues of the past.   it was a sad goodbye but a necessary one.   Those who we left behind may one day join us,  should we have the need for them.   :    you see.    the problem with space travel is that man is man.  And man cannot overcome some very basic of things.  His desires his lust his greed his self glorification and above all else his vanity.      This little tale i spun is only but the tip of the iceberge when it comes to the idea of man venturing into space.    Some of you hope to find Alien Life.  even an Alien Being.   Now how do you think that would workout?   Man has a history of pure and unadulterated hate and fear.   How would man handle an alien being thats more intelligent?   Fear and hate.   What if the aliens were very tall?   Fear and Hate.    What if they were ugly?    Fear and Hate,   What if they were unimaginably beautiful?   Jealousy Envy and Hate.       Now... what if they were small?   Hate and dismissive    What if they looked exactly like us?   Suspicion and hate.    What if, they had nothing to gain from.  Hate.    You see..   the problem is us.  our ignorance,  our lack of basic social intelligence.   If we cant get it right with ourselves here on earth,  what would we gain on another world with all things being the same?     The best spaceship we have IS EARTH.   The greatest planet we could ever hope to find.. we already live on.  and we still havent goten it rite.", "comment_date": "2019-10-12T02:02:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Andrew 13579", "comment_text": "Maybe Tim will get some big contracts with the &quot;networks&quot; and go pro.

The word &quot;lame&quot; comes to mind when explaining why merely sending a capsule to the space station takes so long.  It was 98 months from Kennedy&#39;s &quot;landing a man on the moon&quot; speech to actually LANDING a man on the moon and bringing him safely home to Earth.  Now, it&#39;s also been 98 months (and counting) since retiring the Shuttle program--the most complex spacecraft ever designed and produced--to landing a man on the space station with a simple capsule.  &quot;Testing. Data. Temperature. Pressure. Development. Blah blah blah.&quot;  Please don&#39;t tell me that you think the Russian&#39;s have done anywhere&#39;s NEAR the testing, data collection, temperature and pressure analyses and CAD development with Soyuz, but you&#39;re more than willing to send Americans up and down in their funky cans.  You really think their ancient, $70MM/seat Soyuz capsule is SAFER than what Spacex has developed?  Really?  Because if you say, &quot;Well, they&#39;ve had so many successful missions with it, though,&quot; doesn&#39;t that negate the &#39;we-don&#39;t-know-what-we-don&#39;t-know-so-we-need-to-test-the-stew-out-of-it-instead-of-fly-it&#39; argument?<br><br><br>I was very critical of the slipshod safety record of the Space Shuttles and NASA&#39;s willingness to risk human life in favor of keeping an aggressive flight schedule.  But, it really seems that the pendulum has swung just as far the other way.  Unlike any other vessels, Crew Dragon has a dual landing system.  (I really doubt that the SuperDraco engines are going to be ignored as a backup emergency landing system.  Nothing wrong with it, but validating a powered landing system as primary is going to take into the next century.)  Aside from one instance of deliberately making a chute fail (probably causing the other chutes to malfunction), all other &quot;parachute-out&quot; tests have been solid.  And, none of the returning supply Dragon capsule parachutes have ever failed as far as I remember.  Let&#39;s go, NASA.
