Regarding the sandwich on Gemini 3, Mary Roach mentioned in her book &quot;Packing For Mars&quot; it was not something major except for media coverage. However, I read that some managers and congressmen got pretty upset, felt they are losing control of the astronauts so after that no more spacecraft after Molly Brown had names. Names returned during Apollo 9 when there&#39;s two different manned spacecraft flying at same time. Getting to fly on first Gemini mission was a huge plus, that program is what put US way ahead of Soviet Union (fuel cells, onboard computer, ability to change orbits, dock with other spacecraft). Gus and Young probably had to squeeze in a lot of tests during their brief flight. Besides using a name to help it be unsinkable, Gus didn&#39;t want to experience what he had on his Mercury flight.<br><br>What is amazing is John Young stayed active at NASA for decades. Rumor has it he was too outspoken after Challenger accident but he maintained astronaut status mentally and physically when others would simply retire. He was not flamboyant, and in many ways &quot;boring.&quot; I remember distinctly watching on TV the STS-1 landing where he exited Columbia with that &quot;Yeah!&quot; attitude walking all around full of excitement. Crippen said before they opened the hatch John was jumping all over inside the orbiter (unusual for this &quot;boring&quot; astronaut). Getting back to Apollo 16, Houston radioed to Young and Duke when they were on the lunar surface the Shuttle program was approved by congress. Nearly ten years later, and lots of studying and sim time, Young was able to command the first and successful STS mission.<br><br>Beside the sandwich on Gemini 3, they had Young and Duke drink a lot of orange juice on Apollo 16. While EVA, John wasn&#39;t aware audio feed to earth was hot complained about farting and other stuff, &quot;I&#39;m never going to eat another F orange again.&quot; But at that point media didn&#39;t bother to tune into the audio feed (walking on the Moon at that time was considered boring that would have low viewer readings).<br><br>Also note John Young did flight tests of the new F4 Phantom before becoming an astronaut.", "comment_date": "2018-01-07T02:29:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "sorrenable", "comment_text": "R.I.P.
