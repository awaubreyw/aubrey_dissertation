So in order for the rocket to be able to alter the trajectory as it flies towards the edge of the atmosphere,  it&#39;s easier to roll, put it in the exact zero position, make it easier for the computer to calculate.

Great stuff.  The reason the Saturn V and CSM had opposite axis was the astronauts were heads down on ascent but they would fly it &quot;heads up&quot; in space to make it easier for former test pilots to navigate.  The reason they were heads down for ascent is to put the g-forces in a positive direction, pushing them into their seats.  Positive gforces are easier to handle that the negative gforces they would experience if they were heads up.  Negative gforces force blood to your head and cause brain damage but positive push it away and you can use a g suit to compensate.", "comment_date": "2021-08-26T20:55:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "keepthefaith", "comment_text": "Just a basic orientation", "comment_date": "2021-08-22T03:12:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BigFire", "comment_text": "Meanwhile, Russian rocket FINALLY have digital flight computer so they can do a roll instead of rotating the launch table.", "comment_date": "2021-08-19T16:55:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "flippert0", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB-GKvdydho&amp;t=5m02s\">5:02</a> pardon my ignorance, but what rocket / rocket launch was that?", "comment_date": "2021-08-18T09:45:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dark Leome", "comment_text": "Spinning is so much cooler than non spinning", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T14:06:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "I Like Turtles", "comment_text": "Rocket Roll \\m/", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T19:10:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ethan jbleethan", "comment_text": "Why do they roll in space tho?", "comment_date": "2021-08-08T08:33:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "dunodisko221", "comment_text": "\u201cThe shuttle controls pitch and roll via gimballing nozzles on the solid rocket boosters\u201d<br>Wait, that\u2019s illegal", "comment_date": "2021-07-30T19:05:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roger Cimon", "comment_text": "You should have kept concentrating on the Earth curvature ( it would have been easy for me to explain it with a trajectoy line superimposed on latitude line... ) but here you started talking about this and that detail not related to the principal object of this video and that makes me believe you do not understand clearly both the original direction deviation phenomenon and the real need for roll program.

The prisms reflected infrared beams sent into the ST-124 by a theodolite stationed 700 feet away from the launch pad.

Except for the space shuttle, the roll is often not that apparent (ok, maybe it is for the F9H and D4 as well).

The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn&#39;t. By subtracting where it is from where it isn&#39;t, or where it isn&#39;t from where it is (whichever is greater), it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn&#39;t, and arriving at a position where it wasn&#39;t, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasn&#39;t, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isn&#39;t.<br><br>In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasn&#39;t, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasn&#39;t. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was.<br><br>The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn&#39;t, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn&#39;t, or vice-versa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn&#39;t be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T16:36:13Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Pawe\u0142 Cymbalista", "comment_text": "How about antares from wallops island Virginia pay load  to iss", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T16:35:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jimmy", "comment_text": "Thought the y axis was the vertical and x horizontal", "comment_date": "2019-06-19T16:31:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kascia", "comment_text": "Literally unwatchable due to a title made for preschoolers.

Two opposite rudders can do yaw or pitch control wrt. to the reference frame of the rocket by operating them together in the same direction (like the  horizontal tail rudders on an aircraft). The roll control can be done by two rudders operate &quot;against&quot; each other. Thus creating a torque by introducing a spin in the exhaust jet.

Amazing attention to details while keeping it simple at the same time! I would just add a tiny correction: In case of space shuttle, the roll after the launch is mostly due to the aerodynamic forces affecting the orbiter during the pitch. If the shuttle would to pitch tank first, more air would get between the orbiter and the tank increasing the pressure on the joints and possibly risking the integrity of the tiles. <br>As for communication, it is true that the antennas need to be pointed as best as possible, but during initial stages of the launch it is not that important because the Shuttle is near the ground. However, where it does matter is about 2 minutes before MECO, when the Shuttle is further up and downrange. This is the time when Shuttle does another roll to have the antennas pointed correctly before MECO and tank separation.<br>As for the astronauts, another important thing is the centrifugal force affecting them during the pitch. If the rocket were to both pitch and yaw, during the yaw motion astronauts would be thrown sideways, which is much less comfortable than being thrown into the seat  when only pitching.<br>These are just minor details, you did an excellent job explaining a rather difficult subject in the most fun way possible.

Then after launch when the first stage completed the roll succesfully to the left, the upper stage calculated correctly that it is only 10\u00b0 to the right from it&#39;s target direction, but it already decided on the ground that the fastest way to roll is to roll right...

The engineers doing the talks gave 2 reasons: <br>1. They were re-using old Apollo launch pad, therefore they were subjected to their limitation and needed to be able to place the vehicle at the right attitude (with the roll maneuver).<br>2. The aerodynamic engineers figured it out that there was less stress on the orbiter when it was sitting underneath the main tank during the max Q phase (maximum areodynamic pressure), this was because (as you mentioned) the thrust was directed throught the center of the mass of the entire system, therefore the orbiter was somewhat skewed with respect to the flight path.<br><br>Funny story (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s actually true, but it was stated on the aformentioned course): when Soviet launched their first and only Buran, they too did the roll maneuver. They didn&#39;t have to, because their launch pad was capable of giving the right attitude to the vehicles. So american engineers (after the collapse of the soviet union) asked russian engineers: why did you do that roll maneuver???

I understand that  SLS is not reusable and would probably have been a lot more useful if it launched in 2017 as planned but as far as I know it may allow us to go back to the moon a lot sooner than any current option. I do not think it is the best vehicle for lunar exploration but it seems like a good start. They may even start using Starship/Superheavy for lunar exploration\u2014 a task I think it would be better suited for than Mars exploration.
