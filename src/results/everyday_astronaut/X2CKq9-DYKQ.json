Personally I&#39;ve long speculated that the Buran might possibly have launched and flown right-side up instead since the placement of the main engines was in the large core-stage (similar to the ET but with engines), rather than the orbiter itself.  So perhaps the engines of the Energia main stage needed to be below the Buran shuttle during ascent to maintain similar control as the American shuttle (with its engines on the orbiter itself) I&#39;m possibly thinking!  That way in both cases the gimbaling main engines are below the large tank/central booster.
