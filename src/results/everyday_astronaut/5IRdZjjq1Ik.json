I was amazed when I heard that some US pilot ejected in an ejection seat from an Blackbird at near Mach 3 and survived healthy, while another USAF pilot ejected just above Mach 1 from a crippled F-15 and became seriously injuried, becoming physically disabled. None of both planes used nothing like an ejection capsule or anything like that. The explanation was that Mach 3 at 60,000 feet is totally different than Mach 1 at 20,000 feet. First, in the case N\u00b0 1, Mach 3 is a lower effective speed than Mach 3 at 20,000 feet. Second, the air is incredibly thinner at 60,000 feet than at 20,000 feet and even much more than at 0 feet. The density has a significant influence on the drag and thus on the effects over the human body. That is the reason why supersonic aircraft like the B-58 and the XB-70 and even B-1A were planned since the beginning with ejction capsules: they would ensure a safe supersonic ejection at low-level; their foreseen flight envelope included a large part under 40,000 feet, but SR-71 and other Blackbirds were never envisaged using those escape systems, since they were designed to be &#39;high flight birds&#39;, from the start. I believe that an ejection from a rocket zooming several Machs of airspeed through the atmosphere would have been submitted to the same principles, and North American must have envisioned that high (and REALLY high) Mach numbers would go linked to lower and lower air densities... giving an ejection seat a bit of a better chance of surviving. However, apart from the issue of the pure oxigen environment inside the capsule and the roman candles, etc; what would have concerned me most would have been the heating induced by friction on the ouside of the capsule. Now, to escape through the flames of an explosion like that of the Titan I you show as an example, is nuts. They would surely have landed on Heaven. But a LES tower ejection would have been impossible too: the blast shockwave would have destroyed the capsule even if it had been launched before the explosion had reached the top. I blieve in rocketery, every escape system is developed thinking of an imminent disaster; not when disaster is already going on, \u00b4cause disasters are split second shorter. That&#39;s the reason why sometimes these systems don&#39;t work; because you need have a minimum time for waraning the crew or relying on automatization on the triggering of the system response.<br>Paul", "comment_date": "2020-04-03T02:36:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrKiwi1960", "comment_text": "Almost as good as an ejection seat on a helicopter....", "comment_date": "2020-04-02T12:37:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kyle Betts", "comment_text": "Why doesn&#39;t NASA make indestructible space suits for their astronauts?

Pad weight is the most important thing.

By the time the tower is discarded the fuel burned to lift it far outweighs the fuel needed to lift the seats the remaining.  The real issue with ejection seats is the hazard issue. More than the ones you mentioned they have a low survival rating even in jet fighters. Lots of cases of single, bilateral, trilateral, and quadrilateral amputations. Decapitations too. But the reason to use the ejection seat was really the weight issue because the Gemini was to be the real workhorse of the Apollo program. It carried out so many mission requirements, virtually all of the Apollo mission requirements were studied with the Gemini.  They had to save weight to accomplish as much as they had to. Two men, space walk, rendezvoux, long duration. etc. See what happens to a mission when you exchange 1000 pounds of escape tower on the pad for 1000 pounds of oxygen on the pad.

First the Gemini vehicle was a spacecraft, not a capsule.  NASA went to great lengths to make that distinction; it could change orbits, maneuver in space, dock with other vehicles, etc.  The Mercury was a capsule; it could not change orbits, etc.<br><br>I was the project test engineer on Gemini for Weber Aircraft.  We were tasked to design, test and qualify it for McDonnell Aircraft (MAC) and NASA.  We, Weber Aircraft spent three years in providing an escape system that was the most sophisticated and complex system ever envisioned.  It had to provide the astronaut occupants with safe egress and recovery from (1) a pad abort condition should the booster suffer a catastrophic failure.  The system had to eject the occupants more than 500 feet away and bring them safely to earth via a personal parachute, (2) a high speed max Q condition during the boost phase, (3) a high speed Mach 4 ejection at 45,000 and (4) a high altitude ejection up to 70,000 feet.  A whole lot more than those currently in service with the F-35, F-22, F-16, F-15, B-2, etc.  Weber also provided the lightweight systems used in NASA lifting bodies M2-F2, HL-10 and X-24 in addition to those for the LLRV and LLTV ( have the filmed footage of Neil Armstrong, Joe Algranti and Stuart Present ejecting from it).<br><br>Astronaut safety was the primary concern throughout the program and every conceivable failure mode and environment was considered.  <br>Secondly, you were correct in listing the reasons for ejection seats.  Jim Chamberlain had always championed them and with good reason for the Gemini program.  The weight of an escape rocket system would have been many times that of the seats and they&#39;d have spent much fuel getting to a safe altitude where the vehicle parachutes could be relied on to affect safe recovery.<br><br>Modern ejection seats have provided a 90% safe recovery rate for the past 50 years.  And a good deal of the 10% failures are pilots delaying the decision to eject.  There were some spinal compression fractures in early Martin Baker seats before we realized the importance of keeping onset rates below 150 gs/sec.  Once that was solved there have been very few back problems due to ejections.  More than 12,000 pilots have had their lives saved by ejection seats and I think they&#39;d take exception to your comments regarding the safety and capabilities of ejection seats.<br><br>John Young and Gus Grissom were not at the Randsburg Wash facility of China Lake when the hatch problem caused only one seat to be ejected.  I was there and had Jim Lovell and Frank Borman with me.  And the seat did not &quot;blast through the hatch.&quot;  The system works like this...when either occupant pulls his ejection control handle  to fire an initiator, the hot high pressure gas is routed to both hatch actuators.  The hatch actuator initiator fires to start the hatch opening sequence.  As the hatch actuator piston moves up it releases the hatch latches and starts opening the hatch.  When the piston reaches the top of the actuator and hatch is locked in the open position, hot gas is vented off to the rocket catapult (rocat).  The catapult ignites and moves the seat up the rails.  When the seat reaches the top of the rails, the catapult is stripped off and the seat rocket is ignited.  In this instance, the o-ring on the piston failed and hot gas was vented off to <br>the rocat before the hatch was fully open.  The seat moved up the rails and struck the hatch structure.  This jammed the seat on the rails.  Both the hatch structure and the seat headrest structure sustained some damage.  The test dummy&#39;s helmet was cracked.  When we were looking at the post-test damage, Jim looked over at Frank and inquired if maybe Frank might interested in trading seats; Frank thanked him for his kind offer, but decided that he was fully satisfied with his seat.  MAC installed double o-rings on the piston and no further problems of this kind were encountered.<br><br>Since the seat is at the top of the rails when the rocket is ignited there is no flame inside the vehicle before that and no problem with oxygen environment.<br><br>While our astronauts are extremely intelligent, super test pilots and true American heroes, none of them that I&#39;m aware have any experience whatsoever in escape system design.  Several of them, including Tom S., did make derogatory comments about the Gemini seat system and that was unfortunate.  They are human just like the rest of us, but their comments should not be taken as gospel.   <br><br>Weber, MAC and NASA expended blood, sweat and tears for those three years (1962-1965) to provide our guys with the finest system available.  It&#39;s very easy 50 years later to make derogatory comments regarding why certain decisions were made, but where were you when the decision had to be made?<br><br>Thanks for letting me vent!<br><br><br>If you&#39;d like to follow my blog visit me at <a href=\"https://geminihistory.com/welcome-to-my-blog/\">https://geminihistory.com/welcome-to-my-blog/</a>", "comment_date": "2019-02-13T00:14:14Z", "likes_count": 2207}, {"comment_by": "John Thompson", "comment_text": "Great video", "comment_date": "2019-02-12T23:55:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tanner Robinson", "comment_text": "Just like aborting at 500+ MPH = Sure death.

And was any testing actually done by engineers that would actually validate the idea that the pure oxygen+ejection would actually coincide long enough for those flames to be a significant problem? The anecdotal conjecture from a pilot, though the pilots were undoubtedly very smart and well versed in the engineering behind their craft, is not always congruent with the determined findings and calculations of an engineering team. If there was engineering documents saying after that fact that in hindsight it was determined that the factors were such that it would be probably fatal, then that&#39;s something to actually consider.<br><br>I think, in reality, the risks of the oxygen are not as bad as might be suggested. In fact the case of ejecting from a tiny capsule, and being stuck inside a combusting pressure vessel, are very different situations.<br><br>For one, it&#39;s not like Apollo 1 was instantly lethal: It took some 15 seconds from first sensing the fire till the last transmission stopped, and the crew likely lived for a good while longer (The cause of death being asphyxiation from lack of oxygen, as their plastic breathing tubes had melted away). It was almost 30 seconds before pressure built up and ruptured the hull, letting in more air from outside and It was only then when the serious fires started (And while it was certainly an intense blaze, you can still see one of the astronauts paper checklists mostly intact in the capsule after the bodies were removed, and the cabin lights were still lit!)  So they had sufficient time to react to fire in the cockpit, communicate the issue, and start attempting some kind of escape before lack of air caused them to choke. The fire itself did not seem to cause serious burns until after they had passed, and they were badly burned but not incinerated. Had the hatch been able to quickly be opened as in later designs it seems they would have made it out even if it took some 15-20 seconds to get it open. It seems like the majority of the issue that caused the incident to be lethal was from the sealed nature of the Apollo capsule and the inability for the astronauts to get fresh air in time.  Thus had the fire been started by blowing the hatches without the ejection seats firing, the fire itself would no-longer be contained and probably not a significant problem; even if the crew had to crawl out. (assuming they had anywhere to crawl to of course)<br><br>Ejection seats act very fast. They work by not keeping you in the cockpit for very long at all. Fractions of a second. So the only flammable aspect would be that they had oxygen vapors on their suits?Which I imagine would burn off in a very short time indeed. It&#39;s not like they had woolen space suits, soaking up gas. They were impermeable and any flames would likely flash off whatever vapor clung to.<br><br>Second, the Apollo capsule had considerably more internal volume to fill with O2 than Gemini. This is a minor point as I think you&#39;d be well away from the capsule before the fuel was all burned off in either case.<br><br>Third, any kind of ejection at all seems like it would be taking the astronauts through at least the beginnings of a fireball of some kind from the exploding rocket. So if they weren&#39;t on fire from the oxygen vapors burning off their (hopefully flame retardant) suits, they would probably be going through a fireball regardless. NASA would not have overlooked this and thus deemed the duration of potential exposure to the combusting hypergolic fuels to be survivable.<br><br>Lastly, if they did a pad abort, I&#39;m assuming these ejection seats were so designed to allow sufficient use of a parachute, unlike Vostok. So how far are they being thrown from the ship to avoid just being near the still-massive fireball? And to avoid their parachutes from deploying in said fireball and turning to useless melting nylon slag, I&#39;m guessing a good couple hundred meters. Which means cooking up some pretty good speed. That seems to suggest that even if they were on fire and the suits had some amount of fuel to maintain that burn for some seconds, they&#39;d be under such a wind blast as to snuff out any hope of a fire sticking around for very long. <br><br>In short while maybe no-one bothered to test for Oxygen in the capsule for ejection trials, I don&#39;t think they overlooked it. I think they simply decided that it wouldn&#39;t matter what gas the cabin was filled with as it wasn&#39;t going to matter for long enough to impact survivability. Whether this is correct or not is debatable, but, even if the astronauts had been on fire as a result of the oxygen around them being on fire during ejection the duration would not have meant it was lethal, simply perhaps more unpleasant than it already was.", "comment_date": "2019-02-12T06:05:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MegaZsolti", "comment_text": "I like the name &#39;cosmonaut&#39; more than &#39;astronaut&#39;.", "comment_date": "2019-02-12T06:01:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tony Nguyen", "comment_text": "Really nutty when you think about it...", "comment_date": "2019-02-12T05:49:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Harrison Wheeler", "comment_text": "Holy Crap!
