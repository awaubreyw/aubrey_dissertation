First: Falcon Heavy to LEO is indeed 30 tonnes, because as stated in the video, we quoted fully reusable, RTLS and droneship landing. The number you see on wikipedia (63,800 kg) is fully expendable.

I swapped graphics out last minute and forgot to change the lbs conversion of OmegA. So, the kN&#39;s are still accurate but the translation to pounds is incorrect.

Later this was solved by using Helium as inert gas, which stays gaseous close to absolute zero temperatures.", "comment_date": "2020-11-29T19:14:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Syklas", "comment_text": "New Musk!", "comment_date": "2020-11-28T09:57:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tyler Pedigo", "comment_text": "Blue Origin is a joke", "comment_date": "2020-11-27T17:39:40Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Benton Bridge", "comment_text": "the rocket looks nsfw to some people", "comment_date": "2020-11-27T06:44:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Creepy Chris", "comment_text": "man these popping noises. it makes me stop everything im doing to see what is happening. gotta turn this one off coz im working \ud83d\ude02", "comment_date": "2020-11-26T10:22:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Krista Heinemann", "comment_text": "Hi Tim,<br>I love your videos!

And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T06:45:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Crugleberry and Friends", "comment_text": "Considering SpaceX has made more progress with Starship already than Blue Origin has with New Glenn, the answer is no.<br>SpaceX will dethrone themselves before they give anyone else the chance to.", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T23:32:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "walkergarya", "comment_text": "Starship will be the heavy lift king for a long time to come.

As noted, Bezos has almost unlimited funds towards whatever goals he wishes to achieve, but he doesn&#39;t have unlimited creativity and willingness to take risks to carry us forward in spaceflight. The AF passed out a bunch of dollars to replace the Atlas engine, but that rather limited the field to ULA and whatever choice they made and that was BO&#39;s BE-4 engine. That meant that BO received the majority of development dollars for their engine, which was actually behind the Raptor in design and build. Both NASA and the AF have consistently offered around 40% more dollars to whatever competitor SpaceX had, for the same deliverable. This also ignored the fact that until New Glenn starts returning mass to Earth, SpaceX rockets are the only ones that offer down mass as well as up. In other words, hundreds of experiments would not have been possible because physical results could not be returned, discounting the tiny amount of return mass for the Soyuz. More money for less capability means that NASA and the AF put their thumb on the scale for contractors of the past, even when new competitors prove their worth. This has consistently meant that contracts have been awarded on a completely uncompetitive basis and we, the taxpayers get to pay to continue to support the contractors which have failed to provide any innovation in either capability or cost from decades of cost-plus contracts. Look at the SLS and Orion. They have taken forever and are costing billions of extra bucks for capabilities that will be m\u00e1tched or surpassed by two other companies on fixed-price contracts, probably before the second SLS/Orion leaves the ground and maybe before the first.

The Soviets by comparison failed in their attempt, in a close race, at least in terms of producing a rocket capable of the feat.<br><br>In fact, the N1 rocket of the Soviets was powered by a viable rocket engine -- unlike the F1 engines of the Saturn V which blew up repeatedly on the test stand. A makeshift arrangement was installed in the Saturn V which allowed it to achieve near Earth orbit.

We all saw its mayden flight and I belive they have 2 more launches in the pipeline, one as soon as Q1 2019 but is their enough of a market for all these heavy lift rockets either online or coming online by 2021. From what I have heard we&#39;ll probably see an average of 2 FH launches per year. Especially with even larger rockets that shouldn&#39;t come too long after that of which are looking to Mars. Don&#39;t get me wrong all these rockets are awesome but is there going to be a market for all of them especially with FH and Delta 4 already flying. Now new markets could absolutely open up, possible private space stations &quot;space hotels&quot; or other ideas but is their enough interest for all these rockets. With FH being the budget heavy-lift rocket but with a minimal area in the fairing, Delta 4 being expensive but incredibly reliable, and eventually New Glenn with is huge fairing, where will Vulcan and OMEGA fit in? Theirs only so many large and heavy government or military satellites to go around which seems to be the current real heavy lift market.
