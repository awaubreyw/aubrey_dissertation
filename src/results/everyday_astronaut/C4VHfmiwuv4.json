It\u2019s true that the direct radiation from the Sun cannot reconcile measured values of global average surface temperature. THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT IS ADIABATIC HEATING IN REALITY. Adiabatic heating is the raising of T by adding work energy (N x m) without exchange of heat energy (Joules(J) which is also = N x m).\r<br>\r<br>The Sun does the work of inflating the atmosphere against the force of gravity in the same way you do physical work climbing up to the top of a cliff. On top of a cliff, you have potential energy. If you do a base jump, your potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as you fall (i.e. when you speed up). Atm pressure (caused by gravity together with the mass of the atmosphere) causes thermal (=kinetic) energy in the case of gases. \r<br>\r<br>Any volume V of any gas at pressure P has a steady and constant thermal energy P(N/m2) x V (m3) = N x m = J(Joules) = nRT as a result of this kinetic energy of its molecules. Thus for a given mole amount of gas ( n), PV/T = nR (a constant) or P1V1/T1=P2V2/T2.\r<br>\r<br>T1 =214 K +/- (Temperature from solar radiation @Tropopause)\r<br>V1/V2 = 3.3 expansion ratio of any gas from 101 to 23 Pascal (P @tropopause)\r<br>T2 = P2V2/P1V1 x T1 (above gas law solved for T2=predicted T@surface)\r<br>     = 101.3x1/(22.8 x 3.3) x 214\r<br>     = 288 K (Earth Surface, subject to minor variations +/-1 K associated with albedo and imperfect adiabatic system)\r<br>\r<br>There\u2019s thus no need and no such thing as magic power producing, entropy reducing, apocalypse causing plant food in the sky.

Thank you.<br>I agree that we need to never look at solid boosters again. Currently, our CO2 levels are over 400PPM, at average Earth temp, about 17C. Putting things into perspective, we have to remember that most life evolved, in the past 600 million years under an average temp of 20C and 5000PPM CO2. Most of this carbon has already been sequestered by the Earth and we&#39;ll never get it back. Plants die around 150PPM, so we already were facing a carbon-extinction event until the discovery of fossil fuels extraction, which set that back a few hundred million years (more plant life is good, right?)<br>Its a long road, and we&#39;ll run out of fossil fuels about the same time we replace them, as long as we let innovators like Elon Musk keep doing their thing, without slowing them down. The climate will keep changing, but if we cut off fossil fuels tomorrow, we have to realize half the world&#39;s population would starve, as they are dependent upon that energy.  That would be a lot more catastrophic than to just let Elon Musk solve it for us, in his own time. Again, we just need to keep the innovation going and it&#39;ll be a soft landing.

To a dead planet with no molten iron core.  Yeah, what&#39;s the carbon footprint for that compared to its contribution to us?  More than 80% of the World is covered by existing sats. and cable internet systems already. Starlink is not cheaper nor better because it has to link to the cable system to operate. And of the 20% of the World&#39;s surface not with internet is inhabited by the poorest of all humans who struggle every day for enough food and clean water. They can&#39;t afford $500 for a dish and $100 every month for service. That business model is fantasy too.  Starship point to point Earth travel? Compare fuel prices with existing airliner service.  What&#39;s the carbon foot print for all that?  And what will we get in return? Ask the people at the Las Vegas Loop.  Also the Starship launch bases have to be next to populated cities. What about the results of a total Starship with Booster explosion?  They have to be placed a considerable distance from any populated area probably at sea. Add the travel time from city to rocket base then do you fuel it first or board the passengers first, gases, etc.? Also each and every passenger has to have one of those fancy designer spacesuits that fit them.  Health considerations? Then the passenger if they survive at all has to take the same travel time from the landing site to the destination city, another hour or so after the change out of their space suit. Add all this reality up and you&#39;d be safer and cheaper to travel by airplane. So who will be lining up for all this when they have proven aircraft?  If one, just one Starship falters and kills, no one will fly them again or at least the investigation and corrections actually takes more than a year or two while all the Starships are grounded making no money.  I respect your enthusiasm but don&#39;t you guys think things through? And the price tag for all of this is going to be paid by whom? None of this is going to get us anywhere and don&#39;t say we need to become a &quot;spacefaring race&quot; because we didn&#39;t evolve without oxygen, proper pressure, temperature, water and the ability to sustain massive Solar flares, Coronal Mass Ejections and all the Galactic radiation.

There was a lot of talk about peak oil and of course global warming is the twin concern with fossil fuel depletion and another reason for the abandonment of fossil fuels.  There is a lot of compelling arguments for peak oil which has been a theory since 1954 but is a Malthusian concept.  Anyway my main points are this.  Peak oil proponents were constantly raising fears that the sky is falling and the end of the fossil fuel age is here approaching.  It\u2019s like an end of the world scenario and there was a site called life after the oil crash which was a very good peak oil theory site with many threads about preparing for peak oil.  But my overall experience in researching it was it was a doom and gloom fear hobby approached from a survivalist perspective which is rather naive and the \u201cscientific\u201d outlook most has was the modern world would collapse being modern society and we had to do all we could to get off oil and fossil fuels before it was to late.  And it was to late according to early and mid peak oil curves already.  The world had 750 million fossil fuel vehicles back around 2005 and there was no way electric vehicles could replace them and we were rapidly running out of oil. The USA reached peak in 1972 and we would never produce as much oil as we did back then and never be oil independent.  That was impossible.  Of course as gas prices increased in 2007 many more got on the peak oil band wagon and global warming was the environmental perspective.  But the reality was not debated in peak oil circles although there was some denying sites it was proclaimed peak oil was a fact of physics and you can\u2019t argue with Mother Nature. There were no solutions really just piecemeal solutions.  One of the chief speakers and leaders of the movement was the chief leader and founder of the post carbon institute.

What effect would Starship launches have on the air pollution index for towns or cities there are near? \u00a0<br><br>Climate scientists will typically preface when talking about CO2 that it is a very mild greenhouse gas with water vapor being a much more powerful greenhouse gas.  Water vapor overlaps the inferred blocking wave lengths of CO2 except for a small window and is some 45 times more concentrated in the atmosphere.  A note: greenhouse gases as typically discussed block inferred radiation from the earth&#39;s surface from escaping out to space.  Their interaction with solar radiation is not a big topic of popular discussion.  Water vapor and steam are invisible.  Condensing water vapor and steam appear white as seen during rocket launches. <br><br>CO2 in the atmosphere converts high energy ultraviolet solar radiation into longer wave lengths more conducive to heating the earths surface.  This is CO2&#39;s primary means of heating the earth and is thought to provide the earth with some 50\u00b0C of additional temperature.  This takes place with very low levels of CO2 at 10 - 50 ppm to reach saturation with present day concentrations being around 350 ppm and there is no ultraviolet radiation in the wave length CO2 does this conversion hitting the earth&#39;s surface.  There is a giant spike in the CO2 converted wavelengths hitting the earth&#39;s surface.  This is NOT a greenhouse gas mechanism. \u00a0<br><br>As a greenhouse gas CO2 has a natural log relationship with larger concentration having smaller effects in radiation forcing and may go hyper log rhythmic at multiples of todays concentration.  CO2&#39;s forcing effect is small at some 1.4 W/m^2 inferred energy retention predicted by an attitude of 20 km for an increase of CO2 from 250 ppm preindustrial to 350 ppm of today.

If you compare Rockets to Airliners, then you have to look on their practical and societal uses.

So just putting the different numbers up there rather becomes a part of an &quot;whataboutism&quot;, You could equally excuse <b>anything</b> with that argument that just happens in a niche, like car racing / racing cars on public streets, military emissions, etc. pp.<br>The question is not: &quot;Has this a large percentage on overall pollution?&quot; but &quot;is this additional pollution worth the purpose it serves&quot;. Almost nothing apart from general transportation, electricity generation and heating has large impacts on pollution, if singeled out - but the sum of the small niches still delivers a huge part of overall pollution. So - you just can&#39;t absolve Rockets from producing emissions by saying &quot;there are not that many of them&quot;.<br><br>If a rocket is used as travel devices for millionaires to have an exiting &quot;holiday in space&quot; than its emissions are completely avoidable - this serves virtually no benefit to society. It just would be a totally unneccessary purpose, a sign of pollution as a right to a decandent elite. This is of course also true for yachts, etc. - but this is again a whataboutism and would do nothing to justify Spaceflight as a thrillride for millionaires. E.g.

The genesis of modern rocketry (all advanced scientific industry, actually) is political. Anything extraneous to survival is by definition political in nature. The issue, from my perspective, is people&#39;s choice to eschew Politics while fully participating in politics. politics is popularity and status signalling, while Politics is prioritization of public policy initiatives. It is an intellectual ouroboros. Abdicating participation in Politics is willfully surrendering personal sovereignty. If one wishes to be led fully and disallowed from questioning things, then avoid Politics by all means. But don&#39;t expect to get a seat at the table of Power, likewise have a say in Process, if you can&#39;t be bothered with participation. Democracy doesn&#39;t work because the choice to participate is voluntary, meaning that it will always devolve into regulatory capture and influence peddling. People&#39;s reluctance to take consistent, principled stances is why we have a ~90% congressional recidivism rate and a &lt;20% congressional approval rate. This is one of the biggest reasons behind why SLS is a complete waste. If we want to be a space fairing civilization, we either need &gt;90% full political stack participation, or a monarchy/dictatorship. The sole reason, underneath all other factors, that we have a civilian space program at all is excess capital.

Some very efficient diesel engines are two stroke, don&#39;t demonize the two stroke cycle.

And that is that CO2 is NOT a problem. \r<br>The Earth has been around for billions of years. Life has been around for a long time too. And for MOST of the time that there has been life on the planet CO2 levels were MUCH higher than they are now not by percentages but by multiples. \r<br>In fact we are at a level of CO2 now that is dangerously low for life. We went so low in previous ice ages that all life was almost terminated on earth. This is because so much of the Carbon necessary for life over time has been trapped and during previous ice ages the levels almost dropped below the level necessary for plant life.. Certain forms of life like Shelfish for instance have learned to use CO2 in their shells, and when these organizms die, they trap this CO2 which over time is buried and sinks to lower and lower stratifications in the earths layers. This is actually where a lot of fossil fuel comes from in the first place..\r<br>Burning of fossil fuels actually re-introduces this CO2 back into the eco-system and the CO2 starved plants are very thankful indeed, even tho for the most part, even with rockets, we only produce a small fraction of CO2 compared to Nature. The fear of some scientists is that without man, so much CO2 would be trapped in time that a subsequent ice age would do what the last one failed to do, basically wipe out all life due to hyper low CO2 levels.\r<br>Ideally our CO2 levels would be 4 to 6 times higher than they are now. Plants life would be much healthier and larger, food much easier to produce. Animals much easier to feed. \r<br>And when these more typical conditions existed in the past, there was no negative effect from a climate standpoint because of the way the entire system regulates itself, which is far more complex than current infantile models show. In fact most of the models are designed to prove a theory, rather than to expose a truth, but I digress.\r<br>There is also no CO2 emergency now, unless you consider historically low levels of CO2 a hardship. Our earths history makes this truth self evident. Man just looks at the blink he exists in, and calls THIS moment normal, and anything outside of it catastrophic. This is an understandable, but flawed approach. Science should not assume. All times and all conditions are relevant evidence here. \r<br>We are recovering from Ice ages. Of course glaciers may recede over time, and CO2 will increase, with us or without us. Temperature will also increase, very slowly. I&#39;m talking thousands of years.\r<br>And believe me, this is the right direction and the right speed. We are fortunate to be in the position we are now, where CO2 and temperature are on the uptick. Both of these will actually be a net gain for life on earth. For each area they say might turn into a desert, that probably already is close, we will open 4X as much temperate zones for food production and living comfortably.. \r<br>And with the self regulation of the weather Hot areas tend to cool themselves, and Cool areas tend to warm themselves. Clouds and water vapor work to negate extremes and balance temperatures quite well. \r<br>Also consider that much of our current severe weather systems are based on cooler northern air (or southern if you live in Australia) coming down towards the equator. Far from there being more storms in the future, the evening of world temperatures into  less extremes would mean less violent storms across different climactic areas. \r<br>This is the earth returning towards what is more normal, warmer temperatures, and sufficient CO2. And we will be fine, the earth has gone thru this cycle countless times before. Rather than making models to predict what high CO2 would look like, perhaps the scientists could look at the past. The life then didn&#39;t seem to mind. All signs are of abundance that far exceeds anything we enjoy today. One of the reasons everything was much larger. Fauna and Flora are small and sickly compared to the animals of other eras that were not gas starved. \r<br>Rockets should hopefully be as efficient as possible, and limit pollutants, but of all the emissions they make, CO2, despite popular opinion, is the least worry of all. CO2 is the gas of life. A noble gas that we benefit from and that is necessary for the creation of oxygen via photosynthesis. Even concerns of radiative forcing usually do not consider that although less energy is allowed to leave the atmosphere, less energy is also absorbed from the sun in the first place because the effect works BOTH ways, not just ONE way. The earth never burned up before when we had levels in the thousands of parts per million (we are in the hundreds of parts per million now), and it won&#39;t burn up this time. \r<br>Plants and animals will be more disease free and healthier. We do not realize it because this is the era we exist in but we are starved for oxygen and CO2 and a move towards more of those gasses and further from an Ice age, is the best possible scenario. I have even heard serious scientists say that far into the future we may actually have to harvest more CO2 from Shale fields etc. whether thru combustion (which by then would probably an archaic form of energy), or chemical process to purposefully add CO2 to the atmosphere because of the trapping effect. I don&#39;t think it will come to that point however in the foreseeable future, especially when people are taught incorrectly the CO2 poses a great danger.\r<br>If they taught this properly, this would not be a controversial idea, and the evidence is easy to find. But because it is political, these ideas are almost never spoken, which is why many internet cowboys will now claim I am lying, without even bothering to research anything at all, or look at different eras of the Earths history when CO2 levels were in the thousands, life was abundant, and the climate was wonderful.  \r<br>Databyter", "comment_date": "2020-06-08T11:30:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Craig Penfold", "comment_text": "Bezos?

You&#39;ve been a crucial voice in educating the public about our space programs and you do so with a positive attitude.  I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll get too much flack for mentioning the environment, it&#39;s very important.  On the conservative end of things, I think what they often don&#39;t like is being spoken down to if they disagree with a climate change solution or prediction but liberals also have their own concerns about being poked at an immature fashion.  Both the right and left seem to bicker back and forth on this topic.  With that said, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve gained support from everyday people who have a wide range of beliefs because you&#39;ve stayed apolitical from what I can see.  I probably follow politics as closely as you follow Spacex so I know from experience what happens when people with clashing beliefs don&#39;t get along. <br> <br>You spoke about how you don&#39;t agree that NASA and SpaceX should be in competition with each other.  That mentality of them VS. us is far worse when it comes to politics which is why I get saddened when those who advocate for our space programs get too aggressive with going after the beliefs of those who have a different set of values or when they get too aggressive with going after major political figures.  I worry about that because it divides their supporters along ideological lines and I think it&#39;s so important that the public is educated on matters of science.  I think Bill Nye has made that mistake along with Astrophysicist Robert Zubrin, both of whom I think are valuable to the scientific community but who have pushed some of their followers away.  I know this by speaking to and looking at the comments of some of their followers.  <br>It&#39;s my belief that as scientists or science enthusiasts, we should be pragmatic in our approach to learning or teaching.  Elon Musk has been fantastic in this regard, he does occasionally make public statements that stir the pot but he&#39;s willing to speak to people on both sides of the political aisle.  He&#39;s obviously not on the political left or on the right.   Personally, I&#39;m more conservative so it excites me to see conservative politicians fighting to fund NASA and supporting SpaceX but I can also appreciate when a typically left-leaning news network gives a lot of coverage to developments with SpaceX and NASA.  We should be coming together to fight for these programs and thankfully support is coming from multiple directions right now. <br>The only thing I have to say as a conservative is that there are a LOT of us interested in science, SpaceX and NASA just as with liberals who are interested.  You&#39;ve done amazing at keeping a positive and inclusive spirit.  Not only is that important in regards to race and sex, it can be important on political matters as well.  NEVER let that die because it&#39;s too rare.  We all have our opinions and the right to express them but when there are divisive comments or a singling out of the mistakes made by one group over another, it can be off-putting and steer so many people away from what are good causes. This is especially true on matters of science, personally, I believe they should be separated from political biases as much as possible.<br>  <br>I may try to see if you have a public email to get this message to you because I&#39;m not sure at this point that you&#39;d get to reading this comment given that this video alone has well over 2000 of them, lol.  Thanks for engaging the public and putting so much effort into these videos.

Ozone or Ozone depleating is in fact critical. But keep in mind that ozone is produced out of O2, which is very abondoned in the atmosphere (20 %). Ozone not only plays an inportant role in filtering high energy radiation, it is also important to sustain the 3 lower layers of the atmosphere, where the troposphere is the lowest. The troposphere is very critical for containing the convection below 7-15 km and therefore conserve the heat where it&#39;s needed. It therefore can be said, that ozone is not only a filter of dangerous radiation, it&#39;s also the one and only greenhouse gas there is. Water vapor plays a regulating role, due to the fact that it&#39;s the only atmospheric gas that is able to condensate and form clouds. Water vapotr and aerosoles in the stratosphere are critical, aswell as Ozone depleating gasses. CO2 is not a factor in the complete atmosphere, it even doesn&#39;t block the radiation in the 15 micrometer band (radiation window). The same is true for water vapor, although it strongly absorbs in this band.<br><br>The real question here is: how many aerosoles and water vapor are injected into the stratosphere, because that&#39;s the layer where the ozone layer is located at and that&#39;s the place on which tropospheric convection depends on. <br>Aerosoles in the troposphere get cleaned out by condensed water and will be carried back to the ground, so they are not harmful.<br><br>I did not get busy with the mesosphere and the thermosphere, but these seem not to play a big role in the earths climate.<br><br>The radiation equilibrium is neither influenced by CO2 nor by H2O. These gasses simply scatter and therefore delay radiation cooling. The way more imporant part is taken by Ozone and it&#39;s resulting tropospheric convection.<br><br>This is not political.

More specifically:<br>1. Have a stationary tube with a super-orbital speed rotor inside.<br>2. Wraps around the planet.  Preferably around the equator, but could be at any inclination.<br>3. Heavy use of magnets and superconductors to both operate (such as levitating the rotor in the ring), to maximize performance of electromagnets, and ship massive amounts of power around the ring.<br>4. Suspend high voltage direct current (HVDC) high temperature superconducting (HTSC) power line in the shadow of the ring to distribute power around the ring.<br>5. Put a maglev track on top, probably similar to a Japanese maglev train where the electromagnets are on the sides, providing more room for movement.<br>6. Placed at an altitude of 80km with the super-orbital speed rotor keeping it up through centripetal force.  A particular notion on this is to have the rotor going at say 15 km/s so in case the ring catastrophically fails, the rotor will fly off into deep space while the rest of the ring could parachute back to Earth.<br>7. Tethered to the Earth inverted suspension bridge style and have the tether lines group up say 20 km in altitude before the bundle makes it the rest of the way to the surface.  Also have these anchor points to the Earth say 20 km apart so there is room for redundant cross hatching of tether lines to the ring.<br>8. The ring and rotor are made from mass produced segments.  At this the tube could have rolling O-rings at the junction points, an outer seal, and if build on Earth, anti-barnacle paint for being suspended in the ocean below the surface before raising to the operating altitude.<br>9. Various passive and active stabilization mechanisms such as guy wires at harmonic nodes, tensioners, etc, to dampen out vibrations.<br>10. For high capacity to and from the ring, use inflatable towers with vertical tracks on them.<br>11. For both always there power and high capacity power, use a combination of solar panels hanging off of the sides of the ring, conventional power lines running vertical up to the ring from the ground, the HVDC HTSC power line mentioned in #4, and orbiting power satellites beaming power to the ring, launched from the ring.<br>12. For the vehicles transiting the ring, use a two part cart that is always in the track and the space vehicle mounted on it.  Use maglev train style acceleration with superconductors to get up 0G (orbital speed), flip over, and continue to accelerate until reaching the desired speed to be flung off into space.  Use a small kick motor to make the final orbital adjustments and to fly back to the ring if desired.  The notion being without exceeding an additional 1G on your body, anywhere in the Earth - Moon system can be reached and can go to Earth - Sun Lagrange points.<br>13. For the return trip to the ring, use regenerative breaking to slow down, potentially using that power for more launches.  This can be especially handy if you have say &#39;ringmax&#39; (space version of panamax) nuclear propulsed ships releasing their &#39;containers&#39; (space vehicles) while approaching the moon in a free lunar return trajectory, then swings around to the Earth - Moon L2 Lagrange point to pick up more &#39;containers&#39; to carry out to deep space, say to the asteroid belt for large scale mining operations or Mars for a fast &quot;cruise ship&quot; run or even to some place in the outer solar system such as Titan for hydrocarbons or swoop through the outer atmosphere of a gas giant collecting up that o so rare on Earth helium.  This way a nuclear propelled ship never uses its nuclear drive closer to Earth than the Earth - Moon L2 Lagrange point, which should be a safe enough distance to not harm Earth&#39;s biosphere and the ring acts as a conveyor belt of sorts to mass move materials from such a nuclear propulsed ship.  Even the original project Orion ships would be a vast improvement over chemical rockets in deep space and this would mean a ship like this could finally be used safely as the ring pushes the closest point such a ship needs to get to Earth pretty far away.<br>13. The materials for a ring like this already exist on Earth in the quantities needed as one of the beauties of a ring structure is they already exist around other planets without needing any special materials and an artificial Earth based one would only need materials already in industrial scale commercial use (though some of the materials would need to have their production rates ramped up for the construction of the ring).  However if space mining operations are already happening due to say the BFR rocket, could potentially source some of the materials from space or possibly get space manufacturing up high enough to build the whole ring in space.  So there are potential options to either build this in space and attach to the ground or build on the ground and have it move itself to the operating altitude.<br><br>The notion for building such a ring structure goes along the lines of the SpaceX Starship / Superheavy and Blue Origin New Glen rockets are really opening up space and we want / need to go to the next level.  Especially if we want to do things like send enough solar shading satellites to the Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point to halt global warming in its tracks while we work on longer term solutions, do large scale space based mining, large scale solar power satellites, and especially want to get to Jeff Bezos&#39; vision of moving industry into space and turning Earth into one big residential zone / becoming a true space fairing civilization in general, you just can&#39;t do that with rockets as you are finding out.  The only structure I have come up with that can potentially ramp up to this scale is the launch ring built more or less to how I specify here, which should scale up to terawatt scale electrical power, numerous vehicles getting on and off the ring every second weighing in the 100+ tonne scale per vehicle, chemical propulsion in near Earth space used to the smallest degree possible with the ring doing the heavy lifting (and it seems you have pinned down the best fuels for this), maglev tracks on the Moon, say on Olympus Mons on Mars (pokes above the atmosphere, which is handy for high speed surface launch and landing travel), and other low gravity, no atmosphere moons and dwarf planets.  The Orbital Launch Ring, a literal maglev railway to and from space, is the real missing piece to having a future more like in the Expanse, not a radically new nuclear powered engine, though I suppose a better fusion drive engine would be a big step up from say the Project Orion nuclear pulse designs.  (Plus using water for oxygen would make more sense if you just fused the hydrogen byproduct for both energy and propulsion.)<br><br>So what do you think about this proposal and are you up for doing calculations on its feasibility when scaling up to say airliner scale travel?", "comment_date": "2020-03-27T16:37:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FunBotan", "comment_text": "There are also spent stages and stuff that burn down on reentry.

This is before any data is looked at and it would wasted on them anyway.   Then they bring in their &#39;climate Scientists&quot; to supply the data to support their conclusion.  Very Scientific. <br>2) In the 1990 report, they project the global temperature would rise by 7.5 C  and sea level would rise by 25 feet.   wildly inaccurate.<br>3) In the 1995 report, they doubled down by making the head of the science data section a guy named Michael Mann who created the &#39;hockey stick&#39; used a the basis of the models and science in the report.  This is the man who refused to let other scientists review his methods.  It was shown he manufactured the data needed for the curve from faulty statistics and tacked on unrelated data to made the curve.  He has sn=ince been drop from the gods of climate science.  Oh, IPPC still showed that same curve in 2015 reoport.<br>4) In the 1995 report, some where around page 952 of the report is the statement the computer models of climate prediction are impossible because climate in a closed loop non-linear chaotic system.  There is an excellent presentation by a world renowned mathematician who showed that because of the size and number of weather parameters needed to make an accurate model the model will always crash since it is a model make of definite formulas and nature is a continuum.  <br>5) In the 2015 report,  their project global temperature rise is between 1.5 and 3.5 C amazing only a 300% error range that&#39;s what I call hit it on the head.<br>6) I point you to Patrick Moore, a former Green Peace founder, look him up in you tube, he has many wondrous things to say about the IPPC and Green Peace and the utter junk science they profess.  As to junk science, google Steve Millory, he has debunk many of the EPA, NOAA and IPPC statements and reports.<br>7) To get a calm view try Tony Heller on you tube is an excellent and experience scientists who regularly takes NOAA and IPCC for false and misleading statement to push what is a socialist agenda. <br>Hope this helps.", "comment_date": "2020-03-24T01:34:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Razzz I The Razzzones", "comment_text": "Absolute amazing work!

In the last 70&#39;s we conducted studies in augmenting the level of CO2 in greenhouses and discovered that increasing CO2 above 1,200ppm (four times today&#39;s levels) you received increase growth, reduction in water, fertilizer, pesticide, fungicide requirements. Many of today&#39;s industrial hydroponic greenhouse and cannabis production facilities use very high CO2 levels. cannabis has been grown at levels as high as 10,000 ppm with remarkable results in growth, flowering and overall production (toxic level for humans). <br><br><br><br>NASA discovered that in the Midwest Corn and Soybeans fields are massive CO2 sinks. By late afternoon,  CO2 can plummet to  200PPM or less, during the night the CO2 levels begin to rise again back to the current 390 PPM or so. In fact Rain forests contribute little to reductions of CO2, but are major producers of Methane due to the rapidly decaying vegetable matter. If you are bent on reducing atmospheric CO2, the best things would be to cut down the Rain forest and plant soybeans, agricultural crops absorb massive amounts of CO2 and emit little methane (which is by far a gas of greater concern). The problem we have on this planet is that we are actually in a CO2 drought. Vast quantities of CO2 have been locked up in fossil fuels and limestone. To feed a hungry planet, especially the push to move away from eating meats which are the product of low quality food stocks, to a plant-based diet, will entail massive amounts of fertilizer, water and pesticides or increase CO2 levels to 1,200 ppm or high world wide. These level are not harmful to animal life. <br><br>CO2 is an interesting molecule in that its a reverse exponential molecule.  The higher the concentration,  the less the effect observed. So if you have 600 ppm the &quot;green house&quot; effect will not be twice the effect of 300 ppm but substantially less. <br><br>If you want to talk about Climate Change, you have to have a very broad ranging discussion of Orbital mechanics (Milankovitch cycles), Ocean currents, plate tectonics, Solar Output etc. Climate is the result of many factors outside the influence of human activity. <br><br>For example in the 11Th century the Norse men were able to travel from their homelands west ward to Alaska and the Russian coast maybe even circumnavigating the arctic. There was little if any sea ice, no glaciation on Greenland and the weather allowed Farming in Greenland.<br>All this was the result of natural forces.<br><br>By the 1,300 the Greenland settlements were abandoned and the Norse were intermarrying the Saxon population of Britain. A few hundred years later the Europe sailors were searching for the famed Northwest Passage which was then blocked by sea ice.<br>Climate change is real but there is nothing we can do about it or should try to do about it.

I use standard industry practice, which has almost a century of experience making paper product production cheaper and more volume oriented. One day some researcher in a lab in Florida gets paid 20k by the EPA to prove that my use of lignin solvents is hazardous to ozone. (In reality, century lows in solar activity and decreased sunspots lowered the near band UV radiation, the leading factor in UV production, which is self regulating, because the more UV, the more ozone is produced to block that UV). Now understand that ozone is highly volatile, almost anything can cause it to break down in a lab. So I get a call from a federal review board saying that they will tax 15% on all my production volume that uses that particular solvent. Ok, not so bad, you could argue that my lignin solvent is pretty nasty stuff, and should be phased out. Well now I&#39;m faced with an increase in retail price of about $1.20 per 12 rolls. A herd of hippie college grads with art majors and no knowledge of reality swarm my product online, and shame customers from my company even though literally every brand uses the same process. So I pay some geek out of environmental engineering school to figure out a more environmentally friendly alternative for my solvent. Turns out the tissue industry already has one, so I spend 500 million dollars across my 12 billion a year manufacturing chain to change solvents. Well now my tp costs $7 per unit instead of $5 per unit, but in a more environmentally conscious age, maybe the public will accept this. Nope, some Chinese competitor I&#39;ve never heard of starts using my previous solvent, charges $6 per roll, and dumps all their used solvents into a lake. They steal all my business, and the planet is way worse off. <br><br><br>This is a fictitious scenario, but it happens all the time in nearly every industry field that is taxed by the EPA for carbon emissions, hazardous wastes etc. The fact is that until nations like China are internationally boycotted for their terrible practices, child slave labor, and horrendous emissions, all this will continue. Because a bunch of hippie college grads with no reality experience, who live in an incredibly safe, privileged, and environmentally conscious nation, will always use real problems to justify their uneducated opinions, turning off real decision makers from addressing the real problems, because there will always be an echo chamber media to support them. I know I sound harsh, but if the problems of climate change are as bad as some would have us believe, (and some are, no dispute) children (both young and old) need to shut up, and learn real facts before cramming false ones down everyone&#39;s throat.", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T19:57:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lone Rider", "comment_text": "For more people to understand this make a summarized version around 10 min long", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T19:55:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SergKiev87", "comment_text": "Is running fuel rich a problem?

This means all those photovoltaic panels from the first mission can be reused for the second, third, and so-on. Even so, it doesn&#39;t make sense to ship several tonnes of PV panels there, and then mothball them between missions. It may be more sensible to take advantage of other resources we know are already there. Martian regolith is high in iron and presumably also aluminium, much as is the case on Earth (our planet&#39;s crust is 5% iron and 8% aluminium) and either of these can be used to produce mirrors capable of reflecting light onto PV panels, increasing the amount of energy they produce. Even considering the loss of solar energy due to much of it being reflected rather than direct, the fact that the mirrors will be little more than rigid sheets of metal makes them potentially much simpler to produce - a definite advantage under the circumstances. It would require the first landing site to be chosen based on the metal content of the local regolith, and for either the first or second rockets to bring both a metal refinery and CO2 splitting facility (both aluminium and iron refining require carbon). Aluminium production would have the added advantage of also producing oxygen as a waste product. The crew of subsequent rockets could then assemble the mirrors when they arrive, increasing the available energy for things like food production. The ability to produce a stock of metals on-site will also be an advantage if the goal is to create a permanent settlement.<br><br><br>Re long-haul routes: one of the reasons airliners have historically not done many direct flights over really long distances, but instead usually stop at intermediate airports like Dubai or Hong Kong, is that beyond a certain distance (somewhere around 5000 km IIRC) the amount of fuel needed starts climbing really rapidly. This is because the largest chunk of fuel used by an airliner is the same as for a rocket: takeoff and landing. The longer the flight, the more fuel - for both engines and passengers - you need to keep going once you&#39;re up in the air. More fuel means a heavier takeoff weight, which increases fuel needed for takeoff, which further increases the weight of the plane. This feedback loop creates an exponential increase in the amount of fuel required for distances beyond about 6-7,000km, so airlines have long reduced their long-haul fuel bill significantly by refueling at intermediate airports. With all but the wealthiest passengers more sensitive to price than creature comforts, it is well worth the increase in transit time.<br><br><br>However there is an ongoing shift towards non-stop flights over really long distances, where the higher prices may be worth it for the convenience. This means P2P may be able to compete if the balance of price and convenience works. Even if rockets do use more fuel, that will be at least partly offset by massively reduced staff costs. the combination of shorter flight times and not serving food means the ratio of cabin-crew man-hours to passengers on Starship will be much, much lower than on a very long-haul airline route.", "comment_date": "2020-03-22T14:52:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Zhu Bajie", "comment_text": "Glad you enjoyed the Rocket Garden.

If you use the wood from the tree to build something, then you&#39;re delaying the release of the CO2 until the thing you built reaches the end of it&#39;s life and decomposes.   The ONLY way for trees to be a net help is if you bury the dead tree in an anoxic environment so it doesn&#39;t decompose (and eventually becomes coal - which we must promise not to dig up and burn.   You can do better by planting a self-sustaining forest - then as one tree dies, another grows to take it&#39;s place.

An average adult tree with a 50cm diameter trunk weighs between 1 and 3 tonnes...most of which is carbohydrates - which are mostly carbon, oxygen and hydrogen (from the water it absorbs).

Elon used the booster for that, not sure that an starship loaded with 400 passengers (around 50 tons of payload) could reach very far being reusable. I don&#39;t know, I am asking.<br>2-Water vapor is not even comparable with co2, it is a more potent greenhouse gas, but it last only from days to few months (depending the altitude) vs hundreds of years of co2, then we also consider that most of the emissions happen at lower altitude instead at higher altitude.<br>3- Electrolysis does not consume much energy, today electrolysers are at 90% efficiency, current liquefaction plants are at 70% efficiency, but just scaling up (which you need to make rocket fuel) you can have a plant with 85% of efficiency.  One more case, you need to store solar and wind energy one way on another into hydrogen to solve the seasonal disparities and to clean the other 50% of global co2 emissions that came from the utility transport sector and the natural gas grid, those thing can not be solved with batteries (is not practical neither cost efficient). <br>4-You mention how many football fields of solar panels are needed to make enough fuel for the starship on mars, but you did not mention how much time it would require to fill those, is not the same that amount of panels to refill a starship every 1 month than every 2 years.", "comment_date": "2020-03-21T00:45:47Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Steven Williams", "comment_text": "This makes me curious what would be the cost/benefit ratio of resto-moding old cars to buying a new one?", "comment_date": "2020-03-21T00:44:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nitehawk86", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4VHfmiwuv4&amp;t=6m20s\">6:20</a> Well, comments sections tend to be pretty freaking stupid.", "comment_date": "2020-03-21T00:44:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Whole Nuts And Donuts", "comment_text": "Dude you crazy.
