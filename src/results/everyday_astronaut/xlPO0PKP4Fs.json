[{"comment_by": "Mark Weber", "comment_text": "After reading some of the moonwalker&#39;s books it sounds like the legs collapsed about as much as expected but do to Apollo 11&#39;s gentle touch down not as much as the others. And being the first to land on the moon had no other data to compare it to. As mentioned the landing speed and lunar surface itself all played a part in the final collapse. In zero-G it was not a real risk that they would not be able to hop up to the first step. It was just a little extra effort but nothing unexpected. And NASA being smart had the first on the surface test it to be sure. Jim Irwin struggled a bit because Falcon landed on the edge of a crater and the LM was at a slight angle at final rest, which left the ladder leg uneven. It was interesting to read about in Dave Scott&#39;s book.", "comment_date": "2022-08-26T19:15:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marvin Sannes", "comment_text": "All that tech worked perfectly 6 times.

That is why on ships, in submarines (where I worked for more than 30 years), at factories and so on, you can see the sign &quot;Safety First!&quot; And there always is a technical commission that decides if a vehicle, building or whatever complies with safety rules. If not, none of a technical commission will sign documents allowing this vehicle or whatever to be used as a working one. Safety first! Anything else doesn&#39;t matter. American Institute of Ladders  states: &quot;Always maintain a 3-point (two hands and a foot, or two feet and a hand) contact on the\u00a0ladder\u00a0when climbing. Keep your body near the middle of the step and always face the\u00a0ladder\u00a0while climbing.&quot; None of a working vehicle can be allowed to work if there are such gross violations of safety rules. Such a ridiculous ladder was made intentionally so that people when they see how easy astronauts get the ladder at 1/6 G in the movie can believe that the movie is going on on the Moon. If you are wearing rubber gloves and a space suit highly pressurised in vacuum, you cannot grab firmly onto the ladder. You cannot raise you foot up 75 centimetres, for even without a spacesuit one cannot do that.

An average human walking speed is 1.4 meters per second, an average airplane landing vertical speed is 2m/sec.

But I don&#39;t think they have an answer for the moon buggy which explored the surface with the astronauts onboard. <br><br>let me go back to the basics first. The moon&#39;s gravitational force is just 1/6th that of the earth. That means if &quot;g&quot; is the earth gravitational force which is roughly equal to 9.8 N , and that of moon will be 9.8/6 (you should do your own math here to find the lunar &quot;g&quot;) . For the sake of convenience , we&#39;ll take &quot;g&quot; = 10 N(earth&#39;s gravitational constant) ; As such if we could lift  6kg on earth, a man on the moon could lift 60 kg since g(moon) = 1/6th g of earth. If it&#39;s 60kg on earth, it&#39;d be 360 kg on the moon and so on. <br>Back to my findings or observation that originated in my tiny brain =^_^=<br><br>you might have seen the lunar buggy that rolled on the surface of the moon carrying Armstrong and Aldrin. (Actually the astronauts from Apollo -11 till Apollo -17 had an opportunity to do offloading on the lunar surface [May be on the cold nevada desert, who knows]  But let&#39;s say they did drive those buggies on the moon) . <br>Reference #1 : If you have noticed the way they do 4/4 &quot;Toyota land cruiser&quot; safari on the earthly bound middle eastern deserts , you might have noticed the sand being thrown away tangentially (parabolic shape) from the tires of the vehicle in the  rearward direction (Let&#39;s neglect the air drag here) and the time taken for the sand granules that falls back on the desert  surface again(may be seconds we can  say , plus we should not forget that the earth has a gravitational force and attracts every objects towards its center, thanks to Sir Issac Newton &#39; <br>If you notice the sand which being thrown away tangentially in the rearward direction from the moon buggy wheels, and compare the two footage, it takes the same time period. Had it been on the lunar surface  and if the so called moon&#39;s gravitational force is 1/6th that of our planet earth, it should have taken more time and traced a larger parabolic shape before it falls down on the ground. Both cases , the wheels of the vehicles should displace from the original position and the sand would fall back on the initial position of the wheels (again we&#39;ll neglect the side ways thrown away sand here for the sake of convenience) with an exception that , the lunar sand thus thrown back would have fallen back after a considerable time gap as that of the &quot;Toyota land cruiser&quot; somewhere back on the desert in the middle east. <br>&quot;Houston, we have a problem!&quot; . You&#39;ve got to be kidding me , It doesn&#39;t fit in to my tiny head. So I put that in italics here.

I also know the moon&#39;s gravity isn&#39;t so low as to invoke cartoons walking on their fingertips, but it seems like in low-g environments it seems like you&#39;d want footing for stability, and grasping for assent. Which is more what one experiences while rope-climbing, or cargo-net climbing, and less like ladder or step climbing. This kind of rigging would also be adjustable to multiple landing inclinations and conditions. Also with such a construct, the emergency backup plan of the second astronaut attempting rescue &amp; pulling you back aboard if you are incapacitated uses the exact same equipment. (Because good luck getting an astronaut to fireman carry another one up and down a ladder in those big fat bolted-on spacesuits even in low gravity. They were practically so top-heavy they were trip-falling even without carrying one another. So if one miscalculated his strength or lost balance while attempting to carry another on board the incapacitated astronaut becomes an accidental battle-ram against a craft so fragile they were afraid they were going to kick a hole in it whenever they fall asleep! So it seems way better to tie-up a distressed astronaut and pull them back aboard after climbing up ahead, especially if its doubtful if the ladder system could carry two astronauts at the same time if the weight-saving design constraints were limited to one at a time procedure, and you can only do something like that with a rigging type for egress and ingress.) <br><br>I think if we had used the lamb system for many dozens of manned trips to the moon instead of the handful we had, some of it&#39;s speedy design concessions to get us to the moon first would have likely been some of the very same things that got someone killed on the moon. An increasing awareness of the flaws in that system, combined with an increasing awareness of just how dangerous the environment of space was beyond earth&#39;s magnetosphere, &amp; just how lucky many of the Apollo missions were in the estimation of the insiders working on the program contributed to the cancelation of the American moon program, every bit as much as the Soviet withdraw from its lunar ambitions, and later its economic/political collapse, because Uncle Sam doesn&#39;t really want a system that relies too much on skill of the best of the best on the luckiest days of their lives, it wants systems that it can deploy at increasing scale with increasing frequency at reliable performance metrics across battalions made of people of average luck, and adequate skill because its along those later parameters it can run projections on its strategic interests, militarily, economically, and so on. Anything that stays at 2 failures in 100 is going to remain only an experimental level of interests gaining and loosing funding on the ever changing political whims of congress. Ideally, what they want are failure rates that are statically negligible which is much less than 1 percent of the time. Neither the Apollo or the Shuttle program managed this, but whichever system is the first to break from that pattern in a big way is going to be the one that resets the pace of space exploration for humanity.", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T05:25:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Alfa Won", "comment_text": "The answer is around the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlPO0PKP4Fs&amp;t=7m30s\">7:30</a> min mark", "comment_date": "2019-07-21T05:06:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Emert", "comment_text": "Excellent explanation.

A hinged ladder would still have failed if the feet penetrated as much as anticipated. You would not have been able to unfold the ladder and it would now have to contend with bending forces it was not designed for when the astronauts stepped on it. The picture of the russian lander there looks orders of magnitude heavier than the apollo lander, so don&#39;t forget everything on the apollo was engineered to just about do a job and not be any heavier than needed. The russian lander was never tested of course.<br>A telescoping ladder, with adjustable length between each rung, would have worked, though of course that&#39;s now more to go wrong and muscle memory from training could lead to incidents with the astronauts using it. Another option would be a solid, set length ladder that could be slid down the leg in runners as needed, and additional rung sections stored inside the LEM and bolted into place as needed upon exit. Again though, its possible additional weight.

Then there are those color pictures taken with a camera which would not have ever worked in those exteme conditions. There so many abnormalities in every aspect of the whole trip. Don&#39;t forget this was a space race in technology against Russia which eventually made them broke. This is coming from someone just like you who knew everything there was to know about the whole space program. I built all the models of all the space craft used during those years. I read all the book I could find in the library and bought as many as I could. I was 17 years old in 1969. I was a huge fan from the earliest rockets being lunched from Patrick Air Force Base and other places.  You remember those from your videos when most blew up. I followed it to the end of the Apollo program. Then got disinterested with the Space Shuttle program. They should have called it the Space Truck. Although I was very impressed with the Space Shuttle on display in Florida back in visit during 2014. I was completely amazed at the rocket engines on display. I love all this new stuff with SpaceX you are covering. I am amazed at how the boosters return most of the time. The thing that really sticks out about SpaceX is how far they have come in such a short time. Why is NASA so far behind on this technology or are they. I guess that&#39;s were the secret space program comes into play. NASA and the Air Force have many other secret locations which they launch from all the time. The thing that really sucks is how they put all those brave astronauts at risk and killed so many with old tech when there was a much safer way to travel into space. We had had anti-gravity solved back in the 50&#39;s, but that was a deep dark secret. So Werner von Braun the salesman headed up the space program for NASA all those years ago. He was part of the over 1,400 Nazi scientists and other technology fields in Operation Paper Clip which the United States allowed to come here no questions ask. They even got some of these people from the Nuremberg trails being tried for war crimes. So those were the people help us supposedly get to the Moon. This whole thing stinks! One of the biggest smoking gun of the Moon Mission was the radiation the astronauts would have been exposed to on that trip. There was no protection for radiation in the capsule, lander, or suits. The funny thing about that is they still have not figured out how get around that problem for a Mars mission.

Processes on earth such as liquefaction do cause materials to intersperse and compact. We&#39;ve recorded seismic lunar activity on human timescales. The lunar regolith has experienced eons of time for seismic activity to affect the surface materials.
