Perhaps you would like to ask about this in some future news conference?  My idea of what constitutes THE &quot;worst&quot; case scenario and THE &quot;most natural and authentic configuration&quot; is the following:<br><br>Have an in-flight abort test where the 1st stage engines are running at full throttle, at the velocity of the test that actually occurred, but where they are not shut down.  What happens is, a small explosive charge set just behind the capsule on the 2nd stage (which is fully loaded with fuel and oxidizer) goes off, triggering a second stage explosion.  It&#39;s at this point that the capsule attempts to escape the stack.  Also, the capsule has been kitted out with all the sensors exactly as in the test that was done but everything else about the capsule remains as it would be in normal mission to the ISS (sans people of course :-).  There would be no gutting/stripping of the interior of the capsule.  And for good measure they would have a normal 2nd stage with a functioning MVAC engine installed.<br><br>What say you about these ideas?  What I&#39;m trying to get at here is THE worst case scenario within THE most natural vehicle stack &amp; flight profile to the ISS, with the exception of test instrumentation, (and, of course, without people) that is possible.", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T01:04:03Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "drac richards", "comment_text": "i cant hear anything here.... :(", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T00:08:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ShiP wReCk", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsjq1Rfh9C4&amp;t=5m34s\">5:34</a> <br>I could sit and listen to Elon Musk list off rocket parts all day.", "comment_date": "2020-01-20T21:19:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atlas Gaming", "comment_text": "Wish there was sound in this.

Is dragon capsule capable of separating from Dragon 9 even if that signal does not work as intended? (Falcon 9 does not shut down and continues it&#39;s ascent?)&quot;. That question was triggered by the lack of clarity on the actual process of that demo we saw. I hear throughout the whole press conference and when I almost loose my hope that it will ever get answered, I hear Your question, which is the very last question on that press conference. And that question nails that matter, although it is almost not understood at all at the beginning. But then, You continue to ask to clarify the substance of the question and then You finally get the answer, that Dragon Capsule is capable of separating from Falcon 9 even if Falcon 9 keeps on firing its&#39; engines during the abort. And that is the answer that finished the conference.<br>Thank You very much for that question and... somehow I wasn&#39;t surprised it was You, that asked, and continued to pursue for the answer, for it :)", "comment_date": "2020-01-20T02:00:15Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "Steve Pirie", "comment_text": "Question for Tim or any in the know.

Can that kind of compensatory pressure be achieved and yet not blow out the leeward side of the tank?
