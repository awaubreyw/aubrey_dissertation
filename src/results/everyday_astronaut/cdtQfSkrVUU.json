Smaller means way easier to armor.<br>But I bet that a relatively simple system with one or more floats (metal ball bladders) tethered to a ground scraping anchor (hard, durable and solid metal ball?) could scrape up more than enough energy from wind gradients, thermal gradients, and ground drag friction (with plenty of margin) to actively cool a tiny well isolated capsule (mounted somewhere in the middle) that just holds a few very small cameras and minimal electronics for processing and data transmission. This way mission time could be extended from a mere few minutes to orders of magnitude more. We need high-res pictures of diverse spots of the ground from the perspective of the ground (ideally somehow human eye level - fixed on that hypothetical tether at that height - if that works). Venusian ground on smaller scales is still a very big mystery, beside the view samples of low-res glimpses that Venera gave (which where an incredible feat at that time) we have absolutely nothing.
