Imagine it landing ok, and a few years later one blows up because of lessons not learned from SN8.  So much easier and cheaper to implement changes at this stage of design.  <br>Obviously the main issue was in the fuel delivery, but I&#39;ve also noticed other things that needs tweaking. (just my opinion, I&#39;m no rocket expert, but I do write a lot of software code)<br>1.  Over flipped.  I think it slightly over flipped, although this maybe partly due to thrust loss during the flip.<br>2.  Flaps.  Wouldnt it be better to have all the flaps to extend out once it was close to the vertical position as to help further stabilise it? <br>3.  Power loss.  Requires a critical maneuvers mode.  During dangerous maneuvers, min/max power targets, min/max distance to the ground or other objects should be set, and the craft given automated decisions to keep within those parameters.  eg. it can instantly pull fuel from other tanks or instantly ignite other engines to meet the minimum required demands in those critical moments, or even use the cold gas thrusters to help correct.  This should be a feature that can be turned on/off, as features such as these have been known to crash crafts because of incorrect input data. <br>4.  No landing legs.  I believe the craft was still trying to stablise the flip and hadnt entered landing mode.  Landing mode would have contained many preparations before landing/hitting the ground.  Landing mode needs to be triggered when the craft detects its landing whether expected or unexpected.", "comment_date": "2020-12-16T02:12:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben Katz", "comment_text": "Wow!!
