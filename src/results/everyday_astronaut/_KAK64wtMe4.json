However it seemed they never happen until the last minutes,  I&#39;ve always been curious as to why they couldn&#39;t have a pure mechanical back up, such as system of springs and pressure equalizers/compensaters !? (for lack of a better term) to bring them to more &quot;default-ish&quot; position, as again it seems at the point they fail is normally at a point which they do not need as much sensitive controls of the fins. Something that could possibly give it a fixed setting with the best chance of providing a more likely vertical landing position. After all, from what i have seen from videos (although i have not researched the more details of) that the landing legs and such are pretty hardy. Being built with the collapsible struts and such that can withstand a decent amount of velocity and even compensate a lading that isn&#39;t 100% vertical landing.<br><br><br>Again just a quick thought that came to my mind. I am by far a rocket scientist. <br><br><br>I totally agree with the pre determined flight control. That is essentially how Apollos got to the moon.

Keep up the awesome stream of knowledge. Although I  didn&#39;t get to witness it back in the day as i was born 2 decades late, the whole space race i have recently got into has me very interested. Namely Apollo 8, reading of Genesis and Earth-rise. I could only imagine had Us (the US) and Soviets had worked together from the start. Granted, maybe there would have not ever been as successful since they were never competing.  Competitions push and lead to more developments, but that&#39;s another story.  But none the less, i totally agree with the times you have mentioned that you and everyone should be happy for any tests or developments out there, and not being &quot;go spacex&quot;, &quot;boo blue origin&quot; , or &quot;Boeing sucks&quot; type of mentality.  <br><br><br>Anywho, thanks for every you do Tim.

At that time in the video the fins are oriented to produce a clockwise torque ( when viewed from above ) around the longitudinal axis of the rocket while the rocket has a counter clockwise rotational motion. Yet the counter clockwise rotational rate increases. Am I the one seeing this wrong?  If not, then this video refutes his assertion about the grid fins insane amount of control. Was he so sure of his argument that he did not look at the evidence he was presenting? Or do I have this backwards???  Another point to discuss regarding aerodynamics. Does the aerodynamic force on an airfoil vary with the square of the speed? Does it then follow that the grid fins at 9.99 mph have a thousand times less  force than at 333.333 mph?
