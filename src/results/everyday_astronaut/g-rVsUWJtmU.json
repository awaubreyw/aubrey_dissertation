In the 1960&#39;s, U.S. engineers thought running Ox-rich would be impossible in a metal chamber, as every welder knows one switches a gas torch to pure oxygen to cut thru steel.  But, surprisingly the Soviets did that in their NK-33 engine for their Moon program.  Their trick was to use copper in the preburner and a materials trick for the steel alloy turbine blades.  Leftover NK-33 engines were later used in ULA&#39;s Taurus vehicle in the 2000&#39;s.  The U.S. IPD demo engine of the early 2000&#39;s also had an ox-rich preburner, so by the time of SpaceX Raptor design, there were at least 2 prior liquid engines which had proven an ox-rich preburner.", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T17:39:01Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jorn /Blokies", "comment_text": "When will they try again?", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T17:38:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cscuile", "comment_text": "The fact that you make anti-clickbait titles makes you one of my favorite youtubers!", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T17:37:52Z", "likes_count": 179}, {"comment_by": "Ratul Deoun", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t wait till humans return to the lunar surface and humans going to Mars!", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T17:32:37Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "Lachezar Krastev", "comment_text": "Guys, when all this project gets scrapped, many people will look stupid ...<br>Waiting several hours for just a static fire is pathetic.", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T17:32:17Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "MR.BOBFACE !!!", "comment_text": "So much going on.
