The center of lift is mostly fixed in a certain position.  But the center of gravity (CG) can be shifted depending on where we place the heavier passengers and our baggage and fuel.  The greater the distance between the CG and the CL, the more stable the aircraft becomes.<br>              When the CL is behind the CG we call it positive stability.  That means that if the airplane is flying straight and level in a normal cruise configuration and you upset the cruise, for example by pulling back on the stick and letting it go, the airplane will oscillate into a waveform and return to normal straight and level flight.  That is called &quot;positive stability&#39;.  That&#39;s a good thing.<br>                However, if the pilot misloads the airplane and places the GC at or near the CL, and upsets the cruise configuration, the aircraft will go into continuous oscillation and its waves will continue as usual.  This is called &quot;neutral stability&quot;.  BTW, some military jets that &quot;fly by wire&quot; are designed for &quot;neutral stability&quot; because of aircraft will maneuver more readily.  Safety is conserved by the &quot;fly by wire&quot; computers.<br>                The worst way to misload an airplane to put the CG behind the CL.  If you upset the cruise by pulling back on the stick or control wheel, the oscillations will continue to grow in wave\u00a0height.  This is called &quot;negative Stability&quot;.   No pilot want&#39;s to be in a negatively stable condition if he/she enters a stall because it might be impossible to recover from such an upset.  Just a little basic aerodynamics 101 for review.  So the next time you get into a small airplane, don&#39;t be upset if the pilot asks you how much you weight and wants you to sit in any particular seat in the airplane.<br>                Even in a lightly loaded airline jet, the crew may ask passengers to move their seat, for weight and balance purposes.", "comment_date": "2019-02-18T19:47:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gil Davis", "comment_text": "It seems to me that both SpaceX and Boeing have merely designed and built spacecraft for either Earth orbit, or lunar missions.

However it has to get wings or fins to stabalize using aerodynamics. The first craft clearly did not have fins so the center of lift cannot form a straight line with the ground, then the center of lift will cycle upward and downward because of no fins or wings to control the craft in any sort of way. Therefore the cycle continues and the craft spins as shown.<br><br>The reason why they have to extend a part to add fins is because the crew capsule is designed to flip and any sort of fins cannot achieve that balance because the capsule would like to flip and then any thrust will be unstable. The reason I can think of not adding grid fins is because it makes the crew capsule less aerodynamic though I can&#39;t see why they won&#39;t do that.

I recall from my model rocket days that a cone&#39;s center of pressure (the term we used in those days, side-stepping the question of whether it&#39;s more accurately called center of drag or center of lift) is two-thirds of the way back from the point to the base. And that&#39;s why the capsule wants to go blunt-end-first: unless it&#39;s got some serious ballast in the pointy end, a cone&#39;s center of mass is going to be a lot closer to the base of the cone than that.
