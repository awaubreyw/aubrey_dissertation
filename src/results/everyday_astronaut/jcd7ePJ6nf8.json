First--the energy added would send a considerable amount of the vaporized gases into orbital or escape trajectories--so you&#39;d have a lot of loss--not very efficient.  Second, the vaporized gas would be irradiated--astronauts are already dealing with a solid amount of radiation just by being on Mars and increasing that for a few solid years might not be the best decision.  Third--until we somehow boost Mar&#39;s magnetic field strength, the new atmosphere would suffer heavy losses to solar wind--and we might want to be efficient if we don&#39;t just have an abundance of frozen carbon dioxide with which to build an entire atmosphere.  And Fourth--I&#39;d like to see how on Earth we&#39;re going to launch several very-powerful thermonuclear bombs and convince the FAA and UN with secure confidence that we are peacefully sending this cold war M.A.D.-esque barrage to Mars.  And Fifth--those pesky range safety regs...<br><br>I read an article earlier which stated that even if we utilized all of the available oxygen in the ice caps, atmosphere, and outer crust of Mars, we&#39;d still only achieve 7% at best of the density of Earth&#39;s atmosphere, and we&#39;d probably need thicker than that to retain enough heat to make Mars temperate.  Looks like we&#39;re going to have to develop a practical way to perform mass nuclear transmutation to create oxygen/nitrogen from other elements--to do so at a practical pace, and to do so without creating too radioactive of results in the process.  I&#39;m sure it can be done, but that&#39;ll be a major hurdle in any real kind of terraforming operation, so far there&#39;s debate about whether or not we&#39;ve successfully synthesized organic elements (nitrogen, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen--and to a lesser extent sulfur and phosphorus), but that&#39;s another thing where we&#39;ll be counting on progress in the scientific community.", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T20:54:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u0420\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0430\u043d \u041e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0435\u0432", "comment_text": "\u0412\u044b \u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0433\u0434\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u044b\u043b\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0435, \u0438 \u043d\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T19:12:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tusk Act 4", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcd7ePJ6nf8&amp;t=1h22m57s\">1:22:57</a> the flamey end was up ruh roh", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T16:59:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matrixar's music workshop", "comment_text": "Orbits don&#39;t snap.....", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T16:26:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jet Aviationxx", "comment_text": "How comes you can\u2019t tell if that vacuum engine was lit or not?", "comment_date": "2020-07-31T10:45:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Orr", "comment_text": "Best Launch Simulcast out there.

Without using mods, I found you can launch, then roll for inclination, at 60m/s pitch to 80 deg and hold until your around 3600-4200m.  Then set your rocket to prograde.  Then watch your time to apogee (Most Important) and when it gets around <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcd7ePJ6nf8&amp;t=1m15s\">1:15</a>-<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcd7ePJ6nf8&amp;t=1m30s\">1:30</a> then reduce throttle to a TWR of around 1.0 and see if the time holds, if not reduce more.  When your close to your target apogee throttle back to hold current speed and let time get closer to 15 seconds for when you want to start your circularization burn.  Although the time really depends on your second stages TWR.  Anyways, just something I found with KSP since I haven&#39;t been using mods that might help, but your first stage did have way more power than was needed for Kerbin haha.  I kinda figured this out back when I was using realism overhaul and didn&#39;t want to use up my ignition amounts and figuring this out made my rockets in vanilla KSP way more efficient :)", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T23:06:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Grange Gardener Organic Vids", "comment_text": "Hi Tim, Benjamin from Aus. I enjoyed your coverage last night and watched most of it I love your enthusiasm of all things Space . As I watch most of your coverage I saw a few things that I hadn&#39;t thought much about. This so I have two questions I&#39;d love you to answer. <br>1. What happens to the second stage after burn? Does it orbit the sun or come back to Earth and burn up?<br>2. I noticed whilst watching the Telemetry, that after stage 2 engines turned off the 7 second burn that the speed suddenly decreased and continued to decrease. Shouldn&#39;t it continue at the same speed? Does the probe continue to loose speed all the way to Mars and if so What is it&#39;s lowest speed as it approaches Mar&#39;s?", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T22:52:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "danilo rainone", "comment_text": "how long  for the trip?", "comment_date": "2020-07-30T22:49:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CL Huang", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcd7ePJ6nf8&amp;t=1h49m10s\">1:49:10</a>.
