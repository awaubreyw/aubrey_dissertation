I am an all-out supporter of SpaceX but even so, I didn&#39;t expect the SN6 hop go so smoothly.  The chance for Raptor to be so reliable and throttle-able to that precision is insane.  This is still the most efficient, most powerful (impulse, chamber pressure) rocket engine and hardly cleared prototyping phase (still climbing with chamber pressure, and even Elon isn&#39;t sure if it can withstand 350 bars).  So the fact, that this engine can do this, and all those strapped on copv-s and  Telsa batteries to do this is extreme. I am happy and shocked at the same time. Scared fo them in a weird way.  I think the level of precision and knowledge wrapped into this thing is overlooked. Seems like a grain silo, when in reality it is an actual rocket, with a 7 days production time.
