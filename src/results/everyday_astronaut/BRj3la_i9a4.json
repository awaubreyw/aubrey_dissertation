Satellites are technically only &quot;cubesats&quot; if they fit the sizing and weight criteria. A 1u (or a single unit) cubesat can not exceed a stowed size of 10cm*10cm*10cm. A 2u (or 2 unit) cubesat must fit 20cm*10cm*10cm. Larger unit sizes must fill the area, so a 4u cubesat must be 20cm*20cm*10cm, and can&#39;t take an &quot;odd&quot; shape like an L shape since it doesn&#39;t use the whole area. If you did make an L shaped cubesat, it would actually be the next larger unit size it fits into. The MarCO sats claim to be 6u, but that would be 20cm*30cm*10cm (7.87&quot;*11.81&quot;*3.94&quot;) which is roughly a ream (500 sheets) of letter sized paper. From the JPL page, &quot;MarCO&#39;s design is a six-unit CubeSat - about the size of a briefcase -- with a stowed size of about 14.4 inches (36.6 centimeters) by 9.5 inches (24.3 centimeters) by 4.6 inches (11.8 centimeters).&quot; which is about the size of a ream of legal sized paper.", "comment_date": "2018-12-12T06:25:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jonny B", "comment_text": "You host a very enjoyable webcast.

If this can be achieved, heat re-entry shouldn&#39;t be issue as Felix Baumgartner demonstrated, so BFR should land easily.
