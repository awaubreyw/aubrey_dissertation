[{"comment_by": "Everyday Astronaut", "comment_text": "Friendly reminder: My job is to report, cheer on and educate about spaceflight. This is a spaceflight event. By witnessing history and learning about the science being done, I\u2019m not endorsing a government. People don\u2019t chose where they\u2019re born and I\u2019m here to cheer those people on as they explore. It&#39;s also not my job to derive the intent of each and every launch. For that purpose, I feel ok covering NRO missions which have nothing to do with space exploration and everything to do with military prowess. It&#39;s spaceflight I cover, period. That&#39;s what I&#39;m here for, I will not discuss geopolitics / human rights further (despite them being important topics), as those are not the topics I cover on my channel and I encourage our comment section to do the same.
