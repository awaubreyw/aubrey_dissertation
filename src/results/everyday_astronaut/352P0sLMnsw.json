Difference between the case of a suborbital rocket like New Shepherd and SN20 on its orbital flight is that the latter will certainly fly in an orbital trajectory, but it is interrupted by the atmosphere, not the surface of Earth on its own. Relatively speaking, if a starship aerobrakes on Mars, then it\u2019d be in a orbital and then suborbital trajectory instead of a hyperbolic trajectory as it would be to start and if it weren\u2019t interrupted by the Martian atmosphere. <br><br>My point: the atmosphere of a planet is mutually exclusive from the instantaneous status of the objects that orbit it.

Slower, and it will de-orbit and burn up in the atmosphere. Faster, and it will escape Earth&#39;s orbit and veer off into space(-ish). Surely all space junk cannot be orbiting at exactly ~7,500 m/s?
