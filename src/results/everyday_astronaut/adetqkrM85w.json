At about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adetqkrM85w&amp;t=10m40s\">10:40</a> it came up:<br><br>When you think about this, it actually becomes very easy to understand why.  I can think of three off the top of my head:<br><br>1) Drag.<br>Regardless of when the fairing releases -- more on that later -- having the two halves attached to the first stage greatly increases it&#39;s drag.   It would have to release before stage separation, obviously, but regardless of if it&#39;s during the boost phase or coast phase, separating them and having them hang off the booster increases it&#39;s drag.  Even if it would be minimal at the 60-70KM altitude when separation occurs, that&#39;s likely still enough that it&#39;s going to slow the rocket down.  Now, you might think drag is a good thing on re-entry, but...<br><br>2) Vehicle stress<br>Assuming they&#39;d try to close up the fairing somehow, that&#39;s going to create significant stresses on the vehicle as it re-enters, and that&#39;s not even including the stresses on the joints to close things back up, hold things together, etc.  Who knows how that will affect the vehicle as it reenters.<br><br>3) Complexity &amp; weight<br>In addition to the usual complexity of the weight needed for this mechanism, which would reduce payload capacity, etc, the complexity of such a system would add several new possible points of failure to the main mission above what&#39;s already involved in simple fairing separation.  As I see it, there are basically two possibilities for an integrated fairing: either the entire 2nd stage pops out through a door at the top, or the two halves slide or flip down.  For the first, if that 2nd stage makes contact with the side at all, you&#39;ve lost the mission.  If the two halves separate but then don&#39;t swing down, or stresses cause one halve to stay up with the connection mechanism, you&#39;ve lost the mission.<br><br>Any way I look at it, I cannot see having the fairing attached working.", "comment_date": "2019-07-05T02:02:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Javier Vazquez", "comment_text": "Atlas V 100% success rate, is a reliable rocket.
