There would only be a small amount of fuel needed by Super Heavy after achieved orbit to return to the surface, so whatever unneeded fuel for re-entry that is left in the Super could be pumped over to the Starship, and walah - instead of four or five flights to orbit to top off the Starship tanks for &quot;Deep Space Ops&quot;, you do it with the initial launch... In this way, you can send a whole fleet of Starships almost anywhere you want without weeks and weeks in orbit around the earth, waiting on multiple flights from the surface to refuel!<br><br>I&#39;ve been working this in my head for about a month now, and I can&#39;t think of any negatives.
