After we open our parachute, we fly to a spot upwind of the place we want to land.  The exact spot is based on the wind conditions.  We fly downwind, turn a 90, fly, turn a 90, and are on \u201cfinal\u201d.  The turn timing is adjusted on the fly to make a spot on landing.  I am not sure how Spacex is working this problem, but it would seem reasonable that the parachute can be steered just like skydiving parachutes.  As soon as the parachute opens, an ideal landing location for both the faring to steer to and a spot the boat can make it to should be predictable.  Along this line of thinking, the boat would just need to get to the landing spot and the parachute needs to steer to the pre-determined spot, basically landing on the boat/net.  I am sure it is easier with a human brain and eyes in the loop, but maybe they could pick a skydiver brain for how to program it.", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T23:29:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Avida Dollars", "comment_text": "An pseudo astronaut who can&#39;t handle altitude lol", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T23:12:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "01glenn0101", "comment_text": "mate.... putting an advert, half a second after main engine start was very annoying ... put me off your channel really....", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T23:00:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lieven Petersen", "comment_text": "fairings seperated at 103 km, so above &quot;space&quot;-line (forgot name), together with coast to apohel they&#39;re gonna be well within space.<br>Why does this matter?
