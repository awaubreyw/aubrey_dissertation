If Jesus Christ comes back to take his church and found you not saved (not believing at him as the savior through believing he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and that he risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now) you will be left behind and there will be great tribulation you will suffer on earth and that will be God&#39;s judgement.<br><br>The only way to be saved at tribulation after left behind by Jesus when majority of Christians have disappeared is to not take the mark of the beast on your forehead or right hand and you will be killed or starve to death.<br><br>2. Death always occur you can die at any time and the huge issue is if you die before Christ returns and you were not believing at him as the savior( that is not believing at Christ that he was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and risen again on the third) your soul will go straight to Hell for eternity, at Hell you will burn but not consumed.<br><br>Believing at Christ does not involve worship of other gods(church leader&amp;ancestors), object(hand bands,car stickers,trees e.t.c) Muhammad,buddha e.t.c. It&#39;s only believing at Christ as the perfect sacrifice for your sins.<br>It&#39;s your choice but know that rejecting Christ will send you the wrong direction.<br><br>No works can save you, there is no physical thing you can do to get saved but you are only saved through faith at what Jesus did for you as simple as that.<br><br>Ephesians 2:8-9 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:<br>Not of works, lest any man should boast.<br><br>Believe and confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ was crucified and he shed his blood for your sins at the cross and was buried but risen again on the third day and alive in heaven now. <br><br>After believing at Christ as the savior you must change your ways and try to stay away from bad works or sins as hard as possible, you must show that you are a new individual in Christ. e.g stopping fornication, getting drunk, homosexual acts, masturbation, pornography e.t.c.<br><br>As a human you will still fall at some sins of course as no human is perfect, but you must not swim in sin you must try your best to fight against sins and live a righteous life.<br><br>Also grow in the word; I suggest the following YouTube channels; Real bible believers, Robert Breaker and Pastor J.D Farag.", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T06:48:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Yo Homeboy", "comment_text": "Where\u2019s the pizza pockets?", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T05:55:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bryant tillman", "comment_text": "and NOW, &quot;Fireball SN5&quot;....uh...(not YET!?)", "comment_date": "2020-07-29T05:44:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beacon of Wierd", "comment_text": "YOU&#39;RE NOT THE MOM OF ME!

It is a perfect desciption of the landing maneuver for starship as well as for the boostback burns of Falcon 9 boosters and Superheavy.<br><br>&quot;Flip&quot; is more precisely describing a rotation that stops somewhere near 180deg whereas a &quot;turn&quot; can be any angle.<br><br>&quot;Turn&quot; also traditionally describes a change in the actual track of the movement as opposed to a rotating around itself while maintaining a course in the same direction.<br><br>Additionally it grates on my ears, and I think it must others too, because there is already a completely different meaning associated with &quot;turn and burn&quot;. It means that an aircraft in a dogfight is spending its mechanical energy turning very hard and engages the afterburner to replace the energy as much as possible regardless of the high fuel consumption. This will allow it to turn harder, turn hard for longer or build up mechanical energy while turning hard. It is not a momentary thing, it is not a first-this-then-that-thing and it makes it confusing to hear it used about how Starship is going to slam on the brakes when it is usually about keep UP your speed.<br><br><br><br>Anyway, just a thought that we might stil have time to change this before we get stuck with a bad term for the next 150 years of space travel :D Great work, great chat to read..", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T12:22:47Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Rune M", "comment_text": "Never seen a chat with so much venting..", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T11:38:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LuckyLuke3331", "comment_text": "We loveyou Tim !", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T09:53:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "trickeyD", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNlS-mgyJAE&amp;t=3h10m15s\">3:10:15</a> - thank me later", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T08:27:12Z", "likes_count": 124}, {"comment_by": "David Greene", "comment_text": "what powers the Spacex raptor tcv hydraulic pump?", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T06:54:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kenneth James", "comment_text": "Hey get it together.  that thing may still go", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T04:02:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dorothy Jones", "comment_text": "Also", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T03:59:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ultima", "comment_text": "TIM THEYRE TRYING AGAIN RIGHT NOW", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T03:49:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "tristan diaz", "comment_text": "It appears they\u2019re still possibly going for fire", "comment_date": "2020-07-28T03:37:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "max dude", "comment_text": "The NasaSpaceflight channel is covering the continuing activity at 10:15PM  <br>Venting just started.
