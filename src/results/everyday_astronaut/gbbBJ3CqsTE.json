Wings do not provide a lot of lift at this level, but they are good for control if they are the right shape as smaller control surfaces do not generate force to significantly control the craft. Typical aircraft that have enough thrust to achieve extremely high altitudes will enter dead spins when they loose control &amp; that will stall out their engines if they haven&#39;t already from poor air intake. (Like the F-4 phantom.) 3) in the lower atmosphere and at landing, lift is a big factor preventing stall outs &amp; and variable geometry is managed by much smaller control surfaces. Despite having these control surfaces it&#39;s not common to think of these aircraft as &quot;variable geometry&quot; but technically, they kind of are.  <br>4) A spacecraft making entry/exit into both Mars &amp; Earth will have completely different optimized profiles based on the composition &amp; depth of the atmospheres. <br><br>Variable geometry concludes the forces involved in flight at every stage &amp; speed prevent a one-size fits-all mentality, and works around it by modifying the surface dimensions of the craft.  <br><br>HOWEVER, the downfall of most variable geometry designs in aviation is the reason the f-14 got supplanted relatively early in its aviation career by the f-15 is reliability &amp; cost. The more moving parts in the system, the more can go wrong &amp; that added complexity also increases the costs of production &amp; maintenance. Most aircraft today have fixed designs that are optimized for their mission profile. Birds &amp; bats &amp; all other flying creatures are by nature variable geometry.     <br><br><br>The multi-payload, multirole, multi-altitude, multi-atmospheric capabilities that Elon Musk wants Space X to achieve in a single craft pretty much defaults to variable geometry (cuz physics) with the engineering challenge being reducing the costs &amp; complexities of continued operation with such things because the f-14 and the concord, and many other craft, the costs of operation has been the killer of the program. (However, they were competing economically with completely reusable &amp; reliably optimized aircraft already in the market &amp; mass produced not all these one-build-one mission throwaway rocket programs that Space X has been trying to usurp.)<br><br>If we ever invent real airtight forcefields air &amp; space craft can be whatever physical shape you want them to be, because the field could likely provide all the variable geometry required to create desired maneuvers.
