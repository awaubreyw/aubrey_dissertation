Would that not help consolidate the engineering of the landing systems for the Starship lunar lander?

You are all excited about Starliner and optimistic, going as far as putting it at almost the same level as Dragon. That is not right, Starliner should be tested thoroughly before people are put in it.

And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T05:07:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Loris Martino Perfetto", "comment_text": "The atlas 5 is pretty amazing", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T22:00:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Creative 8D", "comment_text": "I want boeing build a <b>H U G E</b> trampoline and launch some one to space", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T20:11:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Full Flow Aerospace", "comment_text": "Make that 6 astronauts limit 7!", "comment_date": "2020-11-23T04:01:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe Szczepanski", "comment_text": "One works, the other doesn&#39;t, lol.", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T16:30:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Admin Boi", "comment_text": "D", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T11:31:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "gregory siebers", "comment_text": "Space x operational with no real set backs  and 2 human flights(beyond the exploded  capsule  tested after its intial use) where as boeing had a failure that stopped it from getting to iss and still yet to do a demo human  flight  and the next demo crewless flight is pushed  to 2021 ... really enough said  space x won hands done", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T06:41:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Baclig Family", "comment_text": "Is The Droneship and Iss Has a same lenght", "comment_date": "2020-11-22T06:29:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter Rubinshtein", "comment_text": "The terrible quality of text comments.

That being said, I do have a bone or two to pick with Boeing aerospace. I believe their management team is a little corrupt and overly profit motivated. This at the expense of the safety of the general public and astronauts. No mechanical escape system is a really big deal with manned flight. Each Shuttle flight cost between one and two Billion dollars, a really hard price to justify on a &quot;Reusable&quot; vehicle.. Some flights had no cargo although some used support systems in the cargo bay for experiments that could not have been done without a second launch vehicle. The first test of the escape system for Boeing was a joke as it did not test the parachutes of the system and was a Hugh public media snow job.  I also think it is fair to say that Space X is the first company to provide two, yes TWO landing systems in one vehicle. It has the parachutes, but if they were to fail, they also have the superdraco thrusters! Even without landing legs, I would bet this would be a viable landing alternative. NASA is just too picky when they are approving someone else&#39;s manned system. !

This isn&#39;t also without problems as well but I think we are at a high enough level to resolve those. Cargo?  Well, we are still stuck with the dangerous rockets for anything with a serious amount of mass.  There is no way at the present; to get away from them yet.  I did formulate some ideas but they are really better for platforms already in orbit with a cargo load no more than 5t.  For the initial test of the design.  Unfortunately, even I have to admit the larger the scale the more of insane mass necessary to support it.", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T15:39:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "B-MAN", "comment_text": "Crewed or Crude? :-)", "comment_date": "2019-09-11T05:21:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joe M", "comment_text": "why do you refer to humans as if youre not one yourself? hmmm", "comment_date": "2019-09-10T19:33:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Don Frandsen", "comment_text": "AMERICAN SPACE CRAFT RULES!!!<br>GREAT VIDEO<br>MORE!!!!

Space craft need to be efficient, and maybe the weight of a traditional flight console isn&#39;t really justified.", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T16:25:07Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Tetsujin", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqLNIBAroGY&amp;t=24m49s\">24:49</a> - Regarding the cost-per-seat of a shuttle flight, and the consideration that it might be effectively offset by the cargo capability...<br><br>If it&#39;s $214M per seat - that&#39;s based on, what, seven or eight crew flying? Around $1.5B overall per flight...? (I know NASA&#39;s website indicates &quot;about $450M per flight&quot;...  Really??!? I mean, what?? Where does that huge disparity in cost-per-flight calculations come from?)<br>So would it not be reasonable to start with the cost of flying a Shuttle, deduct the cost of flying a comparable cargo using another launch system like Atlas V, and then figure the cost-per-seat from the remainder? Maybe a little generous since it assumes the Shuttle would ALWAYS be flying cargo...<br>Wikipedia says about $153M to fly an Atlas V 551 - which should have been able to fly a dozen tonnes or more, right? Then let&#39;s round up a bit to be extra-generous, given that the Atlas V cargo launch would have to be fully automated - say $300M for that cargo launch in order to do without a human crew in direct control, and the RMS. That&#39;s still $1.2B per shuttle launch, or around $170M per crew member for the ADJUSTED crew flight cost...<br>Or you could split it down the middle, say it&#39;s about the same as flying two (overly expensive) 12 tonne missions - one manned capsule (at $600M - almost four times the cost of flying Dragon 2) and one automated cargo flight (at $600M - four times the cost of Atlas V!). Then it&#39;s around $100M per crew member.<br>But how do you justify shaving off EIGHTY PERCENT of the shuttle&#39;s per-flight cost when calculating the cost to fly crew?", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T16:07:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tetsujin", "comment_text": "(Size comparison of different space vehicles)<br><b>*face-palm*</b>  And we were launching that thing into space every single time we needed to move crew...  <b>*sigh*</b><br>Maybe the shuttle deserves more credit than I give it for some of its other capabilities and accomplishments - but it really seems like it was a terrible waste to fly that massive thing.", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T15:35:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ray sims", "comment_text": "You really don&#39;t believe any of this stuff to you space is impossible", "comment_date": "2019-03-07T14:33:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "first last", "comment_text": "Do you know with these contracts, do the companies sell design/intellectual property rights of their stuff along with the actual service?

Having been born in the late 60&#39;s I was lucky to have become aware of the world in time to catch the last few years of the Apollo program. As a child I was enamored with those rockets and the men who flew on them, brave men and a beast of a machine. I remember thinking how amazing it was that humans were in space flying to and landing on the moon. I remember our first attempts at long term habitation of space with the Skylab projects, and the transition over to the Space Launch System. I remember being absolutely blown away when they launched the first shuttle flight, it was the most incredible thing i&#39;d ever seen. I remember watching the Challenger disaster on live T.V. and thinking that was going to be the end of the program. I was glad they kept it going. I remember when they launched the Hubble on the shuttle, and then go back to fix the damned thing, lol. I remember when they first started talking about building the I.S.S, and thinking to myself &quot;can they really do that?&quot;, then a decade later there it was, and I thought to myself &quot;wow, they really CAN do that&quot;. That got me starting to think that maybe we had a chance to get to Mars during my lifetime, and I gotta say, that got me pretty excited. Then suddenly the Columbia suffers damage on launch and crashes on re-entry, and again I thought it was all over. how can we keep flying to and back from space when we&#39;ve now lost 17 humans in the process (3 during Apollo)? But, after the nation took a collective deep breath and a long hard think on the issue we kept going. Then out of the blue it is announced that the S.L.S. is being cancelled and that thought that we were finished for sure this time reared it&#39;s ugly head once again. I&#39;m glad that we are developing this new generation of vehicles, and i&#39;m even happier to see that private business is taking the lead to develop multiple vehicles.

The Engineer was so upset over being over ruled, he Resigned and make his manger sign the resignation letter as prof of being over ruled.  The manager later tried to say the &quot;Engineer said it would be OK to Launch&quot;.

Sub-chilled fuel will not boil off until it reaches its boiling point. As the fuel warms up it will expand until it reaches its boiling point. So two concerns, in general it is still considered safer not to have anyone onboard while fueling due to the inherent risks during fueling. Sure an abort system may be a good risk mitigation, but first principles would be to avoid having to use an abort system in the first place. Second, any delay for any reason means having to immediately offload fuel before it has a chance to expand. The nature of sub-chilled fuel means all the fuel has to be removed and fueling has to start all over again, which in itself is more additional risk. All that being said, NASA is a high reliability organization, they would not have accepted SpaceX\u2019s risk assessment until all risks have been mitigated to an acceptable level. <br><br>Cheers \ud83d\ude42", "comment_date": "2019-02-23T01:59:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steeve Richard", "comment_text": "Very good content, well presented.

If we take a step back and think of a machine that could take up large payloads, bring them back, help build the ISS, the Hubble repair missions, etc, basically a space truck, it was nothing short of remarkable.  If congress would have funded what NASA really wanted, a smaller version, maybe we would have had the evolution of the shuttle that should have happened.  With congress under-funding NASA time and time again, it was almost impossible to go beyond the shuttle design we ended up with.  Even though its goals for lower cost and full re-usability were never met, in my opinion the shuttle was something the U.S. space program should be proud of.  People who have watched the shuttle program from start to finish I feel have a better appreciation of what it meant to the U.S. at the time.  As we get further away from the last shuttle mission today, many people who praise SpaceX, (they deserve to be for many things), do not understand the innovations at the time that brought the shuttle together.
