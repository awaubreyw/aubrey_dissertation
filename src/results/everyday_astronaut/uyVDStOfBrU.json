I doubt any will be of use to me in my life  I will never need to know about a full flow rocket engine and I doubt it will ever come up in conversation but it is knowledge I am glad to have.<br>Thanks to your videos I even understand why there are sea level and Vacuum optimised engines air pressure right the only real difference is that vacuum engines have wider noozles as there is less air pressure pushing the exhaust hence they work better in different flight regimes more efficient.<br>So my question is is it dangerous to use a sea level engine in a vacuum or near vacuum and vice versa or just less efficient? Will a rocket go boom or just not perform as well?<br>I ask this because a production Starship will be boosted to near space before it even fires its rockets and 90% of its powered flight will be in a Vacuum. It will only use its engines in atmosphere for landing so will it be better to have 6 vacuum engines rather the three and three mix we see on test vehicles or will we have the rockets go boom issue???", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T05:00:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elephants are Nuts", "comment_text": "&quot;Nothing Happened Don&#39;t Watch&quot; - the best truth in advertising ever ... or double secret reverse psychology!", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T03:28:32Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Franklin", "comment_text": "Rcs thrusters using hot gas methane.
