With Starship aiming to send 100 tons to the surface of Mars, this means Each starship launch to Mars would have a cost of $10,000,000 (Ten Million).<br><br>This is obviously assuming reusability, which includes flying Starship from Mars back to Earth. Based on delta-v requirements, it will be necessary to refuel Starship on Mars for the return flight, and I can only assume the cost of refueling out of Martian in-situ propellant has not been factored into this 10 million dollar price tag.<br><br>The 10 million dollar cost also seems to be just SpaceX&#39;s cost of fuel and maintaining the program, with the cost of building the rocket amortized over a large number of uses, but you can&#39;t achieve a large number of uses if every use goes to Mars, since it simply takes too long for rapid reuse (2-3 years per round trip). This means, in order to amortize the manufacturing cost over a large number of uses, Starships optimized for Mars landings will need to have the ability to be used in LEO or on the Moon as well after making some launches to Mars to be able to take advantage of a market with a higher launch cadence.<br><br>Even if it only costs SpaceX 10 million to fly the mission to Mars, there is an opportunity cost which might increase the price; if that same Starship could service the LEO launch market as well, then does it make sense to accept even a 20 million dollar payment for a trip to Mars (10 million profit) that requires it to be unable to be used for LEO launches for 2-3 years? Surely the profits per Starship serving the LEO launch market will be greater than 5 million dollars a year. Heck, it will probably be more than 5 million dollars of profit per launch, with many launches per year per starship. Therefore, the largest cost of sending a Starship to Mars could be the opportunity cost of preventing that rocket from servicing the LEO launch market for 2-3 years.<br><br>Of course, with such a high launch cadence and the ability to construct Starships quickly there is a good chance that there could be enough Starships to service the LEO market, Lunar market, and Martian market all at the same time. These markets will surely grow with lower cost access due to Starship, but I suspect Starship production will be able to keep up with this demand. Regardless, unless there is some other form of revenue stream from the Mars base, or SpaceX charges a huge premium on flights to Mars, supplying the demand for launches to Mars will be Starship&#39;s least profitable use case.<br><br>I doubt this will stop SpaceX or Elon from making Mars optimized Starships though!

He is more a brilliant psychologist than an engineer.<br>I will also mention Starship, whose base is located in a nature reserve where animals that are dying out(?!) live... because I was very interested in the Apollo program.

He certainly had no similance of a smile on his face. I just thought of how odd the juxtaposition of your vs his reaction to that statement. I suppose it&#39;s a matter of perspective. He&#39;s the man responsible for accomplishing that 10,000% cost reduction. I&#39;m also fascinated by watching this man interact with other people conversationally. Yes the Asperger&#39;s does have an effect,.but I see it a bit deeper than that. It seems to me, to be a difficult challenge for Elon to basically dumb himself down enough to answer other&#39;s questions. Not in an arrogant way at all, more like it takes him time to come up with a response that he thinks you&#39;ll be able to understand. You can see it when, for example you ask him a truly relevant technical question. It seems like he&#39;s happy that you have more than a layman&#39;s comprehension of whatever you guys happen to be talking about, making it easier for him to reply, and he visibly relaxes a little. I don&#39;t know how well he knows you, but I can tell that as you guys go on, it gets more and more comfortable for him. I guess he realizes he&#39;s not got to dumb it down quite so much. That&#39;s just a theory, but another I have is that dude thinks so fast, that he&#39;s moved on, and is bored before he gets out the full reply to a sentence lol. Ya know, either/or lol. I will admit that you guys actually used 19 words during your dialogue, that I have a firm grasp on, regarding their meaning, use, and purpose. That makes me pretty smart.

Keep it safe) The main causes of accidents in warehousing and storage are: \u25a0 slips and trips; \u25a0 manual handling; \u25a0 work at height; \u25a0 vehicles in and around the warehouse; and \u25a0 moving or falling objects.           2)Shelving not only helps you to organize things precisely but also provides ample space to store things in their appropriate place, right from books to other heavy industrial products. There are many different types of shelves available, like wood, plastic, and metal shelves.\t    3)The highest shelf for practical use should be 7 feet. The lowest shelf should be 6 inches from the floor. Clearance between the shelves should be at least 15 inches.    4) This is a safety tip: store your heaviest merchandise as close to the floor as you can. This will prevent potential collapses, but it will also lower the potential for injuries as your staff move the items around. Conversely, lighter merchandise should be stored off the floor, to prevent cluttering and tripping.\r<br>5) A key benefit of using Hot Dip Galvanizing is its durability. Data shows that galvanizing can provide between 34 to 170 years of protection for steel.  \r<br>6) Coating System\t$/ft2\tTotal    Hot-Dip Galvanizing    $1.76   $ 88,000  \r<br>Epoxy/Epoxy   $2.92 $ 146,150 Epoxy/Polyurethane\t$3.35\t$ 167,650 \r<br>Inorganic Zinc/Epoxy $3.17 $ 158,650     7) Hot dip galvanizing is often perceived to be more expensive than it is. There are two reasons for this: Firstly, that such a high-performance coating is automatically assumed to be expensive. Secondly, the initial cost of galvanizing relative to paint has changed significantly over recent years. It is cheap. Galvanizing is a low-cost method of steel protection, so you can get excellent, strong, and very affordable material.    8) Dexion: slotted angle steel strip construction system, widely used since the 1950s for domestic and commercial shelving, storage racking, exhibition stands and accommodation purposes.   9) The central difference between shelving and racking is that shelving involves putting products into the system and retrieving them by hand. With racking, warehouse employees carry out storage and retrieval with equipment like forklifts.  10) These include steel, aluminum, copper, chrome, plywood, koa and oak. This is because these materials are strong, durable and long-lasting. Steel is the most popular material used in the industry, yet copper and aluminum come in a close second.   11) Industrial castings are structurally sound and are produced using various types of air melt alloys to accommodate a range of strength, corrosion resistance and wear requirements.  12) Welding is a fabrication process whereby two or more parts are fused together by means of heat, pressure or both forming a join as the parts cool. Welding is usually used on metals and thermoplastics but can also be used on wood. The completed welded joint may be referred to as a weldment. 13) In fact, many businesses prefer stainless steel when it comes to their shelving requirements because steel is proven to be strong as compared to other shelving materials like wood. Steel could withstand heavy weight, high temperature and safe for usage. 14) semi-permanent: using nails, screws, rivets or stitching for example, temporary (i.e. designed with the intention of being easily removable for replacement or maintenance etc.", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T07:26:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Capt'n Jay Greybeard", "comment_text": "What, what!? here&#39;s a thumbs up\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2022-05-17T07:21:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Markwell", "comment_text": "Great engineering and financial skills insights along the way, especially the cost per ton to Mars.

The &#39;other&#39; guys invite senators and folks from the military industrial complex because that&#39;s where their funding comes from. At Starbase in Boca Chica, just observe the difference in how people talk to you about what they&#39;re working on. You feel like you&#39;re the CEO and they are giving you a status report. It&#39;s very surreal at times but also, in my opinion, why SpaceX emits a completely different vibe than NASA or the other aerospace incumbents. Trust can be a lot higher when you invite a person in to see what you&#39;ve been up to and what you want to do next. That&#39;s something the &#39;agencies&#39; should remember in the future.

A parachute can be manipulated to alter the rate of descent or to change course to some degree. The ship could come down engines first, this would eliminate the need for the dreaded flip maneuver, it would also solve all those pressure problems. Reentry could be extended to about 3-5 hours.<br>   There would be a significant weight reduction, no heat tiles and the lower and upper flaps/fins would no longer be needed.

If that makes sense, ie so many ceos and execs have face value knowledge, where as Elon seems to be actively involved and really have that working knowledge. <br>To be honest if I ever got the chance of meeting someone famous, this is the kinda everyday guy Id like to meet. Yeah hes a little awkwark at times and  like filthy rich, but relatable.

That is a great way to reach conclusions you might want to try out as other options. I like the moment he talked about the price of the fuel and he said a billion$ and everyone laughed except him. I knew he would not find it to be funny because he is the one that is funding it. He really understands the cost of things , moreso when they go wrong, but keeps goals in mind and does not waver. He is the child with the pez dispenser dreaming about filling a low orbit with his satellites in a similar manner and also a man still in touch with costs and the economic realities of making all these things he has been dreaming up for the good of humanity come to fruition.

Obviously we&#39;re not onsite touring every bit of new engineering methods and designs developed for this project, but many companies are so paranoid, secretive, and honestly just plain &#39;ole greedy, that access to roam around with the boss during extended interviews would simply not be a thing. It&#39;s also important that Elon genuinely appears to be as talented an engineer as his hand-selected engineering project leads, and is willing to simply have discussions with them to bounce off ideas and debate the positives of a given suggestion.

They&#39;re full of mistakes. Uploading bad captions is worse than using Youtube&#39;s auto-generated ones, because, with the latter option, you at least know to take them with a grain of salt.

While it would be nice to have handmade captions for every video, I recognise that that isn&#39;t realistic. Just leave it to Youtube&#39;s auto-generated captions, which have their own issues, but at least don&#39;t claim to be more accurate than they are! And if you&#39;re going to go to the trouble of creating your own captions, do it right or don&#39;t do it at all. But if you&#39;re uploading captions (without regard for their quality) in the hope that the Youtube algorithm will look more favorably upon a video that apparently has handmade captions, that certainly is despicable.<br><br>People use captions for various reasons. It isn&#39;t just the deaf. Because of the windy audio in this video, I imagine more people than usual will look to captions for help understanding.

One thing to alter: shorten-up the questions.  60 Minutes interviewers do two things: short to-the-point questions, and they rarely interrupt the interviewee... even allowing a long pause so allow the interviewee think for a moment and then add more insight to their answers.<br>3) Engage with some of the YouTube comments.
