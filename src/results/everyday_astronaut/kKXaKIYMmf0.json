Atmospheric density of earth decreases all the way up, not just after Max Q. I presume it is the way the craft interacts with air that changes, in a different way than breaking the sound barrier of course which happens earlier (mach 1) but I would think we ought to be able to visualize the Max Q change in some manner. An analogy would be useful. Maybe an arrow hitting a material at different speeds. Maybe jello.<br>I&#39;m guessing beyond Max Q is where air molecules are no longer compressing and pushing each other out of the way but more like ice being smacked away.<br>Raises a question: Why don&#39;t nose cones undergo at least one change of shape on the way up?", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T05:12:19Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "stephen hennesy", "comment_text": "Got this notification late af", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T04:48:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tom Delay Beats", "comment_text": "Paid actor.", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T04:48:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "joe mamma", "comment_text": "Sweeet mustache", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T04:44:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blake Davis", "comment_text": "Great to see the GPS SV4 start on its way towards its important mission.", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T04:36:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Arnold Lesin", "comment_text": "Why are they not trying to recover the fairings anymore?
