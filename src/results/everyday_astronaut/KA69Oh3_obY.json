And they will deliver exactly what Elon has been saying they will deliver for the past 10 years now.  The market is ONLY just starting to be convinced of that.  It&#39;s all starting to take off.  Pun intended.  If the success of Tesla is any indication for what the future of Starship will be, well, then I&#39;m convinced I&#39;ll see people land on Mars in my lifetime.  I&#39;m 45 now.

Competition between corporate entities will enhance even that, and I am all in favor of it. Political factors will always make government less efficient than private corporations and eleemosynary organizations at producing products or services. From the early sixties, I have thought the government erred in not having corporate partners in developing our space program. Such partnerships would lead to new products, technologies, etc. for general consumption that would generate profit for corporate partners and NASA alike. NASA&#39;s profits would reduce revenue dependency upon a fickle Congress and burdened taxpayers. <br>     Space-X may currently seem to be an alternate (to NASA) American space enterprise, but that could change for a number of reasons. Until humanity becomes a race of angels, we should not neglect, as a nation, to maintain a vigorous space program. SLS should continue until we have a better, more efficient system to replace it.

Add to this the facts that, except for a mock up, we haven&#39;t even seen a fully constructed Starship, that somehow during tests Space X has blown up the last several very crudely constructed fuel tanks (water towers?) which are a key component of its Starship, and that we haven&#39;t even seen the untested booster formerly known as the BFR or have any concrete information as to its stage of development.  (I might add that many engineers suspect that the BFR design requiring more than 30 rocket engines is flawed and very risky and that Space X is making the same mistakes as the Russians did during their moon rocket development with a strong possibility of a similar result). At this point, it would seem that canceling a competing program would be premature, even foolish. If and when Space X succeeds in getting Starship into low earth orbit using the BFR as the booster, then the argument to cancel  SLS may begin to make sense for the reasons you discussed. A realist would say that the chance of a Starship orbital flight in anything like the projected time frame is only 50-50 at best.", "comment_date": "2020-07-20T17:57:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Richard Park", "comment_text": "SLS will never fly.", "comment_date": "2020-07-20T03:57:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ryan Landfield", "comment_text": "Great video.

The private sector alone could never have achieved anything near the level of technology  we have today.  So many innovations developed by the private sector were started and funded by government.

TL;DR - This video is great. <br><br>I&#39;m a NASA engineer at Kennedy working with the Artemis program...and other partners*.  (Cool snippet with the ICPS in the SSPF high bay - I saw it too, along with the SN DreamChaser cargo module prototype).  First, KUDOS for clarifying that NASA does not compete with SpaceX - that&#39;s so annoying.  It&#39;s as ridiculous as saying that the Army competes with Boeing to build an Apache attack helicopter.  Ugh; failure to launch.  The best analogy of leveraging commercial partners (such as SpaceX) is like this: most normal people are inept at building cars from scratch in their garage (i.e. government), and it would similarly be a waste of time, money, and energy to do so in lieu of buying a Toyota or Ford.  NASA is a partner rather than the driver, while SpaceX builds it how they know best.  It&#39;s simply the model that the military (NRO included) has used for decades.   NASA has to deal with constantly changing presidential administrations, members of Congress, governors, etc.  It&#39;d rather be off &quot;sciencing&quot; stuff - in the words of the legendary Mark Watney.  It also learned very hard lessons about going fast and breaking things (Apollo 1, Challenger), and getting complacent (Columbia).  As Administrator Bridenstine said, when NASA fails, the President of the United States has to get on the phone and on TV and explain to the whole world about an international tragedy.  When we fail, America fails.  That&#39;s a degree of accountability orders of magnitude greater than what private companies will ever have to deal with...and I didn&#39;t celebrate Demo-2 until the astronauts came through the hatch on Station, to drive home the point.  Yes, you are 100% right about the army of contractors being a safety blanket...and it is just the price of doing business in this democracy.  Going back to risk aversion, why is NASA skittish?  I&#39;ll skit:<br>&quot;Hello, World Health Organization and hi there, CDC...welcome to our <b>Agencies Anonymous</b> therapy session for survivors of real life Kobayashi Maru scenarios.  Our name is NASA.&quot;  :-)<br>That&#39;s why.  Taxpayers are all too quick to grab pitchforks and pull funding when agencies make mistakes, or when we struggle to juggle plates while trying to walk on eggshells in a hurricane.  For every finger pointed at NASA, there&#39;s four pointed back at ourselves.  We got to the Moon in 8 years because they had 100,000 people building the VAB in less than 18 months, with no social media highlighting all the construction workers and wildlife killed in the process.  Everyone should implore your congressman to support Artemis, and to pour money into that rather than swashbuckling with the Iranians and Chinese, and perhaps SLS would have already launched.<br>That out of the way, I am younger than the Shuttle generation and fully support the commercialization approach.  We need their speed, their production capability, and their unique strengths for being profit-&amp;-schedule driven.  They cut corners where it makes sense, push the envelope regardless of what naysayers say, and are more insulated from political winds.  On the other hand, we have deep pockets, institutional experience, and can get them to slow down periodically and think critically about outcomes.  I personally think that NASA and the nation are better served by this synergy, as we focus more on what lies hidden in the cosmos, scientific discovery, navigating international cooperation, treaties, refining engineering principles, and freely sharing all of this body of knowledge with the public...that is why NASA does not compete with SpaceX.  NASA will not get the budget it needs until the taxpayers and pols see a real return on investment, and companies like SpaceX provide us both good PR, consistency, speed, and lower prices.  I have my own opinions on SLS, but suffice to say that I&#39;m optimistic that this new private commercial sector is here to stay.  <br>We are a team, with NASA the quarterback.  Artemis is not practical without SpaceX, Blue Origin, Sierra Nevada, and many others....and they have no mission or funding without the initial government investment in R&amp;D and scientific discovery.  NASA has to first get to the Moon and study lunar regolith before Blue can make a business case to get over there to mine it.   Starship is like the 787 Dreamliner, and SLS is the tried-and-true 737 (non-Max).  Both have growing pains.

The SLS program is operating with one hand tied behind its back because of the political constraints it has to deal with. Still, the Starship seems like it is just doomed to fail. But is SLS really that much better? No, not really. Unfortunately, Boeing has become SLS&#39;s biggest problem. Like always, the bean counters have come in and destroyed what was once a supreme engineering company.

Aerospace companies are ruthlessly evaluated for profit margins by Wall Street, and programs with low ROS destroy that margin.  No aerospace contractor wants to go over budget due to that.  They actually get higher ROS and the program finances better support the stock price when they come in under budget.  Everyone thinks going to fixed price contracting is better, but few realize that it will drive price up and often put smaller companies that can&#39;t account for the risk out of those types of contracts.

There is also the X model developed by JPL.  Boeing uses the Common method that engineers love.  Spacex uses a dynamic model.  The Common method is very safe because the final product is basically known before step 1 occurs.  It also tends to result in finished products with fewer flaws. It&#39;s also very expensive, inflexible, slow and tends to produce &quot;last week&#39;s model&quot; - outdated upon arrival.  Expensive because you don&#39;t work around a problem - you work through it - stick to the plan no matter what.  There is an old joke - if Boeing and NASA built a TV, it would be just like their rockets - massive and black and white.  In a Dynamic method,  each step plans the next step(s).  It requires that at the start, the final product be more conceptual than exact - because it will change.  It&#39;s fast, can be cheaper, and can respond to changes in the &quot;problem&quot; (the end goals), and produces cutting edge products.  It is also not as safe, prone to lots of prototyping, and has a great deal of untested tech.  The X model I don&#39;t know everything about - but it seems to be a mix of the other two models.  Which you might expect from JPL.  NASA probably uses something similar.  The triad method is something the government uses in everything from safety protocols to cleaning up super fund sites.

In other words, their incumbent suppliers functioned as if they were the only game in town...because they were. The &#39;bidding&#39; process crafted a VIP club where only they could enter. But, it was on the taxpayer&#39;s dime. SpaceX and NASA are friends now based on what they say for the sake of PR. But your slides show that the economics that NASA functioned under reached a point of breakdown. I think, without a doubt, NASA needs SpaceX just as much as the NASA funding helped in SpaceX&#39;s growth.

Once the plan was ready, they chopped it up and told everyone &quot;Do it like this, no deviations when avoidable, because if you change anything, we&#39;ll have to update all the plans we handed to the other companies as well&quot;.<br><br>SpaceX on the other hand is just &quot;trying out&quot; things and improving what needs to be improved on in a rapid schedule. If you don&#39;t know which of two options is better, try to find out by reason for a short time. If there&#39;s no clear winner, make an educated guess and just go with that. The key is to not lose time arguing what should be done. Save that time and thereby a lot of money by trying it now. If it happens to work out, good for you, if not, you probably have enough time to re-iterate; even better, if you were really fast, you might have enough time to switch over to the alternative altogether.<br><br>As a matter of fact, being a software developer, I can totally relate to both approaches. My company is too small to develop everything on our own. So we outsource some of the work to different companies, and it&#39;s a lot of work to keep everyone synchronized and informed about changes any company or we ourselves had to make to any communicated plans. On the other hand, when we develop something internally, we have already overthrown major parts of the code base, because we learned while maintaining our old code base. But the only reason we could do that, was because we could do it completely internally, and needn&#39;t inform anyone else about it. It&#39;s way easier to brief 4 people sitting around the same table, than writing an email to 14 external developers in 4 different external companies.<br><br>As for what approach I prefer, I think NASA should not develop a rocket at all. NASA should focus on raising funds for the scientific parts of those missions. Federal agencies are best when the return of invest is located in a far future or uncertain. Building space telescopes, conducting micro gravity experiments, and stuff like this which have no inherent commercial value is what NASA thrives at. Rockets on the other hand, or more precisely cheap launch pricing, bigger payload capacity, or TLI-capabilities, are of commercial interest already. Let &quot;lightweight&quot; businesses like SpaceX do the work to make whatever they do profitable. They will have enough investors who are trying to harness the economical advantage that cheap launch pricing has anyway. Facebook and Google are not interested in whether or not there&#39;s a black hole in the center of every galaxy, and whether or not lettuce can be grown in space. But putting satellites into orbit for 2 million instead of 200 million per launch, that&#39;s something Facebook and Google are interested in. Those projects will always be funded one way or another.

People seem to talk about going to Mars like it&#39;s &quot;just around the block&quot; from the Moon.  There is a quite substantial difference in distance.  And unlike the Moon&#39;s fairly constant distance, the distance to Mars varies enormously throughout the 2-year cycle of our orbits, with the Sun coming between us!  Maybe you can illustrate that and other difficulties/challenges, and what solutions exist.  I mean, Elon seems set on building a colony on Mars.  Is he crazy?  Or does he have all the problems solved?  But just concentrate on the trip, maybe.  One hurdle at a time. :)  Is there a problem with 6 months of weightlessness going to Mars, and potentially another 6 months coming back to Earth right away in the event of not being able to land there?  Would manned flights be made in a single ship?  To such a remote destination as has never been attempted before...by a long shot...is it wise to go in just one ship?  What if you arrive in Mars orbit to find out you cannot land or return to Earth?  How long do you have to wait for rescue?  Can it help to send 2 to 10 ships simultaneously for mutual support?  After all, you can&#39;t do like Apollo 13 and just swing around Mars to come back to Earth.  And there are no &quot;life boats&quot; along the way.  If Starship is to go land on Mars, I would think you would first want to fly the heck out that thing in cislunar space with several 3-month flights to be damned sure it works flawlessly on long duration flights.  And land it in remote, desert locations on Earth, like Antarctica, Australian desert, New Mexico desert, and high plains of Peru or Chile...and refuel and takeoff back to orbit from those locations...although, Earth is a deeper gravity well.

The habitation ring is around 149 meters around the circumference and would be 100 meters tall along with enough area for gardens, for food and co2 exchange, gyms, science equipment, mars gravity testing facilities, and hotels and tourist attractions. The effect of a station of this magnitude would cause drastic decrease in money to get ships to other celestial bodies because you could process raw material and not have to send up prebuilt parts.

I have been giving SpaceX starship a great deal of thought. about landing on the Moon or even Mars. It will crash,  the way it is now. Sorry! Stop and Think, the star hoper has legs even the boosters have legs that come down. Now Elon wants the legs to be on the inside the truster housing. Two things wrong with that. One back flame, you would have to mush blowback in the Trust house to handle it. Plus uneven ground. Every time SpaceX has recovered rockets they have land on flat even ground made of concrete. Nowhere on the Moon or Mars do they have that? You would also have to take in the weight of the Starship. Apollo had big pads to land on, Right? One it will sink into the ground and tip over. You have seen what happens to it if an uneven load does. Right?  Sorry people I really wish he can pull it off.

These types of arrangements normally last for the length of a typical industry framework (say 5-15 years) and then after that the client/supplier relationship is so bad that all the bridges get burnt, and the client has to get back to stage 1 on the thing they wanted done with a different supplier.<br><br>Lump sum is the opposite. The client enters an arrangement knowing that the only way for the supplier to make profit is for them to streamline the process and reduce wastage. Also, if there are issues in program, it&#39;s the supplier who has to deal with them. Yes - this typically means the supplier adds risk to their proposal fee (and hence usually makes them look more expensive at the outlay) - but the result is usually a better relationship. The customer gets what they wanted sooner, and in the future the supplier has worked out better ways of working and can do it cheaper next time, while still making a tidy profit. The only risk with lump sum is cowboy suppliers, who will deliver a &#39;product&#39; but with very low quality because they saved money by cutting all the corners. Quality management is the client&#39;s best friend at this point and can usually prevent this from happening.<br><br>Lump sum is ALWAYS better for the client and supplier. Cost+ is absolutely terrible and the only people who like it are people who sit in board meetings at overinflated engineering companies who have confused the terms &#39;revenue&#39; and &#39;profit&#39;, or suppliers who know they lack the appropriate staff and resources to do a better job.

On that program, both the prime contractor and NASA are to blame for the overruns in cost and schedule. Because of all these realities, one can&#39;t expect to have fixed price contracts for these programs. If you did, the contractors would not bid on them.", "comment_date": "2020-05-02T03:28:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Im1CrazyCow", "comment_text": "To all who Want to BUY Tim&#39;s Gear.......

(For example: EFT-1 tested a heat shield that isn&#39;t on Artemis-1--the mission formerly known as EM-1--or any future Orion capsule.)  Lots of design changes led to inefficiencies where the Contractors were willing to do and re-do and re-do because of the nature of their contract.  United Launch Alliance act like they are getting paid to work on a rocket, not to launch one.  <br>Also, as for hiring contractors, only to lay them off or reassign them, then try to bring them back later: That&#39;s exactly what they do and why NASA hires contractors.  Rather than build a bunch of Orion heat shields, it looks like they are having the contractor build them one at a time, dismissing the team in between, and reconstituting it later to build the next at some point months or years down the road. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they do similar with the crews working on other critical components.<br>SpaceX, meanwhile, is doing Starship R&amp;D largely out of their own profits (while still pricing services below their competitors) because their goal is not to earn government funding, but to build highly-capable, inexpensive to operate rockets.  As Elon has noted, the hard part that they&#39;re working on is building a rocket _factory_, not just building a rocket.<br>SpaceX only gets paid if they deliver a product customers want.  SpaceX&#39;s constraints are their objectives, not satisfying Congress&#39; need to funnel money to their home districts, and due to that, it seems like there have been a number of questionable moves on the part of government to shore up the SLS (see Europa Clipper).  <br>You noted that SpaceX were one of the three in the running for the Human Landing System (HLS), but it is worth highlighting that they are getting less than a quarter of what Blue Origin / Lockheed / Northrup are getting paid ($579M) for the first 10-months of development on a stripped-down version of Starship ($135M) that is for lunar-lander only operations (but still big enough to just about fit the third competitor from Dynetics&#39; consortium ($253M) in the cargo bay).  I guess that would make Starship-HLS the 4th version in addition to cargo, fuel, and crewed-reentry, and it seems likely the lunar-lander funds will be used to accelerate the development other 3 as well, but are probably only a fraction of the actual cost to develop the HLS version.  Although in fairness, I should point out that NASA is already working with SpaceX on a separate project to develop in-orbit refueling, because NASA wants to use the technology and Starship relies on it.  With Starship-HLS landing on the moon, SpaceX would have even more data to feed into the production of the other versions, along with time, money, and experience to perfect the Raptor and its mass-production, so it seems to be in SpaceX&#39;s interests to subsidize the development with their own money.", "comment_date": "2020-05-02T01:48:39Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Gordon Chin", "comment_text": "SLS is showing us how underpowered the space shuttle and its derivatives are and how The Old Boy&#39;s Club is perpetuating a bad design to wallow in tax payer&#39;s money indefinitely.", "comment_date": "2020-05-02T01:40:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tesla Genius/Fan", "comment_text": "Love the content, hoping the upcoming videos are as good as this cause this is goooooddddddddd!", "comment_date": "2020-05-02T01:38:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lionel KJ7OFH", "comment_text": "OK.

The whole idea that NASA develops and operates it&#39;s own super heavy lift rocket may have made sense 10+ years ago. Back then you wouldn&#39;t find a private company targeting 100 tons to low earth orbit, moving terrestrial heavy industry to space or trips to Mars for their own purposes. Now that this exists, and especially since we are talking about US companies, the idea that NASA needs to have this capability of it&#39;s own is outdated. Another important skeleton in the SLS closet is that the technology doesn&#39;t really go anywhere new. NASA gets a big rocket and what is effectively a better crew and service module than during their last moon trip but how exactly will that let you do new science or push further into space? In order to make that happen you need resuability and in orbit refuling. The SLS does nothing to develop NASA hardware with these capabilities. SpaceX however is purposely looking to develop all these capabilities for their goal of reaching Mars and their commercial needs. And the same can be said for Blue Origin even though their plans are not yet finalised and what they have revealed seem more geared towards commercial use than accomplishing Bezos long term goal of moving or establishing heavy industry in space. <br><br>Now I&#39;m not saying NASA don&#39;t need their own hardware in space or should just stop having things built to spec. I&#39;m just saying there is no need for them to design all of it. Award a contract to SpaceX for an adaptor to the Super Heavy that can launch NASA hardware and possibly a propulsion stage that can be refuled in orbit, perform altitude control, offer multiple restarts and be controlled either from the ground or via an attached module and suddenly you have company building things custom for you that rely on hardware they were developing either way. In terms of cost savings you can write this off from money saved by not launching another 4 SLS rockets after the once that are planned. Going with the assumption that we will see horrible inflation that still leaves you with a budget of slightly less than ~$3000M after adjustments. So even if they end up finalising the SLS and use it for Artemis 1-4 it&#39;s hard to deny that this is a much better way to move forward past that point than to buy any further SLS launches or keep paying for enhancements on more cost+ contracts to companies who has no use of what they are building outside of said contracts. The thing is though that if NASA want&#39;s to do this they need to be ready to pay for it within the next 1-2 years. Because once SpaceX actually has a working prototype of their entire stack any adaptions to suit future NASA needs will be much more expensive as it may require unplanned redesign of existing parts. By the way I&#39;m not saying that SpaceX should get exclusive rights to offer such capabilities, but let them make it now since it coincides with their plan then offer the same sum to Blue Origin or ULA if their hardware ever evolves towards similar capabilities. Just don&#39;t make another cost+ contract for it with a company that has no further use for such capabilities outside of government work.", "comment_date": "2020-05-01T17:25:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "NG1 N3", "comment_text": "Orange rocket bad", "comment_date": "2020-05-01T17:20:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Random Tube", "comment_text": "I felt like this video was just 8 minutes long!\u2764\ufe0f", "comment_date": "2020-05-01T17:19:51Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Adrian Wasawo", "comment_text": "It would be an interesting bet to see whether SLS in Artemis 1 or Starship reaches orbit first.", "comment_date": "2020-05-01T17:18:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "NG1 N3", "comment_text": "They don&#39;t exist at the same time, starship is still in prototype phase.

Maezawa is not going to the moon within in the 2020s, I&#39;ll wager that much. Hate to sound cynical guys but it&#39;s just too ambitious for the timeline.

SLS is old tech and too expensive, and as a taxpayer, I seriously dislike cost-plus contracting.  Kill it.<br><br><br>But not right away, because we <b>do</b> need heavy lift, and Starship is not a done deal.  They&#39;re going fast, and that makes me very happy, but Starship is undeniably a risky project.  SpaceX will go at the pace that works for them, but we don&#39;t really know how quickly they will get to their milestones.  Or <b>if</b> they will get there.  If we kill SLS right now, and Starship is delayed or fails, we&#39;ll be out of luck.<br><br><br>There is a lot to excite me about Starship.  Full reusablility!  That gets my juices flowing.  Cheap steel and cheap assembly: no clean rooms required (well, I dunno about the Raptor part).  The hull, tanks and fittings can be assembled out in the open, exactly like a water tower.  Raptor looks ready to go, very cool engine.  SpaceX will have to solve orbital refueling, and that is amazing all by itself.<br><br><br>So what&#39;s playing in my head right now are two images.<br><br><br>One is Starship dropping to the moon to land next to little spidery low-cargo landers made by someone else.  The  cute little landers are unloading handsful of cargo.  Starship unlimbers a winch and starts dropping tons.  Am I amazed at the incongruity of that image?  Yes, I am.<br><br><br>The other is an image of Starship plummeting through Earth&#39;s atmosphere on a return trip, hauling passengers who will attempt to survive a tail-first powered landing.  Y&#39;know, the idea of riding <b>up</b> on a rocket is terrifying enough.  Starship&#39;s mostly free-fall descent followed by a burst of last-second flames to rapidly decelerate to touchdown is orders of magnitude more terrifying.<br><br><br>NASA will surely use Starship once it&#39;s working, but I bet no-one at NASA will agree to put astronauts on a landing Starship, either on the Moon or on Earth.  No way, no how.  They&#39;ll insist on using a capsule to get their people down to Earth and a lunar lander for the moon.  I, for one, won&#39;t be able to blame them.  Maybe after 500 landings with no accidents, we could get NASA interested in riding a rocket butt-first into hard objects.  Maybe not even then.<br><br><br>There are many details to sort out in the Artemis program, including how Starship will be used for it (if it&#39;s ready), what particular roles will be assigned to particular spacecraft, how it will all come together.

I am also a government contractor and as Tim eluded to, there is so much inefficiency in gov&#39;t work, it&#39;s disheartening. I want to see a transition to gov&#39;t - corporate partnerships. I would love NASA to act as the liaison between congress and the corporate entities that would make up the aerospace industry. I would love to see everything owned and operated by corporations, with some funding, guidance, and regulations set by NASA. I personally believe the gov&#39;t should only be running the things that the public deems necessary but would not be profitable for a corporation to invest their capital into. Going to space isn&#39;t making anybody super rich just yet, and that&#39;s why I am grateful for even the SLS program.

Your logic in explaining Nasa&#39;s Gymnastic of funding was very informative, and I think it was right on.  Is it the Best way to build a Rocket, Maybe not.. But you can&#39;t deny the fact that they have pulled it off. Through Multiple Presidential Administrations, and may other challenges going on around the world.  About the only other think I would have to add, that Nasa Does, that SpaceX does Not, is catalogue and preserve the knowledge that they have achieved.  Maybe they were not perfect in everything, but their achievements through the last 50 some odd years is undeniable.  It has taken many years to get the Private Sector to even believe they could build a rocket in a commercial venture, The next 50 years is looking to be an explosion of Commercial Expansion that will make the Airplane look like a Bicycle compared to a Car.  Since I&#39;m almost 60 Years old, and STILL have the dream of seeing Mars with my own eyes without a camera, I actually am feeling that I may be able to achieve my goal before I leave this world.  and for THAT!!

A pre-flown booster today cost as much now as the first Falcon 9 (V1) rocket did brand new when they first started launching them 10 years ago. This is completely the opposite of what Elon has stated would happen in the past. He once talked about Falcon 9&#39;s costing as little as $5 million to launch. As it currently stands, the fairing alone cost $6 million. Now, from what I understand, there are planned price drops as of next year but they aren&#39;t anywhere near as significant as he had hinted years ago.<br><br>Now, I know that the current Falcon 9 V5 is a far more capable rocket compared to V1 but I have no doubt that the same improvements will be made to Starship. They will continue to improve upon the design and the rocket will become increasingly more capable. And like the Falcon 9, I just don&#39;t see the launch cost going down due to this. Even if Starship is 100% reusable. I imagine that by the time we see any chance of a price drop SpaceX will move onto their next big idea (EG a Mars base and/or new launch vehicle) and will require funding for that so prices will continue to remain relatively high.<br><br>I&#39;m not trying to bash SpaceX here.

There&#39;s nothing &quot;conservative&quot; about SLS in actual practice.<br><br>The whole point of SLS was to be a shortcut.  It was going to use hardware that industry already knew how to build and already had the facilities to produce, making it cheaper and faster than &quot;starting from scratch.&quot;  SLS was never intended to be some bleeding edge experimental vehicle - it was supposed to just work without much trouble, because all the R&amp;D had already been done in the 1970s with STS/Shuttle.  But as you describe in the video, they have thrown this one-and-only selling point of SLS completely out the window in favor of redesigning the core stage, which means that as a shortcut, SLS has already failed . . . . Unless the whole point of SLS was <i>really</i> to make work for a bunch of silver-haired, rent-seeking parasites in a space-industrial complex, in which case it&#39;s worked exactly as intended.  But from a cost perspective, it&#39;s the worst of both worlds, because we&#39;re getting an expendable rocket that uses solids for probably the same money that it would have taken to just develop a superior all-new vehicle, if not more.

SLS has gone through rigors and is posed but still hasn&#39;t flown. Starship has enormous potential but is in its infancy in development. NASA should continue with SLS until Starship can prove it can take the reins. On the cost issue, SLS is extremely expensive but the development costs are part of that equation. Bridenstein says that by ordering more now, will bring down the cost. When you consider the STS, it too was never fully developed. It never did fly back boosters or liquid fueled boosters, it never did Shuttle C, and other improvements. Those developments that would have improved and cut costs of the system were never developed. Looking at the military, almost all of their systems were given later developments that made them better, faster, cheaper ie: FA18E. If SLS is aloud to mature, and not go the way of the shuttle, X33, etc., then we may see a more cost effective SLS system. If not, then a matured Starship or some future system will take it&#39;s place.

NASA, on the other hand, while their management right now is horrible, has actually designed and done the math on the SLS before building it. SpaceX has done a good job making large failures look small, they can&#39;t do that for long, until people realize how SpaceX is not being careful.

By that time, both Blue Origin and SpaceX had voiced their desires to build larger, more capable spacecraft.  NASA should have begun the Commercial Space Partnership Initiative (I just came up with that, so feel free to tear it apart).  With that initiative, NASA would have used the funds earmarked for SLS at that time, to provide grants to companies working on designs for large, heavy lift capability spacecraft.  The NASA facilities being used by SLS at that time, would have then be made available for lease by such companies so that the workforce at those facilities wouldn&#39;t be left jobless.  NASA should never have granted Boeing (or anyone else) a 3rd extension/funding increase once other viable entities were in the market.  VERY poor mismanagement of that division of NASA.  The administrator (who I actually liked) should have gone to Congress and outlined why the SLS should have been cancelled way back then, and that the funds should be instead used for this initiative.  Imagine the launching capabilities we&#39;d have had 2 years ago if companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin had been given that kind of funding 5 years ago!", "comment_date": "2020-04-30T18:10:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Furrrburger", "comment_text": "Oh Tim uploaded a 50 minute video...everything else can wait today!", "comment_date": "2020-04-30T18:09:49Z", "likes_count": 6}, {"comment_by": "Sonderax", "comment_text": "In the time it will take for Nasa to get SLS to the moon. explore and return SpaceX will be able to build 1-2 Starships.
