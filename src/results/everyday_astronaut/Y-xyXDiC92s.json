When you pass hydrogen peroxide over potassium permanganate, the peroxide breaks down into water and oxygen gas. This is a very exothermic reaction, so the water will very often boil if you have enough mass in one place reacting. So in turn, you have steam power, yes, but you also have large amounts of oxygen gas being produced mixing with that steam. This reaction is done quite often on a small scale and classrooms and in shows and is known as the elephants toothpaste experiment when soap is mixed with the peroxide.

One of the main reasons why Russia was able to develop those high efficiency staged combustion cycles was because of the grade of kerosene they were able to get. <br><br>Heavy hydrocarbons are often hard to work with in engines because of a process called coking, where deposits of solid carbon (called coke or lacquer) form on the walls of your combustion chamber/regen cooling channels. This can be bad because you can have channels clogged with these deposits and it also lowers combustion efficiency. <br><br>Standard aviation fuels in the US (Jet-A or JP-8) are not coking resistant whereas fuels like JP-7 and RP-1 are because they\u2019re more refined. One of the main bad actors in the generation of coke is it\u2019s sulfur content. Sulfur acts as a catalyst for coking. <br><br>And it turns out, the oil mined in the Soviet Union contained naturally much less sulfur than the oil mines and refined in the US. This actually made it a lot easier for them to use kerosene as a coolant, and allowed them to work towards developing those engines when for the most part the US decided to focus on unlocking hydrogen as a fuel.", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T21:38:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Valeriy Nefedov", "comment_text": "I once heard a beautiful phrase.

Like that Glushko was a pioneer in rocket engines <i>before</i> the war, and how blown away they were at the first sight of the A4&#39;s engine, which they called &quot;something that couldn&#39;t be&quot; for having 10x more thrust they&#39;ve ever been able to achieve at home. Or that the whole point behind R1 was to recreate A4 with indigenous materials: A4 used some 80 steel alloys, while USSR at the time had only ~30 to offer. It was mostly about metallurgy. Or that the Germans they brought back were not actually rocket scientists (Americans scooped all of those), just very good generic engineers and scientists who had to learn rocket science along with the Russians. And the sad part that the Germans, despite their good nature, honest work, and genuinely good ideas, were placed in a bubble on an island and never allowed access to real design work, their efforts mostly thrown in the garbage for the fears of sabotage or espionage.", "comment_date": "2021-11-25T00:24:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "oakrootm", "comment_text": "I\u2019ll bet this is on Elon\u2019s watch list.
