You said it yourself. To go from a circular parking orbit to a geosynchronous transfer orbit you have to do a burn on the opposite side of the planet to where you want the satellite  to be positioned. The satellite itself then burns to  insert itself into a new circular parking orbit when it&#39;s on the opposite side of the planet to the second burn (of the second stage). This parking orbit is at geostationary distance. There are further complications inasmuch as the plane of the geostationary orbit is the same as the equatorial plane, but the plane of the second stage parking orbit is a bit weird (consequence of launch location). Second burn compensates for this. You can see this adjustment on the video where the ground trace rises from Mauritius into the Indian Ocean during the second burn. The satellite geostationary insertion burn will also correct orbital plane. These correction burns explain why it takes a day or so to dock with the space station. Similar issues exist. The other complication is that the Earth is spinning under the orbit.", "comment_date": "2018-02-01T10:30:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JoeBusLife", "comment_text": "@Everyday Astronaut What kind of internet do you have?
