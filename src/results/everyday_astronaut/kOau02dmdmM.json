There is no such thing as a &quot;new&quot; SRB no matter which vehicle you are talking about they all work on decades old super toxic and unstable fuels plastic or rubber based fuels. SRBs are the worst in every way that matters: they have the lowest ISP of all, they can not really be reused, they are the only rocket engines that produce extremely toxic exhaust even when functioning correctly and they produce the most greenhouse gasses of any rocket engines by a large margin. SRBs are basically huge plastic fires accelerated with an oxidizer all packed into the same unstable tube, hence they are extremely unsafe by default once ignited they cannot stopped unlike all other rocket types can.", "comment_date": "2020-11-14T07:59:43Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "P Express Airline", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOau02dmdmM&amp;t=35m08s\">35:08</a> tea-tab green flash", "comment_date": "2020-11-14T07:19:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "angelolachica", "comment_text": "Are you going to live in the lunch of crew dragon crew-1", "comment_date": "2020-11-14T07:08:10Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Jason Wrinkle", "comment_text": "it is a sad day whenever NRO launches anything without an explosion", "comment_date": "2020-11-14T06:34:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thomas Belmont", "comment_text": "Sitting at a traffic light in Boca Raton, about 150 miles south, and was treated to to the sight of this magnificent launch illuminated by the setting sun.
