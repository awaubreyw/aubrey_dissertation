SpaceX may even ultimately wind up providing a lander for Artemis. Nonetheless, Artemis is dependent on Congressional funding and is a political football. SpaceX is going to the Moon with or without NASA. They will, if they win the contract (which I am certain they will) develop their Lunar Starship for NASA as a lander for Artemis. That will not stop them from developing their standard Starship which will be fully capable of going from the surface of the Earth to the surface of the Moon and back again. They will have their own money, from launch and Starlink profits to conduct that project in parallel with the NASA funded Lunar Starship project. They will begin sending their own manned missions to the Moon, independent of NASA, when they are ready, whether that is before or after or instead of Artemis getting to the Moon, depending on the political situation. <br>I am quite certain that, if Congress does fund Artemis for a Lunar landing, either in 2024 or later, that it will not be long before SLS/Orion is scrapped in favor of a pure Starship architecture. My guess is that the Gateway will be kept, even though with Starship taking over it will be more useless than ever, because it is an international project and, having promised our international partners participation in it, including carrying their astronauts to the surface, we will be unable to then back out of it. I know for a fact that Bridenstine expects that to be a major factor in keeping Artemis funded and not being cancelled, because he told me so himself.<br>So, SpaceX is going to the Moon, in partnership with, in parallel with, or without NASA depending on how the political winds blow.", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T21:41:08Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Pepsi Man 101", "comment_text": "There&#39;s no point end Tim!....", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T21:25:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Brian wild", "comment_text": "The hoses are the automatic fire suppression system", "comment_date": "2020-05-19T21:08:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Morten Flecks", "comment_text": "Tim, stop appolegizing!
