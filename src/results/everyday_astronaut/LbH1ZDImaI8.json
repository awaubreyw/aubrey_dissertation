I chipped my hands around a friend\u2019s ear and shouted instructions from one inch away at the top of my lungs on the photography we were doing. He was unable to hear me. The legs of the slacks I was wearing were flapping as if a wind was hitting them. It was completely calm. The flame shooting sideways out of the flame bucket was a few stories High and I guessed about 700\u2019 long horizontally. It was wickedly ferocious looking. It\u2019s been a little over half a century now but I\u2019m still impressed by my memory of it. I later flew down to the cape and watched the final flight of Apollo, Apollo 17, lift off at night from 10 miles away. We could barely hear it by comparison at that distance, but it lit the sky up like a sunrise. After staging with the hydrogen burning second stage engines, it looked like a breeding start moving rapidly through the constellations. Many years later, during the Shuttle program, I saw one reentering the atmosphere late at night from Gulfport Mississippi heading south to fly over the Gulf of Mexico toward Florida at an altitude of 35 miles at a speed of 5000 mph. I got that information the next day via a phone call to the Johnson Space Center. It looked like an orange meteor with a long white tail of ionized gas. It casts moving shadow under a bright streetlight. Two minutes after it faded out over the Gulf I heard a characteristic double sonic boom. I never saw it launched though I drove down to KSC and waited once. I never had another proper opportunity. Hopefully the  SLS will become a flying vehicle one day, assuming a lot of things, and I can go see it. I have a much longer way to go to beer there these days. I now live in Iowa, only about 2-1/2 hours south of you!  SRBs are very very bright. I saw the launch of Voyager 2 in 1977 from 4 miles away on a tour bus on a sunny summer Saturday. It like looking at two Suns, the pair of solid rocket boosters strapped on the Titan rocket. Of course those were much smaller than the ones on the Space Shuttle and what will be on the SLS. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing if I can get as close or closer to a launch and get \u201cblinded\u201d by the light. We\u2019ll see\u2026\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f(Wow WOW would I like to see a full up flight of Starship some day too. That would be incredible.

And it&#39;s necessary to improve the performances near perfection and decrease the fuel waist to a minimum in order to successfully uplift technology and humans to the lower earth orbit with sufficient speed to orbit these indeed. It&#39;s obvious the margins are really limited. Not talking about geostationary moon, and other planets / star systems. I really would like to explore with you how bad thing would get if earth&#39;s mass and size had been slightly bigger, like 10% more mass (and accordingly higher radius to keep the density close which is easy maths but I&#39;m lazy / why bothering as you&#39;re the man anyway) would it still be feasible? How much costs would increase? Technological doability?  Would we humans have been able to make it to the moon in 1969? Or would we have had to wait year 2000 to orbit our first satellite... Auhwwr Sprout-Nike, then now preparing for our first moon attempt? Or 2100 with... Xiout-Nyk, then 3000++ for the moon with Chang&#39;e Babe Antimatter/Fusionpowered Mission? What size and weight for the earth would mean to your mind, a planet the intelligent species the size of humans, however smart it could be, would never leave because it&#39;s just too much G&#39;s too much resources... And of course on the other side we know some small systems where many small planets orbit the star at a distance of barely the moon&#39;s distance from earth, meaning if they have some moons, the first human moon travel would have been possible just right after the invention of jet planes, and i a same way comparing difficulties with out own situation, starting from a light planet or a light moon, we would have been able to travel to another planet as early as in 1969, and we would now have colonized a few other planets, and obviously have already human travelled on most of our system planets? Or what if we had started as a species living on Mars? Leaving Mars would have been easier, but then the earth would be considered a bit like we see Venus, a dangerous high gravity, high pressured planet, plus it would seems impossible to come back from there, lifting up humans from such a high gravity when we only experienced &quot;easy rocket science&quot;. Are there some places in the universe where it&#39;s possible to imagine an intelligent species of low body size/weight could have already at our technological development, already colonised other close star systems? I consider this would be a very attractive video, maybe a &quot;first&quot; if you manage to do it as seriously as you do anything these days, it could be a learn&amp;dream perfect matching duo, and a very successful click-me video. And really a help to understand our own strategies, like it&#39;s easier to understand why the belly flip, or why the 7 minutes of terror, or the raptor&#39;s physics when we ca compare to what would have been the challenges had the gravity been different, or had the pressure have been really higher/lower etc. Could even explore what if we were an aquatic species.

When you were talking to Elon about how 1lb of mass almost equals two when &quot;fully considered&quot; you were talking about avoiding a vicious cycle. Saving mass then, would be a virtuous cycle. These are book-ends to the middle condition of trade-offs. <br><br>You&#39;re right that in engineering you quite often have to settle for trade-offs, and picking the best trade-off is the best you can do, BUT, this is NOT always true. Two great examples are the US redesign of the Panama Canal featuring Gatun Lake, and the design of the F-16 fighter jet which uses the tail as a lifting body, augmenting the lift of the wing, instead of working against the lift of the wing, AND balancing the plane so that it provides no lift, up or down as it crosses through the sound barrier, completely eliminating Trim Drag. As a result, the F-16 has up to 15%less total drag, and also goes through Mach 1.0 without any hesitation at all. <br><br>It&#39;s a small point, but an important one. As an engineer you always know immediately that you have found a good solution when everything gets better. Catching SH&#39;s grid fins with MegaZilla so the mass of the legs can be moved off the spaceship and into Stage 0 is a perfect case of a virtuous cycle, so again, not a trade-off, because everything gets better.", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T21:24:08Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Michael Casareo", "comment_text": "Tim Dodd, thanks for all the awesome videos.

I love this great video, but I have a question. <br>There is one point I don&#39;t get: You say, that in all cycles, the preburner chamber is the point of highest pressure in the whole engine. Okay. <br>You say, that in all the engines, the chamber pressure can not be higher than the pump pressure, and so the pumps have a lot of load on their tiny metal shoulders. That sounds like a disadvantage relative to the full flow... <br>And then you switch to the full flow, but don&#39;t mention at any point the relation between the chamber pressure and the pump pressure. <br>And so it sounds, as if the full flow solves this problem, but in my understanding it rises the problem. In the full flow engine the pump pressure MUST be far HIGHER than the chamber pressure, because everything downstream of the preburner chamber is on lower pressure . But you mention, because of the mass flow in the turbines, the pressure in the turbines can be LOWER. But isn&#39;t the goal of the full flow engine to archive higher chamber pressures?

The reason H2 needs to be kept cool is not to keep it liquid--that can be managed using pressurized tanks. The problem with hydrogen is that it&#39;s a very small molecule, the smallest multi-atom molecule. It tends to pass through ANY storage materials eventually. The rate of escape is dependent on pressure, and lowering the temperature lowers the pressure and thus the escape rate. Lowering the temperature to the boiling point of hydrogen would prevent escape, but that&#39;s prohibitively expensive even on Earth, except in the places where it&#39;s manufactured in large quantities. Larger molecules (like methane) can be contained indefinitely by a variety of materials without worrying about the temperature as much as the structural integrity of the container.<br><br>Thrust-to-weight ratio of an engine usually doesn&#39;t matter much, because the weight of the engine is usually dwarfed by the weight of the fuel, usually by ten-to-one or more. What matters more are the thrust-to-SIZE ratio and the ISP. The engine size determines how many you can fit on the rocket&#39;s base, while the ISP helps determines available delta-v. Several of the other engines here are the endpoint of that line of reasoning, varying in thrust and reusability.<br><br>It seems that SpaceX is betting that one engine design can meet all of their future needs. They need to be careful here; having 39 engines on one stage means 39 times as many points of failure. I don&#39;t know if they intend to build redundancy in by using more engines than needed by a stage and then running them at less that full power, so that any in-flight failures can be compensated for; but that seems like a cost that can be streamlined by designing a more reliable engine. Just the plumbing involved is a nightmare, as the Soviet engineers discovered when building the N1. SpaceX will be forced to design a new engine at some point in order to launch an all-up crewed Starship. Otherwise, several launches will be needed to assemble the ship in orbit by launching the uncrewed Starship, then the crew in a smaller launch, and finally the fuel.", "comment_date": "2021-04-11T00:29:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Bogdanich", "comment_text": "The SLS engine is not an RS-25.

Here is hoping someday someone will crack the invisible wall and see if the F-1 can be usable again, except perhaps a scaled down version . . . .  I love how you still use the F-1 for comparison though, because it is actually a great piece to measure by.

Now, while it&#39;s not the point of the video and you&#39;re not actually saying anything that is wrong in any way, it did, at least to me, give the impression as though  1:1 was the stoichiometric ratio, where all oxidizer and fuel is burnt and nothing gets left over. This would make it seem as though hydrolox ideally burns oxygen-rich.<br><br>However, the opposite is the case. The stoichiometric ratio for hydrolox is 8:1, so actually rockets carry more hydrogen than that, burn fuel rich and push unburned hydrogen out of the exhaust. The reason for this is that hydrogen is such a small molecule, and this means that it is much better at turning thermal energy into kinetic energy than heavier molecules, such as oxygen or water vapor. Basically, unburned hydrogen gets accelerated to much higher speeds in the combustion chamber than anything else, and the difference is so large that it&#39;s more efficient to run fuel-rich. For the highest ISP (specific impulse), the ratio would actually be 4.7:1! This also comes with the advantage of burning cooler, making it easier for the materials.<br>But since hydrogen takes such large tanks to store, it ultimately doesn&#39;t make sense to actually use this ideal ratio and the 6:1 is the compromise between running fuel rich to be more efficient and saving weight.<br><br>Now, this really doesn&#39;t matter for the point of the video, but basically, you&#39;d theoretically expect the bar for the hydrogen to be a bit lower, not much higher.", "comment_date": "2020-04-03T08:43:19Z", "likes_count": 54}, {"comment_by": "Loll Marcel", "comment_text": "Great video thank you so much, big support from France !!!!!!", "comment_date": "2020-03-31T08:54:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ruler of Monkeys", "comment_text": "I want a NEWTONS 3RD LAW machine", "comment_date": "2020-03-30T21:08:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Asger Vestbjerg", "comment_text": "Great intro to the subject<br>Thanks for sharing\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\ude00", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T18:02:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ZenGolf99", "comment_text": "Great Video!", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T14:58:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "zzebowa", "comment_text": "You have a really annoying voice and way of speaking.", "comment_date": "2020-03-29T13:58:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dan Jones", "comment_text": "Methane is cheap!

The imperfections are called &quot;dislocations&quot; and there are usually millions of them in any cubic millimeter of metal. Dislocations tend to move more easily as you raise the temperature of a metal, causing yield strengths to decrease with higher temperature.  The methods of strengthening metals generally center around trying to halt the motion of these dislocations, either by adding alloy elements which tend to stabilize dislocations at the atomic level (such as adding carbon to steel), or by precipitating secondary phases (like small crystals within the crystal) which act as roadblocks to dislocation movement.  <br>Secondary phases are usually precipitated by raising the temperature of the metal and aging it for a certain duration.  Aluminum is an example where this is very common. Metallurgists have determined the proper time and temperature to age metals to get the maximum strength.  The longer you age, the larger the precipitates grow.  If the precipitates are too small, dislocations cut through them.  If they are too large, dislocations will bend around them.  If you age at the wrong temperature, or the wrong combination of elements, precipitates will form along grain boundaries instead of inside crystal grains, which doesn&#39;t add strength, and can weaken the metal.  Precipitates must be fairly small, and uniformly spread throughout the crystal in order to add strength to the metal  <br>Precipitation hardening is especially common in Aluminum alloys.  Part of the reason aluminum is fine for airplane skins but not good for engines revolves around the fact that precipitation hardening is lost once you raise the temperature above a few hundred degrees, as the high temps will cause precipitates to grow, combine, and migrate to grain boundaries.<br>You mentioned work-hardening of stainless steel.  Work hardening is a mechanism where you basically limit dislocation movement by adding a whole lot more dislocations, and forcing them to move until they run into each other.  By deforming the material, you push the dislocations until they start to stack up, which gives resistance to further propagation of dislocations. The downside of this is that you lose some of the metal&#39;s ductility, which is the ability to &quot;bend before breaking.&quot; This means that if you have sudden, large force on your structure (shock load), it is more likely to fracture rather than bending or denting.

Magnetic confinement is one of two major branches of fusion energy research, the other being inertial confinement fusion.<br> The magnetic approach dates into the 1940s and has seen the majority of<br> development since then. It is usually considered more promising for <br>practical power production.<br><br><br>Fusion reactions combine light atomic nuclei such as hydrogen to form heavier ones such as helium, producing energy. In order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion<br> between the nuclei, they must have a temperature of several tens of <br>millions of degrees, under which conditions they no longer form neutral atoms but exist in the plasma state. In addition, sufficient density and energy confinement are required, as specified by the Lawson criterion.<br><br><br>At these temperatures, no material container could withstand the <br>extreme heat of the plasma. Magnetic confinement fusion attempts to <br>create these conditions by using the electrical conductivity of the plasma to contain it with magnetic fields. The basic concept can be thought of in a fluid picture as a balance between magnetic pressure and plasma pressure, or in terms of individual particles spiralling<br> along magnetic field lines. Developing a suitable arrangement of fields<br> that contain the fuel ions without introducing turbulence or leaking <br>the fuel at a profuse rate has proven to be a difficult problem.<br><br><br>The development of magnetic fusion energy (MFE) has gone through <br>three distinct phases. In the 1950s it was believed MFE would be <br>relatively easy to achieve, and this developed into a race to build a <br>suitable machine. By the late 1950s, it was clear that turbulence and <br>instabilities in the plasma were a serious problem, and during the <br>1960s, &quot;the doldrums&quot;, effort turned to a better understanding of the <br>physics of plasmas. In 1968, a Soviet team invented the tokamak<br> magnetic confinement device, which demonstrated performance ten times <br>better than the best alternatives. Since then the MFE field has been <br>dominated by the tokamak approach. Construction of a 500-MW power <br>generating fusion plant using this design, the ITER, began in France in 2007 and is scheduled to begin operation 2025.", "comment_date": "2019-10-04T11:57:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Whitefox", "comment_text": "Great graphics Tim, what software does he use, does anyone know?", "comment_date": "2019-10-04T11:49:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Small", "comment_text": "Just found your channel and it&#39;s fascinating.

This was the case on Apollo 6 and 13.

The thrust of RD-171 is about 7.2M at sea level, with the specific impulse being 309 . It slightly loses its thrust/weight to RD-180, that being one of the reasons, aside from sheer reliability, RD-180 has been preferred as a more refined. In fact, RD-180 is a twice less powerful derivative of RD-170/171. In addition, according to the claims of the manufacturers (yes, you have to take their word for it too), RD-170 was routinely tested for 7 full cycles, but technically has never been marketed as reusable, since in its time there was no such requirement.  Eventually, the current Russian space program is planning to derive a new, reusable engine from RD-170/171.

Both airliners and military jets achieve well over 50% operational availability even on continuous sorties with maintenance, and while they are vastly more reliable than even reuseable rockets, we should keep in mind the military jets are also prone to coming back with cannon shell fragments piercing through that fragile turbomachinery.

Based on Earth, and assuming there is no natural methane reservoir on Mars that would still require very heavy drilling/recovery/refining the CH4, you&#39;re taking about hundreds of thousands of tons of gas handling/manufacturing/compression/refrigeration/liquefaction/liquid hangling/refrigerated storage industrial plant. Good luck getting that all to Mars. Oh, and then there is human physiology. Humans in zero G space even with exercise are useless upon return to significant gravity after just a handful of weeks in zero G. They cannot even stand up when they return to Earth and it typically takes more than a month for them to recover even a little bit and more than 6 onths before they are able to do significant manual labor for any meaningful period of time. Plus the one year transit time to Mars will lethally irradiate a person when outside the Van Allen radiation belt that protects space station satellites in relatively low Earth orbits.

There are a couple of reasons for poor efficiency (meaning, in this case, not the Sutton or Yang, et al., theoretical engine efficiencies, but the real-world overall system efficiency - i.e., significantly more fuel is needed to achieve a given orbital mission than any other modern rocket booster): (1) essentially no fuel atomization results in large amounts of pyrolyzed, unburned hydrocarbons and PM2.5 in the exhaust.  This unoxidized carbon doesn&#39;t develop thrust, hence is a liability.  (2) The unburned/pyrolyzed hydrocarbons also destroy the thermodynamic efficiency of the nozzle (which is most efficient for monatomic and diatomic species - nozzle efficiency is <b>crucial</b> for vehicle performance).  This second reason is also why high-efficiency rocket engines burn slightly fuel-rich (if we assume high energy fuel atomization and relatively complete conversion of liquid fuel to partially-oxidized species).  For a pintle (an engine with very low or nonexistent liquid fuel atomization), there is a large fraction of polyatomic species (pyrolyzed and unburned hydrocarbons) in the exhaust.  The nozzle expansion cannot retrieve the energy lost to quanta in the large number of internal vibrational states of those large polyatmoic molecules - that is, the nozzle expansion cannot convert the internal vibrational energy into axial velocity as it does for monatomic and diatomic species (O, H, H2, OH, etc.) which have little or no internal vibrational energy.

Although the SSME was in 135 flights, there are 3 engines per launch.  Meaning 405 engines were flown with 1 failure due to a pin left on the ground puncturing the bell.  This would technically mean that the SSME was $66.54 per flight cost.  But, you would also have to consider which of the 47 engine combinations you were working with, and the Block components that each engine was configured to.  A Block I SSME (2019) with a 2020 powerhead would be different than the Block II version with a 4007 powerhead.  This would bring the cost per flight up since not all engines were cradle to grave in the SSME program.  Similarly, 65 F1&#39;s (cradle to grave) were flown during the Apollo Era since only 13 Saturn S1-C stages were ever used in flight.  That would bring your F1 cost to around $68.  Similar adjustments would need to be factored for the Merlin&#39;s, particularly assuming they have also been advanced since their first flight.  The problem with the Falcon is that since SpaceX only really mentions the booster as a whole being a &#39;block 5&#39;, you really can&#39;t tell what was upgraded to make it that Block.

The US chose simplicity where possible, and to take the NECESSARY decision to tackle combustion instability, so permitting construction of a very large main engine (the F1), thus reducing the number of first-stage engines required, thereby increasing the reliability of the eventual booster - the Saturn V. This judgement proved to be exactly correct as the F1&#39;s open cycle was (obviously) good enough TO WIN THE MOON RACE, and was fielded in early 1969 in an operational form, and its simplicity contributed to the 100% success rate of the Saturn program.  <br><br><br>It was the Russians who erred in pursuing the closed cycle during the Moon Race era. The long, difficult development alone almost assured they would lose the Race, all the more after they looked at the combustion instability problem and pronounced in insoluble.

ISP only talks about the effectiveness of the fuel generating thrust by dividing the thrust output by mass flow of the fuel used to generate that thrust.  It indicates the efficiency of your fuel and combustion system, but totally neglects the mass of the rocket engine itself, fuel / oxidizer tanks, etc.  It seems to neglect the basic issue that you really only care how much your rocket can lift that isn&#39;t the rocket itself.  I would like to see the dimensionless number be [mass of rocket minus payload] divided by [maximum payload mass that can be delivered to a given orbit], but I haven&#39;t seen people use that number for comparisons.<br><br><br>I&#39;ve heard--but haven&#39;t seen the numbers in detail--that SpaceX went Methane over Hydrogen, because they realized that the Methane tanks would be so much smaller and lighter than Hydrogen tanks, and it would so greatly simplify the design of the Raptor (further reducing the engine mass) that it more than makes up for the reduced ISP.  If that is true, why have everyone been building hydrogen powered rockets for so long?<br><br><br>If ISP is the be-all end-all, then some may ask why are Ion / Plasma engines are not in wide use despite having ISP values orders of magnitude higher than any chemical rocket engine?  Besides not being able to generate a lot of thrust, the mass of the engine with all of its shielding and the power generation system (solar arrays or nuclear batteries) make the spacecraft so massive, the little engine can barely accelerate the vehicle.  (F=ma =&gt; a = F/m)  That said, they are the little engines that can, when it comes to deep space missions.<br><br><br>Now for the nit-pick:  You called the RD-25 engines &quot;reusable&quot; and factored that into the cost, but that only refers to the Shuttle version that is no longer in service.  The RD-25D engines for the SLS are now going to be disposable so the potential cost is going to be even more than $27k : kN since they were built for the Shuttle, then modified for SLS (original production cost, plus mod cost).", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T02:46:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bala M", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbH1ZDImaI8&amp;t=43m26s\">43:26</a> &quot;With the F-1 never having shut down at all&quot; But what about the time one engine failed on Apollo 13?", "comment_date": "2019-05-31T02:30:14Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tesfaye Lemma", "comment_text": "Ahhh, I miss Physics!

Thank you. I love space, rockets and exploration, but ... yes here comes the but ... my reaction to Musk is that he is a genius who has built a amaxing, beautiful, elegant system to 99%, but the 1% which remains sinks the whole thing. That 1% is why? I&#39;m an astrophysics major who switched to economics and went on to manage billions of dollars of investment portfolios. I&#39;ve also served in a state legislature. The reason we cancelled Apollo is the same reason Musk&#39;s Occupy Mars is an amazingly conceived disaster. Mars is a low G, no oxygen, irradiated, toxic soil, bitter cold shithole millions of miles from Earth. It has no particular concentration of resources. There is no there there. The area of the uninhabited Earth is larger than Mars. Musk&#39;s diss of Bezos&#39; LEO colonies must have been conceived in a room with no mirrors. The reality is that it would be easier to build a city for 1,000,000 in the middle of the ocean than Mars or LEO. For that matter the Arctics, deserts, Wyoming, the Chernobyl evacuation zone, inside the Fukushima reactor building would all be vastly superior to Mars or LEO. The idea of us destroying Earth beyond the current state of Mars, the Moon, Venus, Ceres, LEO is idiotic. Taking carbon levels to poison and then detonating every nuke on Earth would still leave an Earth an easier repair job than terraforming Mars ... by orders of magnitude. The &#39;we have to be interplanetary diversify from Apocalypse Earth extinction&#39; is idiotic, go bury 10,000 human on Earth as a recovery colony, they would totally have a better existence than the poor fools buried in caves on Mars or the Moon. The real hard sci fi is that humans are fragile biologics evolved to live on Earth. Space isn&#39;t for us. If anyone colonizes the Solar System it will be robots we and our AI intelligently design for the exploiting the particular resource/location worth exploiting. We have a population peak on Earth staring us down. Space needs to serve these daunting challenges. It is not escapism literally or figuratively. Solving fusion, or building space solar, or educating or connecting the world at near zero marginal cost is noble.

It is known that the skin of the airship was covered in a dope (aircraft fabric coating/paint) with properties far from flame retardant. The skin ignited - look at the footage. The footage in this very video. As you well know hydrogen is a gas that is lighter than air. When it combusts at sea level and low pressure it will behave like that puff of natural gas (methane, hmm, another rocket fuel?) coming out of the typical stove top in a kitchen, or, perhaps, that gas-fired fireplace. It goes &quot;wumpf&quot; and all goes up at once. Flashing over is another way to say it. The Hindenburg did not do that. <br><br><br>As you pointed out in this video hydrogen is a sneaky sneaky element. It likes to leak and get away. So, being so much lighter than air, once the hydrogen &quot;tanks&quot; ruptured the gas would have rapidly gone up (lighter than air) and away. It would not stay close the aircraft pouring fuel to the flame like a blowtorch.<br><br><br>One more thing I&#39;m sure you know. Hydrogen flame is very faint. In full sun, difficult to see in fact. The Hindenburg disaster took place very late in the day so it was darker, but, the film stock at the time was not very good in low light*. The huge flames visible would most likely not be &quot;pure&quot; hydrogen burning. I&#39;ll stipulate that under the conditions of the skin fire there was some hydrogen combustion. It simply was not the cause of the tragedy and a helium filled-Hindenburg would have caught fire and lost its skin in the same way. <br><br><br>Finally, I&#39;ll grant you that the actual cause of ignition and the role of both hydrogen and the skin (coating) remain a subject of hot debate. However, it is safe to say that it did not catch fire and burn up because of hydrogen (the role of the gas after ignition is what remains uncertain).<br><br><br>*Arguments are made that the sensitivity of the film at the time to the emission spectrum of hydrogen flame (wavelengths of light) explain the bright reproduction of the fire scenes. While that may be true the overall sensitivity was so low I don&#39;t think this is a credible explanation for the bright fire scenes. FWIW I&#39;m a trained professional photographer from the film days.<br><br><br>Anywho, none of this is meant to take away from the huge and praiseworthy effort you put into the overall video.

Estimated launch pad explosion size 1/2 kT mainly from to the second stage due to fuel used in various stages and the amount in each stage.  In other words RP-1 on the first stage was partially a choice of making the worse case rocket failure more escapable.<br><br>2.The Space Shuttle we all know doomed, worse design from a safety standpoint ever.  When you are strapped on to the side of the main fuel tank, no need to even calculate.  However due to the altitude of the Challenger, the explosion happened at the most survivable point (high enough to where the explosion basically expands out into space as opposed to confined by the atmosphere enough to necessarily whack you with a lethal blow, plus a lot of the fuel has burned off, but moving slowly enough to where you don&#39;t burn up from atmospheric friction), which is why the astronaut bodies recovered showed they manually turned on their emergency oxygen supplies and breathed until impact with the ocean.<br><br>3. The Falcon 9 easy enough to escape from.  (Granted your capsule does not spontaneously explode, which I am sure they will figure out.)<br><br>4. The SpaceX Super Heavy / Starship does not seem to have a launch abort system.  This is curious.  The best Reddit post on this I could find suggested the worse case scenario blast would be around 16 kT due to fuel used in both stages, so a little larger than Hiroshima.  I came up with there is nearly 25 kT worth of methane onboard, but it won&#39;t all instantly flash over; there will be some fall through.  I just didn&#39;t know how much fall through to calculate for, which is why I mention somebody else&#39;s calculation.  I was wondering if you can get a better estimation and maybe even delve in more in general to the survivability of a Super Heavy / Starship failure at various points in the mission?", "comment_date": "2019-05-29T06:18:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Celanis", "comment_text": "This is a good rocketry 101 video.

You will note that the designs starting on page 4 start with the least costly and then on page 18 they go through all the possible designs increasing on budget available. From what research has been done (not enough), it seems that Mars gravity may be reasonably healthy, while Moon gravity is not. My thought is that the Moon may be the least expensive place to test artificial gravity, either with a large merry go round style rotating habitat or with a habitat on a circular set of rails (please make the rails farther apart than the width of two horse butts that all earth trains are based on).<br><br>Anyway, interesting stuff people may be interested in.", "comment_date": "2019-05-28T21:47:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DrReason", "comment_text": "I really enjoyed this video from beginning to end.

Its sort of like a friend of mine an Air Force Academy graduate told me that the air force&#39;s objective in cadet recruitment was and is to seek out competitive individuals who are well rounded good at various tasks over the full spectrum but not necessarily highly developed in one or two specific areas.  Geniuses tend to be very very good head and shoulders above everyone else in a relatively narrow spectrum.  They also tend to utterly suck at anything that is outside their immediate sphere of ability.  That&#39;s not always the case but in general, it&#39;s a pretty fair rule of thumb.  The issue is can the individual work at a high degree of productivity in a variety of settings.  The same thing seems to be at issue with the Raptor Engine.  We need an engine that is very good over the entire spectrum of specifications but not one that is truly outstanding in only one or a few of those pertinent specifications.

You throw back propellant (reaction mass, from your own initial mass) to increase the speed in the other direction. But because your mass is not limitless, the faster you throw back the reaction mass, the higher your acceleration (and the final speed) will be. To compute the final speed giving a constant speed of the ejected reaction mass regarding your own vehicle (this is one reference frame), things get a bit more complicated by the fact that your mass will decrease as you spend that reaction mass, but it&#39;s easily to visualize if make a chart.<br>@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbH1ZDImaI8&amp;t=11m00s\">11:00</a> The problem with oxygen-rich preburner is the oxygen. Oxygen, at high temp, high pressure will just want to turn everything in oxides and it often do that in an exothermic process, after all this is all about the rocket engine. It&#39;s just not good when you have your turbine blades as exhaust oxide particles.<br>@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbH1ZDImaI8&amp;t=14m30s\">14:30</a> Density has nothing to do with the ability of the hydrogen to sneak through cracks. In thermodynamics, density is a relation between mass and volume. 1 Liter of hydrogen at 2PSI is twice as dense as 1 Liter of H2 at 1PSI (because you double the mass, temperature being constant). The hydrogen is sneaky because it has a very small molecule (in fact, the smallest multi-atom molecule). Sure, this small molecule is one reason for hydrogen&#39;s low density, but not the only one.<br>@... Regarding a specific engine, two (agregate) parameters are important: Thrust, which tells us how much weight it can lift (from, let&#39;s say, 1g) and ISP which tells us how fast it can go in the end. A ion engine has a very high IPS (because the ejected reaction mass velocity is very high), but very low thrust (because there is not much reaction mass ejected in a second). F-1 has that huge thrust despite it&#39;s low chamber pressure because it ejects enormous quantities of reaction mass in a second. As a rule, our current technology allows for chemical rockets to eject huge quantities of reaction mass but at low velocity (because that velocity is derived from that chemical reaction called oxidation, well, burning and it is influenced by the chamber pressure) and ion engines to eject minuscule quantities of reaction mass but at much higher velocities (because that&#39;s accelerated in an electrical field where the absolute theoretical velocity is... a bit less that the speed of light).", "comment_date": "2019-05-27T21:34:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Amberwich", "comment_text": "Thumb Up!", "comment_date": "2019-05-27T21:33:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BorisCCRCam", "comment_text": "Great video.

The RS-25 diagram is missing the high pressure fuel going to the combustion chamber, but the LOX is shown. \u00a0The   full flow / Raptor diagram (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbH1ZDImaI8&amp;t=19m44s\">19:44</a>)  is missing both high pressure outputs to the chamber.<br><br>Am I misunderstanding something?<br><br>At the beginning it would be good to mention why combustion is needed to transition from the discussion of cold fuel / high pressure engines.  Otherwise, it would seem you just could expel the &quot;fuel&quot; without needed to ignite it.  From Wikipedia it seems combustion causes the production of very high speed gas to exit nozzle and that considerably increases the momentum change that causes the engine to move.

I&#39;d like to see you tackle a Van Waals Force rocket engine using as few atoms as possible. Its amazing we could harness a chaotic mass of fluid to escape Earths gravity.

If we could figure out a model for doing that without mass or mass less perhaps it could be scaled up.. sort of a resonance chamber or a resonance crystal that imparts momentum. SciFi tropes have been all over this.. but diodes and crystal radios are real despite sounding SciFi. Along these lines.. an Ion Rocket is a step in that direction.. but what if you could use smaller and smaller particles, pieces of atoms rather than whole Xenon or Krypton atoms.. say electrons or Mesons.. like the Pi-Mesons from Matter/Antimatter thrust NASA looked at.. at some point you have to reach the maximum ISP for matter to inertial thrust possible.... perhaps there is a wave effect particle that couples to a field like the one that black holes drag around.. and that translates into an exchange of inertial mass.

The fission engine could come in two forms: heat engine using CO2 reaction mass or longer term a scaled up Ion engine using H2O as reaction mass.  This spaceship would need to be assembled in orbit and fueled there; note - dry ice is remarkably stable requiring no pressurized tanks.  The specialization would allow for (1) protection from radiation, (2) increased living area as the only consideration is mass, and (3) critical system redundancy not possible with a rocket and (4) centripetal pseudo gravity  .  The longer term solution of the Ion engine scaled for greater than .5 G constant acceleration reducing the mission duration to days from months vastly simplifying the logistics and potentially upping the number and type of missions.  But, of course, no nation in the world is devoting any serious effort to developing such a power plant even though the technology is available.  To make an sailing analogy, SpaceX is developing a 3 masted Galleon to replace our canoes; what we need is a steam ship. We will not be able to sustain a Mars colony until we have such technology.

Hey, talk to PBS, maybe they would like to air this one.  Can&#39;t hurt to ask.<br><br><br>I get that liquid methane is easier to maintain over months or years in space than liquid hydrogen.  But it&#39;s still awfully cold.  Is there any information from SpaceX about how they will keep liquid methane and liquid oxygen chilled on long missions?  I guess that&#39;s question one.<br><br>Question two is, how will Starship take off from Mars?  On Earth, without launch infrastructure, a launch is impossible.  There&#39;s a lot of stuff needed.  Nobody takes off on a bare patch of ground; it would damage the rocket and probably blow it up.  They&#39;ll need less thrust to take off from Mars, but isn&#39;t there still a need for site prep and a pretty extensive launch infrastructure?  If so, how will that get built?  I&#39;m having trouble envisioning how the tools and equipment required to build the infrastructure will be carried, deployed, and used by humans in space suits.  It&#39;s hard enough to replace a bolt in a space suit, let alone dig, pave, lay electrical conduits, build tanks and gantries, build a water-spray system, and we haven&#39;t even gotten to solar arrays, ice mining and refining, and all of that.  And as the first Starship will land on bare ground, will it have to be moved to a launch pad nearby?  The whole Mars launch infrastructure problem is puzzling me.<br><br><br>Question three is, should we consider the Raptor engine as a suboptimal solution for any space mission other than launch to Earth orbit, missions to the moon and missions to Mars?  We need its power to escape gravity wells, but for missions involving only microgravity, it seems like overkill.<br><br><br>I&#39;m no rocket scientist, but a simpler and cheaper solution for microgravity missions to ice-bearing objects might be steam rockets.  Top off your tanks any time you&#39;re visiting an icy object:  mine ice, refine it, stick it in the tank, run heaters off of solar power, build up steam pressure and off you go.  Heat more water to make more steam as you go with power from your solar arrays.<br><br><br>We can&#39;t refuel with methalox except on Earth and Mars.  For trips to near-Earth objects or the asteroid belt, it might be interesting to know if the engineering case for steam rockets makes sense.<br><br><br>Question three point one is, can the steam rocket concept be combined with an ion thruster in the same rocket design?  I&#39;m really flailing with my ignorance on that one.  We have mass to expend and electrical power, so maybe?  We don&#39;t need high-powered thrust for operation in microgravity, and ion thrusters are pretty efficient.  A combined steam-ion thruster engine, if such a thing is possible, should give us two options for acceleration: low thrust/more efficient and higher thrust/less efficient.<br><br><br>I suppose SpaceX engineers are too busy to want to sit down and talk about steam rockets, but NASA might consent to a conversation, perhaps.", "comment_date": "2019-05-26T16:35:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Antonio Campos", "comment_text": "incredible work man i love you", "comment_date": "2019-05-26T16:34:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tegrity", "comment_text": "I hated school as a kid, as a 26 year old adult now wanting to learn I find your videos very educational. <br><br>I learn better with videos like the ones you make, rather than books that just don&#39;t interest me. <br><br>Thank you for providing me/everyone with this!

I actually know a lot of the content already, but it was fun to see how you chose to present it, and I learned a number of new details myself.<br><br>I&#39;ve tried to write about this myself in the past. E.g. how to chose rocket engine and propellant: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/how-to-chose-a-rocket-engine-and-propellant-d2f25432951e\">https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/how-to-chose-a-rocket-engine-and-propellant-d2f25432951e</a><br><br>You did a really good job explaining specific impulse (ISP) I think. I&#39;ve also tried writing about it, but getting a bit more into the math, delta-v etc: <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/gas-mileage-and-horsepower-on-a-space-rocket-1a0181696d78\">https://medium.com/@Jernfrost/gas-mileage-and-horsepower-on-a-space-rocket-1a0181696d78</a><br><br>If I was to nitpick, I think it would have been good to mention WHEN ISP matters and WHEN thrust to weight ration (TWR) matters. For the booster stage when you are going vertical, TWR matters a lot more than ISP, because you are fighting gravity every second and has to spend as short time fighting gravity as possible. As soon as you start going horizontally though and you don&#39;t fight gravity, ISP starts to be a far more important metric. Which is why upper stages tend to have low thrust and high ISP engines, while the bottom stages tend to have really powerful but less efficient engines.<br><br>Raptor seems like an awesome engine as it works good both as a first stage and upper stage engine.

I&#39;m the same guy who wrote the original Raptor articles in <a href=\"http://nasaspaceflight.com/\">nasaspaceflight.com</a>. I think you made a fantastic video, but I would like to point out some little tidbits:<br>-Gas generators are relatively simple to start. Staged combustion and full-flow are the hard ones.<br>-The loss of performance on gas generators is not so much about the mass you dump (about 2%), but the power available to the turbine. Higher pressure on the chamber gives better performance. Turbines are thermal machines, but you can&#39;t increase temperature due to the blade&#39;s material limitations. So you need to pass more mass to increase total work (mass times delta temperature). But at around 1,000/1,200psi (chamber) the specific impulse of increasing pressure is lost to increased mass dumped to the gas generator. That&#39;s why the staged combustion works so much better, instead of passing about 2% of your mass, you use about 73% (kerosene)/ 85% (Hydrogen). You multiply the power on the turbines x35/x40. The nice thing about full flow, is that you use 100% of your mass to power the turbines (more on this on why methane). More turbine power = better performance.<br>-The first staged combustion engine in the world (and it was Soviet) was the S1.5400. It powered the Molinya fourth stage (Block-L). And it was kerosen/LOX. The next soviet staged engines were hypergolic for the Proton. Then came the NK-15/33.<br>-RP-1 is actually a kerosene, which is less refined (and expensive) than diesel. So is jet fuel. The RP-1 controls for certain non desirable chemicals like sulfur.<br>-The RD-170 was used A LOT. Zenit launches used it, Buran used it, and the next Soyuz-5 will use it. So 92 of those beasts launched.<br>-The RD-180 is designed for 10 uses, they just never used it on a reusable engine (but they do get acceptance fired).<br>-Now, on why methane is the BEST propellant IF you are using Full Flow: turbine power is equal to massflow * specific heat, this is really important. There are really only two high performance full-flow compatible fuels: hydrogen and methane. Now, hydrogen is great because it has crazy specific heat (like 13 kJ/(kg.K)), while methane only has about 2, LOX has about .9. So you get crazy TP power out of a fuel rich hydrolox engine. But here&#39;s the problem if you go full thrust: the hydrogen turbine needs to move just 14% of your mass, but will have 72% of your turbine power. While the LOX turbine will have just 28% of your total power to move 86% of your mass! Now, let&#39;s look at methane: the LOX turbine will have 60% of your total power to move 77% of your mass, while the methane will have 40% to move 23%. A much more balanced equation. Incidentally, you might have noticed that the oxygen rich side of methalox has more power, and that&#39;s the reason the BE-4 is oxidizer rich. So, the only propellant that REALLY squeezes all the performance out of a full flow engine, is methalox.", "comment_date": "2019-05-26T03:57:35Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Chenus", "comment_text": "Very interesting.

As noted. Fuel density as relates to tank size, which helps with lowering the vehicle mass. Plus the fuel storability issues of LH2 are another killer IMO. <br>I really wonder why it took this long for the engineers designing rocket engines to go with LH4. I get that ISP is the holy grail but it&#39;s not the only part of the equation.<br>As to powering the turbo pumps.  What if one used a monopropellant to power the  turbo pumps. Say H2O2. And the if possible dump the exhaust from the pump into the combustion chamber or the expansion nozzle. <br>As to engine types. We see the regular bell nozzle, aerospikes have been tested. What if we turned the idea of the engine around. At the aft end of a re-entry vehicle that soft lands we have a heat shield over the power head and combustion chamber. This heat shield is shaped like a partial dome. Instead of a hemisphere just the region from 45\u00b0 to the axis. The rest of the heat shield is curved outward so that it gradually approaches 90\u00b0 to the vehicle centerline. The engine exhaust flows over this surface. The perimeter of this structure could have a set of, let&#39;s call them flaps, that can be extended so that the exhaust builds up a layer of high pressure gas providing thrust for the vehicle. Basically your heat shield  and engine are combined in one structure.  Efficient, maybe not.

A turbine needs both mass flow and pressure differential, in an open cycle you get maximum pressure differential and so minimum mass is needed.

High enthalpy propellants have a lot of chemical energy (high energy bonds, hydrogen to nitrogen such as N2H4 or oxygen to nitrogen bonds N2O4) as well as the energy released when combined in combustion.  The way to get a feel for high enthalpy propellants is recognizing that they are usually pretty good at being monopropellants, or reactants in APU\u2019s or HPU\u2019s.  They have so much stored energy, they can be used as fuel without even being burned.  When they <b>are</b> burned, they release even that much more energy than you would get from a simple hydrocarbon for instance with very little bonding energy to release. \r<br>\r<br>Although just about everyone calls them that these days, gas generator engines don not use preburners, they use gas generators (they are different, most closed cycle engines uses a preburner since the fuel is essentially burned twice, once in the preburner and then again in the combustion chamber).", "comment_date": "2019-05-25T20:05:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kha Vu Chan", "comment_text": "Feels like a good school lecture!", "comment_date": "2019-05-25T20:05:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark Jones", "comment_text": "Great video!", "comment_date": "2019-05-25T20:05:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ICECUP", "comment_text": "just great!", "comment_date": "2019-05-25T20:05:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mauro C\u00e9sar", "comment_text": "Excellent job.
