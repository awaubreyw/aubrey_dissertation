The Lofstrom launch loop costs under $100 billion, it&#39;s just, well it needs a lot of manpower to work on. But, not really at the same time. The track is literally 6 cm wide, you&#39;d just need to make a 80 km long track. One could say that this is like paving a 80 km long road, expect it&#39;s 6 cm wide and definitely not made out of asphalt. Also, the Lofstrom launch loop does not need any supermaterials of the future, it relies on active support. It would turn down launch costs to $3 to $10.
