My idea to submit is to catch the two fairing with the same ship. Engineer the fairing&#39;s &#39;flight decent time&#39; to differ by a small amount. One trails the other down the same path. ( could be done with a delayed chute deployment for one fairing, and other methods to align the paths...one flys a circle to allow the other to travel to get to it partner&#39;s path ) When the first fairing is caught the net is slackened immediately and a second net to stretched out across the net support posts to catch the next fairing. The net support posts may need to be heightened a touch for a safe clearance distance between the two fairings. Using one fairing recovery ship instead of two almost cuts the fairing recovery costs in half. I guess they could also have a ship with two nets. That still requires a similar path for both fairings and still the fairings need to be spaced out with different decent times so their chutes do not interfere with one another.<br>Where is the &quot;Spacex Idea Submit Button&quot;?", "comment_date": "2018-02-23T03:04:47Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Wesley Jeggo", "comment_text": "Looks like there not even re-painting the rockets now.
