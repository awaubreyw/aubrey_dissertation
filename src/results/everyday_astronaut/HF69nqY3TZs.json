And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.

So, for example, if a part had a design life of 100 hours, and only was used for 10 hours per launch. They would still have to inspect that part even after only 10 hours of use because the shuttle was man rated. They could not afford to take that risk.

A better comparison will be to the Falcon 9 plus Dragon capsule.  Will the capsules be re-used?  Will NASA allow manned flights on used Falcon 9 boosters?  As mentioned, Space Shuttle refurbishment became overwrought, requiring almost 100x more man-hours than before the Challenger incident.  This is a typical government response after any incident.  A similar example is the U.S. nuclear power industry, which required ~10x more personnel after the Three Mile Island incident, per government regulations, with most simply pushing paper, fussing about things like calibration dates for steel rulers and probably adding little value.  True that the biggest cost and complexity was having to check and refurbish the thermal protection system on the Shuttle, which is much more area than a capsule.  Falcon 9 launches avoid this by returning the 1st-stage early, at a speed similar to the Space Shuttle solid rockets (jettison both a few minutes after launch), where thermal protection for re-entry isn&#39;t needed, and discarding the 2nd stage.  Thus, the main problem with the Shuttle was being closer to a Single-Stage-To-Orbit system.  Having the Shuttle mounted to the side where the tiles were struck by foam and ice made this a much worse problem (proved fatal).  SpaceX StarShip will also be a large re-entry vehicle, so may prove a similar refurbishment effort, depending upon the thermal protection it will use.", "comment_date": "2020-06-04T03:01:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Imaws", "comment_text": "I still don&#39;t know if it is or now", "comment_date": "2020-06-03T19:34:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "shaenj", "comment_text": "So what do you know that didn&#39;t require practise to achive reuseability?

Engines - Space-x uses an open cycle engine, a simpler and cheaper, but less powerful engine than the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs).<br>2. Thermal protection - as discussed the boosters re enter at a much slower velocity than the orbiter and therefore do not require the thermal protection of the orbiter and the associated expense<br>3. The vehicle - the Space-x boosters are not really spacecraft, they don&#39;t have all the avionics, life support systems, and power generation systems that the orbiter had. I&#39;m very curious to see Space-x&#39;s turnaround time and cost for turning around a booster, and presumably a capsule once they start flying humans.<br>4. Vehicle size - the orbiter was the largest spacecraft to ever fly, and that size had an effect on inspection and turnaround times and cost, Space-x&#39;s booster and capsule are so much smaller in comparison<br>5. Private vs Public - the STS (shuttle) program was an endeavor by the federal government and was subject to politics, components came with stipulations that they be built in districts of politicians who voted on the project, this is true of the SLS program and why it is so over budget and behind schedule and why congress doesn&#39;t want to kill it. Meanwhile Space-x is a private company, it can do it&#39;s business however it seems fit.<br>I really like what Space-x is doing, they are capturing the public&#39;s imagination and grabbing attention with science and engineering which is sorely needed in this day and age. I think Space-x will be able to reduce the cost and increase the frequency of spaceflight, but the exact same promises were made of the STS program back in the late 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s and we got was a far cry from what was promised.", "comment_date": "2019-05-03T01:26:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Redbeard Pyro", "comment_text": "The other thing that you have to consider is that human rated rockets must have much higher safety ratings.

I think the closing chapter/s of &#39;The Man Who Ran the Moon&#39; comment on this and all the other design decisions that were appropriate to the Shuttle as a partly &#39;military&#39; project, but were not when viewed as a civilian craft.

The truth is, once perfected (which takes quite a bit of effort), automated systems are vastly better for most purposes.  The reason is, they can actually detect and report weaknesses before they become &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;not working&quot;... while most tests performed by humans only detect components that are broken or seriously out of whack.", "comment_date": "2018-12-24T06:16:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "ShadowHunter120", "comment_text": "Them grid fins tho.", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T18:00:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Benjamin David Tatum", "comment_text": "How many tiles were on the space shuttle? =:0)", "comment_date": "2018-12-23T17:56:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ten Minute Tokyo 2", "comment_text": "Most complex machine ever built.

Even that was just a blip compared to the incredible excitement I felt as a kid when the Shuttles would launch. My school always set aside media time when the Shuttles launched so we could watch. When the Challenger accident happened I was watching in School. It was horrible and our teacher just broke down into tears. But thankfully the Shuttles kept flying for a few more years. I wish that instead of everyone trying to reinvent the rockets. We worked towards taking the Shuttles design and go forward with creating a truly reusable Space Shuttle and even begin working on space ships. I just keep feeling like we are taking a step back in advancements to try and perfect something that while definitely needed improvements.

Use less intensively inspected/refurbished launchers for payload only and a specialized space plane to hoist 3-4 crew for a rendezvous with a station or ship.   This would bring the cost down massively.   The space plane gets off the ground using A B-1 BOMBER!  Yup that&#39;s right the Lancer.   Now the bomber will have to be modified to go (back) to its top speed of Mach 2.3, reposition it&#39;s rear landing gear into the aft bomb bay, possibly lengthen it&#39;s landing gear, lose all its ECM hardware, add a spaceplane carry rack, add solid rocket boosters outboard of the main engines and also add reaction control systems so the boosters can get the carrier ship to mach 4 and 120,000 ft to launch it&#39;s spaceplane.   This space plane can be thought of as a super X-15 with a huge solid rocket booster.   The Lancer boosters will weigh in at 30,000 lbs, the spaceplane booster will be around 120,000 lbs and the spaceplane at about 50,000 lbs.  How will the modified Lancer get 200,000 lbs off the ground?  Easy,  drastically reduced fuel load.   This Lancer does not need to have a range of 5,100 miles.   About 500-700 miles will do.  The Lancer can carry 115,000 lbs of payload already,  the other 85,000 lbs will be reduced fuel.   I do see problems with the carrier heating up during its &quot;reentry&quot; and with recovering the SRB of the space plane,  bit this set-up should not be all that expensive to reuse and possibly partially refurbish for subsequent missions.   The B-1 itself costs about 75k dollars an hour to run.  The booster for the spaceplane/orbiter is recovered in 1 piece.

To all this transfer of resources in dollars must be added the transfer of technology that NASA has made on occasion for Spacex to face some of its technological challenges, the thermal protection system of the Dragon capsules is one of the many examples of this.&quot;", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T19:01:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ned", "comment_text": "Your &quot;ridiculous shirt&quot; twisted my brain just before I realised what was happening..", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T18:06:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anand Suralkar", "comment_text": "Reusable rockets are the future of space travel", "comment_date": "2018-12-03T14:01:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Speedy Cuber", "comment_text": "Prograde is with the velocity vector, retrograde is against it.", "comment_date": "2018-12-03T04:57:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kcrusch", "comment_text": "I think it&#39;s a real apples-to-oranges comparison here.

The design decisions SpaceX has made were available to NASA in the 70s, but they couldn&#39;t get funding to complete the thing without getting help from the USAF, which required the significant design compromises.  I still feel pretty strongly that the systems required to recover the Falcon boosters outweigh (literally) the single-use rockets.

A few comments. SpaceX will have to slow things down once they start flying humans. They will kill some Astronauts at some point. It&#39;s not a matter of if but when. Spaceflight is hard and human spaceflight is very dangerous. The Shuttle and the Falcon 9 were designed for very different missions. The typical Shuttle payload capacity was about 50,045 pounds (22,700 kg) but could be increased depending on the choice of the launch configuration. It&#39;s a little harder to quantify the payload capacity of the Falcon 9 because there are so many versions and mission profiles. Here is WIKI&#39;s take on Falcon 9 payload. The current &quot;Full Thrust&quot; version can lift payloads of up to 22,800 kilograms (50,300 lb) to low Earth orbit, and up to 8,300 kg (18,300 lb) to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), when flying in expendable mode. The first stage can be recovered and reused for GTO payloads up to 5,500 kg (12,100 lb) automatically landing after disconnection of the second stage. The Falcon 9 has been subsequently upgraded and uprated; on July 22, 2018 a Falcon 9 launched the Telstar 19V 7,075 kg (15,598 lb) satellite into a sub-synchronous transfer orbit, also called a GTO-orbit. At first glance it appears that the Shuttle and the Falcon 9 have very compareable payload capacity. If you are basing this purely on mass then they are compareable. However, they don&#39;t compare equally when looking at volume. As you pointed out in your video the Shuttle has capabilty that the Falcon 9 can&#39;t match. For instance, transporting something the size of Hubble and most of the ISS modules. The 2 systems have/had different mission profiles. Having been born in 1960 I watched the moon landings and remember how exciting space was back then. My father worked for NASA from 1958 until 1978 and then worked for NASA contractor Teledyne Brown on the Space Shuttle for another 15 years. We watched the first successful Falcon 9 landing together and it was neat to see him crack a smile after the booster safely landed. SpaceX is pushing that feeling of excitement once again. I am hopefull that SpaceX can push the technology to a point where rockets and spaceflight become as common place as a large passenger airliner flying across the country.  <br><br>Sources:<br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle</a><br><br><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9</a>", "comment_date": "2018-07-31T05:10:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tangent Plays", "comment_text": "I am so amazed that someone was still on the moon when the shuttle was approved.<br><br>Like, I knew it was old, and I knew that we quit going to the moon even longer ago..

Several major upgrades occurred. The ET was totally redesigned early on to save weight. It went from aluminum to an aluminum-lithium alloy that shaved nearly 8000 kg from its original weight. The SRBs and Main engines also went through upgrades to increase performance and payload to orbit. Those improvements and the weight savings of the ET and other components boosted the payload to orbit by about 7250 kg.  a 35% increase in capacity!!<br>And, the most visible upgrade was the avionics and \u201cglass-cockpit\u201d upgrade that occurred starting in 1999.

If the heat shields are made of a material that can be melted down, or reformed into another shape like plastic does, then this would be great.

And they all don&#39;t have reusable boosters, so that&#39;s a pretty easy comparison, so saying it really is the first reusable ROCKET is pretty fair.<br>I think the Space shuttle will remain very unique thing in spaceflight history for quiet a while even though some tests on new smaller shuttles are done I am not sure if they will succeed, at least not for the next years. The Shuttle was too expensive and without any real incentive to have a shuttle like the USA had back then, I don&#39;t see those projects going anywhere as long as the Falcon 9, especially the B5 and probably the BFR in the future are gamechangers for the space flight industry.

However, almost all that revenue is going into R&amp;D for their Mars colonization vehicle, and, while doubling the number of planets our economy covers is obviously financially promising in the ultra-long term, it&#39;s difficult to see medium-long term profits coming out of this. Further, they are almost exclusively focused on the vehicle, and little on the colony, so this really needs wide partnership, or substantial growth to go anywhere sustainable. Maybe Starlink or Earth-to-Earth gets them the funding they need, but these ideas can not be relied upon to come to fruition, and are each R&amp;D burdens themselves.

I&#39;d assume a huge win would be a single piece heatshield rather than tiles.  Cutting NASA out of the loop would almost certainly help too.  I mean, they don&#39;t tear down a commercial airline after every flight to inspect every part, and if the shuttle was really so flawed as to need this, why didn&#39;t anyone try to improve it?  The problem with design freezes is that it sets every problem in the system, known or otherwise, in stone.  They knew the heat tiles were a big problem from pretty early on, certainly after STS-27 in 1988 when Atlantis very nearly suffered the same fate that later claimed Columbia, but the design was nevertheless frozen for &quot;safety&quot; or &quot;costs&quot; or something and it ended up in tragedy.  Even assuming no one had a better idea for a reusable heatshield than the tiles, once the cost in labour of inspecting and repairing the tiles was clear, wouldn&#39;t it have been safer AND cheaper to switch to a simple single piece ablative heat shield and just replace it as a unit after every few flights?  But then, NASA had their hands tied by Congress, who of course knew better.<br><br>Anyway, rant over.
