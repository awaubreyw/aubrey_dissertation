The platform could be tall enough to allow exhaust to be directed away so debris doesn&#39;t get blasted up into the engine chamber and could compress under the load avoiding the need for landing legs altogether.

Thanks for your passion.  I do have a question...  You have a lot of videos about how these rocket engines work, and they mostly focus on the chemistry of the propellant and oxidizers, and all the pipes and tubes that get the things where they need to go.  I would like to se an explanation of the mechanical forces at work after the combustion happens.  What does the column of exploding gas push against?  How does the mechanical energy transfer through the nozzle, the combustion chamber walls, the injector plate, propellant manifold, etc...  How do the parts of the engine physically transfer the thrust up to the gimbal bearing and the thrust frame of the rocket, from a mechanical engineering point of view?  How do these engines not crush themselves like tin cans?
