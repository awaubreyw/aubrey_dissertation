[{"comment_by": "Emerald Is cool", "comment_text": "Hi Tim, I&#39;m from the future! I found this video after researching what the rocket was that I pass by daily. There&#39;s an unused Little Joe at the Hampton Air Power park, which is on Mercury blvd- which was named for the Mercury Program. So cool to see this video and learn about this rocket that I have wondered about for ages now. It&#39;s even cooler to learn its history and the role it played in American Aerospace Engineering :)<br><br>The music was a nice touch too lol", "comment_date": "2020-11-14T15:08:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niknut Nerd", "comment_text": "My family had a huge reunion last year and we found an old box of jarts that was really fun, and noone got hurt", "comment_date": "2020-07-07T00:15:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Will Young", "comment_text": "And 9 yrs", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T12:51:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glockoma762", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://youtu.be/9S0zKr69fmo?t=15m39s\">https://youtu.be/9S0zKr69fmo?t=15m39s</a> that was a pretty sad launch test song", "comment_date": "2018-09-22T22:56:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Glockoma762", "comment_text": "Hello past people", "comment_date": "2018-09-22T22:53:36Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tupolev Tu-114", "comment_text": "Hello past!", "comment_date": "2018-08-10T21:19:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Plane The Rock Johnson", "comment_text": "liking in 2018", "comment_date": "2018-04-18T11:36:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gerrit Immink", "comment_text": "hello from the present, which is the future you were taking to in the stream!", "comment_date": "2017-01-21T06:48:03Z", "likes_count": 0}]
