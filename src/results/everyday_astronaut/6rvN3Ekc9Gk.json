This video truly was amazing and awe-inspiring. It makes me want to work hard and do a ton of research and see what i can learn and do with the knowledge of aerospace engineering and computing. Thank you for your wonderful videos and continue at this. I hope in the coming time, you garner world wide attention for your work to help people understand all the hard work that these brilliant minds put in. Lastly I hope to see an fully legit reward ceremony created and hosted by you for the 2019 Astro Awards. <br><br>Myself personally, I&#39;ve always been interested in anything space related and scientific. This video helped; in a way rekindle what i realize is truly remarkable, in that what you say is true. Space exploration really does break free of the worlds ways, and brings everyone together.

After Heavy, I would go on YT or FB streams of other launches, Parker Solar Probe for instance, and they were always far more popular than they had been in 2017 with people from all over curious about what it was, where it was going, how it would work, when is it launching, what is the white vapor coming out of it... what does that mean that they just said.

Fellow commenters, this is for Tim so you needn&#39;t read it.   Tim, my degree is in broadcast journalism.  I did TV news for a little while and I am familiar with efficient and descriptive speaking.  I&#39;m no one special and many statements below can be taken as my opinion.  Still, you may want to consider my observations from this awards segment:<br><br>I found your speaking style Inspiring - full of energy/enthusiasm.  Your thorough research and captivating B-roll kept me glued to the screen.  The insight you into social/political/economic/scientific ramifications of the listed space achievements makes your scope of commentary exceptional .   I would like to point out some specific instances in which you could be more concise or express yourself in a more interesting manner:<br><br>At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=14m40s\">14:40</a> you say &quot;very precisely.&quot;  Precise means Very, as in very accurate, so that is redundant.  Using fewer words will get your point across better and make you even more enjoyable to listen to.  <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=23m40s\">23:40</a> has a small redundancy:  &quot;They Completely re-did the Entire flight computer system.&quot;  Either &quot;completely&quot; or &quot;entire&quot; would do it.  &quot;Computer&quot; and &quot;system&quot; may also be redundant.  EG: &quot;They redesigned the entire flight computer.&quot; (If that doesn&#39;t seem to pack the emphasis you desire, I understand.  Personal style is important too, and I think you&#39;ve got a fun style.)<br> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=23m58s\">23:58</a> &quot;..before they have the same issue Potentially crop up on another flight.&quot;  &quot;Before&quot; and &quot;potentially&quot; both reference before/after.  It&#39;s either &quot;before they have the same issue on another flight&quot; or &quot;because of the potential of the same issue on another flight.  For this statement, I think &quot;before they have the same...&quot; would be best.  <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=33m00s\">33:00</a> ...&quot;at this Point in Time.&quot;  You have a choice of &quot;at this point&quot; (since the context is time anyway) or &quot;at this time&quot; because &quot;this&quot; indicated something specific - a point.<br><br>At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=15m50s\">15:50</a> you use &quot;incredible&quot; for the first of at least six instances.  It&#39;s a popular word because of its power but when it&#39;s overused it loses its punch.  &quot;Unbelievable&quot; or &quot;unimaginable&quot; could be used sometimes.   More &quot;incredibles:&quot;    <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=18m00s\">18:00</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=18m15s\">18:15</a> &quot;incredibly common&quot; (maybe &quot;surprisingly&quot; instead) <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=21m10s\">21:10</a> &quot;incredibly advanced&quot;....maybe explain why it is incredible/unbelievable/surprising.  Because if it is not actually any of those, then use another adjective.  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=22m50s\">22:50</a> &quot;incredibly advanced technology,&quot; instead, maybe something like &quot;technical quantum leap&quot; or &quot;game-changing innovation&quot; and then an example, such as the carbon fiber structure you mentioned. <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=22m25s\">22:25</a> &quot;incredible year&quot; could be &quot;triumphant year.&quot;   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=27m00s\">27:00</a> &quot;incredibly engenius&quot; could be &quot;amazingly engenius&quot; or &quot;shows mind-blowing creativity&quot; and follow with your example. <br><br>Another popular word is &quot;massive.&quot;  It loses power when overused or put in the wrong context.  Example:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=21m55s\">21:55</a> &quot;massively inspirational.&quot;  How much physical inertia does inspiration have? :-)  Perhaps &quot;extremely inspirational,&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s heart-lifting to witness...&quot;  (Maybe that&#39;s not so great either but I&#39;m sure you get my point.)<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=24m00s\">24:00</a> &quot;...massive rocket factory...&quot;  Try &quot;expansive&quot; ...it avoids the overuse and speaks &quot;volumes&quot; about the ambitious nature of the facility.   (BTW I loved &quot;..evil lair.&quot; :-)   <br><br>And now for....wait for it.....&quot;Awesome.&quot;<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=26m40s\">26:40</a> &quot;Really Awesome.&quot;    Really?   Please excuse my whimsical sarcasm:  What makes them &quot;Really&quot; Awesome? Is that different from &quot;Very Awesome?&quot;  What&#39;s &quot;Awesome?&quot;  It is related to &quot;awe-inspiring.&quot;  When one&#39;s mouth hangs open in wonder the sound &quot;awe&quot; may even come out. (Witness Laura Dern&#39;s character in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; when she sees the 80-foot brontosaurus for the first time.)

It&#39;s weird.  In your case, you mean &quot;spectacular&quot; or &quot;wondrous,&quot;  and you could use those two words sometimes instead of the &quot;a&quot; word. :-)   Actually, just about anything can be substituted because &quot;awesome&quot; is being used for everything.<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=30m00s\">30:00</a> &quot;...awesome landing failure.&quot;  Actually, that was awe-inspiring!   <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rvN3Ekc9Gk&amp;t=33m50s\">33:50</a> &quot;..awesome science experiments.&quot;  Why were they &quot;a?&quot; Maybe they are &quot;imaginative,&quot; &quot;promising,&quot; &quot;innovative.&quot;  <br>You advertise &quot;Lots of Awesome merch.&quot;  Could it instead be &quot;unique,&quot; &quot;historically important,&quot; &quot;perfect conversation piece?&quot; <br><br>A few power words just came to mind:<br>&quot;The sight of the Tesla soaring above the Earth was captivating. &quot;  (Maybe it was even stunning.)<br>&quot;India&#39;s success has been stunning.&quot;   (Your merch may include &quot;thought-provoking,&quot;  &quot;colorful&quot; or &quot;eye-catching&quot; pictures, but they probably aren&#39;t stunning.  Viewing them probably won&#39;t make people feel like they&#39;ve been hit by a baseball bat or had a glorious spontaneous sexual experience.  Of course, I haven&#39;t seen your merch, so maybe I&#39;m wrong :-)<br>If Rocket Lab is using more carbon fiber than anyone has before, then, &quot;RL&#39;s thorough use of carbon fiber in the fuselage is unprecedented.&quot;  (But probably not stunningly unprecedented.)<br><br>Things I like:  Well, practically everything.

Sounds silly, I know, but let me tell you why. I am child of the 60\u2019s and can remember Apollo 11. My name is Michael and my brother is Neal, so by namesake alone we felt we were astronauts. We were in Okinawa, but there wasn\u2019t anyone I knew that didn\u2019t know about the mission. Then in second grade the school gathered all students into the gym to have a moment of silence for Apollo 13. Imagine that many students quiet. I remember the shuttle missions and know where I was for the tragic ones. However, my interest in space exploration began to wane for some time until the Mars missions. In particular Curiosity... Seven minutes of terror and all... but when I watched the Falcon Heavy and the Tesla in space... not only was I excited but so many that I spoke with had something to say... so... cheers, thumbs up, and thank you for a delightful and inspiring production.
