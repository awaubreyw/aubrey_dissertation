And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T06:10:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gerald Wagner", "comment_text": "The Buran story always makes me really sad.

The reason was that the computer received new wind data and recalculated landing trajectory, landing from the other end of the runway. Nobody understood it tho and we were just a minute away from shooting it down with a rocket believing it was a malfunction. After that government decided that the shuttle was unsafe and the program got canceled.

Halfway through it, I got <br>hungry so I left it playing and went to the <br>kitchen to fix myself a sandwich.

But I&#39;m really a shy person so I took up a <br>three-year personality development course so <br>I can introduce my self. She was very friendly <br>and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. <br>So I said, all good, I&#39;m a mature person. I want <br>the best for her and I harbor no illusion that <br>I am the best person for her and she seems <br>happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother <br>her anymore. But we kept in touch and we <br>became friends and I got over my crush on her. <br>Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank <br>some alcohol because of it, I told her she&#39;ll be <br>fine and I wished her well. I still think she&#39;s the <br>most beautiful woman in the world, but like I <br>said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five <br>years already when I first saw her. Besides, I <br>am quite happy with the friendship I developed <br>with her. It was more important than a crush. <br>So we kept hanging out, drinking, having <br>coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started <br>dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live <br>some other life without me in it, so I said, <br>okay, I want the best for you and I want you <br>to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and <br>I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the <br>same advice I gave her when she was in that <br>position and I became okay with the breakup <br>immediately. But we were really drunk, so she <br>spent the night in my apartment. I only have <br>one bed, so you know what that means: She <br>took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on <br>the couch, I really can&#39;t sleep. Something was <br>bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about <br>three hours, then I finally can&#39;t take it anymore, <br>I stood up and went straight to my room where <br>she&#39;s sleeping. I approached the bed, gently <br>sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull <br>her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. <br>She asked what&#39;s up. I told her, you know, the <br>first time I saw you, I was watching a video <br>and left it playing to get my self a sandwich <br>then went to the store to get some mayo then <br>I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish <br>the video. She said, you know what, I&#39;ve been <br>wondering about a weird noise in your night <br>drawer.

One was he wanted me to help re-inspire children to want to get into science and math, [sophistry] he wanted me to expand our international relationships, [NASA is a science agency, not good will ambastors]  and third, and perhaps FOREMOST, he wanted me to find a way to reach out to the Muslim world and engage much more with dominantly Muslim nations to help them feel good [when their not doing the Alla Akbar thing]  about their historic contribution to science, math and engineering.\u201d  [which they never did it was Assyrians, not Muslims ] In other words, NASA was to become an affirmative action feel good agency for Muslim nations [something akin to African American studies] ... whos technological prowess is on display daily throughout the Muslim world... now, which hand do I eat with?  The other travesty is the shifting of priorities to things like AGW a complete scientific fabrication again driven by politics and not science.
