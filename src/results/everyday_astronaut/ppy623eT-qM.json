Say a current satellite costs $400M and has 5 tonnes mass. If I said &#39;Make an equally capable satellite, but it can mass up to 10 tonnes&#39;, how much would this reduce the cost? If it reduces the cost by $100M, then it makes sense to make the more massive satellite, pay an extra $50M for a Falcon Heavy launch (over F9) and come out $50M better off. <b>If</b> there are considerable cost reductions by not scrimping on mass, this could drive demand for FH launches.<br><br>It is possibly a bit early to be asking this, but: How do the costs of New Glenn compare to SpaceX F9 and FH? My initial thoughts are that SpaceX has more flexibility by having two sizes of rocket (NG is similar to FH in lift capacity) and SpaceX&#39;s second stage looks much smaller than NG&#39;s, therefore one might expect it to be cheaper. As the second stage (and in case of NG, optional third stage) are not recovered on either rocket, cheaper is better.
