The satellite uses an orbital insertion burn to speed up to geosynchronous velocity (2*pi*(23000+4000)/24) mph (roughly 7000mph). The upper stage isn&#39;t going fast enough to stay at that altitude so will plunge back down to perigee. Deorbit burn is best at highest velocity (= lowest orbital height, i.e. perigee).", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T14:38:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ibnu Zandra", "comment_text": "Indonesia", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T14:38:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mufti Ali", "comment_text": "you pronounced it pretty accurate, it&#39;s fine", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T14:37:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "2 Terrible Toads", "comment_text": "Where do you find the chat feature and how often do you do those?", "comment_date": "2018-08-07T14:37:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kornel Kornecki", "comment_text": "The symbol for kilogram is kg not KG.
