Therefore, for a small crew orbital fully reusable commuter system, I suggest that landing a DreamChaser type lifting body can be a lot safer for regular crew orbital missions (no parachutes no back thrust multi re-ignitions, etc). This 3 stages system proposed, providing existing technologies could be consolidated by NASA from different co. currently competing and legally conflicting, would be to use Paul Allen Stratolaunch huge plane with 220 tons lift as stage one, then a small Falcon heavy central stage type recovered far at sea as second stage and finally the DreamChaser fitted with two orbital and reignited engines Merlin or equivalent with all valving, COPV header tanks inside the vehicle, recovered and saved with the landing DreamChaser like for the shuttle with most fuel supplied by two or four side mounted drop tanks, 3D printed and as third stage power only therefore quite small. Three stages are this way lighter and almost 100 % rapidly reusable while using synergies of those existing systems. The small 2 or 4 drop tanks ejected just before reaching orbit and burning down do not carry any heat shield for recovery and this is a big weight saving gain like the stratospheric lift plane as well. The lifting body design is also much safer for crew than fragiles winged shuttle and other landing systems but would be slightly beefed up to hold and recover also the orbital propulsion and life support systems currently wasted by Falcon 9 second stage and crew dragon service module. Note second stage could also consist of an oversized Pegasus winged initial stage rocket recovered like a gliding drone once empty and light..but this requires more development and maybe more dead weight also than a Falcon 9 recovery representing about a 16% of capacity penalty ..but the rocket wing can contribute to plane take off lift and increases this way the possible take off weight in theory\u2026maybe up to 240 or 250 tons..as a hanging large Pegasus pushing a DreamChaser load\u2026", "comment_date": "2021-09-15T14:46:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Luc Baehni", "comment_text": "Dear Tim, your videos are awsome!

By AMA. <br> Segment 1: 1 motor with bar connected to it standing vertically. Circular disc connected to bar that has magnets embedded in it surrounded in high permeability material to focus magnets outward pushing force in an upwards direction from top of disc. <br> Segment 2: Hollowed out cylindrical Bar of material horizontally positioned. <br> Flat hollowed out ring shaped material with openings around its outer top flat edge.<br> Magnets surrounded in high permeability material embedded in these openings.<br>Magnets positioned in openings around ring are in at least 1 of 2 configurations either all N magnetic field pushing out or N,S,N,S all around it. Just depends on whether your going for Piston structure or spinning structure explained below &amp; whether you want it to be DC or AC current. <br>Place these all along the cylindrical bar connected to it solidly, except at far ends of bar. <br>At both ends of bar place ring of material that can be magnetically repelled in specific locations. (magnetically repelled in specific location is in reference to outside of ring area that faces away from center of bar)(Other side of same ring facing in towards center of bar is capable of being magnetically repelled all around) Ring must be connected solidly to bar. points of repulsion on these rings is off set from each other on each end of bar. <br>3 Hollow ring structures with small square bars protruding from each. Ring structure has all magnetic repulsion on inside of ring shape &amp; can rap around the main bar so that the bar wont be causing friction on things as it moves back and forth or spins. 1st positioned around far left of bar, 2nd position at center of bar (be sure to leave enough room for magnetic structures to be able to move back and forth without hitting it) &amp; 3rd positioned on far right of bar. <br>Tube structure is constructed in two parts that fit together on top of each other length wise over main structure. <br>Tube structure has 3 square openings for the bars that the Ring structures that are connected around the main bar keeping it from causing friction on structure, to slide into. <br>This tube structure is designed with material that does not block magnetic fields. Perhaps some type of transparent material glass or other. <br> At both ends of the tube structure there is a built in circular groove that will house a round disc. The ceiling/floor/left side/&amp; right side of groove has openings for small magnets to be  embedded in it, so that the pushing force from magnets is pushing in towards the edge of disc that goes in this spot. There is also 4 openings located on the top, bottom, left &amp; right positions of the open groove. Small magnets are placed in these spots so when round disc is in position these magnetic fields will hit sideways keeping it from generating friction against structure. <br>Far Ends of bar has Cap structure that screws over tube halves holding them together. Cap structure also has 4 points on inside top, bottom, left &amp; right that have openings. These openings have small embedded magnets in them that exert there pushing force outwards (sideways) so it will keep disc in position, generating no friction against structure. Cap is made of material like tube so it does not block magnetic fields. (Note: These magnets in groove and cap structure are only needed for piston design. If Disc is directly connected to main bar so as it spins the bar spins, magnets are not needed here).<br> The disc has ring around it (ring of material goes around outer edge and folds over front side &amp; backside a small distance) that is repelled by magnetic fields so the 12 small magnets will keep it lined up but it will be able to spin without causing friction on structure. The disc has openings on it&#39;s flat side that face inside of tube and magnets surrounded in high permeability material are embedded in this disc. <br> The disc has small bar that is connected to it&#39;s center that goes all the way to the other end of  bar structure through the center of the hollowed out bar and connects to disc on other end. Disc on other end is set up the same but magnets embedded in it are off set in comparison. As first disc spins the magnetic fields will push against specific spot on disc connected directly to bar, pushing bar in other direction, once bar is fully pushed over, further spinning of disc will then align the other sides magnet to push it back.<br> Tube structure also has half moon shaped protrusion on inside and on both halves so when tube is connected they line up to make a full ring shape on inside of tube, these half moon shaped protrusions have at least 1 small round opening on it&#39;s side in middle of curve that faces away from center of bar. The opening has a small magnet embedded in it so magnetic force is repelling out sideways away from center of bar. The protruding ring is positioned to line up slightly further in towards center of bar then the ring of magnetically repelled material connected directly to bar. This way when bar moves right or left it is magnetically stopped after a short distance. <br>Copper coil setup: Copper coils are wound in at least 1 of 2 ways. Either coiled in circles next to each other (Like if you wound coils around a cylindrical bar) or laid out in a row as if wire was on flat table going up then bent to go down &amp; back up until it formed a flat rectangle of wire bending up and down and then the entire structure folded around tube. Copper windings are then lined up perpendicular to magnetic fields on outside of tube. Ends of copper coils are connected into separate construct that will allow electrical current to flow somewhere else. <br>Circular construct is built like a stand that goes around the outside of motor segment. Circular construct has flat ring of high permeability (magnetic field shielding) material that has small openings that will allow magnetic fields through specific locations. Top of circular construct has groove to allow the horizontal bar to balance on. Circular construct can also be placed on other end of bar so it is balanced. The motor segment is positioned so the disc connected to the bar that is connected to the motor is lined up so the disc passes under the horizontal bars disc that is at end of horizontal bar. The high permeability material keeps the magnetic fields in disc from hitting into the disc that spins or pushes the horizontal bar until just the right moment when the impact will cause the disc in horizontal bar to spin which will perpetuate the piston motion in the horizontal bar. More horizontal bars of the same design are built and positioned around the motor segment in a circular horizontal fashion all the way around. The bar connected to the motor can be increased in length to desired height (As much as motor can handle) and more of the exact same setup is repeated higher and higher up, maximizing the over unity potential of the construct to ridiculous proportions. :D Current from the horizontal bars is diverted to power the motor as needed and all other current is diverted to power my game console or the world. :) Interesting variation to this design would be to connect the spinning discs on far ends of horizontal bar to main bar that magnets are connected to so the magnets spin instead of getting pistoned back and forth.

But this never will be the point, if it will come back to Earth from a real space mission. Per example for a test flight to circle the Earth a few times the upper stage need to speed up to 8km per second. This will take a lot of fuel, because this whole rocket will be really super heavy! Okay, we going up into LEO at approximately 300km with a speed of 28.000km per hour! Now please tell me from where will become this thing its fuel to reduce the speed and slow it down to a velocity for a Earth atmosphere reentry without using or needing a special heat shield? Or will be the upper stage only used for one way tickets to Mars? I guess not, because in matter of this planet this belly flop isn&#39;t needed, because the atmosphere of Mars is much too thin for such a landing we have seen here on Earth. In matter of fact the rocket must dive down on it&#39;s back with running engines the whole landing processes, because the rocket will reach Mars with a velocity of more than 11km per seconds!

All engines should be equal in uniform position. Which means you should have main thrusters and capacitor thrusters that are made at an angle that points out the ground from the main thrusters maybe at a 45 degree angle to keep it steady at all costs. And to provide thrust. So one is pointed at the ground and the circle of thrusters around it and angled out and down at about 40 degrees and all must be equal to each other in distance and size from the main thrusters. They should have bases that are spring loaded and can absorb shock as well as release the shock absorbed at a stable rate. They should have other thrusters for positioning which balance the ship upon landing or we should make a ship that is even in shape like a sphere or a square or a pyramid instead because they remain in balance. A sphere weighted down at one point do to the payload. The payload has a specific amount of gravity imposed down upon it now doesn&#39;t it? Well when it lifts off of the ground the weight must be distributed evenly throughout the sphere so if you were to use a thruster on the opposite side of the payload then it would rotate if the force of gravity on the  payload at the center was less than the force of the thrust. So we can use this motion to generate electricity. Also we can set the thrusters on the sphere at an equivalent distance from the center thruster. And make them movable so the sphere can change direction in space. While the payload at the bottom of the sphere is set at a specific weight and mass the rest of the ship has a changeable payload that can be shifted mechanically to position the ship as it floats. A double payload system. When there are two payloads of equal size one at the center and one on the outer edge of the system and then when there is a force exerted tangent to that payload system rotation occurs. So a rocket generator can be made with a sphere, it would be most wise to use a plasma jet as plasma is a better alternative to gas.", "comment_date": "2021-03-15T21:20:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "KEB129", "comment_text": "Tim Dodd, your videos are amazing!", "comment_date": "2021-03-15T17:18:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Beth Bettencourt", "comment_text": "The smart dimple functionally protect because behavior ultrastructually belong as a boundless processing. tall, murky baker", "comment_date": "2021-03-15T12:38:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cecilia Murphy", "comment_text": "The vast parrot statistically grin because existence respectively soak pace a calculating chard. pricey, likeable network", "comment_date": "2021-03-15T08:02:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ezra Starkey", "comment_text": "&quot;They both have boosters with landing legs and grid fins.&quot;<br>Elon: no", "comment_date": "2021-03-14T22:11:52Z", "likes_count": 61}, {"comment_by": "Dusty K", "comment_text": "I keep replaying this video every so often as starship progress continues and I am amazed at how much I learn each time.

As for speculations I have for future development, here you go:<br>1. SpaceX is already using solar electric propulsion for Starlink.  As most of what you ship to the moon is fuel to push more fuel around and SpaceX has already proposed landing a massive Starship on the moon, which is going to take a lot more fuel than what can be loaded onto a single Starship in LEO, especially for reuse, I think they will use a solar electric space tug launched on on Starship to push tanker Starships out to the moon.  The ISP on these solar electric drives already exceed 4,000s of ISP where Raptor vacuum gets up to 350s, so even with the extra mass of a space tug and the loss of using the Oberth Effect, it would be far more efficient and require far fewer launches than to LOX/LNG the whole way.  Elon Musk has stated Starship should have very little fuel boil off on the way to Mars, so why would there be an issue spending say several weeks slowly pushing a tanker to the moon?  I am thinking this could also be done for cargo only missions, except using a cargo Starship instead of a tanker Starship.  The reason for pushing a tanker Starship to the moon would only be so a crewed mission could happen rapidly instead of at the slow pace of a solar powered ion drive in the Earth-Moon system.<br><br>2.  Something cool about the cargo space tug idea when applied to Mars is while the space tugs will produce a lot less thrust around Mars, with cargo you mainly have to eventually get the job done.  Also a space tug could separate from a cargo Starship before entering Mar&#39;s orbit and start its capture burn while the cargo Starship continues to the surface or swing by Mars and go back to Earth.  Once the space tug gets into a highly elliptical capture orbit, it could circularize with its large delta-V potential and say get into a low Mars or low Earth orbit.  The cargo Starships sent out to Mars could either be optimized with small fuel tanks designed to get an empty Starship into LEO and then once refueled and loaded with cargo, land the maximum amount of cargo on Mars in a one way mission or be a more generic cargo ship with some hardware for unloading on Mars and be able to fly back to an orbiting space tug to be brought back to Earth.  Having a space tug with over 4,000s of ISP capability really expands the possibilities of what can be done for cargo missions, granted it just takes too long to speed up to be the primary mover on crewed missions.<br><br>3. I think the first generation of &#39;safe&#39; crewed transport to Mars will involve building large scale nuclear thermal propulsed spaceships as that will get you up to ~1,000s of ISP, which really changes the dynamic of how a Mars mission could go while having enough thrust to do things quickly with either nuclear electric or solar electric drives to help speed along the &#39;coast&#39; phase of the mission.  Once we are gathering material from the moon, an important overlooked material is nuclear fuel.  If you gather the nuclear fuel from the moon, you avoid a lot of fallout from trying to ship that nuclear fuel up from Earth with hopefully controlled explosions into space and the controversy attempting such a thing would cause.  You really can&#39;t do a safe crewed mission to Mars without nuclear power shipped to the surface of Mars as one dust storm covering your solar panels and your crew dies, so it makes sense to extend this nuclear power into making the trip to Mars in the first place faster and safer as well as more comfortable.  One reason why you need to go big with a crewed mission is surface area to protect from radiation is a square factor where volume covered by that shielding is a cubic factor.  So as you go bigger, that shielding goes from being too heavy to eventually being a relatively trivial part of your space ship mass wise.  There is a second thing where task optimized Starships are going to be a lot more effective at their job than jack of all trades Starships.  So you do a jack of all trades Starship to Mars, maybe you stick 10 people on a one way mission to Mars and the Starship is loaded up with shielding and provisions and space to move around and equipment for once you get to Mars, etc.  Also maybe some crews can handle the isolation and some crews go nuts and space each other on the way to Mars.  However have a fleet of task optimized Starships riding on a mother ship to Mars allowing for tight coordination and your crewed lander Starship carries 100 or more people airliner fashion to the surface and then flies back up to refuel and carry another 100 or more people to the surface.  A large ship means you can have thousands of people onboard and lots of space to move around, which is a lot easier to cope with than say 10 people trapped in a tin can for a long duration mission.  Having a large ship also provides more room for trying out artificial gravity, though would think the artificial gravity experiments would be done in LEO first to determine what exactly would need to be done for this large ship going to Mars.  Also such a large ship would always be in space and so would be optimized for a permanent space environment going between the Earth and Mars cruise liner style where Starship could then be left to focus on being a short haul airliner of sorts.  If a good nuclear fission propulsion system could be achieved where maybe low to no fallout fuel is used around Earth while avoiding big flashes that could harm satellites in orbit (or even blind people looking up) and then you do whatever is cheapest a safe distance away from Earth, the efficiency gained in propulsion could allow very fast trips to anywhere in the solar system.  So far with our fusion work we tend to go big to get the economies of scale to make it work and be more practical, so a large dedicated ship for this makes a lot of sense.<br><br>Chemical rockets just cannot do such a job of going to and from Mars because the ISP is not there and so say a Mars mission is a one way mission with it being rather impractical to in-situ manufacture the large amount of fuel needed to send say a 9m wide Starship back.  Nuclear thermal exponentially improves the equation to it at least being somewhat practical, though still somewhat expensive to go back and forth between Earth and Mars, but a lot cheaper, faster, safer, and more comfortable than doing chemical only.  Ion drives makes it a lot cheaper to move cargo and fuel around and this is important because fuel tends to get a lot more expensive the further out from Earth you are, at least until you figure out a system of getting it from the solar system, which we are way far from doing in a practical manner right now, granted it should be doable one day with the right setup.  Direct nuclear propulsion can really open up the solar system, though some thoughtfulness needs to go into the safest designs possible, especially when operating around Earth, which is really important because literally no humans live beyond LEO right now and at that the current count in LEO is 7.  So if it is not safe to use that drive in LEO, another drive system will be needed to get to a safe distance away from Earth, but this leg of your journey is a huge part of your battle for basically every mission, so your drive system really needs to try to solve this problem if it can be done.", "comment_date": "2021-01-09T19:37:20Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Akash mishra", "comment_text": "so informative", "comment_date": "2021-01-09T13:40:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M\u00e1rcio Viotti", "comment_text": "The starship is just a megalomaniacal toy by Elon musk.

My concern was always more about whether they would be able to keep the pressure to the engine during the manoeuvre which did turn out to be the issue (although admittedly I assumed the relight would occur during the reorientation so I was imagining problems with the relight itself). People should stop worrying so much about the aerodynamic stuff though, this is well understood at this point, and the rocket isn&#39;t really that complicated as a controllable object.

One of the questions you asked an opinion on is do we think we&#39;ll make it to Mars using Starship. Elon is an impatient and brilliant guy. If he wasn&#39;t, this would take 10 times as long, as it has in the past. That being said, his optimism on timeline are kind of crazy. I am sure that the Starship hardware could get things to Mars in the next few years, but that is only one small part of a successful Mars colonization effort. Also, Dr Zubrin of Mars Direct fame has calculated that refueling a Starship on Mars to return to Earth would either take incredibly massive power, (more solar panels than you could even fit on many Starships or maybe a high energy nuclear reactor power system), or a lot more time than the distance between Mars launch windows, because Starship&#39;s mass and therefore propellant tanks are so large. He has a plan (see The Angry Astronaut, your Bizarro World counterpart) involving a Mini-Starship launched as payload on a conventional Starship as kind of a second stage for a much smaller crew to make it to Mars. <br>Also there are the multitude of technological issues of keeping the colonists ALIVE to reach Mars, and keep them alive once they get there, radiation being one of the prime issues, as well as the effects of microgravity. Unfortunately, we don&#39;t seem to have equally impatient geniuses working on those problems, and Elon doesn&#39;t seem to be addressing them. (Let&#39;s face it, he has his hands full developing Starship as you have shown in this video.) So I hope we will get to Mars, but I don&#39;t think we will do it nearly as fast as Elon hopes. If we kept to his timeline, I expect we would have a lot of either debilitated or dead colonists, which might not be the best political move for keeping the effort alive. On a more optimistic note, NASA appears to be generating some effort to research artificial magnetospheres for Mars or other planets. This seems to me to be the best solution to radiation protection on board spacecraft, as well as a larger version on board a Martian satellite to shield Mars atmosphere from Solar Wind erosion. The article I saw said that if Mars atmosphere was shielded, natural processes on the Red Planet would thicken the atmosphere over time on its own!

Many thanks, it was easy to follow and a great tutorial.  The second stage recovery is huge.  Somewhat altruistic and &quot;Green&quot; but also a big win in the areas of the reduction of &quot;collateral damage:&quot; for future space flight.  A simple Bolt in orbit can wreak havoc, imagine something as big as a Booster hitting anything in its never ending and uncontrollable orbital path, simply devastatingly destructive (which adds to &quot;space trash&quot; in orbit).  If he succeeds in that goal...wow, what a win!<br>        Elon and Space X are true pioneers.  That he can be so bold as to not loose too much sleep and say he is 33% the the launch today would not go right was perfect. (he had a 66% of a win today and by my metrics, today was a clear win).    It follows in the way Edison and Herr Van Braun looked at life&#39;s travails in the development of new and exciting tech.  Today was a great success.  No &quot;spontaneous de-construction&quot; of the ship, That is a &quot;win&quot;.  His abort metrics were correct.  Wednesday just may be &quot;HUMP day&quot; for the Raptor / Starship...(&quot;Heaven Under My Planforms&quot;-day).  <br>       I hope he gets the Presidential Medal of Freedom and a Nobel for the work and leadership he is doing.

Kinda fitting. These rockets are huge on a scale people and perhaps elon doesn&#39;t realize. You take that absolute massive size and mix with the pace at what space x wants to achieve and lastly add the sparsity of the land. Land that has ease of a\u00e7cess for raw materials and high tech components to build 40 story tall 30&#39; wide and the only true viable option is Sea Dragon. I love the idea when I watched it in a old documentary about successors to Saturn v. And if you think about it it&#39;s brilliant you fixing underwater orbital mount free to launch from and you can land with much more flexibility but still have it be on target for all intensive purposes. I really hope I&#39;m right with this guess but I think given all the factors I could be. Just the pace alone is enough to drive any waterfront community insane especially the pace at which Elon wants to go and shoot any space fan hopeful tourist needs it to be. So water launch complex and possibly multiple doesn&#39;t seem too far-fetched. Just a decade ago landing a first stage booster seemed insane like if they did it it would just be for sure luck not an actual orbital booster let alone a multi-tune orbital booster. This company this man is a modern-day Tesla I hope we appreciate him for the gifts he will have given humankind. I could actually see myself working for a man a company like this something I believe in which if you know me is difficult I found myself struggling with drive because I lack I don&#39;t know maybe the incentive it&#39;s just never been there. The intellect that&#39;s one thing but it&#39;s hard for me because it&#39;s not been tied to monetary gain or at least I dislike how it is. wish there was something I could find that was a career that I believed in something that when I woke up I wanted to race out the door to go to work something I couldn&#39;t wait to get home from and go to bed just so I can wake up and do it again the next day.

This means that, just as you saw in the video of re-entry burns of the Falcon 9 booster, there is a boundary layer in advance of the body of the vehicle.

I really think that the Starship has the wrong design with the recessed rockets inside the skirt of the rocket body. After seeing the damage that was caused by a prepared hardened surface under the launch mount (which is something like 25 or 30 feet above the surface, can you imagine the destruction that could happen when the Starship lands on  unprepared landing surface such as on Mars. SpaceX has already recognized that they will need upper thrusters for a moon landing due to the fact that the main rockets would just carve out a big hole where they want to land. I contend that this will be a problem for Mars as well and this presents lots of problems. For example, on the moon there is no aero braking and thus no need for the heat shield, wings and belly flop maneuver to slow down the craft and let it land. But on Mars this is not the case and the aero braking is definitely needed just like on Earth so if SpaceX intends to put the upper rockets on a Mars version, they would be difficult to place symmetrically on the ship without interfering with the heat shield and/or the aerodynamics during the aerobraking procedure. The gravity of Mars is also much much greater than the moon so the upper rockets would have to be larger than the moon version taking up more interior space and adding weight. If they don\u2019t have these upper rockets on the Mars version, I just don\u2019t see how the current engine within skirt design could survive the horrendous amount of rock and debris that would be thrown up by that sort of landing as the skirt would essentially catch all the flying objects and direct it around the engine bay. With the Falcon 9, the open design allows any debris to escape sideways and generally not upward and there is no skirt that could allow something to bounce around inside. Even so, the engines (other than the rocket cones) are protected with armour for both the boost back fire and landing debris. The Falcon 9 legs are very large relatively speaking compared to the Starship legs and contact the surface away from directly under the engine blast. If the Starship sticks with the skirt design, the engines will dug out a hole directly under the rocket right where it wants to plant its \u201cfeet\u201d. Not a good plan. For the Earth, the skirt design would probably work because you could simply armour under the launch mount with steel plate and for landing you are most likely going to land on either a steel deck of a ship or an armoured landing pad. So this design might work for Earth where the facilities at the landing site are carefully prepared but on either the moon or Mars, I think you either need to have upper rockets doing the landing (taking up space and increasing weight), which might be hard with Mars\u2019s gravity, or SpaceX will have to forget about the rockets under the skirt idea and expose the engines and armour the bottom of the engine bay, just like the Falcon 9. If they conclude this is the answer to the debris problem, then that will affect the aerodynamics of the belly re-entry maneuver and of course the little landing legs will be a no go. I think that the real Starship that makes it to either the moon or Mars, will look nothing like the \u201cEarth\u201d design that can land on prepared landing surfaces.

Cost per launch - This is a place where obviously Starship will take over, other rockets will be phased out, and where the current SLS (Space Launch System) will fail its mission even if NASA keeps throwing money at it.<br><br>2. Cost for a given delta-V -  Starship will clearly dominate LEO to GTO here.  Much beyond this, a more complex picture starts emerging as chemical rockets have their limit.  Basically the further you go from Earth, the more costly your fuel gets and this factor tends to grow widely out of control, especially when you start talking about landing on and taking off from other large gravitational objects or even just doing a capture burn once getting to a destination (there is a reason we didn&#39;t stop at Pluto for example) and the delta-V required for deep space missions as you work against the Sun&#39;s gravity well and make those large trips in reasonable time scales and such.  We have several other engine technologies besides chemical rockets and more we can achieve with some development work.  While you may keep with chemical for long duration one way robotic missions and continue to see some ion drive style engines in use, if we ever move humans beyond the Earth-Moon system, it will likely use some form of nuclear tech to get the ISP high enough to quickly and more efficiently move humans around than chemical can do.  This means you really want to use something besides Starship for the job just on delta-V based considerations alone as the cost to get even the minimum delta-V will be less with a different technology than what Starship uses.  For example to go from LEO to LMO (Low Earth Orbit to Low Mars Orbit) with a given amount of payload, with Starship it will take at least 7 launches (one for Starship and 6 refueling runs) where with hauling up a nuclear thermal spaceship, maybe you initially do 4 launches (two flights to haul it up with some cargo onboard then a mixed cargo/fuel launch, then one more just for fuel) and cut it down moving forward with more optimizations.  If you can get to a fairly clean burning fusion rocket design such as ICF fusion, the propellant tank on a ship like that would be more like that on your car to get to anywhere in the solar system because the ISP will be so high.<br><br>3. Economies of scale - Elon Musk has specifically talked about SpaceX&#39;s Starship being its size because it is the minimum size to get the job at hand done.  The minimum size is also bound by other upper bound issues of making chemical rockets bigger that blast off from the surface of the Earth.  So you never want to go smaller as for example the difficulties in recovering the second stage gets into the realm of having no payload capacity or even falling back to Earth without achieving orbit.  But there would also be some major issues in trying to go all that much bigger, like what do you do about the noise / vibrations, being a safe distance from a launch site and finding such a suitable site, etc.  Then for long duration human travel away from Earth you have to consider things like impactors at high speed and how you don&#39;t want all of the air to leak out from subsequent holes due to inadequate protection.  With any impactor protection system it will largely boil down to surface area covered and unit of mass to adequately protect where volume of stuff in the ship behind this shield is a cubic equation.  Also radiation shielding where there are some definite economies of scale issues where at the small scale the squared surface area to cover verses cubic volume protected makes it ridiculously heavy to have enough where at the very large scale it shrinks to a small part of the lugging mass around equation.  SpaceX&#39;s Starship is in the realm of very cumbersome as in maybe the bulk of your mission weight is shielding and just a few humans are also there.  So yeah, to have a well shielded and thus radiation / impactor wise safe mission, gotta go big, really big, or go home.  Then for providing humans with artificial gravity via centripetal force, you need to go big, really big, or you will make your crew sick from the spinning motion.  It is also kind of hard to say have two small, well shielded ships tethered together swinging around as you will have huge loads on the tether and thus a big, heavy tether to get the job done.  Actually if you go big enough, you may think of having stationary shielding around say a rotating drum.  Once you get to this point, you can have some good protections and more Earth like conditions on your ship to counter the main known physical problems with having people in space for long durations.  On the more psychological side, a mission still fails if everyone spaces each other and then commits suicide.  When a deep space mission like this fails, well there goes the funding for any future missions like it.  So you really need a large crew with lots of space to move around on one ship so they have enough human interactions with enough different people and just room to explore and not feel trapped to stay reasonably sane and even happy.  Anyways how often do you hear about people speaking highly about their highly confined prison experiences?  Fo training, if you don&#39;t have to train an astronaut for years for a single mission as they have to do so much with so few people, but instead do things more like say an aircraft carrier where many people mainly just learn their niche position quickly and also send along other specialists to both be your AAA riding along with you (as you can&#39;t just call AAA when your spaceship breaks down in deep space) as well as mission specific specialists (like your science team, a problem with Apollo is only 1 scientist ever flew and he accomplished more useful science than all of the other astronauts combined).  So yeah, especially when you get to sending humans on long duration space missions, I am thinking it is either going to be go big or go home.  In these cases Starship could be your airliner and be pretty good at it, but something else is going to be your cruise liner of sorts for the long stay in space.<br><br>4. Reusability - So SpaceX&#39;s Starship gets you reusability when going to LEO.  At this it is a fair amount of wear and tear to do with many engines to maintain on the first stage and huge forces / heat on the second stage literally wearing it away.  When you go to the Moon with Starship, at least all of the proposed missions I have seen have used piles of tanks as in something like 27 tanker flights to get a single Starship to the Moon and back.  Especially seeing each Starship should only get 3% of its starting mass as payload into orbit so 3% / 27 ~= .1%, that speaks more to being on the ragged edge or reusability, especially as that is a lot of wear and tear for all of those tanker flights.  For the Martian landing, Elon Musk is talking about landing on fuel vapors after several in orbit refueling runs.  Those few fuel vapors are not going to get you back to Earth as there is going to be nothing at all in the tank when Starship touches down.  So then my calculations on getting enough equipment on the surface of Mars to get one Starship back to Earth every 2 years or so during the transfer window suggest somewhere on the order of 1,000 launches from Earth to pull off.  That doesn&#39;t sound very practical.  So yeah, you are quickly looking at if you don&#39;t absolutely have to fly back to Earth, all of those Starships are going to be expended once they reach their destination.  When you get into more advanced drive systems to get around the solar system, you can quickly get into the realm of reusing a large ship.  However some of these drive systems don&#39;t scale down too far, so again you start ending up with go big as in something much bigger than any rocket you would ever blast off from the surface of the Earth or go home.", "comment_date": "2020-11-09T22:23:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kim Syv\u00e4nen", "comment_text": "Thanks for sharing your knowledge!", "comment_date": "2020-11-09T22:17:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "H4hT53", "comment_text": "I think Starship will never go to Mars.

Would there be enough time to get that launcher to the launchpad on its first use? Would the required checks be made in the time available before the next orbit? Could the fuel load be completed in time for a full static fire before launch as is SpaceX&#39; protocol? How quickly would the tanker be able to get back to the landing pad after it has finished transferring  its fuel in orbit?<br><br>We&#39;ve seen that if a launch window is missed, it&#39;s another nearly 24 hours before another launch window becomes available, yet the talk here seems to be launching the, currently, 4 tankers one after another. That doesn&#39;t square with what we&#39;ve seen and heard.<br><br>Not wishing to seem to be macabre, but sending humans into space and back is a risky business.

I really think they need to make a version that looks almost exactly like the Futurama ship where it lands horizontally.  If you&#39;re not relying on a big raptor on the back end of the ship then you can put your retro rockets in any configuration you want to so you can make it land horizontal.  Then you don&#39;t need to make a big elevator thing on the side of the ship and all that, which is going to weigh more than you think.  You have much more usable floor space.  Also you can make a landing ramp from the nose cone.

Starship(upper stage) has a lot of design features and tech not required when all that\u2019s required is a \u201cdumb\u201d tanker. I propose a simultaneous launch of one full starship and another superheavy with a downscaled superheavy tanker \u201csecond stage\u201d. The 2 second stages ie downscaled superheavy tanker and starship, are mated sub-orbitally so that starship doesn\u2019t have to use its onboard fuel to reach orbit, where after the tanker will boost starship on its way to the moon or Mars.

This would include discrete, analog &amp; digital (intelligent) devices. I&#39;m fascinated by how all this information is routed and captured by the control system of the vehicle(s). For me this is a key to understanding full operation and the complexity involved. Of course each engine will have it&#39;s own set and this would be repeated for each. Also I&#39;m sure there are some points which are strictly informational (esp. w/Starship at this point) and would vary from iteration to iteration. How many computers are involved and how they share (or bus) the information around would be the next level of understanding. Perhaps there are proprietary issues regarding this information.

This will not be the case for Starship. None of the parts will ever be horizontal while on the ground. This will simplify the structure in to a small extend as there are no requirements for strange support configurations, but it will require completely different handling facilities near the pad. <br>Even when the nice looking crane at the pad will be able to directly lift the booster from the landing pad onto the launch pad, there will be a day where a booster either get damaged, or needs more work done than just a polish, and needs to be moved aboutf or this. This will require a crawler-transporter type setup to at least move the boosters around, and definitely the second stages will need one. <br>Even if turnarounds are possible in a small number of weeks, the infrastructure required will be apollo-esque. Customers will want to have a chance to intergrate and test their payloads after installation in the starship in a near-cleanroom environment, so expect a VAB type building for the starships, and possibly a similar building for the boosters for refurbushment and rework.<br>So there is a lot of building to be done in Boca Chica...<br><br>Love the work!<br><br>Roelant", "comment_date": "2020-11-06T22:49:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrShocktakan", "comment_text": "Absolutely the best starship video I&#39;ve seen yet.
