I suspect the howling is pressure relief valves or regulators passing through unstable regions of their operation during shut down. These could be in the hydraulics, the fuel or the oxidizer fluid handling system. Nearly all fluid handling systems employ devices of this type in one fashion or another. You might want to ask Elon about it. FWIW this type of operational instability can transmit fatiguing vibrations through the plumbing, resulting and burst pipes and joints. This is what caused the loss of rudder control on the Amoco Cadiz Oil tanker and was the root cause of it running aground and spilling 1,604,500 barrels of oil along the coast of France in 1978. The Cadiz was blown off course towards a rocky shore in a storm. Just as you hear in some car&#39;s power steering when you turn the wheel full hard, when the pilot on the Cadiz turned full hard rudder to avoid the rocks, the the hydraulic relief valves squealed. Except in this case the Belville washers in the hydraulics resonated at the same frequency at the bolts holding the flanges together. As the pilot maintained hard rudder the bolts fatigued and broke causing full loss of rudder. I only mention this because it appears that the Starship uses a lot of Stainless in its plumbing and Stainless is quite vulnerable to fatigue failure.", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T02:27:54Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "KaBup", "comment_text": "So now what?

The reason the deluge is done by spraying water all over is for absorbing sound waves produced by the engines. It probably helps somewhat with the heat as well, but the main reason for it is to prevent concrete from cracking due to acoustic shock.<br>By spraying water all over, tiny droplets are being produced. Each tiny droplet absorbs some of the energy from the sound waves and heat up. All of the droplets together are able to absorb enough acoustic energy to soften the blow to the concrete.<br><br>A big pool of water would have a similar problem to bare concrete, which is that a mass of water really resists getting out of the way when impacted. In the case of sound waves, they will happily reflect off the water, back up at the rocket. There will probably be some spray kicked up which might help a little, but likely nowhere near as well as the mist produced by water deluge systems of today.", "comment_date": "2021-01-14T01:43:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "_-A_c-_", "comment_text": "Soooo many timestamps from so many generous people!
