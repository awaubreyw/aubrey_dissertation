Many of the deep polar craters never see the sun (which provides shelter from solar activity, and which contain water, which can be converted into fuel (hydrogen and oxygen).", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T08:20:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ThanoSalt", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfc2Jg1gkKA&amp;t=2m24s\">2:24</a> literally starship lol", "comment_date": "2021-03-21T07:33:43Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Denis Day", "comment_text": "\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u043e \u0431\u044b\u043b\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0451\u0442 \u0441 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0451\u0442\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043c\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\u043c\u0438 \u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0443\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u044d\u0440\u0438\u0441 4 \u0430 \u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0443\u0442\u044c \u0435\u0433\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u044e", "comment_date": "2021-03-19T07:34:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "server pro", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfc2Jg1gkKA&amp;t=13m48s\">13:48</a><br><br>Me: wait, theres hotdogs in space??", "comment_date": "2021-03-19T01:33:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Faix", "comment_text": "Isn\u2019t starship going to be an SSTO for Mars?", "comment_date": "2021-03-18T17:31:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ilkanar", "comment_text": "Imagine gravity is 1.5g, would that lock us up on earth for thousands of years more?", "comment_date": "2021-03-18T16:41:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rodrigo Lima", "comment_text": "He didn&#39;t try with planes", "comment_date": "2021-03-18T15:14:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rodrigo Lima", "comment_text": "He is suck", "comment_date": "2021-03-18T15:14:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rodrigo Lima", "comment_text": "Ele n\u00e3o tentou fazer com avi\u00f5es", "comment_date": "2021-03-18T15:13:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rodrigo Lima", "comment_text": "Ele \u00e9 uma merda", "comment_date": "2021-03-18T15:13:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "satyr0909", "comment_text": "What about the Russian Mik%NNr% (as in 17 of 38) military Jets?

First, one has to remember that the rocket equation was last formulated by Tsiolkovsky -- some basic versions of it go back much earlier -- in 1903, months before the Wright brothers proved the viability of mechanical flight. Chemical rockets are much older than airplanes, but if they were more fuel efficient for getting off the ground while still within our atmosphere, we would be flying around in jet packs, not jet planes. Second, the rocket equation is based on PROPELLANT-mass ratio, not FUEL-mass ratio, an important distinction, because a large amount of that propellent comes from oxygen, something which again, one is literally surrounded by when still taking off the ground. So, consider why current rocket design is inherently inefficient. Before launch, we fill a rocket engine full of the mass of hydrazine fuel AND oxygen, and then obtain all lift via direct thrust against gravity, immediately consuming that oxygen and not leveraging any other source of lift. First, address the lift issue. There is a reason Virgin Orbit is launching satellites from rockets launched from high altitude aircraft, because airplanes use less fuel to get you off the ground and shorten the trip the rocket has to travel. So the SSTO needs wings and horizontal takeoff. Second, there is no reason to fill an oxidizer tank on the ground for an engine that can start working as a traditional jet engine, using ambient oxygen while filling an initially empty oxygen tank in flight through freeze separation from the surrounding nitrogen. As speeds and altitude increase, the jet engine can convert to a ram jet engine, and later a scram jet engine to get to the edge of space and speeds of Mach 10+ before becoming a full fledged rocket engine and only THEN start consuming the stored up oxygen. Aerospikes can insure that the engine thrust is optimized for any altitude, further reducing the necessity of staging. Yes, while it would still be more fuel efficient to have this craft either detach from a mothership or shed some of its empty fuel dead weight in the form of staging, the inherent advantage of this craft -- that more than compensates for a diminished payload to fuel ratio, is that ditching stages or mating craft require anywhere from hours to several weeks to remate or replace, which means an SSTO&#39;s inherent cost savings would manifest in its ability to make several trips to and from space PER DAY. In fact, it is not even an SSTO that is so immediately useful as a single stage to SUB-orbit that could be used to ferry passengers from any point on the globe to any other point on the globe in an hour or so, revolutionizing commercial travel, the same way the jet engine did in the 1950s.", "comment_date": "2021-02-10T08:03:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Siddharth", "comment_text": "Spaceplanes are much better....", "comment_date": "2021-02-09T14:17:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Malva Halva", "comment_text": "SSTO&#39;s might suck in real life, but there amazing in KSP", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T11:31:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nonexistent concepts ", "comment_text": "I\u2019m going to say that you can just add more fuel tanks on the sides.", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T06:20:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Plarg", "comment_text": "Ok", "comment_date": "2021-02-07T00:00:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Noocrew", "comment_text": "When I was watching your video I was playing kerble space for Programme", "comment_date": "2021-02-06T08:15:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Whiteness Envy", "comment_text": "Spacex should use flux pinning to stop Starship in bellyflop above an electrically charged pad.

Both fatal dissasters were linked to these systems failing. And i keep thinking, well that was made with 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s technology advancements and hereditary of the Saturn V, surely if we redesigned the internals we could reduce some of the dry mass! What if for instance, though its not the best for the environment, instead of a huge compartment for cargo it was swapped out with SRBFUEL, Blowing the wings to a lifting body and adding hydrolox engines and a smaller tank optimised for the vacume of space on the trailing edges? Changing most of the internal dry mass from steel to modern composites, to reduce weight as mentioned before, reduced weight of the computers etc. with modern technology. changing the crew compartment to a smaller yet dockable size, for one use only: Shuttle to LEO. What if... this may very well be impossible, but it seems to me NASA tried to innovate too much from Shuttles to Venture Star all at once, instead of starting with the problems the orbiter had. Point is Airplanes where not without their faults in the beginning of the jet era either, critical crack distance on window frames exceeded, causing plaines to depressurize and plummit to the ground. Today&#39;s Dreamliners weren&#39;t build on 50&#39;s technology! <br><br>That aside, The Technology to get to Sci-fi like SSTO propulsion level tech, seems most likely to come in the form of turning energy into mass + speed. At which point a Nuclear Reactor, which changes nuclear mass into heat, could be utilized to transmute the fuel into hi-engery momentum capable material, with a non toxic exaust. What ever im rambling and it may seem like pseudo science, derived from quantum research at LHC in Cern.

Then switching to closed cycle with a presumably vacuum &quot;optimised&quot; engine to take advantage of that as well, in order to get into orbit. I actually don&#39;t know how it lands, but I&#39;m guessing after deorbiting it&#39;ll glide just like the space shuttle, once again utilizing the atmosphere.

I do prefer the SSTO SP method over the gravity turn of a rocket though. Holding at 20 degrees above the horizon will get you to space pretty quickly and efficiently but again you speed up much more in dense atmosphere creating heat and drag but it is still more efficient than speeding up after getting out of the atmosphere because you lose a lot of speed(deltaV) between ascent and circulation burns. I have been burning though my gravity turn recently. I ascend as normal until about 50-60k apoapsis (Physically 20-30k) then I begin to dip the nose about -10degrees below the horizon and it keeps my apoapsis from going much higher. The closer to 80 I get the more I dip the nose and it forces my periapsis out while holding my apoapsis where I want it and I don&#39;t use nearly as much deltaV by converting ascension deltaV into circularization. The angle is reversed to +10 degrees over the horizon once the apoapsis is reach. I have been able to hold at altitudes i like this way without the need to pro grade and retrograde nearly as much but back to SSTO&#39;s Re-entry is what worries me. You spend a long time aero-braking. I literally had to glide all the way in holding my non heat shielded belly up to create heat and drag to slow down..... It was a little scary. I didn&#39;t hit my engines until 2000 m to level my descent and line up with the runway.... It would have been awesome if I could have landed it without the need to level my decent but it was my first SSTO SP mission and I eyeballed it.... lol I was close though coming in hot belly up is a lot different than dropping in with a heat shield at just about any angle you want..... lol", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T16:15:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "James Wilson", "comment_text": "cheaper for passenger delivery; that&#39;s about it! you&#39;ll need rocketry for putting up payload....", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T15:41:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "clubgamerstudios", "comment_text": "I can see why this guy has 1/20 of his viewers hits the dislike button", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T07:50:11Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lalathi", "comment_text": "I love his respect for the Metric System, I&#39;m a New Zealander and it helps so much to understand what he&#39;s talking about.", "comment_date": "2020-06-27T00:33:50Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Oceanic 84", "comment_text": "Lost my attention after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sfc2Jg1gkKA&amp;t=2m29s\">2:29</a>...

He advocated various forms of \u201cspinning/rotating\u201d Elevators, where they would carry you to a higher orbit, where you would detach, and then use a bit of reaction-mass to get to an intercept with the next staged-elevator. Then you proceed to hook-up to it, rinse-repeat...

Engines efficient enough can be built, and are built, to lift a rocket into orbit in one stage, but at great cost and with some difficulty. More important than that is how the engines are actually built. The bell nozzle on rocket engines allows the air pressure around that bell to exert a given amount of pressure on their exhaust. At low altitudes, a given bell might work very efficiently, but at higher altitudes, not nearly as well. Staging a rocket allows you to switch between engines as you ascend, so you always have an engine firing that works most efficiently in that environment, given the pressure on its exhaust.<br><br>An engine like, say, a linear aerospike fixes that problem completely, as it can change its geometry mid-flight. Since an aerospike is also a bit lighter per pound of thrust than a conventional, bell-nozzle engine, the extra weight of multiple stages carrying the fuel needed for the extra engines I noted is unnecessary. Using an engine like this in an SSTO would be completely reusable, demolishing one of the greatest barriers to space travel; Cost. Such a craft could lift a similar amount of cargo as a larger multi-stage rocket, but at a fraction of the weight itself. <br><br>So while some SSTO designs might suck, no, the concept of the SSTO doesn\u2019t suck, and we actually know that some versions would be superior.

During the atmospheric part of its flight the wings will sweep further and further back as the speed increases as less wing area is needed for lift. (Of course, once outside the atmosphere, the wings are just &quot;along for the ride&quot;.)

If I&#39;m understanding you correctly, your point of view is that they&#39;re really difficult so it&#39;s better to just use staged craft. Does that mean they&#39;re not worth pursuing? The benefits of a working SSTO would make for a revolution in how we get to orbit; an enormous reduction in waste, cost and required time between flights. You talk about how no one has made a working SSTO as evidence that they&#39;re terrible but in the same breath praise the BFR for being reusable despite it existing only on paper. You mention the X-33, a potential SSTO that was plagued with technical issues; those issues have since mostly been solved through manufacturing advances. Advances in ablation technology, engine design, and manufacturing all point to a working SSTO spaceplane that could be built right now if someone put up the money for it.<br><br><br>The reason no one has attempted a working SSTO thus far is because for-profit space companies don&#39;t want to put the fate of their company on an unproven concept. Government space agencies&#39; budgets are also so hamstrung that they don&#39;t want to take that risk with the little operational money they have. The vast majority of the technology we use today for staged craft was designed and tested during the space race when cost was not really a factor.

Kerbal Space to proove your arguments - please... <br>Don&#39;t make it a SSTO yes or no decision based on the beauty of the pictures from stage separation; look at the reasons why staged rockets are used: No one actually tries create a SSTO with the aged (basically 1940ies) bell-shaped (or Laval) and thus highly inefficient rocket motors. BUT: if you use the almost completed X-33/venture star aerospike rocked motor ( the stopping reason was just the then non-secure (1970ies) composite fueltank NOT the linear aerospike), you are up to 30-35% more fuel-efficient with a more light rocket motor. Than you simply don&#39;t need more than one stage/motor, actually they just add weight. The empty fuel tanks don&#39;t compensate that advantage. Than you also understand that all the current SpaceX returning stages are just a way to somehow meet the need to reduce cost/payload while still using the today heavily tested laval motors and thus sticking to their design limits. Here&#39;s why the linear aerospike is stuck in developement: ARC just doesn&#39;t have the money to go big- their rocket is more a prove -of-concept, the x-33 data are not open source and Lockheed Martin currently are not working on carrier systems. And the other companies would have to dare to start all over again in the R&amp;D cycle done in the 1970ies without being funded for it...Even Elon Musk (who considered the aerospike) shied away from designing the falcon around a whole new rocket motor design as he simply could rely on buying in the existing knowledge of traditional rocket motors to save time&amp;money....which is the way to go if you run a private company: your decisions are not to be brave but create reliable capital growth for your shareholders.<br>See my argument is not simply pro SSTO - they are just a follow-up of using a linear aerospike: as they weigh less, are smaller and can vector/steer without major movable parts (like the whole nozzle section of the laval motors) than any of the staged, classic rockets. Sooner or later the trait of not creating more and more space garbage (Kessler- syndrome) will increase to the point that SSTO will become a must to secure future starts into space from our planet. And here getting everything back in one piece is a major advantage...and then consider atmospheric pollution:the X-33 only used H2/O2 as only fuel..!<br>It&#39;s like the decision whether to use for a car a diesel-motor with lots of additions to make it cleaner or switching to an electric motor altogether.", "comment_date": "2019-02-26T16:24:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Cby 0530", "comment_text": "All SSTOs suck,except for Matt Lowne&#39;s.", "comment_date": "2019-02-26T15:24:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sfef Mallet", "comment_text": "Please elaborate more on aerospike rocket engine.

At the current level of material science, a reusable SSTO would certainly be a maintenance nightmare, much greater than the Space Shuttle, even if some huge advancement in rocket fuel would allow for such specific impulse increase to make dragging all dead weight of atmospheric engines and flight surfaces into space where they are simply not needed possible at all. <br><br><br>What I think could be theoretically feasible would be more like a huge cannon shell with an added rocket engine for sending very small and robust cargo into orbit. To get perspective into what I mean - an APFSDS fired from smoothbore tank cannon can travel at close to 2000 m/s. Railguns currently tested promise muzzle velocities well in excess of 3500 m/s. Anti-tank rockets are also being routinely fired from tank cannons (I imagine at significantly lower muzzle velocities than APFSDS rounds, but anyway that&#39;s a proof that a rocket, with all the electronics, sensors and guidance systems can survive being fired from a cannon). If we scale that up, we need a robust and cheap single stage rocket that can be fired from, say, huge railgun, to bridge the remaining 5000 m/s or so, but with the advantage that it already left the dense atmosphere before it ignites, so it can be optimized for space flight. Further advances in railgun technology, which is currently being actively researched by USA, China, and Russia for military purposes, can increase muzzle velocities far higher, which lowers demands for the single-stage rocket, all to the point when it retains only maneuvering engines. I found somewhere that it would be very cost-effective if the demand for sending material into orbit suddenly increased by orders of magnitude - such a system would cost a fortune to build, but it would have very small operating and reasonable maintenance costs.

I like it, your arguments are sound. Honestly, it is a good video. However...<br>When developing technology to put something in space, we have to start pointing out that there is difference between people and other &quot;stuff&quot;. We mainly focus on &quot;other stuff&quot; because we still do not have the people that can stand outer space conditions for a long time. Artificial intelligence is far more promising, and I am not talking about sentient robots. I am talking about huge algorithmic libraries with fast information processing.<br>Once you realize you want to put &quot;stuff&quot; in space and not necessarily people, as an engineer, your mind opens. There are three optimal places in the world to do so; they are near the equatorial line and at few thousands meters of altitude. You can run the simulations and find out how much these two factors increase the weight of the load. It is not neglectable. <br>The second aspect for consideration is the propulsion system. Anything that depends only on combustions is already the past. As you are not sending people, you can built accelerators (in principle no different from the particle accelerator in Europe). As long as you have enough energy (electricity), you can spend days accelerating whatever you want to send until you reach the proper velocity. This is very important because acceleration and velocity are not the same. Acceleration can be looked as a force that will impose severe structural constrains; velocity is somehow innocuous. There are still strong aerodynamic constrains but they can be solved with good design and a &quot;front runner aerodynamic knife&quot; that will facilitate the path the first thousands meters (In fact, the difference in air pressure created will help reduce the demands on the guiding systems).<br>The end of the journey will require an autonomous propulsions system for outer space conditions (minimal reaction mass).<br>For visualisation. The launch site consists of a huge eletromagnetic accelerator that ends in some sort of railgun. The &quot;rocket&quot; will be a protective carcasse with basic guiding systems. Guiding the &quot;rocket&quot; will be a spear-like object that has also been accelerated. It will &quot;cut&quot; the air to reduce resistance, ensure direction via differential air pressure and reduce physical demands (heat tolerance and strength) on the &quot;rocket&quot;. The spear-like object will finally fall to Earth while the rocket continues its trajectory to outer space. Of course, the &quot;rocket&quot; is not a rocket but more of a missile. <br>Everything I am telling is already being researched or developped. And it is estimated a 20X-40X reduction of costs per kilo put in orbit. It has not advanced further because no country want to invest unless they have absolute control (geopolitical reasons). Moreover, the technology already exists but no country has it all (i.e. Russia is the leading nation in hypersonic aerodynamics but is far behind in electromagnetic acceleration).<br>As somebody will point out, I am not giving any evidence. However, if you do the research, you will find papers supporting what I am saying. I do not want to convince anyone. I just wanted to contribute to the discussion.

They need to overcome 2 basic factors:<br>1. Utility over dead weight. Like why would you need atmospheric engines in orbit? The only solutions would be: design an engine and/or fuel type that works both in orbit and in atmosphere, aka either have a self-oxydyzing fuel so you do not carry two types of fuel or create an engine that can take oxygen from atmosphere like a jet engine and then go into a rocket version, perhaps like a modified post-combustion thing. Or, you would create something that needs an SSTO with all the pain of carrying extra engines and fuel. Is there anything that requires something like that now?  Not really. only purpose of rocket launches is payload delivery. Basically, your vehicle does not even need to return. Or only a small portion of it if it carries cosmonauts or astronauts.. What would require SSTO? Well, intensive exploitation of space. Aka establishing a mining colonoy or stuff like that. Then you would need cargo and passenger ships to take the stuff from orbit to the ground and so on. And here the reusability part comes into play. Or perhaps a troop transport for military aplications, like in star-wars. <br>2. Phyisics. Spacecraft tend to heat quite a lot. Space planes that try to gain a lot of speed in the atmosphere, even more (as explained in the video). The only way I could a space plane design work would be  to find a way to lift that thing as high as possible, using as little fuel as possible. For example, I would be thinking of using the archimedic force, like weather balloons. Of course, this has  a lot of problems. Like, first of all, size.

This lowers the heat pressure.<br><br>Also skylon would not fly hours at an end at high speed, but rather pas this altitude in minuts, so it don&#39;t give time for the panels to heat up.<br><br>There is also other material advantages.

That makes it fly slower (at every given altitude) also fighting less air resistance. It also need about 1/5 of the engine power... So it need to lift... Well 1/5 of the engine mass.<br><br>It needs 30% less fuel simply because it have higher IPC.  It also need really  no.

Would a vehicle still be consider single stage if it lifted off as an aircraft, flew as an aircraft, including refueling as it got higher, then went into space as a rocket? There is a theoretical design for an engine which uses rocket inside a super critical jet engine. As a super critical engine it has no moving parts. Air is fired into the engine on the start and the engine fires. The air is compressed at the point the rocket thrust hits it and it becomes super hot. This causes it to expand much as a normal engine would do. This would cause a vacuum at the air intake and it would continue to get air. <br><br>It would then take off like an aircraft and very rapidly meet a tanker aircraft and refuel. It would then fly as high as a tank ac could and again refuel.<br><br>This means the size of the fuel tank is smaller, and thus your engine is smaller.<br><br>As the vehicle leaves the last refuel ac, its engine would get more air for a time as it accelerated. As it approached the limit of the air, resistance would drop, so it could lower its nose and accelerate using the air. When the speed was too high for even the thin air, it would bring its nose up and accelerate to orbital speed using just the engine.<br><br>In the lower atmosphere, it would be run on low thrust since most of the power would come form air expansion. As it reached vacuum, the vents that allowed air to enter the chamber would close and it would accelerate that way.<br><br>The sr71 was created before the space shuttles heat tiles.<br><br>Haas 2ca sounds like something they would want to use to get a small short term satellites used to spy on places in space fast for a few orbits.", "comment_date": "2018-12-20T01:18:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "the chickenmaster", "comment_text": "But what about the rocket from jules Verne&#39;s book \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T22:23:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phase-B tech", "comment_text": "Yes please do a whole video on the skylon.", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T18:30:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Temporality_", "comment_text": "What KSP mod are you using?", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T17:07:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Time Bisvit", "comment_text": "he&#39;s clearly working for nasa ,they need more funding", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T12:21:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Comrat", "comment_text": "stupid earth", "comment_date": "2018-12-19T10:22:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Petronius", "comment_text": "PS Not to mention the original Orion nuclear pulse rocket was not just san SSTO but single stage to, well, Alpha Centauri?!

As for scramjets, they&#39;re great for missiles, but they are incredibly inefficient because of the supersonic combustion. The limiting factor is how much the air can be slowed down for efficient combustion without melting the engine. That&#39;s basically what the Skylon does by cooling the engine with the LH2, but it too is limited because it can only reach mach 5.4 in air breathing mode before the stresses become too great. Unless there&#39;s a way for them to at least double the top speed the engine can function at while using atmospheric oxygen, then there&#39;s no way it&#39;s going to be worth it.

But as you said in the beginning of the video, if we did try and build an SSTO, it would most likely have wings and at least 1 or possibly more air breathing engines, or again, as you mentioned, hybrid engines. Air breathing engines consume a lot less fuel, not to mention dont need oxidizer until they hit a point in the atmosphere, where your air intakes cant handle the demand of the engine. But getting up to an altitude of around 30,000 meters would be a lot easier and efficient with a winged craft with air breathing engines, and from there, not only could you then use the second half of your hybrid engine, but you&#39;d start off with a not insignificant amount of horizontal speed. Also, the craft would be 100% reusable. But even if you can land the first, second or even third stage of a rocket, the fuel you&#39;d need to land them, and the electronics and control surfaces\\monopropellant you&#39;d need to control them autonomously and land would compensate for the weight of the wings and possibly extra engines in case you dont want to use a hybrid, but in stead a set of both types of engines. So I disagree, that SSTOs suck, I just think we havent yet perfected the technology, and have a lot more invested in multi stage rocket engines. I bet I could whoop together a functioning SSTO in KSP, that would be cheaper to build, and would reach orbit just the same. Also, if this isnt enough to convince you, maybe this will. Landing a rocket, or deorbiting a rocket, you&#39;re going to use a loooot of fuel fighting gravity. But landing a winged craft, all you need to deal with is reentry, as the space shuttles did. And yes, they decommissioned the shuttle program, but that was decades ago, and technology has reached a point, where I dont think we&#39;d run into any of the problems the shuttle program had to struggle with.

Certainly more seriously than building 600 meter rocket simulations.  I love your videos but I think showing that the needle rocket would crash due to lack of thrust was a waste of time.

There is the weight of the fuel assembly and the shielding, to protect the crew from the direct shine from the engine of course.  I tried to quickly find some power density figures for reactors, and I did find some data from the tests done in the second half of the 60s and early 70s. According to those the specific power of the reactors used then were in the 450 kW/kg range, with a thrust of 930 kN (reactor power was around 4.1 GW). That&#39;s about 9.5 tons for the engine (or at least the reactor). The thrust to weight ratio wasn&#39;t very good...But that was a long time ago. I wonder how far we could develop a nuclear atmospheric engine today. I find that very unlikely to happen though, due to public opinion on anything that has the word &quot;nuclear&quot; in it...<br><br>Ps.: Found a 1991 report on Project rover, the Phoebus-2A was the largest engine they built and tested, and produced the above cited 930 kN, continuously for 32 minutes, at a working fluid flow rate of 119 kg/s. The thrust in this case is comparable to a Merlin-1D (845 kN at sea level). Now from what I can gather, the Merlin-1D has a weight of around 630 kg, and a mass flow rate of 306 kg/sec. So for a 1 minute burn, the fuel+oxidizer mass for a Merlin-1D (2018) is about 18.3 tons, while for the nuclear thermal engine (1970) (just the working fluid, no need for an oxidizer), is about 7.2 tons. On the other hand the mass of the engine is a lot bigger for the nuclear variant, around 9.5 tons, which is 15 times that of the Merlin, which is a huge difference. So to actually start to have an advantage , and overcome the 8.9 tons of difference in weight, in propellant mass, it takes about 48 second of burn. So even in the first minute you are getting a payoff due to the much lower mass flow rate.<br><br>For an average FH 1st stage burn of 162 seconds, with 9 engines, the rockets use up a mixture of fuel and oxidizer of about 437400 kg, with a total engine mass of 5670 kg (a total of 443070 kg at takeoff). For the same &quot;burn&quot; the nuclear variant would require a total engine mass of 85500 kg (that&#39;s one hefty engine cluster), but would need only 175000 kg of propellant (a total of 260500 kg at takeoff). That&#39;s about 0.588x the liftoff weight. And here I&#39;ve been comparing a nuclear engine design from 1970 to a state of the art chemical rocket engine of 2018 (and tried to push things so I error in favor of the chemical one).

The construction is also not aeroplane-like so the tanks won&#39;t be providing structural strength to the skin. It&#39;s supposed in fact to be more like an airship with an internal frame.  The outside will be a form of silicon carbide with a lot of insulation between it and the hydrogen tanks.  Skylon is too expensive to do in one jump so Reaction Engines are designing a modular family of engines (SABRE4) which can be scaled up and down in thrust by adding bits - this offers them the opportunity to share the engine development cost amongst several projects some of which will probably include hypersonic flight within the atmosphere.  Obviously there is some degree of military interest if they can demonstrate that their engine cycle works. There are 2 aspects that they are working to demonstrate now - the &quot;HTX&quot; or high temperature heat exchanger which cools incoming high speed air such that it won&#39;t melt the engine and the engine core.  The tests for the HTX were done with unheated incoming air some time ago and that demonstrated the anti-icing features. This test will be with hot incoming air that simulates the situation from 0 to roughly mach 5.  This is obviously critical to the whole engine so good results will advance their cause a lot but it&#39;s not the end. The other side of things is the engine core and it has to demonstrate their thermodynamic cycle which uses the heat rejected from the HTX to do work. I am not a rocket scientist but I understand that this cycle is very important to the efficiency of SABRE4. I am not at the moment even sure if they will be testing the combustion chambers as part of this - I think it&#39; really about how they use their &quot;Helium loop&quot; that&#39;s carrying heat from the HTX to be dumped into fuel to drive a turbine and power other machinery. Assuming all of this gets done they still have to design the combustion chambers and engine nozzles (all intended to be based on well known technology) and an air intake that can do a transition from external to internal oxygen and all the things the SR-71 inlets had to deal with which is not easy.", "comment_date": "2018-05-20T14:14:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ad nauseam", "comment_text": "I wuv ksp!", "comment_date": "2018-05-20T12:18:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Bode", "comment_text": "What makes the rocket equation so tyrannical is that a linear increase in Delta-V requires an <b>exponential</b> increase in propellant.

That would be a magnetic accelerated ship launched from a vacuum tube on a mountain top on the equator. This has been studied extensively and is very feasible. The linear magnetic acceleration is roughly equivalent to a rail gun, but with a much larger projectile. By placing the launcher on a mountain top, you avoid a large part of the atmosphere. By putting the launcher on the equator and firing it East, you gain the maximum velocity from the Earth&#39;s rotation. By pumping the air out of the launch tube before firing, you avoid air resistance and air heating during the initial acceleration phase. Since the ship is accelerated to near orbital speeds inside the tube by magnetic force applied from ground based generators, the ship doesn&#39;t have to carry any fuel to get to orbit. It would have to have an engine and some fuel to stabilize the orbit and then to de-orbit the ship for landing, but that is far less than is required for a chemical launch system. The only problem with this type of SSTO is the crushing acceleration during launch. Even with a launch tube several miles long, the g forces generated would easily kill most human cargo. For this reason, this type of launch would only be for non-living cargo, but that is no problem since ships of this sort would be very cheap to build and they could be launched several times a day, limited only by the time it takes to recharge the launch gun and re-vacuum the tunnel. If the logistics of this type of launch seems too hard to overcome, just recall the Sprint missile built in 1972 which accelerated with over 100 g&#39;s of thrust and hit mach 10 in 5 seconds when fired from close to sea level, and this was while carrying sensitive electronics and instruments to allow it to intercept an incoming warhead. The magnetic launch ship would be fired from a mountain top in the Andes where the elevation of the mouth of the launch tube would be close to 19,000 feet high, which means the atmosphere density would only be a fraction of that at sea level, resulting in far less friction heating. If a Sprint could be built in 1972 and easily coped with that level of acceleration and heating, think how much easier it would be to build a magnetic launch ship today with 46 years newer technology and materials.", "comment_date": "2018-05-17T00:46:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "William Brown", "comment_text": "You kind of glossed over the Delta clipper being canceled.

But a Nuclear\u00a0engine was demonstrated at\u00a01,000 SP-Imp.\u00a0At a thousand SP-Imp, an SSTO\u00a0that would put a thousand tons into orbit and then land again is easy. And before you go crazy about Nuclear, the Hydrogen\u00a0exhaust that\u00a0created the thrusts was not radioactive in the least as the Hydrogen was not inside the reactor long enough. And that was using 1960&#39;s technology. Modern tech would produce a specific impulse around 2,000 easily making for big\u00a0ships that could put\u00a010,000 tons on the moon.\u00a0\u00a0Though the engines have one drawback that they do require\u00a0some shielding and\u00a0must be isolated for a few weeks to cool down radioactively\u00a0before they could be worked on. Though that depends on what nuclear fuel they\u00a0use as A\u00a0Thorium core\u00a0that does not produce all the nasty radioactive particles that Uranium does would only need a few hours and be\u00a0inert incase of an accident.

The Skylon was also to use the ceramic design , but is also much lighter , so would only attain around half the heat load that of the space shuttle. So it could use the same tech without any special modification.  Now about the design of the plane with a rocket on it. I imagine this is due to the US military design of the aero spike and due to Brexit and loss of funding that had had to be picked up by BAE (A military company) and lost a few years , as testing was suppose to take place late 2016. Reaction Engines only gets a few millions in funding per year. SpaceX gets upwards of a billion by comparison. Reaction Engines has focused on getting the pre-cooler done. This is what makes it possible for a rocket to use normal atmosphere, reducing the size needed for oxygen in dense atmosphere levels. So if BAE lets REL do their own thing , I think it will be done by 2020 on target. But if BAE focuses on military design , it wont get done and the 2 stage aero spike design will takes it place advancing a totally different technology and effectively  killing the SSTO.

I haven&#39;t heard of leaking issues in the officially known test vehicles the USA used. And there are signs that at least some of these nations are getting closer to mass production as well, which would imply they&#39;re close or have reached a practical level already for materials that can handle the heat.<br><br>Secondly, Skylon uses an engine design that gives fairly high thrust to weight ratios. This means it shouldn&#39;t be staying at these speeds for all that long, thus giving less time to heat up. (The moment they reach speed, they&#39;d switch to rocket mode to climb and accelerate further after all)<br><br>Thirdly the fuel is extremely cold (being liquid hydrogen) , which should allow them to use it to cool the exterior surface of the craft to an extent, it seems plausible that they could counteract major heating problems with that, especially as this is exactly what they&#39;re doing to keep the engine from melting as well.<br><br><br>Of course, even if the above is all true, it&#39;s still not the same as having built an actual functional plane yet. But the recent joining of several commercial partners is giving me the suspicion that either they&#39;re now willing to take a larger risk due to SpaceX, or that with the cooler design for the engine now showing promise that it will work in the real world, that the risks aren&#39;t as large any more. <br>(It&#39;s also worth noting the Skylon project is in a sense an extension of the Hotol project, which failed for various reasons, but I believe a major one was that they at the time couldn&#39;t make a good enough engine which thus the SABRE in theory resolves)<br><br><br><br>----<br><br>On a side note, a reusable SSTO in theory should have a faster turn around then a two stage reusable rocket. Which would let you more quickly recover capital costs and thus reduce overall running costs.(Because you don&#39;t have to put the two parts together constantly and the extra complications and risks this inevitably brings with it)<br><br>Still SSTO only really work if you can some how get sufficiently high ISP, otherwise the mass fraction just isn&#39;t good enough to compete with a multi-stage system.
