SpaceX price is definitely attractive, but if you are the satellite owner you also need to consider that being a ride share doesn&#39;t assure you are going to reach your target orbit. You need to be prepared to spend some delta-V of your own, hence you need an appropriate propulsion system (with all the engineering, testing, validation, assurance, ...): this quickly add costs up. Whereas Rocket Lab is going to deliver you to your target orbit (assuming they are launching only your satellite) and you only need to worry about the attitude control system (or at most a very low-power propulsion sytem)!!! <br>2. Also, equally important, with ride share there are definitely compromises in the maximization of objectives, for instance the correct time to launch: the priority is given to the &quot;bigger&quot; satellite owner in that specific launch... again, for small sat operators this could end up being more costly than launching with Rocket Lab. Of course, each satellite operator knows what they are doing and ultimately decide their best option for their objectives.<br>3. Even if SpaceX could lower the price even more, it is my opinion that this will not ends up costing too much to Rocket Lab, because of the latter&#39;s flexibility to reach the target orbit. Plus, satellite operators love the launches competitions!!! They need it!!! So, even if at some point in time SpaceX price is definitely more inviting than Rocket Lab, the latter will continue to receive support, thus having the chance to improve their hardware and operations.<br>4. Now that Rocket Lab is pursuing resuability, their costs may go down significantly... Tough, as stated in the presentation, it&#39;s a very hard work to actually reach it.
