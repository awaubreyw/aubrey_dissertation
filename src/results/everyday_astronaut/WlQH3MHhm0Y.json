You definitely got my respect for keeping out anything that had a loss of life. Like you mentioned they must be treated with great respect to those who where tragically lost and to the families and friends they left behind. That really was a beautiful thing to do. Many years ago I got a chance to fly to the Kennedy Space Center. I was in a CH 46. I got to see one of the space shuttles up close. They where an amazing piece of equipment. But of all the things I had seen at the KSC there is one thing I will never forget. As you walk through the building you will see on the wall plaque\u2019s for every mission. Each one has its own mission patch with the launch date just above the return date. When I got the the Challenger it very sadly was missing the return date. It brought me right back to High School when I was seated at my desk with great excitement watching the launch live.

So what you end up with in a fuel explosion is a spectacular fireball, but despite the size and seeming violence of the plume it hasn&#39;t really all that much explosive power.<br>I&#39;d blame Hollywood for that, as they have used fuelfed &quot;explosions&quot; (gasoline is still popular although plantpollen and other flour like substances have sometimes replaced it, similar effect as they mostly look fiery due to the high combustion surface in a good mix of substrate and air) for decades to replace more authentic depictions of bombs (not to forget how they caused thousands of cardeaths by making people believe any fire will immediately cause a giant explosion, so they&#39;d not go and pull people out of smouldering wrecks) and so people instinctually connect giant flameballs with powerful explosions, which they are not, at least not compared to what even small military ammunitions can do.

The air blast was certainly much stronger than a simple 1 kt explosion, but 85% of the fuel supply deflagrating in the presence of LOX is a much slower release of energy, which results in a lower peak pressure, so... this one is likely to just go down as a big question mark.<br>Still, it was unquestionably picked up by US seismic sensors as a possible nuclear test, so its spot at the top of this particular list is unchallenged.", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T13:51:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Kane", "comment_text": "Please re-edit and leave out the MUZAK!!", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T02:08:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ghrey", "comment_text": "I got a real bang out of that!", "comment_date": "2019-01-11T01:01:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sir Lord of Derp", "comment_text": "The titan 4 explosion almost made me be born that day.", "comment_date": "2019-01-10T22:39:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jeffup p", "comment_text": "We have had an anomaly of what the rocket exploding", "comment_date": "2019-01-10T11:19:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "PHSE", "comment_text": "\u0412\u0438\u0434\u0438\u043c\u043e \u044f \u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0440\u044f\u0449\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c, \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0442 \u044d\u0442\u043e \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043e.", "comment_date": "2019-01-10T07:36:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bwfvc", "comment_text": "Hey mate.

But you did leave out one that I thought deserved to be included. It was the Titan 34D launch from Vandenberg on 18 April 1986, which turned into a huge toxic fireball only about 700 feet off the pad. Of course this was only a few months after the loss of Challenger, and the payload was the very last KH-9 Hexagon (aka &quot;Big Bird&quot;) recon satellite, probably cost something like a billion dollars. Not only was the explosion much more spectacular than some you included, but it probably was one of the most expensive booms in history.

The AJ-26 variant wasn&#39;t that much of a change - primarily just the control electronics were updated.<br><br>Also an interesting note: when the N-1 program was canceled, anything related to the program was ordered to be destroyed.  Including the NK-33s that had been built.  So why was Orbital able to use NK-33s in their Antares, 40-odd years after the N-1 program was shut down and all hardware destroyed?  Well, some bureaucrat ensured that the engines were &quot;lost,&quot; and subsequently stored them in a warehouse for a couple of decades until Western engineers finally heard of them in the 1990s.  Aerojet would subsequently purchase several of these engines in the mid-1990s, but wouldn&#39;t find a market for them until Orbital came calling.<br><br>This means that the turbopump that failed had been sitting in a warehouse in substandard conditions for 40-odd years before ever seeing any LOX or RP1.  And had been built by Soviet production staffs, working on a shoestring budget, for a rocket that was canceled before any other hardware could be built.<br><br>All I&#39;m saying is, Orbital really shouldn&#39;t have been surprised that #7 happened.", "comment_date": "2018-07-16T05:29:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Char 2C", "comment_text": "<b><i>What if the Saturn V Went Kaboom?</i></b>", "comment_date": "2018-07-16T05:20:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gankashi", "comment_text": "You look like that frist skin from the season 3 fortnite battle pass.", "comment_date": "2018-07-16T00:27:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blacktooth Fox", "comment_text": "Nerd alert!?

RDX (a WWII era explosive) burns at closer to 8,000m/s so detonation 400m in diameter (approximate size of Fauld explosion) is going to take 0.05 seconds.
