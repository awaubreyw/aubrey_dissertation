Why not three super heavy boosters to get starship not only away from earth gravity but to get starship on its way moving at a very fast rate.  Then the starship decouples and the three connected boosters go back to earth, slow up and return uncoupled like they normally would have.  In the meantime starship is making good time without expending almost no fuel.  When starship is almost to Mars, it opens up it\u2019s clamshell front end to release its main payload.  At that point, starship uses the slingshot method around Mars to be on its way back to earth smoking hot. Fast.  The payload that was dropped off has a heat shield and slows down in the atmosphere and then uses parachutes then lastly thrusters like Blue Origin does.  This sacrifices some weight at liftoff but the starship doesn\u2019t have to lift off from Mars.
