My wife and I live about 15 min from Vandenberg and we have been goin to every launch for the past 6 years. This launch topped them all! We knew it was going to be packed because of it being the first return to pad landing and the good possibility of twilight effect but had no idea how wild it would actually be. I\u2019ve NEVER seen that many people at a launch. We chose to watch from Ocean Ave over the Hawks nest so we could be closer to then pad. We passed the gate to the Hawks best and there was a line of cars over a mile long waiting for gates to be opened! We got there 3 hours early and Ocean was already packed. We go lucky and squeezed in a perfect spot. There were THOUSANDS of people on Ocean Ave also! People were grilling steaks, playing soccer, throwing frisbees, and a few brought guitars to play music. It was like the Super Bowl tailgate but for a Falcon9 launch and landing!!! Will never forget that!!
