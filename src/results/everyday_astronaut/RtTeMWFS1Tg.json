Also about the fan being able withstand the heat, imo is kinda a &#39;blehhh&#39; answer  (as most have commented it as being basically being an answer to the question without action answering it). In my experience (being a refrigeration engineer, experienced in electricity, thermodynamics and also dealing with NH3/anhydrous ammonia-which is used in most of the cooling systems on spaces stations afaik) &#39;normal&#39; fans yes would have the biggest problem of insulating wirings and such and would seem to be the weakest point : again just what comes to mind. A more ceramic type of insulation or other materials even i think could be made to deal with this, even with AC or DC motors.   After all we do  have existing convection ovens here now that can withstand the heat. SO I AGREE, the &quot;WHY NOT JUST A FAN&quot; was a very good question. I can see the point though that the more simple, reliable, safest could work. Another idea i think could work would be to have a basically solar type of oven. Though this i admit im not totally experienced with, as say if they used basically  a sealed transparent case, perhaps with lenses to magnify the product, essentially exposed to the sunlight. Though with this im not sure if &quot;bad&quot; radiation would perhaps contaminate the food?  after all direct sunlight in space is what 248F? hot enough to cook and im sure could be increased with the use of a magnifying glass. Granted the short periods of sunlight could limit this, but i do not see why some type of oven like this would not work. especially if using a cookie sheet to convert the radiation to conduction as well.  Again im not sure about the bad radiation thing. But it seems to me that would be the most efficient as you arent using anything direct power, just the sun. The oven could basically be tethered outside the station for safety also -although it would still have to be pressurized, pressurizing it past 1bar would also increase temperature for things being boiled.<br><br><br>Also along pressure. Density (which is what causes heat moving to cold air) does not happen in micro gravity, however pressure would be able to provide a source of convection. I cant think of the top of my head how much it would needed power/wattage wise, but i know it would take very little. Imagine a little air compressor like what would be used to plug into a 12v/cigarette lighter in your car to pump up the tires or airbag suspension. Compressors are much more resilient to heat also as they are made to deal with heat as compression itself adds heat to the circuit. The motor/power source would be external of the heat from the oven also. Any cooling id imagine could be using current equipment cooling already in place. I know they have to have fans/ compressors or some type of air moving device on  board used to circulate air for the scrubbers, adsorbers or whatever is used to provide O2 from CO2.<br><br>Power/efficiency issues i think would simple-ish to solve by using current cooling systems. IE the ammonia that basically flows between the the &quot;hot&quot;/sunlight sides of the station, the equipment heat being put off, etc flowing the the &quot;cool&quot;/shaded side. I dont know the exact details of the ISS but i know thats the basic principle being used. Essentially how older propane/gas/ fuels refrigerators work. THe flame/heat source is used to raise pressure, condenser to condense high pressure vapor to high pressure, metering device to turn the warm liquid to cold liquid/vapor and repeat. <br><br>EDIT: also for got to bring up induction. An induction type pressure cooker for boiling things would seem easily doable. Also since they could make things such as soups and the like inside the silicon/plastic based bags already. Along with most foods. <br><br><br>and yes, i agree most things are still limited to the fact at zero grav, any type of &quot;crumbly&quot; food would still be the biggest problem <br><br><br>Anywho, just my thoughts of the top of my head.", "comment_date": "2019-11-25T18:06:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Flash", "comment_text": "praying for the day access to space is as routine and safe as driving to a hotel 300+ miles away from home.

If they&#39;d said something like &quot;active circulation would use more energy than NASA wants us to use&quot;, I would understand that. But at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtTeMWFS1Tg&amp;t=17m58s\">17:58</a> it sounds like they&#39;re talking about a fan that would pull external air into the oven from one end and vent the heated air from the other end, which is frankly silly and would make it less of an oven and more of a space heater (pun intended). They also bring up limitations of fan speed, noise, heat tolerance, and debris risk. I might be missing something, but I feel like none of those should be actual issues in this sort of application?<br><br>I have an oven that goes up to 550\u00b0F (290\u00b0C), with a small fan at the back to supplement the normal convection process. The fan doesn&#39;t exchange any air with the external environment, it just pushes around the air that&#39;s in the oven. That means that it is definitely possible, at least under ~1 g of acceleration, to have a fan motor that can tolerate temperatures up to 550\u00b0F without venting any more of the oven&#39;s air than is necessary to prevent pressure buildup.<br><br>The fan doesn&#39;t spin all very fast, and for an air mass as small as that of the one in this video you could easily get decent circulation at only a handful of RPM. A quick search of public NASA documents shows several components operating in excess of ten thousand RPM, so a small fan operating at maybe a dozen RPM does not sound all that extreme. Low RPM means low vibration and sound, and low angular momentum if for some reason it gets damaged in any way. They mention needing a screen to contain any potential debris, which is certainly fine - my oven has one to keep people from pushing pans into the fan blades, and even a screen over-engineered to NASA&#39;s strict (and rightly so) safety standards shouldn&#39;t need to be very complicated or costly to safely contain any possible fan-blade catastrophe at this scale.<br><br>I do completely understand that having no moving parts aside from the door and control buttons would be mechanically simpler than having all that plus a motor and fan. On the other hand, adding active air circulation would reduce the time needed to bring the center of the oven up to the desired cooking temperature, and also reduce the maximum temperature needed at the heating elements to effectively reach the desired temperature in the center, saving time and slightly decreasing the maximum temperature an astronaut might be exposed to. The fan can be turned off prior to opening the door with enough wait time to let the air settle so it doesn&#39;t blow the heated air (or any potential debris) into the cabin.<br><br>I&#39;m not a rocket scientist or an engineer and I certainly realize that &quot;having an Earth oven&quot; is not a qualification for orbital component design, so feel free to tell me what I&#39;m missing here. I&#39;m sure there are very good reasons for not having a fan, since some very smart people decided to not include a fan, but the reasons given in the video do not sound at all convincing to me.", "comment_date": "2019-11-22T16:45:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Astro (David)", "comment_text": "I was just thinking, cookie smells coming out of the oven and not being able to eat them must be torture and Tim asked the question.

Here on the ground where we experience 1g heated air is has less mass than colder air and that is why a candle flame is shaped the way it is. The hot air heated by the candle&#39;s combustion rises upward above the cooler denser air (like a hot-air balloon) drawing cooler air from beneath the flame of the candle. The warmed rising air streamlines the flame of the burning candle to a tear-drop shape. <br>Well, in the micro-gravity of earth orbit the flame is round or flattened as there is little influence of rising hot air. This means heat convection is almost non-existing. Warmer air/fluids will not flow as they do here in 1g.  That is why here on the ground, non-convection ovens the hotter part of the oven is the top rack. Convection Ovens have a fan and try to mix that hot air rising with cooler air to even out the temperature for more even baking temperatures.  A convection oven would be best if the oven has counter-rotating fans to offset any moment produced by a rotating structure. But I have to imagine that a small oven fan would not be that much influence compared to other forces the crew imparts on the Station.

Since you could not seal the pouch completely as the off gases from baking would build up, they will be smelling fresh baked cookie, but they will only get older cookies baked back on earth to actually eat?  This seems like some kind of cruel torture for the crew.  If the oven works as advertised, then you will really be testing the discipline of those astronauts. <br><br><br>If I were designing the oven, I would consider the methods of heat transfer, convection, conduction and radiation.  I think it will be a bit tough to get even heating based upon conduction in a chamber such as that without moving the air around, although I suspect they have simulated the heat transfer in the chamber and hopefully modeled it to be good enough for its purpose.  <br><br><br>I am not criticizing the Hilton DoubleTree oven, but it is a fun exercise to think about how you would overcome some of the problems of designing and building an oven for the Space Station.  I would have almost certainly included a low rpm fan and some protrusions on the interior of the chamber to mix the air and to even out the temperature within the oven and therefore over the surface of the silicone rubber housing for the cookie even though I may have to build a housing shield any noise.  Still a bit tough since only conduction through that silicone rubber housing will transfer heat to the inside of that pouch.  Perhaps a serviceable fan cartridge with bearing placed such as to minimize heating for the chamber though.  As for the wall of the chamber, I would have likely used a double walled chamber with a vacuum in between, such as seen in a thermos as it would minimize heat transfer out of the oven and therefore reduce power consumption, most of which would be lost by conducting heat away.  Coat the inside of the outer cylinder with a coating reflective to the range of infrared most likely to be radiated during operation and the outside of the inner cylinder with a coating most likely to absorb that range of wavelengths too.  Most likely I would have a thermocouple heat sensor or sensors that in addition to being used to determine the energy input to the resistance elements could also be used with logic to keep the door locked via solenoid until the internal temperature was low enough, as well as another small solenoid operated door to vent and replace the air with air in the chamber at a slow rate during the cool-down period utilizing the same fan as used to circulate the air inside.  Perhaps an IR sensor or camera to determine the temperature of the silicon pouches surfaces prior to unlocking the oven door as well as we really do not want anyone getting a 2nd degree burn up there.  I am pretty sure I could control the whole thing with three buttons and a two line LCD display with a pic or an Arduino to run it, although I would likely have to figure out how to shield them a bit.    <br><br><br>I hope they sent a bunch of samples to be baked as I suspect some might suffer a R.U.D.D.D.

Now in a conventional household oven conduction causes the head to mix around inside the oven.  The hot air is less dense than the cooler air and so it rises causing air currents inside the oven evenly distributing the head.  I got that.  This is apparently impossible to recreate in a zero G environment which is completely understandable.  However we have another household technology capable of creating air currents.  ITS CALLED A FAN!  How is it even remotely possible that this issue of not having air currents inside the oven not solved by simply adding a fan to blow the heat around inside the oven?  I mean conduction doesn&#39;t stop my PC from overheating, fans do.  Now they said that it would be hard to make a fan inside of an oven?  you have to be kidding me.  There are plenty of fans in much hotter environments in industry.  That said they seem to only be considering a spinning fan with the twisted fan blades spinning at hundreds of rpm but seriously it doesn&#39;t have to be anything remotely like that.  Their oven is tiny all they need is a diaphragm which could very slowly oscillate inside to generate the tiniest bit of air current.  Think about the hand held folding fans you just move your wrist back and forth a little bit and fan yourself off good.  There are also Ion Fans which use electrical charge to charge air particles to get them to move.  The point is there are a LOT of ways to generate air flow besides a spinning fan.  Their solution seems ridiculously overly complicated.  Not saying it wont work just saying the problem could have been solved much much simpler and probably much much cheaper.<br><br>While we are on the subject of overly complicated why not for the first food cooked in space choose something that doesn&#39;t break into tiny crums when you eat it.

When it comes to designing hardware for space, simpler is always better; fewer moving parts is always better. That way there are fewer failure points and less additional considerations that come with dynamic systems. The analysis showed we didn&#39;t need the fan so the simplest option was to pass current through coils to produce heat which would, in turn, be conducted to the cookie. No moving parts at all. <br>2. We did initially consider fans, but existing commercial oven fans did not meet our needs for one reason or another be it power requirement, size, mounting needs, material etc. <br>3. What is not very evident in the video is that space was a premium in the payload. Adding a fan and possibly it&#39;s ducting means more insulation and extra structure to accommodate it.<br>3. Fans are extremely noisy, not acoustically but electronically. NASA has very stringent standards on the magnitude and type of the electronic noise a payload may produce. The motor of a fan would be very electronically noisy. It would require additional testing and considerations to keep both the radiated and conducted emissions within NASA standards. Much more cost and time in testing/verifications than using heating elements.", "comment_date": "2019-11-20T20:23:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Fionn2200", "comment_text": "Hello elon", "comment_date": "2019-11-20T20:23:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrGonzonator", "comment_text": "Imagine going away with a significant other...
