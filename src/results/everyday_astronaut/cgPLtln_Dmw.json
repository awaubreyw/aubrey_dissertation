But SN10 will be delayed because the same problem was experienced on SN8. Both had restart problems and flow problems.<br>It may require taking SN10 back to the hanger for modifications. I do not think it is a software fix. It might be tank modification. Higher pressures inside the tanks in the nose.<br>It might also need a better relight engine. I would revise both to be on the safe side. SOME OF THIS MAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN DONE ON SN10! Each new ship is an improvement on<br>the previous model, so some of this may have been anticipated. Also, there seems to be no backup procedure.
