I&#39;ve been looking for details on the components that go into a Falcon 9 and the weights and dimensions of them but I can&#39;t seem to find what I&#39;m looking for.  Specifically, what I&#39;d like to see is a list of the major components from bottom to top such as: the 1st stage core, the interstage, the second stage, the fairing, the payload adapter, and any other component that should be added.  It would be great to do this for the Falcon Heavy and for the Starship when the details are finalized.

I think the answer is essentially the same as when it&#39;s in daylight. There are lights mounted on the payload attachment, so that we can see the payload floating away. The cameras showing this does also have an exposure set to catch this event - not the stars. If the cameras were set to be able to see the starlight, then the payload attachment and the payload itself would be all washed out. If the deployment happened within sunlight, the same thing applies. Here&#39;s an experiment to show this: Have a camera that can do manual settings. During daylight, take a picture of an object in your yard, and note at which settings everything in the picture looks right in terms of exposure and light. During night, illuminate this object using a flashlight or something else, and take a picture of it so that the object comes out right this time around as well. The third picture will be of the stars - take a picture where the stars are visible, and note these settings down as well. Now the task is to use these settings interchangeably to take pictures of the skies and the object. For example, take a picture of the object during daylight, but using the settings you applied to be able to see the stars. Most probably, the whole picture will be white, because the exposure is set WAY too high. If you take a picture of the object while it&#39;s illuminated during night time, using the daylight settings, you&#39;ll probably see the object in the picture, but nothing else. If you take a picture of the object while it&#39;s illuminated at night, using the settings you used to see the stars, the stars will be visible, the object will be mostly white, and the rest of the image very dark.<br><br>My point is that the camera settings you use are dependent on what you&#39;re intending to show in the photo. Here, the interesting part is the payload attachment and the payload. Therefore, everything else will be too dark to make out, which is exactly what we see. If SpaceX were to attach a camera on the upper stage with an exposure suited for seeing the stars, <b>THEN</b> you would see them. However, they won&#39;t do that, because adding cameras is not in their interest - their interest is to put spacecrafts into orbit and show us and themselves how it&#39;s doing.<br><br>If space deniers really wanted to, they could buy a CubeSat and get funding to put it on the next launch that carries them. They could have a camera there set to see the stars. There&#39;s nothing preventing people from doing this, other than money. If they lack the knowledge to design such a system, this too can be built to spec by someone. I think if every space denier chipped in, this is totally doable.", "comment_date": "2019-08-07T14:20:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Star Dust", "comment_text": "Kateeeeeeeeee ruuuuuuules :):)", "comment_date": "2019-08-07T14:03:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mike Clark", "comment_text": "Does anyone know why this booster is being expended instead of recovered?
