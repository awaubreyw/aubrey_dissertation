Not to sound pedantic, the speed of sound is the speed at which a pressure wave will travel through a medium.  Sound is literally just pressure waves and those waves will always travel at the same speed in a medium under specific conditions.  The limiting factor that determines the speed of sound/pressure waves is the point at which the flow becomes incompressible, i.e. you literally cannot squeeze it further due to thermodynamic limitations.<br><br>What this means is that once the engine exhaust flow goes sonic, it physically cannot be compressed any further, so continuing to reduce throat size beyond that point simply reduces how much mass can be forced through leading to slowdown.  You can actually have a throat with some length to it to accommodate varying input pressures and you&#39;ll only slightly impact efficiency.<br><br><br>To accelerate the flow to supersonic, you have to expand the pathway to give the gas more room to expand.  This causes it to go faster because you&#39;re essentially giving space to run out, like popping the cork on a bottle.  The actual thermodynamics behind it are far more complicated than this basic view and trust me when I say the math is horrible.  You have to combine core thermo principles with PDEs to derive the expansion equations, but it comes out to the same result.<br><br>So, rocket nozzles work by squeezing hot gas to an incompressible state, then popping the cork so it can blast out.<br><br>Also, thought I&#39;d mention that aerospikes remind me of the idea of external combustion engines theorized for hypersonic vehicles.", "comment_date": "2022-01-29T02:07:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marc Brass\u00e9", "comment_text": "Another analogy might be that of swing wing airplanes.

The best rocket engine to date is the Merlin engines on the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that produce a big more than 1.7 million lbs of thrust. That is like placing a modern car on to a mail stamp. The reason for engines being as large as they are is because of how fluid gas flow changes as atmospheric pressure drops the higher the rocket travels. The problem arises when a rocket engines bell shape is not properly optimized for the altitude. The bell can be underexpaned at higher altitudes and over expanded at lower altitudes. <br><br>(All of this was explained in the video I\u2019m just trying to explain how I reasoned through this)<br><br>Could this problem be solved similarly to how a F-16 fighter jet controls its gas flow? By constricting or opening the bell mechanically. I don\u2019t see many rockets with this sort of mechanism and I wonder why they haven\u2019t experimented with a rocket engine that changes shape as it travels higher. I assume the mechanics to changing the shape may be overly heavy, but what if we had a pressurized container that lies around the engine. The gas inside, as it gains altitude, will expand, as well as, the heat of the engine would continue to expand the volume of gas. The purpose for this expansion would be to increase pressure on the engines outer shell to move the theoretical parts of the engine bell that contract or expand the bella radius. Think of the F-16 jet engines and how they have flaps. If you push them all equally, they fold in on them selves, and if you let them go they will be pushed out wards.<br><br>Obviously this would need more details but Im thinking there could be regulatory valves that release  excess gas to release pressure as needed. Specifically, calculate to be over pressurized as you climb altitude and relieve pressure with the help of AI controllers. A problem with my logic maybe is that the pressure on the inside of the bell may be greater than a outer force from gas resulting in the bell not constricting. Before reaching a vacuum, I think the pressurized casing would have to be completely depleted of its gas so as not to explode.<br><br>Thoughts?<br><br>Thank you for your amazing video explaining rockets to us future astronauts who have yet to take any proper rocket science.", "comment_date": "2021-01-06T17:30:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alan Jeffries Jeffries", "comment_text": "True smeghead", "comment_date": "2021-01-06T15:35:02Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mix of everything CZ", "comment_text": "Why dont they just make an extendable nozzle<br>Sea level=Not extended<br>Vacuum=Extended", "comment_date": "2021-01-06T11:20:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Israel Leite", "comment_text": "Amazing video!", "comment_date": "2021-01-06T05:00:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "duke royalty", "comment_text": "The smiling puffin routinely bury because sheet synchronously subtract by a ten representative. brown, relieved baby", "comment_date": "2021-01-06T01:04:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Marcin B", "comment_text": "Love this video.

You need a working model at the level of the physical mechanisms so that you target manipulating the actual causes of the physical actions, not targeting the observed factors that correlate to the behaviors you seek.<br>With aerospike, you are approaching the tech Viktor Schauberger pioneered, using the boundary layer effects to control the flow of your fluids. But only at the tail end after restricting your degrees of freedom beyond the flexibiloty to meet the full requirements of your design. Remember water has a gas energy state that is diamagnetic and can constantly accelerate the speed of gas flow well beyond supersonic without heating any surfaces if you use the water to contain and guide the flow. Viktor did much smaller units that put so much energy in his hydrocarbon-water fuels that they fissioned between copper plates without melting them. I recommend 400 grade stainless for better magnetic field effect. The plasma reactions also generate electromagnetic waves that push off the gravity of the planet, increasing thrust and reducing weight. Party on dudes, be good to each other.

If you are chocking it just a little bit, there will be no difference, but if you get further, this effect will be clear. <br>In the case of a nozzle it&#39;s not the same but quite similar, if you decrease the throat, you will be decreasing the flow, no matter how you do it. The point you got is quite right, you want as much velocity as you can.<br>Second poit you missed was the shockwaves. While studying a nozzle you need to know where the shockwave is, and it is certainly very important, probably the most important thing.<br>And finally, when you said that flow is constant, it can get constant but not changing the throat size, but changing the pressure inside (or outside) the chamber.

I was involved with a rocket engine testing program about 11 years ago (2008-2009) at the AFRL at Edwards Air Force Base... There were several types of engines there... There was an Aerospike Linear engine on Display in the museum area there at the Air Force Research Laboratories...  From what I recall , the original specification of that Aerospike engine, was to be used with the re-usable orbiters which was called the X-33 program... The single stage orbiter, was to achieve an orbit with the Linear Aerospike engine.... The Linear Aerospike engine was to power the winged air/space craft into space from the Earth. And the Aerospike, then would have good performance in the atmosphere AND in the vacuum of space...  If I remember correctly, the X-33 was to have 2 linear Aerospike engines... The thrust was was to be vectored by varying the amount of thrust from the individual propulsion units along the upper part of the ramp where they were located... Therefore, no gimbaling was needed for ACS / RCS... It would simplify the design of the reusable orbiter, and save weight without the use of gimbaling controls (that were necessary with each bell-type rocket engine)....One of the most interesting things about The AFRL at EAFB, is they had complete testing facilities for testing rocket engines &amp; motors that operated in the vacuum that space has... TSRM-Third Stage Rocket Motor testing facilities were very interesting.... It is too bad that the X-33 program was scrapped... There were other programs that were very interesting as well.

It has to do with energy being taken from the higher energy form, and being put into the lower energy form. That is why you get an average temp, and not a &quot;total added together&quot; temp. It has to with law of conservation of energy pretty sure. This answer is not an exact answer to this phenomena, just a basic overview. <br><br>The lower temp material could only get as hot as the higher temp material. So like you say 1000 degrees up to 2500, the 1000 degrees item could only get as hot as the 2500 item. I don&#39;t think you could make the 1000 degrees item get hotter than 2500 but maybe. That may violate the law of cons. of energy, and maybe someone else could elaborate on this or provide a more correct answer. But when you do thermo problems, you usually do the average temps to make the problems easier to solve and simulate etc. So you get temp and pressure to get your thermophysical properties of the material/fluid and go from there to make it easier. <br><br>This concept is actually really easy to understand, I am just blanking on an explanation for it right now. But I also need to revisit this concept. It is like when you are cooling something. The hotter temp fluid will only get as cold as the lower temp fluid. But both fluids will change temp in the end, unless there is more of one fluid than the other. Then the mixture will either get the hottest temp initially, or coldest temp initially, or in between. But it would depend on how much of the fluids you have; the temp would be based off of that. So it is easier to make it an average. But where it counts, it is definitely not set as an average. There are calculations based on enthalpy that show the temp wont be an average temp, and things will barely heat up or barely cool. All based on the heat transfer coefficient &quot;h.&quot; This is pretty in depth, but not that hard really.

SpaceX has sea level optimized engines that launch from sea level, detach from the upper stage, and again land at sea level, and vacuum optimized engines that operate only in vacuum. Both are better in their respective regimes than an aerospike which is theoretically a good compromise between sea level efficiency and vacuum. An aerospike carrying a big empty fuel tank is still less efficient than a bell engine not carrying that tank.<br>For a moment I though an aerospike might be good as a reusable upper stage, because it needs to work in a vacuum, and then come down to sea level to land, but landing is extremely fuel efficient. Most of the deceleration should be done by the atmosphere either way, so overall system efficiency on ascent is far more important than on descent.<br>Landing an SSTO is also going to be much more difficult than landing just an upper stage. A smaller object takes less shielding to survive unpowered re-entry, or less fuel if you decelerate with engines rather than aerobraking. <br>Maybe an aerospike can be made that is better than a bell nozzle for some applications, I think it is worth a small portion of our overall space budget to keep looking into.

If bell nozzles are optimized for one specific altitude and pressure but aerospikes maintain their efficiency at any altitude, why wouldn&#39;t it be a good idea to use aerospikes on a multistage rocket given that bell nozzles still lose efficiency within a single stage?  The most common argument I hear against aerospikes is the idea that they don&#39;t make a single stage to orbit rocket feasible enough because an STO would still be carrying dead weight but that&#39;s more of a critique of STO&#39;s than aerospikes.  I understand that aerospikes were designed with STO rockets in mind but I keep in mind that bell nozzles still lose efficiency within a single stage at different altitudes, where aerospikes wouldn&#39;t.<br><br>For example, when we look at the Saturn 5 launches, it&#39;s clear that the exhaust was going straight down at sea level but before the first stage was ejected we can see that the exhaust is more spread out in a fan shape and therefore much less efficient.  Assuming they were available at the time If the first stage of the Saturn 5 contained aerospikes that wouldn&#39;t have happened and they still could have shed the dead weight by ejecting the first stage as they normally would have.

This reminds me of a CVT in automatic transmission car with the idea being to have continually adjusted gears for most efficient energy transfer (note: I loathe CVTs, I much prefer DCTs, but the general concept is sound)<br><br><br>As for thermodynamics: Air, in physics terms, is also just a liquid. When you have a 100 Celsius degree hot cup of water and mix it with another cup of water that&#39;s 50 degrees Celsius, the molecules of those two cups of water mix. Since temperature really is just a measure of how quickly the atoms are moving around, the slower-moving molecules of the relatively colder water will absorb some of the energy of the faster-moving ones of the boiling water. In other words, those molecules will be slowed down and the temperature of the mix will, all things being equal, be around 75 degrees celsius. One quick note: I really was never good at physics in high school. In fact, I utterly failed at it with some exceptions. What really helped me get a better handle on this have been science shows like these on YouTube and other outlets. While I am not very good at complex equations, I am good at understanding through visuals and connections which then help me understand at least some of the math. Back in high school I almost had to repeat a year because I was failing math. My mom found me a tutor who at the time was an art student in college. He was able to intuitively explain to me wave functions (things like f(x)=), &quot;Kurvenanalyse&quot;)  by showing me how the equations related to the visual representation of those functions. Not only did I pass math, but I went from an F to an A within just a few months. It really felt great and I stopped feeling like a failure when it came to math. I am still very much grateful.<br><br><br>Keep up the good work. It is science shows like these that help the young and old get curious about science and the arts which, to me at least, are very much connected. Art often provides intuitive leaps that can advance science significantly. That&#39;s also why you will find that inventors in the past have also been quite involved with the arts such as poetry, music, and painting. After all, the great cathedrals were not just significant architectural achievements that required a sound understanding of physics but also were meant to inspire.", "comment_date": "2020-04-27T20:38:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Doctor Forbin", "comment_text": "Elon Musk.

I can really see all the effort you used to produce it.<br><br>That said, as a space engineer, I have to point out some inaccuracies.<br>-talking about traditional bell engines, bigger engines are easier to cool down not because they use more fuel. Burning more fuel means more heat to dissipate and this will not cool down the engine faster. Actually, its not the absolute amount of fuel that helps to cool down the engine, but its quantity compared with the amount of oxidant. If you inject a rich mixture into the reaction chamber, some fuel will not burn because of the lack of oxidant and will simply evaporate, consuming heat in the process (latent heat). This procedure is really common in every thermal engine because a lot of the thermal energy is not lost, but it is used to further increase pressure in the combustion chamber (fuel increase its volume by a lot while becoming gas from liquid). It does not depend on the actual size of the engine, but only on settings. Actually, the bigger the engine, the more fuel you have to spend to have the same cooling effect.<br>The real reason bigger engines are easier to cool down is because... they are bigger. Bigger means more mass and this more thermal inertia, more resistance to stress, more space where to install devices that helps you to cool down your engine and bigger radiating surfaces (which are not a downside, as it seems you&#39;re saying) and so on.<br><br>-and here it comes to aerospike engines. Again: it is true that they have a problem with their cooling down, but that&#39;s not because of the wider surface area. There are two problems with cooling down aerospike engines: they need to be really compact and regenerative cooling is not practical if even possible. The first problem is really easy to understand: just look at their design. Packing many combustion chambers near each other, greatly reduce their cooling efficiency. That&#39;s the reason we invented V and boxer engines.<br>The second problem is, again, a problem that comes with the design itself. The idea of regenerative cooling is that you bring the excess heat from the combustion chamber to the nozzle bell where the gas are cooling down naturally because they are expanding. This heat is not completely lost in the process, but it is partially converted into speed in the process and thus the name &quot;regenerative&quot;. This is obtained by circulating fuel into the walls of the combustion chamber and then into the walls of the nozzle bell and back. This is of course almost impossible in aerospike engines because they do not have a proper bell where to transfer heat to the expanding gases.<br><br>-at last, while talking about thrust to weight ratio, its true that they are way more complex than &quot;traditional&quot; rockets and weigh more., but you also have to say that the idea is to reduce the number of stages required to reach the orbit and this will definitely compensate this increase in engine&#39;s weight.<br><br>There is also one problem that comes with aerospike engines that I could not hear in your video. this is actually a major problem and I think (but to be honest, i&#39;m not sure) this is even more important that the cooling down problem. Aerospike efficiency is related to the shape of the spike. This is the same problem they had with the SR-71 air intake. Basically, to reach the theoretical maximum efficiency, the spike needs to be infinitely long. Even drawing a finite spike with real dimensions, a really sharp edge is still a problem because it is a weak point unable to resist the temperatures and forces that affect it and it also increase total mass. That&#39;s why they &quot;cut&quot; the edge and then they try to overcome the loss in efficiency by using exhaust gasses, as you pointed out.<br><br>In the end, the real reason why they are not using aerospike engines is the same reason they still use 60 years old CPUs: reliability. When you spend years in planning a space mission that cost you half a billion dollars and that will bring a few people in the most hostile environment we ever met, you want to be 100% sure your equipment will not fail. As you pointed out, aerospike engines are not tested in vacuum, they have a lot of unsolved problems and they are still a young technology. Since the cold war is over and commercial applications will be really limited, no one will spend billions and billions just to test them. hopefully this will change in the future.<br><br>Please, let me say just one more thing, not as a space engineer, but as a &quot;science enthusiast&quot;. I really can&#39;t understand how can you be so passionate about space and rocketry and so on (and your videos are the proof of this passion) and, at the same time, being so &quot;pessimistic&quot; about new technologies. A piece of technology is just like a person: it born, it grows up, usually it give birth to a new generation of technology and it dies. SSTOs, aerospikes and so on, are just like babies right now. We didn&#39;t even start to scratch the surface: it&#39;s just like looking at a baby and saying: &quot;oh, he&#39;s so useless, he can&#39;t even talk. Just dispose of it as a waste&quot;. Science does not works like that. Yes, they are useless right now, no one will argue that. But they are the future. And even if you will be proven right and aerospike will be scratched and considered useless junk, the experience we&#39;re acquiring right now while studying them is invaluable. As Edison said: &quot;I have not failed. I&#39;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&#39;t work.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T21:22:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ravindra Sajji", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4SaofKCYwo&amp;t=32m50s\">32:50</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T15:47:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Klab", "comment_text": "The person to make Aerospike engines very functional beyond nozzle engines is going to be rich.", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T15:30:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cindy R", "comment_text": "Great video Tim!

Good vid, though, from an EE who knows &quot;not much&quot; about rocket propulsion, meaning much more than the typical layman, MUCH less than, say, my brother, who was a thermal/propulsion guy  (strange combo, yeah, but the job &quot;required&quot; it...heard about the aerospike first time from him about 20 odd years ago. <br><br>How much force the atmosphere apply?...no secret....about 14.7 lb/sq in. at sea level. What that essentially means is if you took a one inch square tube and projected it  it &quot;into space&quot;, the atmosphere inside that very narrow tube would actually WEIGH 14.7 lbs. <br><br>Think about taking a 10lb and a 5lb weight at the gym, putting them on top off a one inch square block (fairly large gaming dice, like at a casino) and setting them on the back of your hand (say).  It would not be even remotely comfortable, actually fairly to quite painful in a short time. <br><br>Why don&#39;t we experience this pain from the atmosphere? Because it &quot;presses down&quot; both externally and internally in our bodies.   By the way, if  you quickly REMOVE that force, ie. step into a vacuum, it would be EXCRUCIATINGLY painful. <br><br>\u00a0I used to put my hand (NEVER anything else, there are horrific horror stories of kids sitting on them, and them removing their ENTIRE intestines, safer redesigns because of that, back when) over the skimmer inlet pipe in the pool circulation/filtering system while trying to get it primed, draining the last of a near empty pool when it lost prime, with a hose running into the skimmer. <br><br>You couldn&#39;t let air enter the system or it wouldn&#39;t pump from &quot;way down there&quot;, takes a tremendous amount of vacuum to do that, about 1/3 the atmospheric pressure removed, and a pool pump is a REALLY lousy air pump, it would NEVER get there with much air (other than small bubbles) in the system. <br><br>What is ACTUALLY lifting that 10&#39; column of water is the differential pressure above and below the column...the high side IS the atmospheric pressure, and in a big enough pipe, you could lift TONS of water (actually millions of tons, theoretically, practically infinite) by atmospheric pressure alone, to about 30 feet and a bit, at sea level, less on top of a tall mountain.  Trees lift it MUCH further (some 450 feet, through capillary action. This is left as an exercise for the &quot;student&quot;.  Enough of the science lesson.  Hope somebody enjoyed this and maybe learned something interesting, and it certainly applies to the video, if in maybe a secondary way, worst case.  I think this is all accurate, but look it up if you want to make sure.  ;-)<br><br>If I was as good a presenter as you are (excellently researched concise presentation BTW), I might make a video about it, but I&#39;m sure that there are already several on YT already, so probably not worthwhile to anyone.  I know, I basically have half the script written here, right?...beat &#39;cha to that thought, maybe.  ;-)", "comment_date": "2019-10-29T16:08:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "JWils-82", "comment_text": "I love your videos.

Most of a first stage even there are no proven or even theoretical techniques promoted forward as a good idea to utilize the air to improve rocket performance by a significant degree.  At this the falcon 9 does the best thing possible which is to use a circle of engines to promote the thrust of the inner area.  The Super Heavy will have more rings of engines inside this pressure zone on assent.  That is really kind of it.  Then there is the whole thing where a typical two stage to orbit rocket as Elon Musk has said for every 5 lbs of recovery hardware on the first stage, the payload mass drops by 1lbs.  However on the second stage it is a 1 to 1 ratio.  This also suggests any small improvements on the first stage efficiency are going to have an even smaller effect on the overall payload mass to orbit.<br><br>Something else you don&#39;t seem to really touch on is the mass of the fuel tanks, especially when you are talking about LOX/LH2 engines and comparing them against LOX/LNG engines.  The total delta-V of a rocket is its ISP times a partial integration between the starting mass and ending mass after burning up the fuel.  LH2 is not very dense at least compared to LNG and so an LH2 rocket is going to have a larger ending mass due to the larger tanks.  This whole starting to ending mass partial integration times ISP issue is the main reason for multi-stage rockets in the first place as in part way up and after most of the fuel mass is burned up, you chuck off the empty fuel tank mass and associated excess engine mass and basically start a new partial integration with the second stage.  This is also why the Space Shuttle sucked as it hauled a giant LH2 tank and a giant orbiter all the way up to orbital speed, which is just madness along with all of the other crazy and unsafe things they did to make the Space Shuttle work at all.  LH2 engines have also been plagued by lower thrust than any other type of engine and thrust is important when talking about getting off of Earth as either you have a longer hang time, meaning more delta-V to do the same job or the rocket is just too heavy to get off of the ground or very wide, which has its own disadvantages.", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T20:58:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nablablaFPV", "comment_text": "just awesome, i wanted to research and find all of this out, now i dont have 2 :)", "comment_date": "2019-10-26T20:25:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael Ryan", "comment_text": "A great briefing.

A single engine for the entire flight regime is a major requirement for any military application that requires an SSTO capable vehicle that can be deployed as a military asset; and that includes deployment in the form of &#39;scrambles&#39; or intercepts, immidiate requirement for recon due to a battle field developement, or a retaliatory strike package in responds to a enemy&#39;s movement or action. The Aerospike is the one place to go for extreme high performance military applications, bar none. Its why the military focuses on such complex engines in fighter crafts.  They dont just focus on effeciency, they also focus on pure power.

The pressure of the gas on exit would be exponentially greater than ambient. This design would be more fuel efficient and have greater thrust than any other by several fold.

They have a higher average efficiency, but a lower <i>peak</i> efficiency. Higher average efficiency would be great if single-stage-to-orbit rockets were practical on Earth, but Earth&#39;s gravity makes SSTO rockets impractical due to the penalty of dragging unnecessary dead-weight into orbit after the rocket has burned through most of its fuel just to get off the ground. Since Earth&#39;s gravity favors the use of multi-stage rockets, each rocket must have a separate set of engines for each stage, so each set of engines can be optimized for the atmospheric pressure at the altitude it will operate. This means bell-nozzle engines&#39; higher <i>peak</i> efficiency is more valuable in real life, compared to aerospike engines&#39; higher <i>average</i> efficiency. Meanwhile, in an airless environment like the Moon (or almost-airless like Mars), you can just use a vacuum-optimized bell-nozzle engine starting at ground-level all the way into orbit -- a scenario which <i>still</i> favors bell-nozzle engines&#39; higher <i>peak</i> efficiency. Aerospike engines would only be the better option on a planet with significantly less gravity that also mysteriously still has an atmosphere at least as dense as Earth&#39;s, such as Titan.", "comment_date": "2019-10-21T01:11:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Elrayn", "comment_text": "You should do a collab with Scott Manely", "comment_date": "2019-10-21T01:09:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Cilia", "comment_text": "Great Video Tim, hard work paid off.... well explained, top job bring on more videos, thanks \ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2019-10-21T01:09:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dime893", "comment_text": "This was really well done!

Enormous kudos from your YouTube fanbase!<br><br>As an aside, is it really your intuition that blending exhaust gasses would make them hotter? In which case is it also your intuition that mixing cold water with hot water will make the combined water hotter? Hopefully not.

I mean, you rarely send an engine up to space by itself. It wouldn&#39;t even have fuel to do so. The number you quote here is &quot;How much does it push versus how heavy is the engine&quot; while the weight of the engine is only a tiny tiny amount of the total weight of even the dry vehicle without fuel.<br>A TWR based on engine weight is a useless stat in my opinion because it doesn&#39;t matter how many times it&#39;s own weight the engine can push. It matters how much it can push in total force.<br>A low TWR engine can still push more than a high TWR engine that is built with less metal.<br>If the engine weight would be a more substantial percentage of the total vehicle, it would become more relevant.<br><br>So Raptor has 107:1 ratio, which means it can push 107 times it&#39;s own weight.

So complexity (and therefore reliability) is a primary factor for issues with the aerospike. SpaceX seemingly has determined that a couple dozen-ish mass produced engines is the way to go. As an overall system, this is hugely complex (sort of), though they kinda make up for it with brute force (engine-out capabilities). It is no doubt a huge development risk, but it seems like a single (massive, this may compound thermal &amp; mass issues) aerospike with a couple dozen-ish chambers would be similar total complexity.<br><br><br>Of course, there is only 1 rocket that has successfully proven out the many engined concept, so we are still in the early stages at this complexity level anywho!

Those relationships play out going in the other direction too. The case being Diesel engines. Here though, it&#39;s a case of HEAT LOSS. A Diesel engine relies on the temperature of compression to supply the necessary heat and temperature for the fuel to ignite when injected into the cylinder during the power stroke. A very large Marine Diesel engine has a smaller surface-area-to-volume ratio than a small Diesel engine like in the famous VW Diesel Rabbit. I believe the Rabbit had something on the order of a 22:1 compression ratio where very large Diesel engines can have a compression ratio as low as a 12.5:1 (or even less). The larger surface-area-to-volume ratio of the smaller Diesel engine results in HEAT LOSS to the engine&#39;s water jacket and head ...  thus the need for a much higher compression ratio to support the Diesel Cycle and by the very same exponential relationships you so perfectly explained.", "comment_date": "2019-10-19T02:53:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Wood", "comment_text": "Love your work, Tim. <br><br>It seems to me that issues such heat and weight are a function of new materials science.

The thrust required goes down as you go up anyway, so reducing the throat area and thrust instead of increasing the exit area to increase the expansion ratio seem like a much lighter weight solution. it also lets you maintain chamber pressure at low throttle, which is helpful later in the flight when you throttle down for structural reasons and lets the main engine actually do orbital maneuvering efficiently.

This one is fantastic and provides a great insight on the aerospikes. As an aerospace engineer I can only agree with you that aerospike technology doesn&#39;t have enough TRL to be commercially viable in a short term. And even worse than that, there is no reason now for a SSTO given the engines we have and the reusability factor. Nonetheless, I am a dreamer, and we won&#39;t be able to use multistage spacecrafts when landing and taking off from other planets. So, I still can&#39;t avoid thinking that the future of rocket engines is some sort of SSTO spacecraft powered by aerospikes, or increasing the number of steerable engines so the total plume could be fully controlled by hundreds of small engines, or some sort of adjustable geometry nozzle. I feel that the aerospike concept is like the electric car at the begining of the 20th century. It was way ahead of it&#39;s time.

This might be done by replacing the array of combustion chambers with one continuous chamber that runs the full length of the nozzle ramp.   I also believe that someone will improve the cooling issue though pumping fuel though the throat in a more effective and efficient way, combined with materials that handle higher heats, such as a titanium ceramic alloy of some type.  Additionally, by making the combustion chamber and throat from one piece, it would likely improve the surface area ratio to the fuel volume, helping with heat dissipation.  I also think that the fuel reaction percent could be improved by altering the combustion chamber shape, along with improvements to the injector arrays, that better mix the gases.  You could also use some sort of supersonic shock-wave design in the throat to get more of the fuel and oxidizer to combine, improving combustion efficiency.  My guess is that better computer modeling could help find ways to improve the shape and flow of the fuel from the injectors through the combustion chambers, and out the throat to achieve better performance and efficiency.  Better designs combined with 3D printing of advanced materials and alloys, all of these problems could be solved eventually.  It&#39;s just going to take a lot of advancements in computer aided modeling and design, materials engineering, and manufacturing processes to get there.", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T19:16:31Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Imagine A World", "comment_text": "Sstos are only good as an escape pod.

Learned a lot. I have a comment that relates to you statement in this video about SSTO sucking esp. the fact that even the best optimized single stage engine is still way less efficient over all than a multi-stage vehicle with atmosphere and vacuum optimized engines.<br>  The best vehicle to get from the Earth&#39;s surface to a Martian orbit is not Super Heavy/ Starship. That system works great to LEO, but from there on it&#39;s like an SSTO. Wrong engine, for the job. There are vastly better methods of propulsion once your vehicle has achieved LEO, than any chemical rocket. The best (for many reasons) not the least of which is being able to utilize the enormous amount of free solar energy available in the inner to mid solar system. The water plasma engine. Cheap fuel- it&#39;s everywhere. High ISP- super high exhaust velocity and your fuel is easy to handle in the extreme.<br>   No cryogenic hassles, it&#39;s not likely to blow up, it could be radiation shielding and could even be ballast to allow artificial gravity by rotating your vehicle around a common center with the payload on one end and your fuel on the other after your have achieved transfer velocity. Your could even decelerate into Martian orbit, so your deep space system would be waiting for a return trip.  Momentus is commercializing water plasma thrusters for orbit change and station keeping and primary propulsion for deep space probes. Seems to me they could apply the same thrusters for powering something even larger, like Starship. Instead of just a tow truck between LEO and GEO that tow could be to anywhere in the solar system for any thing that could get to LEO!", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T18:36:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The David", "comment_text": "I must say, this video might be your best work thus far.

Now that full flow staged combustion is proven to be workable (having a programatic reason to bring your engine back to earth definitely gives you an incentive to try and make the most effective engine you can, the RS25 is still very impressive and wouldn&#39;t have been developed for an expendable platform) there is some now technologically-accesible fuel efficiency on the table that can be blown on extra cooling if necessary. In 1999 they thought they &quot;could&quot; get the RS2200 light enough to get that 83:1 TWR, but only needed 75:1 to accheive SSTO you said. Comparing the TWR of the RS25 and the Raptor suggests that that&#39;s well within the realm of doable today. I think what I&#39;m arguing in a round about way is that Space-X more than any other outfit to date, has a library of relevant proven technologies they could bring to bear on the problem and is one of the only concerns that legitimately has an incentive to try. And, materials science has moved on a lot in 20 years. <br>The rotary analogy is interesting, but even me as a huge fan of rotaries have to admit that the geometry of the combustion chamber just doesn&#39;t have the potential to provide the last word in efficiecy or torque, whereas an aerospike is sort of the opposite, it&#39;s a more complex machine with a potentially more efficient use of combustion chamber.", "comment_date": "2019-10-18T16:17:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Dogovich", "comment_text": "Breaking it down terrifically once again!
