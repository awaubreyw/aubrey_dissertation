Using the vehicle as a demo was very good and I use this when passing, in anticipating a passing point approaching  , I back off a distance then accelerate as the point approaches so at the passing point my velocity is a fair bit greater than the vehicle to be passed.

In that scenario the fins could be used to generate some lift to provide a soft approach to a landing.", "comment_date": "2021-04-26T21:59:25Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rusty Viking", "comment_text": "How can you dislike this?

If it takes 200 meters to flip and start the engines then that\u2019s the height, plus whatever altitude it takes to slow to landing speed. That gives you a number so that\u2019s the number. Assign more gives you nothing except more propellant mass required = more aerodynamic braking required or even more propellant required = more delta V / propellant required to leave earth LEO for Mars = more propellant loadings in earth LEO ~ Tank volume may be an issue so less payload to Mars to account for increased propellant requirements.<br><br>2. There is basically just enough atmosphere to destroy a space craft but not that much for aero braking. Aero braking require an air MASS and density to push against. There is more of that near the ground so aero braking for as long as possible take advantage of the best part of the atmosphere available. Not only is the atmosphere way denser near the surface making aero braking vastly more efficient let\u2019s say 20 times as just a number, but since you\u2019re going so much slower under 500 kmh as opposed to 50 000 kmh it means you get to take advantage of it for 100 times as long. This means with these example numbers, you get 2000 times the braking per unit distance flown down real low compared to the same distance flown up high.<br><br>2.5 well SpaceX has always said it needed and intended to choose near equator and lowest altitude landing sites available for many reasons. Well this is probably one of them. So at night in winter landing will increase surface pressures by 50%over a summer day landing time.<br><br>3. If the flip to land works then it works. If it doesn\u2019t then it doesn\u2019t. So far it does. Failures are so far, plumbing, ignition timing and engine reliability issues. But the thing can flip and flip back without breaking up, so the flip works. Now the rest of it, lucky this is a TEST program and not the production model duels program.

So, what if they added deployable louvers/flaps (to the top fins, to act as drag brakes), did the flip maneuver say a minute before impact, then deployed the drag brakes (pushing the fuel to the bottom of the tanks where it normally is), then relit the engines normally to land Falcon-9 style. Then it seems like you could get rid of the special landing/header tanks altogether.  Granted,  it would be going faster than the current sideways approach, but at that point, Starship should be relatively light and easy to slow down. It seems like igniting the engines sideways is a problem that should not need to be solved.

The ship goes faster to liftoff. So when the ship  {Controlled flipped } it still will be subject to switching to freefall when it has been made upright unless to burn takes it back up above to the lift allowance. At the upright position the ship needs an acceleration rate that is again equal to original liftoff speed for a fraction shorter timeframe to counteract gravity &amp; side burns to avoid side falling. Because of the exaggerated weight of the ship it needs a much higher altitude to reach the extra lift to reach dynamic lift &amp; hold so de acceleration can commence. To make my point more simple!. A helicopter on decent has commenced accelerating &amp; not decelerating which is why the rotors bent upward under the effect of gravity &amp; wind resistance. The same for Starship. The initial fuel weight before liftoff would need to be increased to allow for a extra hard burn of more fuel to bring an equilibrium @ vertical level before the slowing of the fuel burn rate which allows for decent @ almost an instance equal to the same. When Mars comes to mind the dynamics completely are changed. You speak of wasting fuel &amp; Gravity. Fuel efficiency usage will help make the project work.

The &#39;stopping calculation&#39; is just a simple one; not any harder than calculating orbital burns, and significantly simpler than hitting the correct Moon orbit. Perhaps it looks intuitively scary (because we are poor judges of how scary orbital insertion is) but what matters is reliability. Every day, billions of people put their trust in a simple device called &#39;a brake&#39; which if it fails,  has exactly the same consequences as a Raptor not working during landing. Yes, a brake can be made very reliable, but we are talking hundreds of billions of braking events per day vs a single event of landing a starship. Yes, we got used to people dying because of brake failures, but that is just a matter of media attention. When rockets are more commonplace, an accident will be more like an aeroplane accident these days; it wont stop all flights for a decade anymore. How reliable is reliable enough? it&#39;s all a matter of PR impact. Car and aeroplane companies know all about it. it&#39;s cruel but it&#39;s the way the universe works.

When Starship is descending belly-first, the weight direction from gravity is vertically downward.  Then when lighting the Raptor engines while Starship is horizontal, they will have a thrust direction horizontal, which is 90 degrees to the weight direction.  The thrust-to-weight ratio would therefore be 0:1, since none of the thrust is pushing against gravity.  While Starship is horizontal, lighting either one Raptor engine or three engines, the thrust-to-weight ratio is still 0:1 because none of the thrust is pushing upward.  As Starship rotates to vertical, the vertical component of thrust is slowly increasing proportional to the trigonometric sine of Starships angle from horizontal, which gives time to test the Raptor engines and decide which engine or engines to use, before having any significant thrust-to-weight ratio.  When Raptor engines are gimbaled upward to rotate the Starship from horizontal to vertical, the thrust-to-weight ratio will be a slight negative value for a few seconds, so that a small percentage of Raptor engine thrust will accelerate the Starship downward.<br><br>POUNDS:  At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqJ5bKuApbs&amp;t=14m14s\">14:14</a> referring to Imperial/British/English units of pounds, the quote is &quot;Of course, it would be just as easy to use pounds and pounds-force in this example, ...&quot;.  Technically &quot;pounds&quot; and &quot;pounds-force&quot; are from different variations of the Foot-Pound-Second system.  The three main variations of the Foot-Pound-Second system are:<br><br>    British Gravitational (BG)<br>          pound  :  force<br>          slug  :  mass<br>    Absolute English (AE)<br>          poundal  :  force<br>          pound  :  mass<br>    English Engineering (EE)<br>          pound-force  :  force<br>          pound-mass  :  mass<br><br>So unless you specify which variant of the Foot-Pound-Second system, the term &quot;pound&quot; is ambiguous.  Although in the U.S., &quot;pound&quot; in common usage is usually from the &quot;British Gravitational (BG)&quot; variant of Foot-Pound-Second, so &quot;pound&quot; would be weight.  All of this Foot-Pound-Second ambiguity makes the Metric SI system look much simpler.<br><br>WEIGHT:  In this video, the term &quot;weight&quot; is used multiple times.  In older centuries, the term &quot;weight&quot; was the force on an object caused by gravity, but since Einstein&#39;s relativity theories, there has been academic discussions about whether &quot;weight&quot; only applies to gravity, or whether &quot;weight&quot; applies to any accelerated reference frame system.  In pre-Einstein days, &quot;weight&quot; could be a scalar magnitude (single number without direction) because gravity was always toward the ground.  But since Einstein&#39;s relativity with accelerated reference frames, then &quot;weight&quot; might need to be a vector value (direction included, which may require more than one number to indicate direction).  Even now, textbooks defining &quot;weight&quot; differ on whether or not &quot;weight&quot; requires gravity, or whether &quot;weight&quot; is a scalar magnitude or a vector value.  Therefore, in this video, &quot;Weight&quot; is technically an ambiguous term, but by common sense and common experience, we all know what is being talked about.", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T21:53:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sorin Silaghi", "comment_text": "Whenhop?", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T21:53:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bhakti chohan", "comment_text": "Why am I sad that it\u2019s only 45 minutes :/", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T21:52:02Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "P B", "comment_text": "Why not use a parachute &amp; you might just need retros...", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T21:51:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bhakti chohan", "comment_text": "THIS MAN WILL ORBIT THE MOON.

Starship&#39;s current pre-landing mass exceeds the minimum thrust of 2 Raptors, so in that configuration the Thrust to Weight ratio always exceeds 1.<br><br>But SpaceX don&#39;t want to do a suicide burn if they can avoid it. Why is that? Because you need to to reduce speed to 0 kph at 0 m of altitude, but for the first landings on Mars YOU WON&#39;T KNOW when 0 metres of altitude actually is until you are almost on the ground, as you need to find a suitable place to land &quot;on the fly&quot;, and you do not know precisely in advance what relative altitude that place lies at. So, it&#39;s far better to have the capability to hover properly, or decelerate very slowly, while sideslipping to the chosen landing spot &amp; computing its altitude.<br><br>You touched on the fact that landing on Mars requires only 38% of the thrust. The thrust to weight ratios are therefore very different: on Earth, a Raptor in its current configuration can, as you show, hover any mass of 880 kN up to 2,200 kN. On Mars that converts to 2,315 kN to 5,789 kN. And that&#39;s for a SINGLE Raptor, so on a single Raptor a Starship will need to carry extra pre-landing mass of 915 kN in the form of fuel &amp;/or payload in order to do a proper hover-based landing. If a Starship carrying no payload has a pre-landing mass of 1,400 kN [as you give it here], you cannot land on Mars on two Raptors without carrying at least 3,230 kN of fuel &amp;/or payload [because 2 Raptors cannot hover less than 4,630 kN], That&#39;s the equivalent of carrying a further 2.3 pre-landing mass Starships in fuel &amp;/or payload.<br><br>THAT is why they are practising a proper hover landing on one Raptor on earth: it&#39;s because they will need to do it on Mars - at least to start with.", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T20:41:51Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Stevens", "comment_text": "Who&#39;s this Scott Maley?", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T20:41:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jordan Larson", "comment_text": "Great video", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T20:41:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "let'sNotMakeThisPersonal", "comment_text": "......Why don&#39;t they just (I know what I did) not use parachutes to land just allow starship to remain vertical and use the raptors to land?

I\u00b4m wondering what happens when that fast fip occures and how big the forces might be that try to rip off the pump from the engine or bend the blades of the discs. Normaly those engines are tested in a rather static maner  with only a little gimbaling when running. Im not aware that someone tried ever to tilt a running engine full 90\u00b0 in a way it occures at flip. I asked  Terran Space Academy about that and they commented that there could be significant gyroscopic forces generated and that it  would be interesting to calculate that. Would be nice If space x can provide some information on that interesting detail. Are there even specially &quot;hardened&quot; engines for that maneuver?", "comment_date": "2021-04-23T20:29:44Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matt Williams", "comment_text": "The belly flop maneuver itself has been preformed flawlessly am I wrong?

Modern automobiles are suppose to be survivable in 30 mph crash.  At 225 mph there is 56.25 times more kinetic energy of motion than at 30 mph, but there is a very long section of Starship that could be made to be energy absorbing.  225 mph is a near worst case scenario where only the cold thrusters were usable to get Starship into a vertical position with no repulsive thrust.  <br><br>Some part of the crew survivability system might make use of  rocket ejection seats similar to some fighter aircraft designed to effect crew rescue till the movement before a crash and parachutes down.  The action is not plesent with crew possibly passing out and experiencing 9-10 Gs.  Rocket ejection seats could be made to work in all possible Starship orientations.  The rocket propulsion can maneuver the ejection seat to get away from Starship then quickly change direction to avoid hitting the ground and get to parachute deployment height.  The first cosmonaut is reported to have bailed out of the capsule to make use of a normal human parachute.

No redundancy is what killed the crew of the Challenger, it&#39;s what killed the crew of the Columbia (And Vladimir Komarov if you want to go back further). And you&#39;re completely right: the Raptor hasn&#39;t matured yet, and Starship isn&#39;t even close to passing the prototype stage, fair enough. But it&#39;s safe to say that by this point, that excuse no longer applies to the Falcon 9, and yet its most recent landing failure was only two months ago. A single point of failure on the center engine, and the booster went kaboom on re-entry.

Amazing to learn and understand just how much more fuel would be required to start the flip a little earlier. I was one of many wondering why they left it so late.

So far we have had not enough pressure, too much gas in the lines, and maybe lastly SN11 which may have suffered from an over pressure event in one of the headers.
