Yes, bringing it back into the dock would need to be consideration.  If it&#39;s to deep it wouldn&#39;t work.  Why do it?  Thought is stability.  The amount of ballast needed to keep the ship at water line would allow it to be far more stable in less then ideal seas.  Also, having the rocket lower in the &#39;well&#39; means the top sticking out is lower which means a four point lasso could be drawn up from the perimeter to secure the rocket (initial).  Ok a bit detailed but not sure who else to ask.
