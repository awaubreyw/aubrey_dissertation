That would be a direct competition to Electron and they may even be able to land the 1st stage of the rocket which could be a savings as well.  Given that the 3rd iteration of the rocket would have double the capacity of the 2nd and with the Merlin 1D engine it would have even more thrust so it would easily outmatch Electron so it could be reusable very easily by cutting down the amount of payload.  <br><br>Given that information they could also take on Minotaur rockets and the competition from Russia.  In the end it would be a very interesting proposal for SpaceX if they want to reduce the cost of space flight but it does have one small issue.  The second stage engine is currently not in production; however there is a solution, the Super Draco engine.  If they put one of those engines on a second stage it would preform twice as effectively as the Kestrel but would have to be hypergolic instead of the RP-LOX that the Kestrel was.  In the end it is an interesting idea they could do.  As well as the fact it is designed to operate in Vacuum it makes some sense to use.  <br><br>The issue of reusing of the 1st stage of the F1 would be engine throttling.  Could the Merlin throttle far enough down is the question.  As the only source I seen is a 40% of the thrust which would be too high for a F1 to land on unless they do the landing burn very late to cut velocity from the free fall.  <br><br>The final item is the cost of the rocket launch.  It appears the latest numbers they put up was 11 million or about double the Electron for over twice the launch capacity.

From there the LK lander would fire it&#39;s engines and remove the last bit of velocity before landing. The rest of the mission was quite similar to Apollo. It used the lower portion of the spacecraft as a launch pad and went into orbit before preforming a rendezvous with the Soyuz-LOK.
