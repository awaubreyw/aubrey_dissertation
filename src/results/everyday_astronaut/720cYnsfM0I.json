Either that; or, if they are going to use just one engine, why don&#39;t they attach it at the center of SN5&#39;s base, the way the engine was attached on Star Hopper?  I suppose that would require some temporary modifications to make the attachment, but, it it seems doable.  For the hell of it; they could then detach that Raptor, and conduct two more 150 meter hops with two more Raptor engines so that if SN5 is viable, they can finish building it with engines that are evenly worn.<br><br>     Like I said; I have no doubt that they know what they&#39;re doing, so maybe I&#39;m making much Ado about nothing, but, for me, it would just feel right to know that SN5 would come off the assembly line, with any and all stress testing being more or less evenly distributed, so that, from stem to stern, SN5, is in tip-top shape.
