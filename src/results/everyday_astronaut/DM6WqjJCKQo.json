The reason that there is this separation, is due to both mass as this translates to size and weight as it relates to lateral momentum. Elon Musk is looking at this issue that if he test-flies this stainless steel model, a little, and is lucky enough to get it back on the ground without crashing, then he can go for the medium sized proposed Star Ship and that will get him to Mars. For one, its too heavy to use just aft end thrusters, to preform a tail stand upon landing. Because of the size of the second model up in size, more than likely there will have to be reaction control rocket thruster boxes at the top. Another issue that Musk does not understand, is the thermal protection layer or anti-heat prophylaxis. With the weight he&#39;s going to be incurring with stainless steel instead of aluminum nickel or other alloy metals, plus a dynamic heat protection exterior, he&#39;s going to be incurring penalties that he does not want. One has to look at the Star Ship as a fully packed vehicle, that is going to have cargo plus people. If one gets a lateral motion going to where weight is concerned, then just a moving tail rocket nozzle may not fill the bill. If you ask me&#39; this design is not workable for deep space travel.Lastly, because there is an alien pirate problem in this solar system, according to Patrick Huyghe&#39;s book, (The fieldguide to extraterrestials), don&#39;t name it Star Ship. Star Ship means that this spacecraft has a quantum stellar drive and bad sorts of aliens will jump the ship because of how expensive these drives are. Name it the Mars explorer or something. Elon Musk here, in my opinion is thinking with stubborn strong and cutting all good influences out of the picture. I want this said now, as in the future everyone will be looking at each other when his ship crashes asking, &quot; Well&#39; what went wrong&quot;?!
