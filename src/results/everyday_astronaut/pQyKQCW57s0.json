According to Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur_I\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur_I</a>  Minotaur I, the version shown in the video, has 4 solid propellant stages. Solid rocket propellants are preloaded during manufacturing, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s fuel up or boiling off associated with this type of launch vehicle. But I do believe the &quot;banana skin&quot; has something to do with temperature control or humidity control. If you can please verify I am correct or not, it will be greatly appreciated!

Same thing. RP-1 is a more highly refined form of petroleum than kerosene and eliminates many impurities like sulfur which would be bad for the engines. Both are basically diesel but higher grades. All of them are made from petroleum however the distillation temperature will yield diesel, kerosene, RP-1 or any number of products. <br>And the soot actually doesn&#39;t come from the exhaust plume of the engines. Those burn extremely clean. Because it&#39;s combusted at high pressures with pure oxygen there is almost no soot left, even if the engine runs fuel rich, most of that will burn up once it leaves the nozzle. You can observe this very well with the high speed footage of Saturn V. A black band of material exits the engines with a flame front climbing up towards the engines, never reaching them. <br><br>The soot comes from the gas generators that drives the turbopump. Here the combustion is extremely fuel rich and only partial leaving a lot of soot. It&#39;s the small flame vents next to the engine nozzles where a slow moving flame can be observed. It&#39;s easily observable on the BFR announcement where he stands in front of booster.  This is what provides the soot. If they where staged combustion kerosene engines like RD-180 there wouldn&#39;t be much soot. That&#39;s why BFR will be pretty shiny after reentry, no major soot because of different fuel, and staged combustion engines that will burn the bit of soot that methane could make.", "comment_date": "2018-10-30T17:19:24Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "I hate jumpscares", "comment_text": "I was searching this for so long", "comment_date": "2018-10-30T17:16:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "parthasarathy Venkatadri", "comment_text": "What causes this ...
