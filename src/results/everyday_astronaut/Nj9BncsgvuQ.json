Note how the acceleration went up to maybe 20G&#39;s when you did so in the video?  Probably not good for the rocket.<br><br><br>Then again, the actual force from the engines is the same here as at liftoff - the huge acceleration during boost back is just because the empty tank is so light.  It might work out that since the structure has to support the full tanks at the beginning, it&#39;s strong enough for 20G with an empty tank.

First off the resistivity of copper at -180C or roughly 90K is way different from at 300K around room temp so it seems like if you place those motors close enough to the liquid fuel that really allows you to make these motors so much more power dense. Cooling is not an issue and also you can spec the motor coils to use a high amount of turns because of the low resistivity at these frosty temperatures. I wonder if they use switched reluctance motors to get very high revs or they gear these. Very cool. I guess SpaceX isn&#39;t a fan of this approach because Musk would probably hate the thought of dumping the batteries overboard lol. The only motors that are close I can think of are AMK hub motors they also do around 40kW but are a little larger than a coke can.
