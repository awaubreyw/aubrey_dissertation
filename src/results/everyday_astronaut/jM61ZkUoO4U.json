Although the NSF camera did show a fire of some sort under the Starship after the Raptors had shut down, which is only just visible in your video.<br><br>I guess it can only be one of three things: concrete or whatever being blown off the surface, some part of the stand being destroyed, or some part of an engine or the skirt (or something mounted inside the skirt) being destroyed.  My gut feel is that it wasn&#39;t concrete, it just doesn&#39;t seem to behave the way I would expect concrete to, and I can&#39;t think of anything else on the surface that would disintegrate.  So that would leave something to do with the stand or rocket disintegrating (and continuing to burn briefly afterwards?).  I think it&#39;s unlikely to be part of an engine, given all the testing they&#39;ve had, and that we didn&#39;t see or hear anything that sugested engine problems.<br><br>Maybe it&#39;s just that three Raptors have never been fired together before and the combined blast/heat/turbulance is far more than was expected?  And the result was damage that hadn&#39;t been expected.  If this is the case, it could indicate that even the prototype Starships are going to need a &#39;proper&#39; launch pad (flame divertors, more effective damping, etc).  But it also demonstrates just how powerful these engine are and how difficult it&#39;s going to be to fire multiple Raptors together (and the Super Heavy booster is going to have a lot more than three!).  I&#39;ve always suspected that it&#39;s not going to be easy to test fire the SH boosters at Boca Chica (even with limited numbers of Raptors), and it&#39;s definitely not going to be possible to fly the SH booster (or perhaps even the Starship) to orbit from there.<br><br>Edit: looking at the comments, it seems this might have just been ONE Raptor.
