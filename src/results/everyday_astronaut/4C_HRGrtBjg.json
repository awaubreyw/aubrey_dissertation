First, thanks for what you do. I&#39;m 64, grew up reading Heinlein (and getting a first degree in engineering), bought a telescope with my newspaper delivery, and eagerly tracked the 1st moon landing (after my 7th grade). In those days, my pulse pounded. It&#39;s been doing it again, the last 5 years. And you have been a wonderful medium vectoring in the current excitement. Thanks!<br>2. Requests: Please check out Patrick Moore (Ecology Ph.D., co-founder of Greenpeace) and his presentations about the positive role of CO2 in the atmosphere, for plant growth and planet greening. Also Michael Crichton&#39;s very serious essay on this issue, at the end of his &quot;State of Fear&quot;. In it, he shows that an early-20th-century concern, regarding eugenics, had many brilliant people--critical thinkers, expert in other scientific areas--beguiled (in this blind spot) into counterproductive science, hurting instead of helping. He then shows discussion-dynamic parallels between that discussion and the current climate-change discussion. <br>3. In light of that, please reconsider your underlying assumption, indicated at 1hr18min of this upload. You mean well, but will atmospheric CO2 reduction actually hurt and brown the planet? Please research.
