Invented by Joel R. Ramirez. The drive system F.D.L. is a four part sycro-drive craft, all four crafts have to work in sequance. All four crafts are self-propelled. Three crafts are ring shaped, that are able to fold down to a smaller diameter and back to the lare diameter. These three ring crafts are electric coil-conventional rocket propelled. The forth craft is a mercuty engine elecric coriolis propelled craft. In perfect synco mesh drive the combination of effects creats faster than light speed drive system. The ring crafts have a set of coils. One coil is the slave to the second coil, a transister to ground is the initiation of the over amprage that sparcks via air gap to slave coil. This then starts a cascade of over arching magnetic flux. This flux is a magnetic worm hole effect, At the bottom of both coils is a set of capaciters. The slave coil capaciter bank is grounded to the master coils capaciter bank. External electric source starts the worm dirve system. The three ring grafts toloroide within and without each other. Around the center ring craft, as the folcrum. The mercury engine craft is at all times, located dead center of folcrum crafts, ring diameter. During the drive cycle. The folcrum craft, is constantly being replaced, by one of the crafts, to either side. Depending on direction of drive vector, forwards or backwars. The drive system is started by the last rig coils, as it thrusts through the magnetic arch of the next two coils. The rear craft starts with the off position, for the coils of craft. After passing the mercury engine craft, the coils are set on the on position. From a stand still, meaning in orbit. The mecury craft drive remains in, zero inertia forward mode. Untill rear rig craft is in forward position. The mercury craft then spools drive to forward inertia. The whole cycle is then free to continue. With the mercury craft as the control ship and velocity accelarater. The coil crafts are caught in the field of the mercury drive, via an inverted rail gun effect. From the mercury engines, ion fields toloroiding via the coriolis effect. Of mercury drive system. Yours Joel R.

Is it necessarry to always have the tanks filled up 100% ?<br>Is there some special double or triple check procedures ?<br>Did SpaceX had any recommendation from NASA in terms of procedures or did NASA comply with all SpaceX procedures ?<br>What makes up the decision to land the rocket on a droneship instead of a land pad ?<br>Does having astronauts inside add a lot of redondancy systems or does it work the same way it would with regular payload ?<br>Will Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy have hardware and-or software upgrades/updates or will it always be the same because it is working fine ?<br>How much does SpaceX pay attention to details in terms of esthetics ? What is the balance between esthetics and fonctionnality for all visible components ?", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T09:29:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "donald dlugos", "comment_text": "Coolness", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T06:00:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Kay Sr", "comment_text": "Wow that moment when Tim quickly spoke from heart the speed of ISS when obviously Elon was taking a second trying to remind him self from memory, <br><br>Elon Got to love this Guy.. <br>That&#39;s why he gives him access to high profile interview,(Heatleast understand what he is talking about,  unlike many mainstream media)  Proud of you Tim....", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T05:44:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "timid", "comment_text": "i appreciate how Elon puts his phone down and then comes over to the interview.", "comment_date": "2020-06-06T01:54:29Z", "likes_count": 142}, {"comment_by": "branden jones", "comment_text": "Nevermind lol i found it.

With having the anniversaries of the moon landing recently it was like December 2018 50th anniversary of the lunar orbit, then suddenly Apollo  9 and 10 then moon landing all with in 6 months of Apollo 8. That was some fast turn around time. The issue for NASA over the years has been cuts in federal funding along with heavy bureaucratic limits placed on them. With spaceX I feel because they don&#39;t have as much government oversight and they are able to recapture that pace that NASA was able to do back in the 60s. NASA had to take a lot of risks back then and it was amazing they got as far as they did so fast. This model is what SpaceX seems to be about.

That good luck charm never failed Gene.! C\u2019mon guys start some of your own traditions (yeah I get the irony of saying that while suggesting that they reenact some old NASA traditions)\u201dLifes\u2019 full of little ironies.\u201d<br><br>Somebody tell Bridenstein that it\u2019s really, really dumb to build the Lunar gateway in orbit around the moon they should build it along with 10 others in low earth orbitthat we\u2019ll eventually want around Titan, Ganymede,Mars etc..Economies of scale makes each one significantly cheaper, the station gets a full operational checkout in LEO WHERE ITS CHEAP&amp;EASY TO DO REPAIRS or MODIFICATIONs to all gateways plus workers take only a couple of hours to get \u201con-site rather than and a couple of hours back to earth in case of injury or illness rather than 3days each way to moon&amp; back all that time doing no work but using up oxygen &amp; food&amp; absorbing cosmic radiation, instead do the work under the protective shield of the earth\u2019s magnetosphere Then once the station is complete &amp; fully checked out stick it on the Interplanetary Transport Network for a very \u201clow energy delivery to its intended destination. Small chemical rockets to start it on its way with lowG acceleration &amp; several ion thrusters for fine tuning of trajectoriesat LaGrange points. Once the first 5-8 stations have been successfully delivered(proving safety) to their destinations, they could sell tickets for passengers to make that journey (6-10months of the greatest views in the solar system ( imagine the approach to Jupiter or Saturn or Mars. 50-100 people on a station built to provided R&amp;R FOR 10X THAT NUMBER WILL MAKE THE Station seem incredibly spacious they will certainly have rotation induced artificial gravity overstocked multimedia library&amp; huge fresh water pools with cosmic radiation refuges at their centers (water being one of the best radiation shielding materials, also providing huge fresh water emergency reservoirs. Also a small nuclear reactor on board or off-board would provide all the power that the station would ever need allowing unlimitedhot showers, jacuzzis, real water purification thru distillation, etc. All the luxury items that would be difficult or impossible to provide with just chemical or solar power the station would also leave earth orbit with all the fuel required for the first mission crew\u2019s rocket to return to earth carrying back the out-bound passengers on a \u201cfast return trajectory. Deep space Navigation is a serious issue to solve this problem one of SpaceX\u2019s first commercial missions should be to place a \u201choming beacon on the far side of the moon, exactly opposite the center of the earth this beacon combined with one on the ground would simply send out into space an omnidirectional radio signal \u201cbeep\u201d the advantage of putting it on the far side of the moon are numerous, first we have extremely accurate knowledge of exactly where the moon will be for any time over the next 500years or so, the fact that the moon is gravitationally \u201clocked to the earth, keeps that beacon in a fixed location with respect to the earth Right now Deep Space navigation is accomplished with complex signals sent from NASA\u2019s DSN transmitters at Golldstoone &amp; Spain &amp; Australia. With two of these beacons (one on the moon &amp; one on earth or In Geosynchronous orbit, any spaceship in our solar system could determine it position precisely using standard DTOA (DIfferential Time Of Arrival) calculations, simply by measuring the time delay between reception of the \u201cchirps from each beacon. But in order to do this you must know the precise locations of the signal transmitters, which is exactly why using the far side of the moon is so advantageous with just two transmitters the location accuracy would be precise out to about 2.6 million miles from earth (about 10x the 256,000 mile baseline from the surface of the earth to a receiver this range could be dramatically extended by using the earth sun L1 LaGrange point for one beacon or by placing an additional beacon  on a moon of Mars. Or even a long period asteroid with well established trajectories ( although asteroids can have their trajectories perturbed by close passes to planets or the sun or even to any one of the several  \u201cempty\u201d LaGrange points of each planet.  Such an unanticipated or unnoticed perturbation of an asteroid\u2019s trajectory would wreak havoc on the operation of the system  this system would provide precise navigation for any spaceships out to the orbit of the asteroid belt which should be sufficient for the next 200 years or so. Then we simply extend the range by adding additional beacons (further out in the solar system. (again on tidally locked moons are preferred locations).the main advantage of this system is that continuous navigation can be simply quickly &amp; easily &amp; accurately performed on any spaceship without having to transmit a signal back to earth as is now required. Or depending on the antennas on earth to send back your calculated location", "comment_date": "2020-05-30T06:51:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "CRP", "comment_text": "Elon is getting fat.

This was a Very good interview. I just wanted to say. Also, the adding of the lettering to the video screen shot or thumbnail helped me to glance up and write this. (I forgot jim bridenstine&#39;s name) infact, before this particular interview I had heard him speak before but never knew, caught, or remembered his name. Your architecture in both the video screenshot or thumbnail along with your guiding Elon with your own knowledge of the speed of the space station helped to bring to light his thoughts. Sometimes people need help articulated their thoughts and it helped him bring his analogy of twice the speed of a bullet. Sometimes it&#39;s better to help then to wait for the answer, it helps the interview move faster because we&#39;re all on a time limit. Best interview I&#39;ve seen with Elon so far because u leveled with him. Also, I would disregard down playing anything. Like sorry for the head set or downplaying your own thing.
