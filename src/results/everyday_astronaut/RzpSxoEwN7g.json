To me this is clearly far more complex, heavy, vulnerable to failure, subject to undesirable thermal and optical excursions and far more costly than a mostly continuous steel hull. <br><br>I understand the psycological and aesthetic reasons for real windows, but the engineering and economic tradeoffs would seem to argue for using some form of internal display (projetors, screens, head mounted displays, etc) in place of spaceworthy windows, to give passengers the impression of seeing outside without poking a giant hole in the hull to accomodate the large panoramic forward window panels. <br><br>In Mars transit, I believe there are technical means other than windows that could be devised to provide a sufficiently immersive experience to at least equal that of widows, while also using fewer, more modestly sized transparent windows for direct passive observation where necessary or desirable to minimize costs and risks while serving the needs of the passengers for a sense of connection to space. It is also true that such means could provide an immersive sense of connection to orher places as, such as locales on Earth or Mars or any place else with appropriately formatted video files. This would provide psycological benefits passive windows cannot.<br><br>In LEO and Lunar excursion modes perhaps there are compelling economic and aesthetic arguments enough to outweigh the risks and costs of traditional spaceworthy windows.<br><br> Anyway, I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on this.

The objective of this mission would be, of course, to pocket the money from the rocket launch and then dispose of the rocket. Only one thing would have to be changed and that is the altitude number to a stable one once &quot;orbit&quot; is reached (to hide loss of altitude due to falling). The booster would still end up in the ocean and, as you said, after a point in the mission the capsule is going fast enough that it will burn up on re-entry, destroying the evidence, without any further tampering.<br><br>Also, apart from a few managers, none of the employees of said company have to be complicit. In both cases the rocket is fully functional, constructed to the same specifications, and completes the same task. The only difference is that there is no rendezvous with the ISS and the payload just burns up prematurely during re-entry (since orbit is not possible).<br><br>I would be happy to hear your responses.
