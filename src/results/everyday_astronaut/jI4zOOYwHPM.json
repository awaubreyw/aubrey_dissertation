Yeah, your video is perhaps a little hokey, but very informative and I love the enthusiasm... One question though, for the cases where they currently cannot recover the Falcon 9 Lites; when they have such massive payloads, why don&#39;t they strap two or more Falcon 9s together and have them each land separately on Of Course\u00a0I Still Love You and Just Read the Instructions, and maybe even a third drone ship (which I&#39;ve named &quot;I Love You - I Know&quot;) sailing as a squadron? <br>And, are there plans to try to land the second stage?", "comment_date": "2017-05-02T21:15:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "foxtrot789", "comment_text": "What a massively unnecessary analogy.
