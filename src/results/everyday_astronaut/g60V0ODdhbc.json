Several wind farms have been installed in the last couple of decades which are helping with increased demand/unwanted immigration. <br>There is only one thermal (coal/gas) plant at Huntly, just south of Auckland, generating 15% of the total (apart from a couple of small diesel fired peak load plants. <br>There is no nuclear (NZ being nuclear free by law).<br>The largest hydro plant, Manapouri, near the bottom of the South Island, generates about 12% of the total but this is used to smelt bauxite (from Australia) into aluminum. Transmission of this power to other users is difficult due to its is distance from markets. <br>If more renewables (solar/wind) are added there is significant scope to convert existing hydro to pumped hydro for storage, especially when the whingers demand everyone drives EV&#39;s.", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T09:43:28Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Jay Stone", "comment_text": "Did they not recover the rocket or does Tim not cover that?", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T09:32:42Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Charlie Walker", "comment_text": "Nice!", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T09:20:51Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Shanmukh Sagi", "comment_text": "Cool", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T09:19:22Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "NeatoBurrito", "comment_text": "Launch at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g60V0ODdhbc&amp;t=55m42s\">55:42</a>", "comment_date": "2019-12-06T09:08:01Z", "likes_count": 75}, {"comment_by": "Main 1", "comment_text": "why was it launched from new zealand?
