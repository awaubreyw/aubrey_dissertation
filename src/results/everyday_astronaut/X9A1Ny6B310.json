This would allow him to get even heavier payloads into orbit, but I also think he might need to make an even bigger and newer BFS. This is because if he wants to bring a million people to Mars, he will need to transport more than the hundred or so the BFS is supposed to take in one go.

I had no idea that the actual expected lifetime of a Block 5 was fully 100 flights, merely being refurbished after every 10. I thought their full operational life was 10 flights, which would still be 9 more than any non Falcon rocket except the Space Shuttle, but 100, that&#39;s fantastic. You didn&#39;t really seem to address though, at least I did not understand, what the specific technical differences are between Block 5 and previous iterations that allow it to go 10 flights with only an inspection and not refurbishment. Is it just the improved heat shielding you mentioned? Perhaps you could treat that in more detail in another video.<br>Let me tell you, I have some technical expertise. I have degrees in Physics and Astrophysics and I used to work at JSC, helping develop Space Shuttle payloads, and monitoring them from Mission Control during flight. I think that your videos are outstanding. You do a very fine job of explaining very technical matters to the layman. Keep it up, and I hope Elon lets you come along and vlog from the BFS during the first mission to Mars.<br>This particular video I am going to bookmark, and instead of endlessly answering the same questions over and over again in comments sections about the differences between the blocks and why they&#39;re not landing them any more, I am just going to link to this.
