Perhaps you would like to ask about this in some future news conference?  My idea of what constitutes THE &quot;worst&quot; case scenario and THE &quot;most natural and authentic configuration&quot; is the following:<br><br>Have an in-flight abort test where the 1st stage engines are running at full throttle, at the velocity of the test that actually occurred, but where they are not shut down.  What happens is, a small explosive charge set just behind the capsule on the 2nd stage (which is fully loaded with fuel and oxidizer) goes off, triggering a second stage explosion.  It&#39;s at this point that the capsule attempts to escape the stack.  Also, the capsule has been kitted out with all the sensors exactly as in the test that was done but everything else about the capsule remains as it would be in normal mission to the ISS (sans people of course :-).  There would be no gutting/stripping of the interior of the capsule.  And for good measure they would have a normal 2nd stage with a functioning MVAC engine installed.<br><br>What say you about these ideas?  What I&#39;m trying to get at here is THE worst case scenario within THE most natural vehicle stack &amp; flight profile to the ISS, with the exception of test instrumentation, (and, of course, without people) that is possible.", "comment_date": "2020-01-21T08:36:51Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Leland Rogers", "comment_text": "Here&#39;s a question for you.

You guys have a nice setup now for covering launches like this.  I have two tips though:<br><br><br>1: With the joystick setup, try adding or increasing the deadzone for neutral position of the joystick.  This should help prevent the drift that was happening with the controls by removing any non-zero noise from them when not actually controling the scope mount.<br><br><br>2: look into getting a low reduction &quot;moon filter&quot; for the telescope.  They make ones that can fit over the appature of the scope, but one that can fit inline between the camera and the scope would effect the visual quality less and be easier to maintain.  A moon filter is just a neutral light lever filter that has no effect on colors.  this would make adjusting the cameras brightness a lot easier for you in the future.  Just make sure it is not a skyglow filter.", "comment_date": "2020-01-19T22:15:24Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Daniel Philipp", "comment_text": "Very very nice and Professional stream...but, and i&#39;m very sorry about that, the actual Launch &amp; Flight i watched on the SpaceX Livestream\ud83d\ude2c, i realy wantet to support you but they had the more current Information and the (again very sorry for saying that) better Footage.<br><br>But you had also a very very good set up and very great footage, the hole time bevore the SpaceX Stream startet i watched your Stream, as a sort of &quot;Pre Flight-preliminary report&quot;.

It goes against what Elon and others have said about the rocket blowing up anyways due to the aerodynamic forces, but I find that hard to believe from the footage. Either way, the first stage definitely blew up, but I think the second stage kept going, stayed in one piece, and was the same object that splashed into the ocean. It would explain why when it made impact, that there was a huge fireball, because the second stage was full of propellant. Again, I could be wrong, but it was definitely a site to see!
