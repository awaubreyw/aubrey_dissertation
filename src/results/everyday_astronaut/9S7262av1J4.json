Different battery chemistries can be discharged at different rates, but typically the highest achievable continuous rates for the high draw chemistries are about 30 &#39;C&#39;. That means a battery is depleted in 2 minutes (1 hour / &#39;C&#39; value of 30 = 2 mins). Trying to drive it harder than that will cause a voltage collapse, and damage the battery, possibly causing it to catch fire but definitely reducing the efficiency and not actually drawing any more power because the increase in current is offset by a decrease in voltage.<br><br><br>For example; Rocketlab do something like burn for 5 mins, don&#39;t they? (I don&#39;t know the specifics.) They could do that with a single battery with a 12C rating, but then they&#39;d be under-utilising the battery cells and carrying more weight for longer than they need to. They could run five batteries for one minute each, but then the C rate would be 60C and the cells voltage would collapse and the batteries would overheat without providing the necessary power. Instead, they use the happy medium; 5 battery packs, run off two of them for two minutes (running them at 30C, which the chemistry can handle and will deplete the cells in 2 mins), then dump the two depleted ones and use the remaining three for the rest of the burn (running those at 20C for the remaining three minutes of burn).<br><br><br>Source - Me, I am an automotive electrical engineer who designs battery systems for cars.", "comment_date": "2019-08-19T16:44:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roller Fritze", "comment_text": "&quot;Look Ma, No Hands&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-08-19T16:32:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Julian R", "comment_text": "Rocket: Dumps tons of nasty lithium polymer batteries into the atmosphere/sea<br><br><br>Tim: Thats soo cool!", "comment_date": "2019-08-19T16:31:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Don Jones", "comment_text": "They&#39;re running out of money for good CGI?
