Problem is though: If you set them of a bit to north or south at some point they will cross the equator go up the same distance to the north - basically crossing the path were you aligned all the other geostationary satellites. Same if you stack them in different heights: Since you want an orbit to take 24 hours, you might go lower on one side of the orbit, but you have to go higher than geostationary on the other side.<br>You could work around this probably by setting apogee and perigee at above the equator (in essence crossing the equatorial plane at a &quot;distance&quot; to geostationary orbit) and do cross the geostationary distance &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; the equator. But this will probably have it&#39;s limits, since the position of the satellite will slightly deviate.<br>But well... with carefull planning you might even stack more satellites in the near geostationary zone than one could expect. You are only limited by some positional mismatch, due to the elliptical orbit (in essence making the satellite move right and left as seen from the ground) and tilting your orbit a bit (making the sattelite move up and down as seen from ground).", "comment_date": "2018-03-06T19:55:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Conor Glynn", "comment_text": "Question; So with this landing scrubbed due to sea conditions, would it be feasible/possible to set up a landing pad across the Atlantic 3000/4000 miles away?
