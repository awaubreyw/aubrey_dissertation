Internal combustion engines recirculate exhaust gas into the fuel mix to lower combustion temperatures.  The exhaust gas is neutral to the mix, but adds volume, which cools the combustion temp by 500 degrees F, so I was wondering if Firefly could be introducing liquid nitrogen into the main burn mix to keep from melting down the pump.

We\u2019ve lied, we\u2019ve stolen, we\u2019ve sinned sexually, and we\u2019ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .<br><br>The problem is, we can never \u2018outweigh\u2019 our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .<br><br>Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake . <br>Right before he died, he said \u2018it is finished\u2019 .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God\u2019s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..<br><br>Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ; <br><br>Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) . <br><br>Do this, and you will be saved .<br><br>If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn\u2019t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .<br><br>You\u2019ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .<br><br>Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn\u2019t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );<br><br>\u2018It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT\u2019 .", "comment_date": "2021-09-04T02:59:09Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Bejkon", "comment_text": "You should stick to what you do..

I saw what I thought (hoped) might be some sort of flexible or purposely articulating skirting. But maybe it was not intended to be flexible but indicated a partial structural failure of the Engine Bay, which would have predictably got worse around Max Q, and potentially compromised a fuel cell at some point. If this was structural, that is a huge problem with the design, not insurmountable, but it means they need to go thicker, or with more re-enforcement, which means more weight and less payload. Carbon Fiber is the Gold Standard of lightness and strength when it is enough, but when it is not, it can fail spectacularly. I do believe based on what I have seen that this was a structural failure, and not a rocket engine or fueling failure. Unless it can be explained, there was movement of the geometry of the bottom end of the hull. A tear or weak point?
