Please explain.<br><br>You replied:     <br> <br> Everyday Astronaut <br>Everyday Astronaut1 day ago<br>No, you\u2019re seeing stage twos speed. Stage one slows down until it hits apogee, then speeds back up to about 1,700 m/s and falls back and they put the drone ship about where that parabolic arc is.<br>     <br>I replied:<br><br>But you said at stage sep the rocket is going way more east than upwards (obvious from visuals and telemetry). So it&#39;s going to go faaar eastward and away from the ship, under no real control of trajectory (fins useless in vacuum and the thrusters only affect attitude).<br><br> And how do they figure for the various wind layers (some reach 200 mph and are unpredictable). The fins have no control in a vacuum and the thrusters have none (not enough) in the atmosphere so - even assuming you somehow home in on the ship (impossible anyway) - for the last 1,000 or so feet, the engine gimbal is the only control. and the gimbal cannot adjust attitude without screwing up trajectory; so the last 1,000 feet cannot be under real control. Your scene with the broom actually shows this. <br><br>Also, the thrusters are for attitude control not heading. Since there is no airfoil surface on stage 1 there cannot be lift, which you need to properly &#39;steer&#39;, especially from 70 miles up with all the chaos theory elements between sep and landing (the fins are for attitude control).

How?)  The booster is still moving upwards rather quickly so it&#39;s total velocity isn&#39;t quite negated. Also, since it&#39;s nearly empty and doesn&#39;t have the second stage and payload on top, the boost back burn is much shorter and easier.
