He has talked about it so much in the past and I would love your expert opinion on the concept. In essence he has revealed a lot of details, hopefully enough for you to make a 3D rendering of what it would look like. It&#39;s a VTOL with two kinds of engines. One for take of and one for propulsion high up in the stratosphere (or however high you need to go to limit drag but still have enough air density for pushing). It wouldn&#39;t have wings and also the take of engines  can gimble. He also mentioned the battery density that is needed somewhere. He sees this as a viable alternative to conventional airplanes so it&#39;s going to be big. Please render it  somehow, I don&#39;t have the knowledge or contacts to do this on my own.
