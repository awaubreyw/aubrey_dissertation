Could ISS astronauts EVA and manually grab? If so - then what? Can astronauts inside Dragon do anything? There are multitudes of questions surrounding these scenarios but you get the idea.

You need to acknowledge this is supposed to start from Mars, there will be no ramp, it will probably start from its legs standing on rocky ground. And Mars launch is another thing, I&#39;d like to see how it will work. If there will be some habitat, how far it will need to be from Starship. I think I heard exclusion zone for Earth is supposed to be 30 km. How are they suppose to install pipes in order to fill it in with propelant if it will be produced by some previously delivered equipment. At this point I think most of ground equipment for Mars will need to be mobile.", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T21:16:46Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Panthera", "comment_text": "So when are u going up in Space man??<br>Can&#39;t wait to seen that smile one day :D", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T21:13:07Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Joy L", "comment_text": "I love spaceflight because indeed it is pushing the limits of what is technologically achievable and manned spaceflight means going to the most hazardous environment possible and doing science there.
