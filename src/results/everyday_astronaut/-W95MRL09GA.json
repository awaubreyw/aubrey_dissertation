And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T06:55:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Connor Jaymes", "comment_text": "Merlyte", "comment_date": "2020-11-25T00:33:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kamila Gad", "comment_text": "18 MINUTES", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T23:13:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Steven Stritenberger", "comment_text": "Go research the wind turbines that are now falling apart from wear, the fact that producing them is more expensive than the energy they can produce or that they use thousands of gallons of lubricating oil.

Since the funding and premise of the company SpaceX Existence is overly based on tax money. The only reason you can&#39;t call it Socialism 100% is the fact that SpaceX does not have any shares owned by the US Government. Secondly when you look at how SpaceX is developing its closer to that of the Soviet Programme, rather than the NASA programmes of the past. That Capitalism Made Elon is eh... a bit of a stretch, however, I doubt any other country in the world would have had the means and motive to have produced a pendant to SpaceX. But SpaceX is not in particular a product of &quot;capitalism&quot;. The misconception often is that Socialism and Communism is the same, which is a falselet, Socialism actually predates Communism, but was indeed the main inspiration for Karl Marx. Its a shame that Socialism is often branded as Communism, because they are most deffinitely not the same, and only causes misinformed discussions and divide.
