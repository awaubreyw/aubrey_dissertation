It will be hot enough to burn your hand, though. I worked in the satellite industry, and observed temperature telemetry from orbiting spacecraft. An unprotected part of the spacecraft when lit by the sun would rapidly reach temperatures of about 250-350 deg C. When the spacecraft went into earth&#39;s shadow, the temperature rapidly dropped, and within 30 minutes was -200 deg C. That is what is probably happening with the Tesla in space.

Only works for high temp conducting materials, and all materials don&#39;t radiate out their temperature the same! That&#39;s why the black paint on the radiator on the back of a fridge is not the same as the black paint on the collector tubings of a thermal solar panel. <br>On the ground, convection is the greatest source of heat dissipation, and so removing it means higher temperature with the same radiative exposure. Plastics should actually soften on the roadster because of that, but without gravity they keep their shape.<br>Also the rocket is slowly rotating on itself to mitigate the overheating of the sun-exposed surfaces, not specially for the roadster, but for the remaining fuel !", "comment_date": "2018-06-05T22:56:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Call of the Road", "comment_text": "you ride motorcycles?!

While you found out the hard way about the security they practice today, it has not always been that tight. One way to get on the base, and see the SpaceX launch site is rather easy and does involve a partially electric propulsion system. I am talking about Amtrak and the three publicly available Diesel/electric propelled trains a day each way that make their way right through the Base.  The Amtrak California Surfliners are the easiest to use and make a stop at a public beach in the middle of the sprawling  base. I have taken photographs from the train many times, and even been able to ride a bicycle through it during a special occasion when the Solvang Century ride was allowed to pass through.<br> That was long ago, and perhaps the present administration has forced such liberties on the part of the Base Commanders to be curtailed. I am old enough, though, to remember when the Soviet Premier Krushchev  visited the United States and California during the Eisenhower administration. He was  not allowed to visit the newly established Disneyland, remarking: &quot;What have they got there, a missile base?&quot;  But the newspapers made a big deal about his plans to take the Southern Pacific Daylight train up the coast to San Francisco. That was because in those days  we were in the middle of a race to build intercontinental Ballistic Missiles and some of our Atlas Missiles, allegedly aimed at Moscow, would be visible to him as the train did pass right through the base where they were test launched. Next time you choose to visit California you might try the train. Little known is that there are several artifacts still there from the time that the Space Shuttle was expected to fly from Vandenberg as well as from Florida. Only a few runways in the world are long enough to accommodate the Shuttle, and Vandenberg has one of them, visible from that train.", "comment_date": "2018-06-05T02:42:47Z", "likes_count": 13}, {"comment_by": "TheRedstoneHive", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tAqwl0V-gw&amp;t=6m33s\">6:33</a> Oh hahahaa that was so funny!

I&#39;m bad this way.)  The &quot;real&quot; reason that the idiot conspiracy theorists think the entire car should have melted like one of Dali&#39;s clocks isn&#39;t the heat of the sun as such.  It&#39;s the thermosphere.  For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, the thermosphere is the portion of earth&#39;s atmosphere that starts roughly at the border of space and goes up a few thousand miles.  (I don&#39;t remember what&#39;s quoted as the exact boundaries, but it&#39;s easy to look up.)  The atoms of the very thin atmosphere in this s area are accelerated to huge speeds by solar radiation.  This means that by the definition of temperature (mean kinetic energy), this area is very, VERY hot.  Easily hot enough to melt whatever the CTers say should melt.  EXCEPT.  Temperature is not the same thing as heat.  Heat -- the energy that makes things hot -- is transferred in three ways.  Radiation (direct from the sun, which at earth&#39;s radius is only enough to heat objects to a bit less than the earth&#39;s own mean temperature.  Let&#39;s say 0 degrees Celsius ballpark.)  Convection (mixing of mediums, not a factor here) and conduction (direct transfer of energy from one atom to another).  It&#39;s this last one that the CTers don&#39;t want to understand.  There are simply not enough of these fast-moving atoms around to transfer meaningful amounts of heat to anything.  To use a metaphor -- it&#39;s the difference between what happens to you if someone flings a drop of water at you once or twice a day, vs what would happen to you if the contents of a small lake got dumped on you all at once.
