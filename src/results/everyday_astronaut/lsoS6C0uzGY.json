Maybe - and I am speculating -  a leakage in cooling system (is it methane cooled?) and Raptor began to self-destruct or somewhere in the region of the  preburner/turbopump so that there was a power loss and a LOX underfeeding. This would explain the yellow plume and perhaps a little faster than expected landing (see Hoppers crushed feet). But nevertheless great success.<br><br><br>Or it was just the dust...when Hopper was approaching the ground the orange/yellow(ish) bright flame went from the bottom upwards.
