I have been watch the NASA launches for years and been a Space X fan for the past few years. I think Mr. Musk is a GENIUS and I cannot wish him more success. I enjoyed immensely you as a host because I can see in you the excitement I feel each and every time I see a launch. Watching the Space X 1st stage landing attempts was edge of my set excitement and OMG when the finally landed a first stage I think my smile went from ear to ear all day. I could not cheer enough. I was jumping up and  down so much that my wife had to come and see what was going on. I enjoy the way you host and educate us along the way. The animated&quot;redo&quot; of the launch was a lot of fun to watch and very interesting. Please do keep up the good work, I will be coming along for the ride. If you start a Space Corps of followers, I will be first on board.

Imagine if the rockets were cinematic cameras.  They have a Body with a multitude of accessories that  are intended for you to get the best shot for the shot you wish to achieve.   So TI is heaver than AL but TI can take more heat and stress than AL.   SO on some flights it&#39;s more cost effective to use AL and some you have no choice but to use TI.  It&#39;s all about incremental price savings.   Example,  for every second (S) that the nose cone is on the top of the rocket it cost you $Z in fuel so the sooner you can eject the cone you would save ($Z)(S) so each small savings in weight/time starts to add up to huge savings.", "comment_date": "2017-10-31T21:17:22Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Klaus Gartenstiel", "comment_text": "he&#39;s not superman. he&#39;s wearing glasses!", "comment_date": "2017-10-31T18:09:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sandeep PS", "comment_text": "which mods did you use for this ??", "comment_date": "2017-10-31T15:59:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MajSolo", "comment_text": "Sometimes they have a good view and can film the first stage high up there.<br>Have you noticed how fast the plumes from the cold thrusters expand?!?<br>Pretty awesome.
