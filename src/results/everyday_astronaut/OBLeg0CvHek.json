Wow - Deja vu all over again - 40+ years later<br><br>I grew up in South Florida in the sixties and began watching live Saturn V launches as soon as I could con my Dad in onto driving up from Fort Lauderdale to watch one of the early Apollo launches (Apollo 9 or 10, I think). Later, when I got my driver\u2019s license, I caught as many launches as I could. Titusville, just three hours away from home and eleven miles west of the launch site, turned out to be the perfect spot for watching launches. Even at eleven miles away, the sight and sound of a live Saturn launch was far beyond anything I had seen on TV. I was addicted. I drove up to watch several Apollo launches including the night launch of Apollo 17, the Skylab launch, and the Apollo-Soyuz launch. I was lucky enough to be at the turning basin press site for the last ever Saturn V launch (Skylab) - where you will be. If this is your first time watching a launch of this magnitude from three miles away, you will be in for a treat. NOTHING and I mean nothing can prepare you for the feeling - not just the sound - but the visceral gut rumbling feeling of those engines. Yes forget the camera. All of my pictures were pretty crappy, but sensory experience is still fondly burned into my memory.<br><br>Sadly I have never been to a live watch since, but I still get goose bumps watching launches on YouTube, but now I get watch F9 landings as well. The double sonic booms that arrive at touch down should be awesome in person. Maybe getting there hours ahead of time is OK, but back in the day getting there days ahead of time was often required :-) .<br><br>Thank you for the great job you do covering SpaceX and other topics. I applaud your ability to do it full time. I envy you. Then again you have mad    presentation skills!<br><br>I have included three of my blog posts below that might be of interest to anyone else reading this. My firsthand accounts of being there. I make no money from this site and I pay to keep it advertisement free so I have no ulterior motives in posting the links other than additional info.<br><br>Enjoy the launch!!!!<br><br><a href=\"https://contrafactual.com/2013/07/20/apollo-11-main-engines-found/\">https://contrafactual.com/2013/07/20/apollo-11-main-engines-found/</a><br><br><a href=\"https://contrafactual.com/2017/02/19/a-blast-off-from-my-past/\">https://contrafactual.com/2017/02/19/a-blast-off-from-my-past/</a>", "comment_date": "2018-02-03T07:23:10Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "XPJV", "comment_text": "During the launch stay away from Bermuda triangle area...

Sorry I can&#39;t not remember the ship and crew details at this moment.  I drove down from Plymouth, MI to my freind&#39;s place just north of Daytona Beach, Florida.  We then headed down to Titusville, FL the night and blindly found a place to camp out.  Well sleeping in the car.  It was near food and facilities, and a mall with a Sears store.  Found out it was 12 miles away from the launch pad with the most visible thing being the Vehicle Assembly Building.  Yes, it was part of a social thing as we joined others and saw others join us with their own stake out.  Free parking.  It was scheduled for an early morning launch.  However as launch time got close, their was a scrub for a number of hours.  Monitored the progress as a local FM station was simulcasting the NASA audio.  But the delay gave us a break  to get good food and see a movie.  Finally the launch came.  The flame is more than any camera due justice to.  I did bring a VHS video camera and only looked over the top of it to aim...no looking thru the viewfinder.  At that distance the ship rises in silence until about 60 seconds later as you feel and hear first the low rumble, then the roar of the launch.  What an experience!!  <br>On another launch viewing I was patient enough and the sky was clear enough that we followed the flame until Main Engine Cut Off as it was called on NASA radio.", "comment_date": "2018-02-02T22:40:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "EricIrl", "comment_text": "Great gen - as we say in the UK.
