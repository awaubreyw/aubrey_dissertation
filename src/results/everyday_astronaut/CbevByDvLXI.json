And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T06:28:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jacob Wiens", "comment_text": "Can you make an updated version with the current design?", "comment_date": "2020-11-13T22:07:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ben MG Scully", "comment_text": "Anyone else notice the dub at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbevByDvLXI&amp;t=6m50s\">6:50</a>?", "comment_date": "2020-11-09T21:39:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Croom", "comment_text": "I never noticed that you had two different colored eyes.(Tim Dood The Everyday Astronaut)", "comment_date": "2020-10-24T04:59:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "kushagra singh", "comment_text": "The first bfr is best and beast", "comment_date": "2020-10-19T03:24:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "not me", "comment_text": "Hey the first bfr is better", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T12:34:22Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "alvin ngure", "comment_text": "So imma need that skin/cover you got going on there mate!", "comment_date": "2020-10-11T17:26:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sirofilm", "comment_text": "When a Millionaire too much play KSP.", "comment_date": "2020-10-06T02:54:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hilbert Manalo", "comment_text": "Hey, Tim you kept calling the BFR the BFS", "comment_date": "2020-09-30T18:09:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chris Brewer", "comment_text": "Nobody calls it bfr BFS everybody calls a SNS", "comment_date": "2020-09-26T02:40:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Scuffed dog", "comment_text": "Fun fact: bfr is a space shuttle on steroids", "comment_date": "2020-09-20T18:36:10Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "rockminelaw 123", "comment_text": "Just take 220 children on the bfs genius", "comment_date": "2020-09-16T23:10:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jack MeHoffe", "comment_text": "That eye joke was hilarious, major props for that.

Consider that astronauts  efficiency and performance might be affected in Mars as a result of such long trip short wave length exposure and we don&#39;t know potential outcomes .Once there underground structures, caves or new technological advances could solve such situation permanently. Those compartments once occupied by rocks and sand bags inside would have the other habitable space structures within space ship above them. If installed before they would add weight and cost during lift off. If lifted in a compartment closed to tanker surface during refueling through pressurized hatch openings giving access to both tanker and habitable space ship inside once in orbit protecting material could be transfer manually and put inside the wall empty compartments of habitable space ship.

Since SpaceX does not have the resources to develop a cleansheet super-heavy rocket right now (Falcon Heavy was completely derived from Falcon 9 hardware), they have to pitch a bunch of concepts in the meantime to keep the headlines and online discussions going.<br><br>Graphics and animated concept videos are cheap and can be turned around quickly. Flight prototypes are not. So we&#39;re seeing a new concept each year until SpaceX finally arrives at what their investors will agree to fund.<br><br>The ITS concept was created to sell the vision of Mars settlement. The 2017 BFR was sized to an Airbus A380 cabin and used to sell the idea of rockets replacing airplanes. When it became clear to everyone that neither scenario was actually going to happen in the next 10 years, Elon pivoted to lunar tourism. It had plenty of potential customers since the 2017 announcement and had reasonable life support requirements comparable to Dragon&#39;s.<br><br>And because this version of BFR needed to be sized for TLI, not LEO, like the P2P transport BFR, it needed to be stretched. More fuel for the first stage (which would be expended) and for the second stage to enable TLI and fuel margins for propulsive landing. The tanker was thrown out completely for lunar tourism, as SpaceX has no on-orbit refueling experience and refueling would be a major inconvenience to the passengers.<br><br>Everyone asking about funding was raising an important point, though. This can&#39;t happen without billions of dollars in support, and even in a best-case engineering lifecycle, development timelines are tied to annual funding. So by asking about funding, press members were asking how seriously they should take THIS proposal compared to the previous two.<br><br>Personally, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if SpaceX needs to scale BFR down even more to something that would directly replace the Falcon rockets. Elon didn&#39;t seem so confident that investors would buy his &quot;cheaper than a Falcon 1&quot; argument from the 2017 talk. <br><br>It&#39;s just more cost-effective (and more environmentally sustainable) for SpaceX to build a fully reusable vehicle that would compete directly with New Glenn. And its payload to LEO would be comparable to Falcon Heavy&#39;s expendable load, making it sufficient for launching StarLink.<br><br>But Elon can&#39;t announce that yet because it&#39;s not as exciting or headline-grabbing as a Saturn V-class reusable rocket. So he can&#39;t publicly concede to building a slightly smaller Falcon-sized vehicle until competition with Blue Origin pressures them to do otherwise. That&#39;s another reason the development timeframes announced are so optimistic. If BFR can&#39;t be finished by 2025, competition with New Glenn would force SpaceX to delay it in favor of a smaller fully-reusable vehicle.<br><br>But the point is, it&#39;s still VERY early in BFR&#39;s development cycle, and they&#39;re still a ways from having a PDR at this point. So in the meantime, they can experiment with various concepts and stay in the news that way. But until they announce a configuration freeze, there&#39;s no reason to expect a Grasshopper version of BFS to launch fewer than 2 years from now.<br><br>The recent pivot to a Falcon-sized BFS for orbit reentry flights hints that the real thing will be sized to replace Falcon 9 and some FH launches. Not to launch 150 tonnes to LEO.<br><br>That&#39;s just my two cents as an aerospace engineer, though. :)", "comment_date": "2018-12-10T01:27:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maris Tammik", "comment_text": "If you were to do an interview, would you be equipped to ask about labour rights?", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T23:36:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Oli Olkwest", "comment_text": "What about ARIANE ??", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T20:12:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chiara Willimann", "comment_text": "And the 2019 BFR?", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T16:53:31Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Chiara Willimann", "comment_text": "Elon Musk is so cool!<br><br>Greetings from Switzerland!", "comment_date": "2018-12-09T16:48:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "taiming71", "comment_text": "Space X should just build the Sea Dragon.

Apollo did the same thing when coming in at 24, 000 miles an hour,   they used thrusters to change the angle the capsule engaged the atmosphere,  at times actually ascending during re entry.. apollo had the advantage of a blunt shape, shock wave that protected the vehicle, but she still got mad hot..<br>   Space X is using this method to the nth degree,  and since the vehicle is huge, and not as robust as apollo,  those wings will slow the craft even further ,  providing for a gentler re entry ... the  trick will be how they manage energy and heat around the Karman line,  and keep it within limits.. It&#39;s like skipping a stone on sand paper,  until the stone finally slows down to a manageable speed..  The Germans planned a space plane that skipped along the atmosphere after being launched by a bunch of V2 boosters,,<br> drop bombs on New York,  and skip it&#39;s way back across the atmosphere around the world back to Germany.. all in like 2hrs..  <br>   It was the theoretical work from this program that allowed Nasa to use the same method to get around the high approach speed of lunar trajectories without having to use huge retro rockets to slow it down on approach to earth.. kind of surfed the atmosphere and used it as an aerodynamic brake.. Space X is suing the same method, but to a much greater degree, and with much tighter tolerances as the BFR is less tolerant of heat and friction,  probably less so than the space shuttle.. so it will need a gentler , cooler approach.. <br>    The theory for this was already done in the 60&#39;s with the x15 program ,and &quot;Dynasoar&quot;, where aircraft with no heat proofing tiles etc , managed to re enter the atmosphere after crossing the Karman line, all be it at much much lower speeds.. with the Advent of Pica, carbon fiber,  titanium alloys, and nomex linings, and very very fast processors that can keep the vehicle on it&#39;s intended path , and manipulate those wings precisely and fast enough to maintain the correct attitudes ( a minor mistake at these speeds, even 10th&#39;s of a degree error will result in disaster).. the vehicle will either g out, and come apart, or skip off the atmosphere so hard it flies back into space .. having no fuel to re enter again.. just like Apollo.. though Apollo had a far greater margin for error as it was blunt and tough..  no protective shockwave for BFR,  no ablative heat shield.. too much weight to make the vehicle viable.. this is going to be a dance with the Devil at the edge of the atmosphere.. with no room for error, very very difficult..very very cool..amazing tech..   good on Space X for tackling it.. the iterations we see in the design must be the result of Space X coming to conclusions about the viability of the size of the vehicle, and how much surface area is needed on those wings and provide a margin of safety.. the earlier lifting body type shapes we saw in 2016, 2017, may not have been proven or didn&#39;t stand up to tests in simulation.. I&#39;m guessing the BFR shapes didn&#39;t provide enough control in certain critical phases of the decent, or added a lot of thrusters and complexity to the vehicle.. so they decided to go with larger wings.. plenty of fluid dynamic data available from the shuttle,  it&#39;s proven and it works.. lifting body ?  don&#39;t know of anybody that&#39;s ever done a re entry from orbit with one.. un charted territory,  and space x would have to do all the R n D , build and test scale models ,  then hope it works and a bloody huge vehicle.. so we see it looking more like the shuttle.. <br>     I would love to know how this thing will manage heat,  and how robust the airframe is , and how they get around issues of weight and complexity.. what it can bring to orbit is all well and good.. how it gets back..now that&#39;s interesting.. if Every Day could do a video on how the BFR will perform on re entry, and maybe his thoughts on the BFR&#39;s  design .. that would be awesome..", "comment_date": "2018-12-06T23:52:16Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Mert Ozener", "comment_text": "Air frame commonality.

So like in the film &quot;the Martian&quot; they had that massive spaceship that the astronauts lived in until they arrived in mars, that&#39;s another thing Elon Musk has to worry about &quot;Gravity&quot;. it will be a lot easer to build a missive vessel that can hold enough people, food and fuel for the journey back and forth and extra fuel for the &quot;mini&quot; rocket to land on mars and get back to the spaceship. And what Elon musk should do to is hire a massive bunch of scientist and all the other people that will be important to the mission and get half the crew to study on mars the Mars&#39;s surface while the other half study the mars weather changes and patterns to warn the colonists when dangerous storms threaten the mission. I feel as Elon Musk is not ready to endure such a huge ambition coz u need to think of COST, WHAT TYPE of people will go, HOW LONG do you want to spend on mars and WHY do u want to go there in the first place when everyone knows mars is a hostile planet and WHAT is there to mine? there are hundreds of questions to ask but in MY opinion these are the most important questions people need to figure out when going to mars. <br> Thank You for those who have had the time to read my comment.", "comment_date": "2018-11-04T02:01:54Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "Ace Liu", "comment_text": "Why dont you get more subs?

Because they are not allowed! If you know what gravity is, you can theories a simple gravitic propulsion system and build a spaceship! <br><br>So, we know space, or space-time has density, as in gravity waves... and we know everything that is made of Matter creates gravity - so, and this is so simple it is laughable, but if Matter is E=MC2 - as in Matter IS Energy, and Matter and Energy create Gravity - what is Matter/Energy? <br><br>Matter/Energy is ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY/RADIATION! ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION CREATES GRAVITY! <br><br>How do you build a spaceship? WITH ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY! As in the EM Drive, as in THE ElectroMagnetic DRIVE! <br><br>What is the frequency that creates a gravitic field? its 33 Killahertz, this frequency is designated or &quot;Allocated&quot; as Government Only Frequency Range, and is not allowed to be used by the public or private sector! <br><br>So the question then becomes, how do you build a spaceship with ElectroMagnetic Fields? <br><br>Take a large Shipping Container, if you skin the container in &quot;Microwave Emitters&quot; or &quot;Magnetrons&quot; and you turn on the Emitters on the top of the Container, you will create a gravitic field above the container, and just like a bubble of air rising in water, the container will &quot;fall upwards&quot; <br><br>If you open the emitters on the top of the container, and on the front of the container, you will elevate and move forward<br><br>Now, if you open the emitters around the entire container, you will create a &quot;field frequency array&quot; or a &quot;Thin Shell&quot; around the container and you will be able to change the containers mass, and you can move the container very fast - because the container is creating an EM Field around itself, it is pushing away &quot;space-time&quot; and it is creating a &quot;thin shell&quot; around itself, where the limitations of the speed of light and local entanglement are reduced or removed, and if you apply enough energy to the front of the container, you can make that container move very very fast, even in an atmosphere, you can move faster that the speed of light!<br><br>And that is the easiest way to build a spaceship! But be warned, the government uses all Smoke Detectors, Computer Hardware, Cell Phones, TVs, Tablets, Monitors, Cell Phone Towers and other receivers and satellites to spy on everyone, virtually everywhere, and because Smoke Detectors both Broadcast and Receive Unique Microwave Frequencies, they can detect any unauthorized EM Signals, as well as triangulate their signals and create a &quot;virtual camera&quot; using the &quot;microwaves&quot; and the all seeing eye is real! Google NSA Smoke Detector Spy Net, and realize the reason the Government is spying on everyone is because they want complete and total control of everything, and should you build a free energy device, space travel, or EM travel that would make oil practically obsolete... you get the idea - you are all farm animals in the eyes of the wicked, and they cant have you fly the coup now can they! <br><br>This is a video of how these craft actually work! - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzY06MRzwPE\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzY06MRzwPE</a>", "comment_date": "2018-10-08T03:57:02Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Alby", "comment_text": "I think the 2016 ITS looks the coolest; it&#39;s got this weird sci-fi aesthetic.", "comment_date": "2018-10-08T03:18:01Z", "likes_count": 111}, {"comment_by": "Jasper Pendlebury", "comment_text": "what happened to butt-to-butt refueling?", "comment_date": "2018-10-08T03:17:37Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ronin", "comment_text": "Me in the bathroom after eating a nice healthy portion of Taco Bell is probably no less than 9000 BAR", "comment_date": "2018-10-08T02:58:26Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "T S Mcraedy", "comment_text": "It&#39;s simple they keep changing it because they don&#39;t know how to do it without killing a bunch of people.", "comment_date": "2018-10-07T18:51:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ted Parf", "comment_text": "Wasn\u2019t the 100 tons to Mars?

This question is related to a constraint from legacy rocket development.  Curious Droid (see link below) makes the case that &#39;aerospike&#39; engines would propel stuff (or people) to space more efficiently than the &#39;bell&#39; engine design we use.  He says, believably, that we aren&#39;t using the &#39;aerospike&#39; design because of development, or &quot;start-up,&quot; costs.  In other words (my words) we can spend $1 today and launch future missions for $20 each with &#39;bell&#39; engines or spend $5 today (developing aerospike) and launch future missions for $19.  <br><br>A better way of expressing the trade off is that spending $5 today on developing the new engine would allow more efficient engines to haul bigger payloads.  I think this is a better way to put it because saving fuel doesn&#39;t save as much as being able to launch the same size (recoverable) rocket with greater power.<br><br>I made up the numbers for &#39;start up,&#39; and &#39;trade off&#39; costs.

A few interesting things:<br><br>- Elon mentioned that the AFT cargo bays can be switched for vacuum engines. This means that SpaceX can focus on streamlining the BFR without having to design it from scratch later. Vacuum engines are good for increasing mass to orbit, so they probably figured out that 100 tons are good enough at first. When the vacuum engines are switched in, we will see far more than a &quot;mere&quot; 100 ton LEO launch capability.<br><br>- The AFT cargo bays are great for storing Starlink satellites. This means that SpaceX can run launches for customers while sending their own satellites up AT THE SAME TIME! Again, they probably don&#39;t need vacuum engines to do this, so it&#39;s a really clever solution.<br><br>- Considering the points above, we will probably see two (or more?) versions of BFR in the future: A version with sea level engines only and a vacuum version. The sea level version will be great for Starlink/light duty delivery and personnel delivery/tourism; especially point-to-point flights on Earth. The main BFS could carry passengers, while AFT cargo could carry trade-goods. The vacuum version will be great for heavy duty hauls (like new space stations) and long hauls to other places in the solar system.", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T16:19:49Z", "likes_count": 39}, {"comment_by": "PAL9000", "comment_text": "Thanks Tim, that was a brilliant !

Being able to angle up and down those wings is a totally new problem, the forces on those wings is insane (I think elon admitted it would be in the meganewtons) and that means an actuator that can fight that.<br><br>One simpler solution would be to just land horizontal with horizontal engines, but that requires new engines that only function for landing and are dead weight the rest of the time.", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T14:36:53Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "noble steed", "comment_text": "100T to LEO was in fully expendable, not fully reusable mode.", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T14:35:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "DIREFUL KN1F3", "comment_text": "Why did they make the bfr worse?", "comment_date": "2018-09-20T14:31:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "youri garretsen", "comment_text": "Once more thank you for being the only one with a contributing question.
