It does not really matter that much and indeed water is not necessarily the easiest compound from which to extract hydrogen.  This line of thinking probably comes out of the fact that we are used to using electrolysis to easily extract hydrogen from water and the reason for that is simply that water is so plentiful here.<br>Even if we actually need water it might be easier to make it by extracting hydrogen from a more plentiful compound and combining it with oxygen (which is very easily extracted from regolith) rather than trying to extract it from rocks with a tiny amount of trapped water. <br>What matters most is the amount of hydrogen per unit volume in the regolith regardless of what it is bound to as the difficulty of extracting ot from one compound or another does not vary that much. It is the actual collection of the &#39;ore&#39; so to speak that is the most difficult part and if you have to go through 1 ton of ore instead of 100 for a given amount of hydrogen it makes a huge difference.", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T12:23:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Jason Plant", "comment_text": "You&#39;ve been missing bro.", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T12:17:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Djbz91", "comment_text": "Tim&#39;s arms seem to get longer ever year \ud83e\udd23", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T12:16:07Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ste kra", "comment_text": "What makes a Stepp a Giantleap are all the stepps before", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T12:15:42Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ste kra", "comment_text": "If you make the Astro Award a phsikyl thing it needs to fether Stars", "comment_date": "2020-12-31T12:08:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Shin", "comment_text": "Idk, the reliability and 26 launches with no real &quot;news&quot; is deserving of a reward itself.

On the other hand only minuscule particles have been collected from asteroids until Hayabusa2 which brought 5g back, relatively speaking that is a lot, especially since this is from an whole new asteroid. Also, bringing back more and more material has its diminishing returns, especially with the sensitivity of modern sensors.
