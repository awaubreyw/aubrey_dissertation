IT&#39;S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU COULD EVER DO AND IT ONLY TAKES A FEW MINUTES\r<br>ARE YOU 100% SURE THAT IF YOU DIED TODAY THAT YOU WOULD GO TO HEAVEN? (CLICK &#39;READ MORE&#39;)\r<br>\r<br>There are some things that you should know:\r<br>\r<br>1. Realize that you are a sinner and in need of a Savior:\r<br>\r<br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlryDJqWalI&amp;t=3m23s\">3:23</a> &quot;For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlryDJqWalI&amp;t=3m10s\">3:10</a> &quot;As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:&quot;\r<br>\r<br>It all began when the first humans, Adam and Eve were created and God put them in the garden of Eden. God created them perfect to live in fellowship with Him. There was no death or sorrow. God told them not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. They disobeyed God and as a result, sin entered into the world. The pain, which this world sees, is the result of sin.\r<br>\r<br>2. Because of our sins, we die both spiritually and physically, but God sent His Son to die so that you can have a chance not to have to go to hell by accepting what He did on the cross:\r<br>\r<br>Ro <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlryDJqWalI&amp;t=6m23s\">6:23</a> &quot;For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Ro 5:8 &quot;But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>Every person who has ever lived is a sinner and is not righteous because we do bad things. A sin is a crime against God, just as if you steal something at the store, it is punishable by going to jail. It&#39;s the same thing with sin. Lying, stealing, sex before marriage, pride, hatred, ect. are all sins. Hell is a prison for those who commit crimes against God. That\u2019s because you must be perfect in order to get to heaven. No matter how well you live your life from then on, you have already sinned, which will be punished if you are not pardoned. If you commit a crime, and then live as a good citizen you still will go to jail for the crime you committed. Right? Just as the President can pardon a crime so you won&#39;t go to jail, Jesus can pardon your sins so that you do not go to hell, and can go to heaven when you die. You won\u2019t have to pay for your own sins because Jesus already did that for you. But if you reject the pardon that He offers, you will have to pay for your own sins by going to hell.\r<br>\r<br>3. If you will confess Jesus Christ as Your Lord, place your Faith in Him and Believe in your heart that He died, shed His blood and rose again as a sacrifice for your sins, you will be saved (from hell).\r<br>\r<br>Heb 11:6 But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.\r<br>\r<br> Heb <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlryDJqWalI&amp;t=9m22s\">9:22</a> And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.\r<br>\r<br>You cannot get to heaven by being a good person, going to church, baptism or any other way other than by turning to Jesus, believing in your heart that He died on the cross and rose from the dead for your sins and placing your Faith in Him. While these are good things to do, some people believe that they will get to heaven, but your Faith must be in Christ and His sacrifice alone and nothing else, giving your life to Him. \r<br>\r<br>Eph 2:8,9 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast.\r<br>\r<br>Ro 10:9,10;13 &quot;that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved..For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&quot;\r<br>\r<br>4.  You must submit your life to Jesus Christ and His will in Faith, believing in your heart that He died and rose again shedding His blood to pay for your sins as a sacrifice to God.  If you want to accept Jesus free gift of salvation, or if you have any doubts about whether or not you are going to heaven, HUMBLY PRAY THIS PRAYER TO GOD FROM YOUR HEART IN FAITH:\r<br>\r<br>\u201dDear Lord Jesus I know that I  am a sinner and need you to save me.  I believe that You are the Lord and believe in my heart that You died on the Cross and Rose from the dead, shedding your blood as a Sacrifice for my sins.  I turn to You as the only way of salvation, I submit my life to you, I submit my will to yours, I place my Faith and Trust in You alone as Lord of my life, Please save me and I thank You for it, in Jesus holy name, Amen.\u201d\r<br>\r<br>If you have truly placed your faith in Jesus Christ as your Lord, submitting your life to Him, you can know that you are a child of God and on your way to heaven.  Now that you are on your way to heaven, you should attend a bible believing church and follow in baptism.\r.", "comment_date": "2020-12-10T03:49:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Anna L.

There are like hundreds of Prophecies that Lord Jesus fulfilled, just look it up bruhs and gurls. God is our Father. He is the best of Fathers, the most lovable and merciful of fathers. Read the whole uncensored Bible that is Catholic(The Original) and\u00a0 pray my friends. Wish you all well\ud83d\ude4famen\ud83d\ude4f <br><br>Was the Jesus of the Bible who He claimed He was? Was<br>He really God&#39;s Son? Was Jesus the Messiah?<br>There are over 300 prophecies\u00a0 that point directly to the Messiah. Here is an example of just 8 :<br>The time of His birth (see the Daniel 8 &amp; 9 Timeline).<br>He would be born in Bethlehem. (Micah 5:2)<br>He would be born of a virgin. (Isaiah 7:14)<br>He would be betrayed for 30 pieces of silver. (Zechariah <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlryDJqWalI&amp;t=11m12s\">11:12</a>)<br>He would be mocked. (Psalm 22:7,8)<br>He would be crucified. (John 3:14)<br>He would be pierced. (Psalms 22:16)<br>He would die with the wicked, but He would be buried with the rich. (Isaiah 53:9) <br><br>Mathematics &amp; Astronomy Professor Peter W. Stoner has made the statement that the<br>chances of just 8 prophecies (like these) coming true by sheer chance is 1 in 10\u00b9\u2077(100,000,000,000,000,000). That would be equivalent to covering the whole state of Texas with silver dollars two feet deep and then expecting a blindfolded man to walk across the state and on the very first try find the ONE coin you marked (roughly equivalent to the Province of Ontario being 1.5 feet deep). <br>And if we were to add only 8 more similar prophecies, for a total of 16, the odds would be 1 x 10\u00b2\u2078 x 10\u00b9\u2077 or 1 in 10\u2074\u2075 (1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000) <br>Using the same type of illustration as above, if we were to press this many silver dollars(10\u2074\u2075) into a ball and place the center of this ball where the center of our Sun is, this silver ball&#39;s outer edge would be in approximately the same area as the orbit of Neptune (almost to Pluto.). One man fulfilling all 16 prophecies by sheer chance would be like sending a blind-folded person out to find one specific silver dollar that has been marked and has been mixed up somewhere in this huge ball and actually finding it the first time! (Keep in mind that this is a three-dimensional BALL, not a disk like our Solar System.) <br><br>Professor Stoner gives us yet another illustration, but this time, because a silver dollar, and even the atom, would be too large for this one he chose to use just the electron that orbits the nucleus of the atom.\u00a0 The electron is one of the smallest particles of matter known to man. It is so small that if you lined up 2.5 x 10\u00b9\u2075 (2,500,000,000,000,000) single file you would end up with a line that is only 1 inch long. (If we were going to count the electrons in this line one inch long, and counted 250 each minute, and if we counted day and night, it would take us 19,000,000 years to count just the one-inch line of electrons.)<br>Now back to Stoner&#39;s illustration. Using only 48 of the prophecies that Jesus fulfilled it was<br>calculated that the chances of one person fulfilling these by sheer chance would be 1 in 10\u00b9\u2075\u2077To help us understand how huge this number is he suggested taking 10\u00b9\u2075\u2077 electrons and pressing them into a solid ball. This ball, made entirely of electrons, would pretty much fill, not just our galaxy, but the entire known universe. (At the time Stoner&#39;s book was written the universe was known to be at least 6 billion light years in all directions. Stoner&#39;s known universe would need to be filled about 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times.) Once again we would mark just one electron, blindfold a man and send him out to find that one electron. Peter Stoner then states, &quot;To the extent, then, that we know this blindfolded man cannot pick out the marked electron, we know that the Bible is inspired. This is not merely evidence. It is proof of the Bible&#39;s inspiration by God--proof so definite that the universe is not large enough to hold the evidence.&quot; Professor Stoner then made the comment that, &quot;Any man who rejects Christ as the Son of God is rejecting a fact proved perhaps more absolutely than any other fact in the world.&quot; <br><br>This is the Catholic Church that has the Holy Sacrament of Holy Communion every Sunday Mass. Sometimes in history some of\u00a0 the Priests doubted that the Holy Communion waffer is really the The most Holy Flesh of Lord Jesus Christ. That&#39;s when miracles happened and the waffer was turned to actual bleeding Flesch-the tissue\u00a0that of a human heart, specifically the endocardium.Just Google Eucharistic miracle on Wikipedia or any other site. <br>Science also has proved it. This\u00a0 male AB blood and Flesch is still fresh to this day and one\u00a0 of the first miracles of this type happened during the 700s so we are talking about Blood that never even slightly decomposed during almost 1300 years! The male AB blood type has also\u00a0apparently\u00a0been found on the\u00a0 miracolous Shroud of Turin. The male AB blood type is also found on the Sudarium of Oviedo the Linen cloth thought to have been used to cover the head of Jesus immediately after the crucifixion. There are even\u00a0reports\u00a0that blood taken from some weeping statues of Mary are AB blood type. . The Holy Apostolic Catholic Church is full of miracles that happen on everyday basis and there are also many other Bible verses that confirm its claim as the true Church. And as always if someone doesn&#39;t want to do extensive research he should just ask directly the Head of the Church and that is our beloved Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth.", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T16:46:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Florencio Vela", "comment_text": "TIME to buy more TESLA TSLA!! go SPACE X!!!", "comment_date": "2020-12-09T14:42:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Peter S", "comment_text": "It looks tilted to the right by 1.5 degrees.
