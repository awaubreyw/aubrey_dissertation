In the short term, it might appear that the American public is saving money, but in the long term, it is losing money and power, handing it to a few billionaires. You&#39;re funding the construction of the Elon Musk empire, handing major, vital space assets and infrastructure to him. Is that smart? Mars will become planet Musk. Your great-grandchildren might end up fighting a war in space or on Mars against the Muskians. Ironically their great grandparents funded the creation, and the development of the Musk empire when all of those resources could&#39;ve been in the hands of the American people.

And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T06:50:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Logaeshwaran .M", "comment_text": "Fellow youtuber Mars Rover worked on Mark Rober oh I am sorry <br>Fellow youtuber Mark Rober worked on Mars Rover Curiosity.<br>As a firm believer in the Scientific method I researched this.", "comment_date": "2020-10-25T05:09:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pamo", "comment_text": "can you do a video about ariane 5 or esa", "comment_date": "2020-10-14T13:43:28Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "FF Team", "comment_text": "I loveeeee Space x", "comment_date": "2020-09-22T19:59:45Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "VelocityX", "comment_text": "Do do da de dodo da me dodo a me de da poo pee<br><br>I don\u2019t know what I wrote", "comment_date": "2020-09-01T16:28:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Swifty Blady123", "comment_text": "who came to this vid after trying to watch the sequel?", "comment_date": "2020-07-01T06:07:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Togemet7", "comment_text": "Nasa", "comment_date": "2020-06-26T17:52:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Miguel Morales", "comment_text": "So now spacex is NASAs bitch", "comment_date": "2020-06-20T20:23:59Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Dev playz", "comment_text": "NASA NASA", "comment_date": "2020-06-11T05:46:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Paul Lee Hernandez Lozada", "comment_text": "yes lets all think about that they should be work together for a better future in space exploration instead of comparing both of them \u263a\u263a\u263a", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T12:31:21Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "False Michael", "comment_text": "Humans have not been alive for 200,000 years.", "comment_date": "2020-05-24T02:36:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ambuj Shree Jaiswal", "comment_text": "Nasa+Spacex\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2020-04-17T18:46:52Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Soup_Time - 11 (MOVED CHANNELS,CHECK BIO)", "comment_text": "Spacex has more money so they can send more rockets into space and stuff nasa barely has any money", "comment_date": "2020-04-13T09:02:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Random Tube", "comment_text": "The 125 dislikes are from congress", "comment_date": "2020-04-10T17:21:38Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Jobs Steve", "comment_text": "Boi has the right to be a SpaceX fan, He spoke with Elon", "comment_date": "2020-04-09T22:20:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Vahe Hatch", "comment_text": "guys do you even realize that all these programs are only a shade of the NASA&#39;s original aspiration. want to see more action, and doesn&#39;t really matter which company", "comment_date": "2020-03-17T22:28:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Phinneus Prune", "comment_text": "CORRECTION: At the time of this video.

NASA has had more on its plate and definitely has a greater scope of operations.  This is totally true.  But comparing the innovations that SpaceX has made in the areas where SpaceX operates with NASA is totally fair game.  There is NO reason why most of the innovation and technical advanced SpaceX has made couldn&#39;t have been done by NASA years... decades ago.  Elon Musk talked about his experience sitting in board rooms at NASA explaining his vision for reducing the cost to space.  He explained to them there should be no reason why the cost to space should be three orders of magnitude greater than the material cost and talked about his ideas for bringing that down.  He described being literally laughed out of those meetings.<br><br>An indisputable case in point is SLS vs Falcon (9/heavy/BFR).  In the same time that SpaceX has taken to do its incredible innovating, the ossified infrastructure at NASA brought us SLS.  1970&#39;s technology they&#39;ve spent billions upon billions of dollars on, and worse, have publicly stated how they thought they were doing a great job with.  &quot;NASA SLS deputy project manager Jody Singer ... stated in September 2012 that $500 million per launch is a reasonable target cost for SLS&quot; - merely getting the actual to orbit cost down to what the shuttle&#39;s subsidized sticker price used to be is their goal.  They bet on SLS because it&#39;s a safe bet.  Something they can throw money at and get an assured space launch vehicle.  Assured because it&#39;s just the space shuttle without the orbiter.<br><br>For decades NASA has been the exact opposite of what they need to be.  Risk and innovation averse for R&amp;D, but crazily risk taking during operations.  Every time there has been an accident or mishap investigation, the boards findings speak about how the culture at NASA is wrong for operations.  Read up on the findings of the boards for Challenger, Mars Climate Orbiter, Mars Polar Lander, and Columbia.  What they have to say about the culture and command infrastructure at NASA is telling, and is a common theme.<br><br>What that tells me, the risk taking during operations, and risk aversion for R&amp;D, is that NASA, both historically and presently, has a culture of not rocking the boat.  That is my definition of ossification.  Don&#39;t rock the boat, sit back, and collect their stipend from congress.  Unfortunately, those who point this out are said to be anti-exploration and anti-space.<br><br>Here in Canada we had a situation with our blood supply and the Red Cross, who at the time were the ones who did all our blood collection and distribution.  They were determined to have a culture totally insuitable to handling something that important.  They were stripped of that responsibility and all assets and infrastructure handed over to a newly created agency. The United States needs &quot;A&quot; NASA.  &quot;THE&quot; NASA cannot, I believe, do the job any more.  It has been allowed to continue on their current path just too long.  There is no remedy that will fix them.  I don&#39;t think much less than a complete shakeup will do the job.  I would do the same thing to NASA as Canada did to the Red Cross.  Disband them and give all their assets to a newly created agency.  Get a completely new command team and hire people from the ground up.<br><br>Tim is too kind to see it this way, I think.  And I get this.  The first anywhere-near-real shuttle I saw was Enterprise in New York.  That was almost a religious experience for me, finally getting to touch a real part of the actual shuttle program.  I will never forget the horror of Challenger.  I read that report, though, cover to cover, and by the time Columbia happened, it was with resigned expectancy that I accepted that news.<br><br>I really am sorry to say it, but NASA does not have, nor do I see a way forward for it to regain, my confidence.", "comment_date": "2019-06-17T19:34:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "YOLO 123", "comment_text": "I dont know if you would read this but could you do a deep explanation on Ion Engines on the satellites?

I remember vividly the day Challenger blew up, I was stationed aboard the USS Nevada SSBN 733 and we were tied to the pier for a missile load out, that day I was on watch below decks and  we had both scopes up so that we could all have a look at the launch and believe me it was very clear and close looking through the scopes. Challenger had just lifted off, I stepped away from the con so the next man could take a look and then shortly after the announcement came over the Subs 1mc letting us all know Challenger had a catastrophic failure, I was 18 years old at the time and I remember it felt like I had the wind knocked out of me as was the expression i saw on everyone else&#39;s face around me. The Officer of the deck came across the Subs comms following the announcement and asked that the entire crew remove their covers, pause and reflect on the tragic loss we as a nation had just experienced, It was gut wrenching. <br>I remember watching the last moon landing and then the follow on NASA missions, Skylab which we almost lost due to damage on launch then one of the last Apollo Capsules docked with a Russian Soyuz Capsule and for a short time we had a sense of friendship, you see back then we still practiced duck and cover drills in school because the cold war was at it&#39;s peak it seemed and almost every public building in my small town in Ohio had a fallout shelter sign on it.<br>Now at age 51 I have a few things I want to say about &quot;NASA&quot;. Many people do not realize NASA is not a public sector space program it at the end of the day belongs to the Department of Defense, civilian purposes come secondary. I often wondered if I would be alive for the Moon outposts NASA had promised us all as young kids or if I would ever see Werner Von Braun&#39;s Ring in the sky that I had read about in popular science magazines and then one day be able to go to Mars as a tourist as everyone was always talking about us colonizing Mars by the year 2000 with regular flights to and from, seems kind of silly now I guess. <br>True, NASA did accomplish many things and it is also true NASA inspired so many of us to dream and look to the stars but in the end NASA was (JMO) a waste of time. I still love space and SPACEX keeps me hooked as Elon Musk is not just a dreamer he follows through on what he sets out to do. I believe we would have accomplished many of the things I listed if we had just commercialized space in the 70&#39;s. NASA operating budget today is 50 million dollars a day, rounded up about 20 billion a year. The culture at NASA is much like the military in that you have allot of bureaucratic red tape and for many years innovation was stymied. Given the amount of money NASA has squandered and I say that because they really have not learned very much when you look at projects like ORION, SLS etc. ORION has much more technology and is almost twice the size of the Apollo Capsule but at the end of the day you still have a capsule and SLS is still a throw away package, not very impressive in my opinion when you consider how young SPACEX is and how very quickly they rose to the top because it was formed as a business and you do not start a business to loose money unlike the government which is in the business of spending and wasting money lolol.  <br>I have followed the &quot;MAR&#39;s&quot; direct&quot; folks and frankly think they more than most have the best, fastest and most economical approach with technology that has been built here and proven already, people keep saying how dangerous it would be and that the risks are too high and that may be so but there is no lack of courageous explorers highly trained knowing all the risks that are willing to go right now. In fact much of the technology needed we had already in place in 1973. To qualify on a Submarine you must know every system like the back of your hand, it is exhausting to get your dolphins or Submarine qualified, day and night you are studying, setting up interviews and physically touching every component on the Sub getting ready for your board interview, my board was 7hrs long and comprised of 5 crew members conducting the interview. What i do remember is a system we had on board the Sub called CAMS, it was the very same system used on the space shuttles, &quot;CENTRAL AIR MONITORING SYSTEM&quot; every compartment had a hockey puck sized disk that was constantly reporting the air quality in every space and where needed bringing scrubbers, filtration systems and oxygen bleeds online to keep the air perfect, it worked very well.<br>Have any of you ever heard of this project?

As I see it NASA should help us build the infrastructure of space for others to use - Meaning that NASA should build theyre SLS and Orion to build and fly manned mission to the LGS and help build a future Lunar Base and then let SpaceX and others use it and help with providing resuply and transportation to and from it.
