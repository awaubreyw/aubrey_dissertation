Israel had nothing to do with it, even though the jewish man that took ownership of the buildings had plans for new versions a year previous, had weekly phone calls with Bibi Netanyahu (who blurted out that 9/11 was good for Israel... before correcting his freudian slip), worked his insurance people furiously to make sure that the buildings were covered for acts of terrorism, an Oidigo alert system went out days before (warning Israeli citizens only not to fly or go near the trade center on 9/11), the only people arrested on 9/11 were Israelis (several of whom were Mossad), of the only flights allowed on 9/11 after the attacks, there was a flight to Tel Aviv (the other flights were for the Bin Laden family members).  Oh and there was the Israeli Gelatin Group that did installation artwork in the buildings months before the attacks where members of the group were photographed inside the towers with a window popped out and empty boxes stacked behind them that had held electronic remote detonation fuses.

This is NEVER used in aviation and industry as you sht out all the low pressure side into the atmosphere.  The upside is system weight savings. Which means you might have lots of pressure in the system left but run out of actuation fluid.  This failure is also unpredictable (what state the fins would be in when the pressure stops). What happened during the Falcon 9 failure is a non-redundant system that is &quot;cold pressurized&quot; means the more you use the colder the fluid will become as it is recovered and re-used. They either had ice contamination lock up the actuator/valve or the fluid simply became too cold and lost viscosity.

I think it ended up too light and the center of thrust vs center of gravity was off kilter and that&#39;s why it got unstable.

The aerodynamic stress along either the x or y axis is just too much structurally and they break apart in violent explosions, or they get flight terminated for the same reason. But with the grid-fins, even malfunctioning grid-fins, they keep the rocket from tumbling by providing that drag at the +z end of the rocket. So while it was spinning, the fins were keeping it upright so it didn&#39;t tumble. This allowed the rest of the system, the nitrogen thrusters and merlin engine, to try and correct the issue, and they basically succeeded. It was a little worrying seeing it start to precess a bit as that could cause enough torque along the x or y axis to break apart, but the rocket corrected that motion very quickly.<br><br>I have to hand it to the structural engineers for building an incredibly tough rocket, and to the software teams who wrote the flight control software so well that it was able to pull off this soft landing and basically save the stage.
