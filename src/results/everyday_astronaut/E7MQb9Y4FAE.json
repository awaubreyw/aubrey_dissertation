New governments can be elected every four years so this makes it difficult to get funding for long-term projects. Elon Musk already has his plan in effect to create his funding. In my opinion there is no space race anymore. SpaceX has the lead by more than a decade. Their competition is nowhere to be found.

Also small businesses have to come before the multiple fleet sales by corporations, this allows more distribution of product amongst the population again offering more free word of mouth advertising. So orders under 10 come before orders over 10 or 100 this prevents someone like Herts rental to get all their Tesla&#39;s before the starter businesses do. Until production of the Tesla Semi can reach more than 4000 trucks a week I think it is important to keep the fleet sales at 100 trucks or less. If they can Mass produce more than that I would be one of the first to help them with their commercial fleet sales but I also believe in being able to help the smaller businesses get there trucks at the same time and not have to wait in behind for larger orders.

Now the exhaust will grow hotter on the inside<br>of the flame, but not incontact with the Bell nozzle itself, and thus heating the nozzle little more.

I served as Chief of Staff to Major General Roger Ramey, Commander, Eighth Air Force.  I had the rank of Colonel.<br> <br>(5)  In early July, I received a phone call from Maj. Gen. Clements McMullen, Deputy Commander, Strategic Air Command.  He asked what we knew about the object which had been recovered outside Roswell, New Mexico, as reported in the press.  I called Col. William Blanchard, Commander of the Roswell Army Air Field, and directed him to send the material in a sealed container to me at Fort Worth.  I so informed Maj. Gen. McMullen.<br> <br>(6)  After the plane from Roswell arrived with the material, I asked the Base Commander, Col. Al Clark, to take possession of the material and to personally transport it in a B-26 to Maj. Gen. McMullen in Washington, D.C.  I notified Maj. Gen. McMullen, and he told me he would send the material by personal courier on his plane to Benjamin Chidlaw, Commanding General of the Air Material Command at Wright Field [later Wright Patterson AFB].  The entire operation was conducted under the strictest secrecy.<br> <br>(7)   The material shown in the photographs taken in Maj. Gen. Ramey\u2019s office was a weather balloon.  The weather balloon explanation for the material was a cover story to divert the attention of the press.<br> <br>(8)  I have not been paid or given anything of value to make this statement, which is the truth to the best of my recollection.<br> <br>Signed:  T.

That&#39;s because you might have 500hp, but you only have it for one very specific RPM. In first gear you&#39;re closer to the correct RPM, the horsepower is higher, car accelerates faster.<br><br>Its the same deal with ISP, maybe you&#39;ve got 360ISP but if you&#39;ve only got that at one specific point you&#39;re not getting the whole picture. Much better to get 350ISP for the whole launch than 320ISP for most and 360ISP for a very short time. You&#39;d do that by getting a graph of the force on the y axis and time on the x, then calculate the area under the curve.

For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.\u201d Acts 2:38-39 KJV <br><br>\u201cJesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d John 14:6 KJV <br><br>\u201cHe that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.\u201d John 3:36 KJV <br><br>\u201cFor if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.\u201d Matthew 6:14-15 KJV<br><br>\u201cAnd I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened. If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?\u201d Luke 11:9-13 KJV<br><br>\u201cAnd Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe not. All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the Father&#39;s will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.\u201d John 6:35-40 KJV <br><br>\u201cAnd he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things. And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy: And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.\u201d Luke 24:44-53 KJV<br> <br>\u201cAnd fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father. But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.\u201d Matthew 10:28-31 KJV<br><br>\u201cWhosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.\u201d Matthew 10:32-33 KJV <br><br>\u201cThat if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\u201d<br>Romans 10:9-13 KJV <br><br>\u201cJesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\u201d John 3:5-6 KJV<br><br>\u201cWho hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son: In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence. For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.\u201d Colossians 1:13-20 KJV <br><br>\u201cLook not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.\u201d <br>2 Philippians 2:4-11 KJV <br><br>\u201cTake heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen. For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.\u201d Matthew 6:1-21 KJV <br><br>\u201cBut Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe. And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you. Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing. And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God. Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book: But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name.\u201d John 20:24-31 KJV", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T22:14:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sand Paper", "comment_text": "Elon musk is like I bought these that&#39;s why I&#39;m smart.", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T22:06:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cristian Mancillas", "comment_text": "\u201cYou have this many here already?\u201d I\u2019m sorry but I cannot stand people that ask some obvious questions like that \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T21:55:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Florzy dairies", "comment_text": "Well said dear", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T21:55:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "BAC", "comment_text": "These are more fun to watch than my favourite TV shows/movies.", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T21:54:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "king Lords", "comment_text": "Elon Musk is a boss!

The only way that gas bubble can get of the way is to cease to exist as gas and change back to a liquid which requires a mass of energy to change phase.", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T15:52:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Atlantis", "comment_text": "to the mars spaceXs go baby go baby", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T15:48:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Allocation", "comment_text": "lets see if SpaceX can achieve there goal and hope it doesn&#39;t take two decades to hit there goal.", "comment_date": "2022-07-10T15:47:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Biruk Gossaye", "comment_text": "Who else wants a breakdown of this video by Tim.

Approximately two-thirds of propellant exhaust is released into the stratosphere (12 km-50 km) and mesosphere (50 km-85 km), where it can persist for at least 2-3 years. This is significant due to the climate impact of rocket emissions that are trapped in those layers.The alumina (Al2O3), chlorine (converted from hydrochloric acid, HCl), nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydroxyl (OH), and water vapour (H2O) in rocket launch plumes all contribute to ozone depletion through chemical reactions in the Earth\u2019s stratosphere.

The okay fire away.<br><br>If 30 will lift the load I sure would like to reserve 3 for landing functionality at least for a few flights.  We need flight time.  Successful landing/return to home.  I realize that there is fail over and backup for the landing burns, alternative Raptor sequence - How long to kick in a backup?  I am with you all - reliability - simplicity .. Preassemblies are wonderful for production and I suspect maintenance - over the service life of the equipment.<br><br>Shrouds - makes it sound like they are already dead.  Shroud is good - especially if we are landing in or on unprepared surfaces.  The Earth based Mechazilla should mitigate the worst of the blow back.  But not for initial landings off world.  Lighter is better ??? what about sponge like or honey comb humm good thing to think about - we press the limits of materials science - blast nets?  blast fabric - perhaps first responders have the shields.<br><br>Not just flying debris but heat okay I am tracking.  idk sock aficionado -  Put a sock on it. <br>Do these puppies pulse?<br><br>The thrust vector is through the entire assembly to the &quot;motor mount&quot; no apparent external frame to thrust puck. It might be interesting to get a set back and look for micro fractures. <br><br>What do you want?

What is the big ugly - don&#39;t say shrouds.  Does size matter? We are at a point where it is all about trade offs.  Where is the predicted failure?  We need flight time.  How many times can we relight a Raptor on the stand?  For say 7 and 3 minute launch landing sequences before the unit would have to be swapped out.  The Falcon series seems to have excellent durability - I know this is a wee bit different but amortization of the cost of the unit and operation is huge if these turn out to be rock solid, bullet proof.  Huge $$ cost savings - I am going to have to sleep on this one.<br><br>Do these Raptor 2 units have a diagnostic component.  Do we know from cradle to grave the temp, the vibration, the hours run, the medical kind of health information for each - Can we turn it over by hand?  This is to say are the valves exercised even sitting on the floor every (pick an interval) idk three days?  I know you can not turn them over by hand but is there an exercise regimen? What were the funky stands for?  I keep a battery charger on the car in the garage - trickle charger to keep the chips warm and for the Raptors we need to keep moving parts operational.  I know talking into my hat.  Just thinking out loud. Logging.  Does the Raptor have a logging function?<br><br>We have picked all the low hanging fruit.
