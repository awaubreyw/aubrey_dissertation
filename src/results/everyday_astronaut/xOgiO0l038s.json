This method can be used to move heat from where the gas is expanded to where it is compressed, not that unlike your refrigerator, except that there is no phase change in the Helium.  Also the Warm side of the Helium is chilled with an alcohol/water fluid that is also chilled using more traditional refrigeration compressor to drain off as much heat as possible from the compressed Helium before it is expanded.  In this system the Helium can get the cold side below the temperatures at which nitrogen condenses (-196C or so).  Since this is colder than the temperature at which either Oxygen (-181C or so) or Methane (-161C or so) compress, a similar, if supersized method, is likely used for chilling and liquefying the fuel and oxidizer for larger rockets whose fuel needs cryogenic chilling.", "comment_date": "2018-09-10T13:48:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "LANdrew", "comment_text": "Launching spacex rockets almost feels easy now", "comment_date": "2018-09-10T13:39:02Z", "likes_count": 4}, {"comment_by": "Leopoldo Marti-Aguilar", "comment_text": "<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23BestSpaceYoutubeChannel\">#BestSpaceYoutubeChannel</a>", "comment_date": "2018-09-10T13:25:32Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Leopoldo Marti-Aguilar", "comment_text": "Good Job Everyday Astronaut!
