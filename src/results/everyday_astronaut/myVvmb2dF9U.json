About 1 in 4 Raptors is failing the pad test fire - unsat. Either the Raptors are not ready, or they are ingesting FOD. Assuming the Raptors are all being test fired several times before delivery to Boca, there is clearly a process problem once they head for Boca.<br><br>I believe each SSME was test fired several times before flying. I would assume the Merlins are too? 25% Raptor failure rate on first launch pad fire - embarrassing. With those failure rates, odds of a successful flight test are close to zero. After ten (?) Raptor starts on pull-up, has only one Raptor come up to full power during the pull up? 10% success rate? also unsat. Houston we have a problem...<br><br>2) I admire the desire to use an industrial grade process to building starships (assembly outside, Raptors shipped on pallets, rather than clean rooms and shipping engines in sealed engine cans), but industry experience is that foreign objects in rocket engine fuel and oxidizer supply lines have caused a LOT of failures. Commercial airliner jet engines are treated with more care than the Raptors appear to be treated once they are headed for Boca. Seriously? Ask your turbomachinery bearing engineers about the impact of contamination on seals and bearings. <br><br>Sloppy... And inexpensively fixed.<br><br>You should cycle a few Raptors through the current delivery, installation, starship test fire process, and then send them back to manufacturing for test on their test stand. How many are unable to have several successful starts/re-starts?  <br><br>3) The Raptors are too fussy about the quantity of fuel and oxidizer being sucked in. Easily eat themselves when flow is low/out-of-balance - this would be a serious design failure, possibly very difficult to fix, and may require a Raptor or Starship re-design.<br><br>4) The transition from belly flop to vertical simply causes too much &quot;churn&quot; in the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and it is impossible to provide reliable flow into the Raptor fuel and oxidizer inlets. Concept flaw. Several possible fixes, all would reduce payload weight to orbit:<br><br>- provide dedicated &quot;re-light&quot; tanks to each Raptor that have zero void fraction at re-light. <br>- start the transition earlier and drop the tail using the aero surfaces. Vertical acceleration will be less than one-G, should help the liquids head for the bottom of the tanks. <br>- use one Raptor earlier to flip vertical and settle the tank contents back to the bottom of the tank before starting the other two. <br>- May need to add baffles to the tanks to reduce sloshing during the transition (many liquid tanks subject to motion have baffles to greatly reduce churn during accelerations/turns. Railroads learned this over 100 years ago.) <br><br>All of these will reduce payload. Too bad. Hopefully impact of one of these options will not reduce payload too much. <br><br>Perhaps Nitrogen thrusters would speed aero-only transition towards vertical? &quot;Flying&quot; towards the pad with more cross range velocity (nose down a little towards the pad), followed by nose pull up, would shift more of the fuel and oxidizer aft before engine start (and the resulting shift of CG aft would accelerate an aero-only flip?)<br><br>Surely the behavior of the fluids during transition can be determined through sub-scale experimentation without blowing things up. VERY difficult to model numerically for multi-phase fluids at saturation with some subcooled liquid and some slightly superheated vapor - a chaotic process (having done non-equilibrium fluid flow and heat transfer experiments 40 years ago). Plus the initial state would be hard to model due to aero-buffeting that might alter pre-flip liquid/vapor distribution of the fluids.<br><br>Each of the four above could be resolved without blowing up more starships, and I doubt these failures are resolving any of these four concerns... Clearly the belly flop works aerodynamically. That has been demonstrated. Time for some serious engineering, like the type that made Crew Dragon successful.<br><br>I was originally impressed with the rapid development concept, but it isn&#39;t working - lucky you didn&#39;t destroy the tank farm.

Perhaps Musk would say that they are too engaged in the business of &#39;serious engineering&#39; to be concerned with such matters but speaking as a spectator I&#39;m dissapointed! On a more technical theme it occurrs to me that when SN10 landed it could be seen that the single engine used, because it was offset from a central position due to it being one of 3 mounted in a trangular pattern about the longditudonally central axis of the rocket would have the effect of causing the rocket to come down tilted from the vertical, I suspect that the tilt could be corrected in the last moments of the landing but it seems a potential complication for the engineers to overcome. Spacex could perhaps use 4 engines with one mounted centrally, (weight issues allowing) but given that all the Starships so far have exploded/crashed this would risk &#39;wasting&#39; yet another engine for each unsucessful test.
