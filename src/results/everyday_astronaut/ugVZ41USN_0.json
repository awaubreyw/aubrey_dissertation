Not even taking into account volumes just a 1.4 meter(at widest point) raptor and piRsquare that to get its area and do the same for the 9 meter area and divide the can calculated available area by the raptor calculated area, and I get 13 as the total number raptor engines that can fit? Hopefully someone can check my math on that but it doesn&#39;t seem to me that 31 engines can come close to fitting even if staggered.Of course I&#39;m speaking of the booster and not the starship but I believe they have the same diameter?

Magic is what happens when you use the training of your mind, the skills of your hands, and the communions of your heart to transform the world.

You call it a trade or a craft, and don&#39;t notice that it is still changing and ruling your world every day.  You get so good at it, so automatic, that you may lose your love and awe of it.
