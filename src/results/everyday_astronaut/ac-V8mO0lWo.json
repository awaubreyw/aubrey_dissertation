I wonder if their flight engine looks the same, as I see several off-the-shelf Mirata valves.  The failed connector looks like an Amphenol &quot;clicky-lock&quot; which most flight vehicles use today.  First I heard of the tap-off.  A great simplification to eliminate a gas-generator.  Now we know who bought Aerojet&#39;s giant Ipsen braze furnace.  Mud-dabbers got into some &quot;sealed&quot; Russian NK-33 engines and ground squirrels have stored acorns inside solid rockets.

A quick summary of some Firefly propulsion facts:<br><br><b>ENGINE GENERAL INFO:</b> US combustion chamber, Ukrainian turbo-machinery. Tap-off cycle.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=11m15s\">11:15</a> This engine uses a pintle injector<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=32m36s\">32:36</a> Combustion chamber runs at 1300 psi (90 Bar) Tap off 1100 psi (75 Bar) expands to about 30 psi (2 Bar) in the turbine<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=7m38s\">7:38</a> The temperature in the thrust chamber is 3000C, but the temperature of the gas fed to the turbine is 600C. This is achieved without any additional dilution of tapped off gas -- it just happens so due to the natural topology of the injector flows in the thrust chamber. [This is not quite clear -- the patent which Tom refers to, describes the upper stage &quot;Lightning&quot; engine, which does use tap-off gas dilution with fuel, and does not have the same injector.]<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=7m33s\">7:33</a> 2.3 O/F ratio (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=36m23s\">36:23</a>) 2.2 O/F in the first flight, but also run at 2.4-2.5 in tests.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=30m50s\">30:50</a> The turbine rotates at 33K RPM, developing 900 HP  [the torque is just under 200Nm, the total force acting on the blades on the  order of 150 kgf]<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=6m43s\">6:43</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=11m42s\">11:42</a> The engine does not throttle, except for a little bit, by changing the pressure in the tanks. [Probably because the turbine is fed from the thrust chamber tap-off and depends on subtlety of the flow patterns at the engine head, this coupling makes thrust control much more difficult. That&#39;s one of the reasons why tap-off cycle is so rarely used.]<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=9m35s\">9:35</a> Turbine is started by Nitrogen spin start. Very low spin start is required before the engine bootstraps. &quot;Could plug the nozzle to help it&quot;<br><br><br><b>THRUST CHAMBER</b><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=6m02s\">6:02</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=11m00s\">11:00</a> Thrust chamber is high strength copper alloy liner [usually Copper-Zirconium-Chromium bronze in the USA] with nickel-cobalt electroplated on it.

After machining the weight becomes approximately 40 kg.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=31m58s\">31:58</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=24m47s\">24:47</a> Copper alloy engine liner at the machining area, (on the left). Lots of shavings!<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=35m58s\">35:58</a> &quot;We can run the [combustion chamber] barrels without film cooling. In some engines we had film cooling in the throat area, where the heat flux is the greatest.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=36m52s\">36:52</a> On film cooling orifices and chamber fabrication technology:  &quot;The chamber will have cooling channels milled into it and then we will put wax in those channels and then we&#39;ll electroplate nickel over that, and then we&#39;ll melt the wax out now you&#39;ve got channels. That&#39;s how we make our cooling channels. Before you put the wax on when you have those channels if you just go a little bit above the throat and use 12 mil electro-discharge machining wire and just pop little holes through those cooling channels into the chamber before you plate it now you plate it and in those channels you have an array of little tiny holes above the converging section and that will inject jets of cold fuel.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=26m13s\">26:13</a> &quot;Just hired a new machine shop manager, who has experience in mass production of thrust chambers. Will be buying some new machinery that will allow to machine thrust chambers in hours instead of days that it takes now.&quot;<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=27m12s\">27:12</a> 3D printing of the liner of this size is still not economical.

[See cross-section of the RD-8 turbopump.]<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=30m50s\">30:50</a> Turbine wheel being made using the machining center.

TRIVIA</b><br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=20m44s\">20:44</a> Bulk LOX is super friendly, it even puts fires out. But hot oxygen gas burns the engine up in a white flash of light in a second.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=33m46s\">33:46</a> At moderate combustion pressures (1300 psi) soot-carbon combustion products LOX/RP-1 condense on the walls of combustion chamber and form a natural thermal barrier which inhibits heat transfer. At higher pressures or higher O/F ratios this beneficial soot formation does not occur.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=34m54s\">34:54</a> LOX-RP is amazing. Impulse density is on par with everything. In the balance of things, methane is a hassle.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=37m45s\">37:45</a> In other engines, Tom have seen engine liner erosion that sometimes produced fuel leaks which provided film cooling preventing further erosion, after which engine ran happily.<br><br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac-V8mO0lWo&amp;t=51m00s\">51:00</a> Wasps cause serious problems by plugging with mud the vents that are necessary for actuating engine valves!

With Terran R and Neutron looking towards attempting a Starship-like vehicle at their respective classes using completely different design approaches, Firefly is going to be in a bit of a pickle, especially if Gamma is only 75% reusable as a spaceplane. I may go so far to say Gamma could just become a second stage to Beta and both bring Composite structures to full reuse orbital rocketry, where Rocket Lab had to abandon it. <br><br>Impulse density is one thing, and so is the need to carry less mass into orbit. But what you use that extra mass for in orbit makes the difference between staying with a mere satellite deployment vessel that can only break up on reentry after being used, or being able to remove and recover satellites, reentering intact and landing, either vertically or horizontally, and being capable of doing highly regular spaceflight on a common basis. If Starship needs landing legs, even with excess weight to achieve that, so be it. Risking new technology that has incredibly slow iteration cycles (like monolithic towers that may take SpaceX a year to complete each) when your competition can iterate faster than your company can is a bad idea for scaling up operations quickly.", "comment_date": "2021-10-11T19:24:52Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Alain Isabelle de Montr\u00e9al", "comment_text": "Come on man give us some of your stuff on soviet engine. not that i did&#39;nt like this video.
