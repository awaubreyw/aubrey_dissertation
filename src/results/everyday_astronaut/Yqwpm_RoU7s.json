That increasing distance means a longer orbital period, or month, as well.\r<br>\r<br>To picture what is happening, imagine yourself riding a bicycle on a track built around a Merry-go-Round. You are riding in the same direction that it is turning. If you have a lasso and rope one of the horses, you would gain speed and the Merry-Go-Round would lose some. In this analogy, you and your bike represent the Moon, the Merry-Go-Round is the rotating Earth, and your lasso is gravity. In orbital mechanics, a gain in speed results in a higher orbit.\r<br>\r<br>The slowing rotation of the Earth results in a longer day as well as a longer month. Once the length of a day equals the length of a month, the tidal friction mechanism would cease. (ie. Once your speed on the track matches the speed of the horses, you can&#39;t gain any more speed with your lasso trick.) That&#39;s been projected to happen once the day and month both equal about 47 (current) days, billions of years in the future. If the Earth and Moon still exist, the distance will have increased to about 135% of its current value. Fortunately the sun will burn up both the moon and earth before this happens.

I checked on the flight club website and there the maximum velocity for the booster was shown to be slightly over 2000 m/s. A quick calculation suggests that the number you displayed was in fact in km/h, although being labeled m/s. Would be cool if you changed that for the next stream :) Apart of that I totally love your work and can never wait for your next stream/ video!
