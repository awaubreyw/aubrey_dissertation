Elon\u2018s philosophy of the best part being no part is the secret to the whole refuel problem. I came up with an idea that just seems incredibly simple so I will assume that somebody else has already come up with it and they decided it wasn\u2019t feasible or it\u2019s already being considered. So at the risk of coming off like an idiot let me give you my suggestion. For decades science fiction has talked about a space elevator, the idea is based on the centripetal force of the earths rotation holding the end up in place. But that idea is kinda pointless and will take way too much effort, but a couple of pipes going up to supply an orbital gas station would be a lot cheaper and easier. The pressure at the earth end of the pipes should be reduced to some degree by the centripetal force of The liquids at the top pulling. Prior to now any type of space elevator contraption would have to be built from the ground up but now with starship it could easily be built from the top down, just drop down a rope and have somebody pull the pipes down to the supply platform. This would eliminate the need for launching tankers fully loaded with fuel into space.  All that you would have to launch is empty containers that can be filled later after they get to orbit. A refueling system in orbit would illuminate the need for heat tiles and fins for reentry as you could refuel before coming back and just use the Rockets to slow down, saving all the weight of the Finns and tiles. The base platform could be out to sea away from people and equatorial (if that matters) and be easily supplied using existing ships. This would allow a lot more playing around in space, just rent one of Elon\u2019s portable tanks and go mine that asteroid. He could make money supplying other companies ships if they\u2019re smart enough to use methane. I\u2019m no engineer but if this works it could be a total game hanger for humanity. I\u2019m assuming that  this already in the works or discarded because it won\u2019t work. <br>Thanks<br>Bill in Wyoming", "comment_date": "2021-10-18T18:47:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Maine Reacts", "comment_text": "The only thing I will say is that if our planet is in danger in the future.

In software engineering the brightest developers for all their genius often fail to deliver because they are so focussed on engineering everything to the nth degree they end up in a never ending loop of going back and forth and if they finally deliver a working product it&#39;s too late, too expensive, out of date and totally overengineered. Hence Elon said, coming up with a design is one thing, but delivering another...Doesn&#39;t matter how genius the design, unless you can make it demonstrable it is of no use to anyone.

However this is a one off one of a king weapon and all parts are hand fit. So then you sell this to the USA army. Now it takes 10 years or more to actually make the machine gun a production line weapon that a factory can build. Things like \u2018how can you get a CNC to machine this bit. When it\u2019s done have we introduced any anomalies? The. What\u2019s the tolerance on every part such that the gun can be built in any factory and have parts from one factory drop into a gun from another factory (especially with the AK47) and so on. It\u2019s 10 years or more on average to do this, take it from a one off and into a production line product assuming you can even manage it at all. <br><br>An example of \u2018oops what the Hellhiem is going on here\u2019 is the 7th round stoppage on the M1 Garand of WW2 fame. Turns out if the rounds were loaded left right left instead of right left right, or the other way around. As well as a machining error where to cut one slot or grove in the bolt and if the machinist went to fast aka too far then this tiny nub was cut away and then sometimes combined with the order the rounds were loaded then you may get a stoppage. At the weapon open day at the trials where news paper and magazine writers had a chance to fire the guns this problem wasn\u2019t solved. The workaround of round loading order was figured out but the problem it solved was still unknown. So all the ammo clips were loaded by a single army guy and they were all loaded perfectly for the dodgy fix. At this time the M1 Garand was still not a certainty for acceptance.<br><br>So yeah, turning a smart or brilliant int idea into repeatable reality is difficult. It\u2019s also very good that a person of the caliber of Elon Musk acknowledges this.

But it you cut the cone of the engine into 8-10 parts and then make them fit so thrust doesn&#39;t escape from holes between the parts and move them along side the rocket while it&#39;s flying you can make them have a smaller diameter while launching for peak water level efficiency and then make the move with servos/hydraulics &quot;must have enough strength to prevent the parts from separation while allowing them to fold and open like petals of a flower&quot; so it gets wider and keeps the efficiency along side the altitudes increases. That wait even thought it&#39;s adding a lot of moving parts to the &quot;already complicated&quot; engine but it might allow you to have more cargo &quot;more power thanks to increased efficiency&quot;/have more flying time because you are at peak efficiency all the way from water level to space and while dropping you could also manipulate the thrust this way at the landing stage.<br><br>It would be like having the atmosphere and the space optimized engines in one + all the steps between.<br><br>Also that might be the answer to have peak efficiency at different atmosphere levels like earth, moon, mars and the perturbations in space.<br><br>If you read this thank you and sorry for the block format.", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T17:03:25Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "Owen", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t705r8ICkRw&amp;t=2m30s\">2:30</a> Elon taking video in portrait just shattered my world...", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T16:43:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joy L", "comment_text": "Elon is my personal hero.<br>Not because he is trying to change the automotive world, rocket science or getting humanity to become multiplanetery...  nevermind being the richest person on the planet.<br>He is my hero because he suffers from autism and still goes into a construction area with so many noises triggering him and has a complicated interview with Tim.", "comment_date": "2021-08-12T16:37:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "atomicmozart", "comment_text": "<b>***</b>    For how smart you guy&#39;s are your really stupid... <br>GET A HARD HAT ON ELON!!!<br>Electricity Costs? ...

Make your requirements less dumb<br><br>2.) Delete the part or process step<br><br>\tIt\u2019s particularly dangerous if a smart person gave you the requirements because you might not question them enough. Everyone\u2019s wrong no matter who you are, everyone\u2019s wrong some of the time. If you are not occasionally adding things back in, you aren\u2019t deleting enough. The bias is \u201cLet\u2019s add this part or process step in case we need it.\u201d You have to run at tight margins, if you don\u2019t you won\u2019t get anything into orbit.<br><br>Whatever requirement or constraint you have, it must come with a name, not a department. You can\u2019t ask the department, you have to ask a person. The person who is putting forward the requirement or constraint, they must take responsibility for that requirement. Otherwise you could have a requirement that an intern 2 years ago randomly came up with off the cuff and they aren\u2019t even at the company anymore \u2014 but it came from the X department \u2014 yet nobody at the X department currently agrees with that.<br><br><br>3.) Simplify or optimize<br>\tThis is the third step, not the first or second step. Possibly the most common of a smart engineer is to optimize a thing that should not exist.<br><br><br>4.) Accelerate cycle time<br>\tYou\u2019re moving too slowly \u2014 go faster. But don\u2019t go faster until you\u2019ve worked on the other 3 things first. If you\u2019re digging your grave, don\u2019t dig it faster \u2014 stop digging your grave. You can always make things go faster.<br><br><br>5.) Automate<br>\tElon\u2019s personally made the mistake of going backwards on all 5 steps \u2014 multiple times. On the Model 3 He automated, accelerated, simplified, and then deleted. One example is fiberglass mats on the top of the Model 3 battery packs in between the floor pan and the battery and it was one point choking the battery pack production line. He was basically living on the battery pack production line trying to fix the line because it was choking the entire Model 3 production program. The first mistake was he tried to fix the automation \u2014 he tried make the robot better, making them move faster, shorter paths, increase the torque, etc. Instead of spackle and glue on the entire battery pack, just put little dabs of glue because the fiberglass mats are sandwiched between the battery pack and the floor plan anyways, so all you need is something to hold them in place until you bolt the whole battery pack into the car.<br><br>So automating was a mistake, then accelerating was a mistake, then optimizing was a mistake. The finally he asked \u201cwhat the heck are these mats for?\u201d and asked the Battery Safety team and if they were for fire protection or something? They said no, they are for noise and vibration \u2014 and he said \u201cbut you\u2019re the battery department\u201d \u2014 so he asked the Noise and Vibration Analysis team what it\u2019s for and they said \u201cFire safety.\u201d<br><br>Finally he said \u201cLet\u2019s try a car with the fiberglass mats and without, and put microphone in both and see if you can tell the difference.\u201d And you cannot \u2014 in fact, I was like \u201cWhich one is which?\u201d So we just deleted them \u2014 and just bypassed this complete $2 million robot cell.", "comment_date": "2021-08-10T00:48:07Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "S.

It must be a relief to have conversation with someone that can absorb and understand the concepts that are passed along from Elon as they flow. You can tell he appreciated the keeping of pace through the complete engagement he maintained while with you. Great to see Elon fully engaged intellectually like this. He\u2019s fun to listen to when he goes all in.<br><br>This is a very cool rare opportunity to allow folks to witness just HOW intense Elon\u2019s static knowledge of a massive range of process really is. It\u2019s incredible. This is not any sort of a slight aimed at folks like Bezos or Branson who both have facilitated some pretty awesome advances. But Elon is NOT just a guy with a big wallet and crazy big ideas handing off design and development to team leaders to solve/create. He is so far inside the specific operative dynamics of what he speaks on, its fantastic to follow along even if one is not fully knowledgeable of the details. Not many big picture type thinking folks are THIS informed of the hyper detailed aspects of the plan they desired to execute.<br><br>Elon is a super impressive guy who is EXTREMELY difficult to pin down for a long term engagement like this and we should all feel fortunate that you were able to keep him fully engaged in the process. There is SO much to learn from this guy if you carefully follow along. Imagine trying to explain the dynamics of pressure in a EV battery and shortly after shoot off into literal operative rocket fuel pressure science seamlessly, then, in the course of conversing these wide ranging attributes realize an engineering solution and then sort it on the spot. You can see the brain sparks flying out of the guys ears, lol.

I don&#39;t think so. <br><br>In the interview he admits several times that he is unsure of a number or detail and jokes about mistakes he and SpaceX made in the past. A narcissist would just bullshit and move on to the next brag. He gives credit to the original innovators of the full fuel flow engines, the Russians. A narcissist would claim all the credit.<br><br>His ideas about hardware development comes from the world of software engineering which has been using rapid prototyping and iterative development for years.  His remarks about testing are right on the mark in my view. Look at Microsoft&#39;s recent Windows bugs that were not found until new versions were released. Although the unit tests were probably OK, the final products were severely flawed after integration.<br><br>Some ideas that he throws against the wall don&#39;t stick however, like the hyperloop, which has too many practical drawbacks to be feasible IMO. These drawbacks include the enormous power requirements for the pumps and the severity and high chance of a catastrophic single point random failure or the chance of deliberately inflicted damage to the system. The cost of hyperloop is great compared to regular high speed rail or mag lev which in themselves are not cheap. Notice that he has passed hyperloop development to others and his test hyperloop is now just a rusty tube alongside the street. Hyperloop was a pet idea that just wasn&#39;t thought out enough before he went public with it.<br><br>-dave", "comment_date": "2021-08-07T10:37:28Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "oldbloke135", "comment_text": "Amazing video.

You should have made a magnetic rail tunnel embedded in the earth at a 50 degree angle of exit about 7 miles long, and you could launch all the fossil fuels into space using less than a third of the fuel,(will only  be needed for vector control and stabilizing) which is one of the primary expenses, using solar energy, transmitted from space using massive mirror arrays located in the north and south pole that reflect and focus massive amount of solar energy into orbital generators that transmit power back to earth via tight microwave beam, routed then via cables to the world.(transatlantic cable etc.)  You then can modularly launch humans , materials , fuel into space safely using the sun.  It would be far safer and efficient and better in every way.  You can launch modular massive 3d printer arrays that can land on a planet and establish a setup for landing and housing before you even arrive.  Using a simple tapered cone for insertion landing on a pad, like a mating fit would eliminate many issues.  It would be a simple frame construct sleeve affixed to a landing platform created as well by the 3d printers.  I love you all, but  the most ironic thing has occurred.  Your companies literally have every technology to do this , and are leading most,  yet you are choosing archaic methods over reasoning and higher scope logic, risking lives and material and wasting time.  Is it oversight, I imagine so, or you are already building one.  These are the only two options.   So, you have to be able to see in time if you really want to mastermind how to travel in space.  Otherwise you just waste it.  The 60&#39;s Harp project proved you can do this as well, yet with a mag rail tunnel, it could launch everything, safely, humans and all, using the sun, using fossil fuels where they actually won&#39;t cause us harm; in space.  <br><br>If anyone is presuming to judge me, just know that Yale and Stanford representatives came out to me when I was 15 to test me because of what happened in High School.  They said this, not me, that I am a creative genius off the charts.  A borderline genius with numbers and such, and I have excellent coordination, which effects more than just the body.  I have already created the fastest form of human powered transportation, which is a new form of bicycle that has a 1.5 times gain over any other bicycle or human powered set up , period.   I also just hacked my own cooling technique in which one of the presidents of the company that I acquired certain components from contacted me because no one has ever used their technology like I have, and I am achieving superior results all across the board, efficiency, safety, performance.   <br><br> I really hope all you arrogant naysayers wake up and learn how to find true masterminds, and not just assume things so much, BYE!", "comment_date": "2021-08-04T22:58:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Cliff", "comment_text": "What&#39;s with the nasty cut on Elon&#39;s neck?

It does not matter who gave them to you. It&#39;s particularly dangerous, if a smart person gave you the requirements, because you might not question them enough. Everyone&#39;s wrong, no matter who you are, everyone&#39;s wrong some of the time.\r<br>Whatever requirement or constraint you have, it must come with a\r<br>name, not a department. &#39;Cause you can&#39;t ask the departments, you have to ask a person, and that person who&#39;s putting forward, the requirement or constraint must agree that they must take responsibility for that requirement. Otherwise you could have a requirement that basically an intern two years ago randomly came up with, off the cuff and they&#39;re not even have the company anymore.\r<br>\r<br>2 - Delete the part or process\r<br>Try very hard to delete the part or process. This is actually very important. If you&#39;re not occasionally adding things back in (10%), you are not deleting enough.\r<br>\r<br>3 - Simplify or Optimize the part or process\r<br>The reason it&#39;s the third step is &#39;cause it&#39;s very common, possibly the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize the thing\r<br>that should not exist. And say, well, why would you do that? Well, everyone has been trained in high school and college that you gotta answer the question, convergent logic. So you can&#39;t tell a professor,\r<br>your question is dumb. You will get a bad grade. You have to answer the question. So everyone is basically, without knowing it, they got like mental straight jacket on that they&#39;ll work on optimizing the thing that should simply not exist.\r<br>\r<br>4 - Accelerate cycle time\r<br>You&#39;re moving too slowly, go faster, but don&#39;t go faster until you&#39;ve worked on the other three things first. If you&#39;re digging and you&#39;re great, don&#39;t dig it faster, stop digging your grave. But you can always make things go faster.\r<br>\r<br>5 - Automate<br>\r<br>Another mistake that has to happen in production is too much in-process testing. So when you were first setting up a production line, you don&#39;t know where things are breaking. You don&#39;t know where things are breaking, so you&#39;ll test like working process at various steps and &#39;cause you wanna isolate where&#39;s the mistake occurring?\r<br>So a very common issue with production lines is to not remove the end process testing after you diagnose where the problems are. So basically if you have like a very high acceptance, like if things are getting to end of line testing and are passing, then you don&#39;t need to do in-process testing. But what used to happened is they&#39;ll be like an initial development engineering team that will be like basically debugging the production line, but then they will forget to take out the in-process testing steps. So then what happens is the in-process testing tester will often choke the line production time. So really in volume production, if things are working well, you&#39;re really just taking a risk, will this subsystem be rejected in the training production process or at the end.", "comment_date": "2021-08-04T17:20:24Z", "likes_count": 2}, {"comment_by": "\u30b9\u30c6\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30f3", "comment_text": ":o", "comment_date": "2021-08-04T17:20:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pedro Rafael", "comment_text": "What a huge amount of information!

Redundancy is important, life-support is heavy, crews need adequate space, radiation shielding and additional cargo space are some of the obvious advantages.<br><br>You would still use Starships by docking several of them into the station.

Everyone should be empowered to be a lead engineer and should have high-level understanding of the entire system. If anyone has a problem with a constraint, go to that person and question their beliefs.<br>2. The best part is no part, the best process is no process.  If you aren&#39;t adding a part or process back in some of the time, you are not deleting enough.<br>3. Optimization is the third step, not the first step. Even the smartest engineers will work very hard optimizing something that shouldn&#39;t exist.  Avoid this.<br>4. You are going too slowly.

No matter who you are, everyone is wrong some of the time, all designs are wrong, it\u2019s just a matter of how wrong.\u201d<br>2.\tTry very hard to delete the part or process. If parts are not being added back into the design at least 10% of the time, not enough parts are being deleted. Musk noted that the bias tends to be very strongly toward \u201clet\u2019s add this part or process step in case we need it.\u201d Additionally, each required part and process must come from a name, not a department, as a department cannot be asked why a requirement exists, but a person can.<br>3.\tSimplify and optimize the design. This is step three as the most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize something that should not exist.<br>4.\tAccelerate cycle time. \u201cyou\u2019re moving too slowly, go faster! But don\u2019t go faster until you\u2019ve worked on the other three things first.\u201d<br>5.\tAutomate. An important part of this is to remove in-process testing after the problems have been diagnosed; if a product is reaching the end of a production line with a high acceptance rate, there is no need for in-process testing.<br>**Elon: \u201cI\u2019ve made the mistake of going backwards.

Have you considered that it is basically a giant tinny echo chamber. I think you could really improve that working area by spraying some sound deadening foam on the metal skins of that bay. It would still echo, but at a much more human friendly level (use a material that will not flake and corrupt the work). Another benefit would be some degree of temperature insulation and condensation inhibition. I&#39;m sure a lot of those guys are wearing foam ear plugs (or should be) which filter out a lot of the tinny echoing so it&#39;s not quite as clammoring and confusing as it would be otherwise. And I realize that coating the skin of the bay would be time consuming and expensive, but it could really improve the work space. It&#39;s not a REAL consideration. But perhaps next time the FAA has given you a moratorium and the guys have some time on their hands it can be a plan B task. Just a thought. And by the way, I would consider quitting my job today and moving to Texas to work in any capacity for Elon&#39;s vision. I think about it quite a bit. To be part of that. Money isn&#39;t everything. I never got a degree for the knowledge I obtained in industry. I just did it. And then I got older. Now I can&#39;t even apply for jobs that I could do because I don&#39;t have a piece of paper showing that I know things. I was laid off during the last recession, and now I drive a bus. I used to operate metal fabrication equipment in a shipyard. I&#39;d rather be a laborer at SpaceX on many days. I love my clients, mostly elderly people, so it IS rewarding. But NOT exciting or inspiring. Im 57 years young and still considering a move to Texas just to be part of the next phase of man&#39;s exploration.  Love these videos, it&#39;s the next best thing.
