The dry mass of Starship is ridiculous. The HLLV from NASA&#39;s SPS study had a similar payload to Starship, yet only 4000t weight when fully fueled (lese than simply the fuel mass of Starship!) - even with some mass reserve! Apparently, aluminium construction/winged flyback is a pretty efficient design! From what I can gather, the SPS HLLV has enough of a mass margin that it can afford to have a heatshield separate from the cryotanks, with an insulation layer in between. Most of the heat is blocked out by the tiles and insulation, and so the actual temperature affecting exterior of the tanks should be no worse than the rocket standing in summer sun. So not a 2500\u00b0C difference but only about 300\u00b0C - much better. So it goes 2500\u00b0C frontface -&gt; heat tiles -&gt; 100-300\u00b0C backface -&gt; insulation -&gt; -300\u00b0C tank interior. By splitting the load, you can also optimize the thermal systems - the tiles for high temperatures to medium ones, the insulation from medium to low ones. In addition, Starship absolutely needs a thick TPS, no matter the material - its tanks also serve as the outer hull, so the tiles have to handle the entire 2500\u00b0C -&gt; -200\u00b0C jump by themselves, the high melting point of steel doesn&#39;t matter. It would matter if the tanks were separate from the hull and it used a variation of the &quot;hot structure&quot; system proposed for the Dyna-Soar project, but Starship isn&#39;t built like that. There is a good point about the fatigue, but it isn&#39;t really tested - long-term wear and tear isn&#39;t really easy to predict. It could end up having higher maintenance needs than an aluminium construction, we can&#39;t know for sure until it is tested in actual conditions.<br>P. S. Plus, the heavy steel construction forces Starship to use baloon tanks, like the Atlas I/II - and everybody will tell you that rocket was incredibly difficult to handle and move around, since the structure tended to crumple and buckle at the slightest loads, and even collapsed if it lost tank pressure. And despite baloon tanks being one of the lightest tank constructions ever known, Starship is still incredibly heavy. So another hit against steel.", "comment_date": "2021-11-22T15:10:15Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "roi joi", "comment_text": "Oct 14th 2021l now, and I think SpaceX could do a ton of launches of propellant tanks, using separate LOX and fuel tankers that are just OBT (one big tank) of either, and which never come back to Earth, but instead form a tank farm in orbit, maybe a highly elliptical one, or whatever, but a very useful payload that decouples the cadence and count of Earth launches from launches to a Lunar orbit - or Mars for that matter. <br><br>Why now? Because if the Super Heavy works well enough to lift these, SpaceX does something useful while getting a lot of experience lifting at max weights while working out bugs, and the tank &quot;Starship&quot; is simple, cheap, and yet critical for the Artemis System. This will be very helpful in decoupling the testing of Super Heavy and Starship, in addition to decoupling the cadence of launches. Perhaps NASA could offer SpaceX a fixed price contract for each full tank placed in orbit. <br><br>Because there is no reentry, these simple OBT tanker ships might be better made out of aluminum, but maybe experience with the same material as the Lunar Starship is more valuable than the weight of propellant lost to a heavier tanker, whatever. Eventually there may be 3 propellant farms. LOX, Methane, and Kerosene for F9s lifting Crew Dragons to said orbit, allowing F9s to be fully reusable, which would be a nice way for the BFR to help out its little brother, AND put an end to the Orange Money-pit. Once the Lunar Starship is certified for crewed flight the F9s could be retasked, but the Kerosene tank-farm could be moved to a Lunar orbit to feed Merlin engines working in the much lower gravity of the Moon, or continue to make almost all F9 flights fully reusable here on Earth.", "comment_date": "2021-10-15T03:10:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "John Robinson", "comment_text": "Humans cool themselves in the same way.

I discovered how to make Starship 60 tons lighter and in a modular way by robotics. I am a discoverer for the perfect integral double bonds by stimulated emission of light in reactive titanium alloys. My discovery has already been granted in the US and allows manufacturing by estimated emission of laser light and automatisms using Starship as all launch systems 100% reusable and resistant to friction with the Earth&#39;s atmosphere. Perfect joints with controlled asymmetry on paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials in an inert atmosphere. It is convenient for Starship to modify its way of landing on earth. The vector control of motors is useful for the Moon and Mars in the absence of atmosphere in the first of the terms or low pressure and storms on Mars. Nor are there airports as if they are strewn on the globe. Therefore Starship should have landing and gliding with state-of-the-art avionics for the ground and the thrust vector as control for environments very different from the Moon and Mars. The systems are compatible and work very well on a multi-functional spacecraft. Less weight of the structures constructed of very strong and light alloys of titanium stamped matrices and joined by estimated emission of light ... I request urgent contact with Mr. Elon Musk. It is very serious and productive since I have all the rights acquired for the US territory ... It is excellent news because the initial accelerator is also convenient for its orbital recovery and fuel savings with better fines. Fuel by lengthening the orbital path can continue to accelerate Starship, and the system does not need to refuel in Earth orbit to continue its journey to Mars or the Moon.

And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T04:46:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Neil W", "comment_text": "Cold forming is usually done at room temp", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T15:51:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "WST", "comment_text": "Musk for President.", "comment_date": "2020-11-20T13:28:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u9673\u9d6c", "comment_text": "Steel has a much much longer life as a frame, it&#39;s very well known and there are many effective inspection and repair methods.

Whereas, if an object is not good at absorbing light (ie. reflects many frequencies), it is not as good of a blackbody, and thus doesn&#39;t emit heat in the form of light as effectively. One possibility could be that they made it reflective as to reflect heat from the sun during transit in space. I don&#39;t know their reasoning.

Issue I can see comparing it to the same type of cooling used in engine bells is that fuel is being used at high rate and then it&#39;s used in combustion,  so the additional heat is dumped during combustion. Using dump cooling would mean having to carry enough fuel or coolant to ensure proper cooling on reentry which seems like it would be a bad idea. The thing you would have to consider is simply not the strength to weight ratio, you would also not only have to consider that at the tempature being used also the amount of deformation at that tempature. For example and this is not linear for 310s but in the temperature ranges we are talking about it should be close enough, if you take a length of 600 inches of 310s or 50 feet, take it from 0 degrees farenheit to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, that 600 inches of 310s stainless is going to expand almost 11 inches. Depending on what carbon composite they were looking at it could very little thermal expansion. Even the space shuttle saw reentry tempature of 1600 degrees Celsius or about 3000 degrees Fahrenheit, the issue isnt if the material will take it alone, because alone I dont think it will last long just from being 500 degrees over its annealing tempature and the issues is going to be how do you cool it and further more how do you dump the heat from what you using to cool it, if your going to dump it over the side or figure out some way to cool it on board, but either way that is going to be a huge amount of additional payload that cant be used for other things.", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T05:32:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kaser", "comment_text": "I can&#39;t like the video &#39;cuz my YouTube feed will be full of space vids and elon musk vids ...<br>Ohhh, whatever !", "comment_date": "2020-02-11T21:13:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Buraga Nelson", "comment_text": "Platinum is the best to build rocket", "comment_date": "2020-02-11T00:24:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ivan Ffff", "comment_text": "I LOVE UR VIDEO IT&#39;S SO INTERESTING", "comment_date": "2020-02-10T21:36:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "jrdoza1980", "comment_text": "What about a rocket made of Graphene metal?

The Molten Salt Reactor technology (the MSRs, IMSRs, and MCFRs) will need to work at 550C (and later at 1050C and higher). I have heard that stainless steel will be used to defeat the uranium/salt mixture at such temps, for months at a time. Companies like Terrestrial Energy, Elysium, and Terrapower, to name just three, are hot on the trail of prototypes which will be designed as modular, and mass produced, to quickly scale up to replace coal and gas plants, and meet a whole slew of new industrial processed heat applications, unattainble by LWRs, which work at a measly 285C and hence have much more limited commercial application. These designs it seems are all based upon various alloys of stainless steel, with the great temp characteristics you describe. As I understand it, INL and ORNL are working right now on optimal uranium/salt mixes, and materials testing to defeat brittleness. And btw, the coming Gen IV MSRs will work, not at the 70 atmospherers of LWRs, but the pressure of a garden hose!<br><br>Got carried away. Forgot my question! But your presentation has fired my imagination into a very badly needed breakthrough in low carbon energy. SS could be a key part of that.

The cost of the stainless steel depends upon the alloy used (there are thousands - and they&#39;re all very very different), but you&#39;re still right - the carbon composite process and cost is prohibitively expensive and time-consuming.<br>2. Another interesting alloy that is what is used in stainless steel ball bearings, which are typically made from 440C (which is too brittle and can cause failure) were replaced with carburizing stainless steel 675 Stainless (a fascinating topic in itself that got addressed after the challenger disaster)<br>3. Testability for failure was left out. Carbon composites make detecting flaws (especially in a reusable rocket) a tricky business. When you are working with stainless, the techniques are well-established and test are not particularly expensive to run - which would be a consistent expectation before every new launch. It might be an interesting episode to talk about how certain materials can be tested for things like risk of failure - where small defects can be disastrous.<br>4.

I was reading a few years ago about a new process of hardening shaped carbon fiber by electric discharge plasma. It seems nothing ever came of the process that was discovered by some university lab. So, there&#39;s progress to be made, on reducing the cost per square foot of space durable carbon fiber. But instead Musk leaps back 50 years. SMH<br><br>In order to auto lathe Carbon Fiber you have to have a vacuum oven bigger than the vehicle you&#39;re making. There&#39;s only a few of them in the whole world. Generally people making space craft or aircraft rent the auto lathe for a day from the company that owns and operates the autolathe. So it costs about a million dollars or more to rent it for 1 day. So that&#39;s one of the major expenses of working with carbon fiber on large craft. If this electric plasma discharge process was developed to an extent that it was utile, then maybe Musk could make spacecraft in carbon fiber at less cost. <br><br>You burn a fire. Every bit of the charcoal left over is carbon. EVERY BIT OF IT is thus useful for making carbon fiber. To make steel, you have to burn so very much wood for melting rocks and for every rock you melt you get a tiny BB worth of steel. Think about the size of that bb, compared to the size of the charcoal pile. How can it possibly be more expensive to make carbon fiber, than it is to make steel? The reality is that it&#39;s not, there&#39;s just a LOT more people who are today making steel and there&#39;s a lot more effort put in to making steel, but carbon fiber is made by nearly nobody no where. So it&#39;s in short supply and not because the materials are not available in abundance, because anything can be burnt and will yield carbon, everything except for pure metals anyhow. But it&#39;s in short supply because there&#39;s NEARLY NO MANUFACTURING OF IT. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s because it&#39;s all produced by copyright protected processes and those people who hold the copyright, don&#39;t want to empower all humanity, they want to empower 1% against the rest of us. That&#39;s why you can&#39;t buy a carbon fiber car for less than a few hundred thousand dollars, because the copyright criminals are running a racket, using copyright to hold back all of humanity, not just on carbon fiber but on so much technology it would make your head spin to hear all the suppressed technology.", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T16:27:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thyago Jos\u00e9 Guilherme", "comment_text": "what happened at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LogE40_wR9k&amp;t=7m42s\">7:42</a> ???", "comment_date": "2019-02-15T15:00:43Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ArthurDent0042", "comment_text": "I had to admit that I was scratching my head on the recent BFR changes.

I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t divert too much into the challenges of epoxies and whatnot in carbon fiber, too. :) I suspect that nanotech construction techniques--which probably won&#39;t be developed for at least a decade--could re-write the carbon story, but let&#39;s not go there lol<br> <br>My main concern about a trip to Mars is not the ship: It&#39;s how they expect to survive while on Mars, and how they will replenish, whether it be for a permanent colony, or a return trip.<br>I&#39;ve heard they want to make fuel on Mars. I wonder how they plan to set up the industry for that, which must include transportation of raw materials, resource extraction, and many other details which are trivial on Earth, but potentially stupendous efforts in the effective vacuum of Mars. You can&#39;t just pressurize Martian atmosphere and expect to get breathable air, after all. I&#39;m not willing to bet anyone&#39;s life on the actual availability of water, materials to source oxygen and other essentials for air, and foodstocks replenishment. You can&#39;t expect even hundreds of tons of payload to carry enough to keep the crew (colonists?) alive for years, much less psychologically stable.<br> <br>I think they need to send multiple automated cargo ships ahead, with packaging capable of surviving bad landings--there are bound to be a couple of those--and re-usable rocket shells that can be used for temporary housing when the manned missions arrive. I&#39;m also pretty sure they&#39;ll want smelting capability, and will want to have underground facilities, even if they&#39;re only going to be there for a few months.<br> <br>I talk too much lol!

I know the number are not right, Lets just assume they are. If a composite rocket cost 600m to build and Stainless cost 6m to build. That would be 60 rocket for the cost of one. Being that stainless is a much faster process to build, lets assume that you can build a composite rocket in say 10 units ( this can be days, weeks or what ever you want ) and stainless steel takes 1 unit.  You can now build 10 rockets in the time it takes to build one composite rocket. Being that stainless steel is a much faster process and does not require the extensive requirements as composite, You could have more than one location building rockets with much more ease than say composite. Now that you have the ability to build a lot of rockets at a faster and cheaper rate.  You can now deliver payloads of up to 100 tons, This means you can ship off more rockets to mars at much faster rates. We know that the trip can take 150-300 days ( shorter depending on speed and other factors ) There are 21 active launch pads world wide while 3 of them have ever launched humans. You can launch 60 rockets on a time loop so that a rocket lands say every few days or every week. Thus dropping off loads after loads of stuff to mars. Some day Space Truckers will be a real thing and we will see rocket launches every day.

If the material is cheap it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s cheap to manufacture. Some metals are easy to weld, some are hard to weld, some things can only be cut with a special ultrahard saw. etc. The manufacturing costs depends on the processing (bending, cutting, welding, glueing)<br>And <b>in Aerospace there simply is no such thing as</b> a 60 times cheaper material. A material that&#39;s 10% stronger at the same weight can (in some cases) double your profitability. &quot;60 times cheaper&quot; is not how it works, period.<br>Here is <b>an example to show why:</b> if a certain rocket can lift up with 100tons of weight, and that 100 tons consists of 75 tons of fuel, 22 tons of it&#39;s structure and 3 tons of payload; and then you take that rocket and make the structure of the rocket with a material that&#39;s 10% stronger,  then you could theoretically (if you really oversimplify it) make the structure 10% lighter. Then you still have a rocket that can still lift up 100 tons, and the fuel is still 75 tons, but the structure now weighs 20 tons, so you have 5 tons left for the payload. So the max mass of the satellite you can take with you went from 3 to 5 tons...<br>If a rocket engine has a lower efficiency, and it wastes more fuel into heat but it has more power, then you can still have a more efficient rocket. Here is why: let&#39;s say I make a rocket engine with an efficiency of 100%, it turns 100% of the chemical energy into thrust, but my rocket engine produces just as much thrust as the weight of the rocket, then it means my rocket will just hover in one spot and not lift up. Then my buddy makes a rocket engine that&#39;s 10% efficient, but it produces a thrust that&#39;s 5 times as much as the weight of the rocket, then he will lift up and accelerate upwards with almost 40m/s\u00b2.<br>Simple conclusion: just don&#39;t fall for marketing wank. These numbers mean nothing. No, really, absolutely nothing, if you don&#39;t know all the details. Especially if you are talking about a reusable rocket where fatigue comes into play, which is a major factor of the cost. If something is strong but unreliable, you need extra strengthening or other fixes to take care of that. These fixes can cost you way more than you&#39;ve saved in the first place. I&#39;m not saying stainless that moving to steel is a bad choice, because I had my doubts about carbon in the first place; I&#39;m just saying this 60 times cheaper material can make a rocket both cheaper and more expensive, it depends on the implementation, it&#39;s all in the details.", "comment_date": "2019-02-03T16:58:33Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Johnathan Parker", "comment_text": "Small criticism: Please remain consistent with the comparison of units.

Obviously reducing the structural cost of the rocket that dramatically will be a huge step towards increasing the number produced, especially if the material (steel) is common (which it is).  It means that any factory that can turn out large thin steel plates could take on a contract to build some of the rocket parts, reducing the need for specialist manufacturing and further lowering costs.  One of the major stumbling blocks of rocketry is how specialized and expensive it is to build a rocket, so if the Starship project can at least partially fix that problem it will have overcome one of the global problems with rocketry in general.  Carbon composites are great for a lot of things but so far as I know they still don&#39;t have such a broad range of properties that they can replace every material effectively, and as their cost attests the facilities for mass producing them are still no match for the steel industry.

At least that&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever heard of before. I think it was meant as normal coldforming of steel sheets which just means forming the metal at temperatures below recrystallization temps. <br>The forming of the metal increases the amounts of dislocations inside the lattice structure. Dislocations hinder the movement of atoms along the lattice structure which in effect increases the strength of the material. If the metal was over recrystallization temperature, the dislocations would disappear as the crystal reforms. <br>So the problem with cold forming is that the metal gets harder and harder and thus harder to form, especially if you have to apply stress over a long roller. I guess that is what Dawson engineered and can handle now. <br><br>The cryogenic part I think is referring to cryogenic hardening. So after hardening you cool the metal to cryogenic temperatures. This helps transform rests of austenite to martensite and furthermore creates a high density of gaps in the lattice structure which can be filled with special carbides that form during a subsequent tempering process. This further increases strength even beyond martensite. This is a fairly new technique and I&#39;m not sure it has been done to parts as big as rocket fuselages yet.<br><br>I actually think using steel or even aluminium is a smarter choice for reusable rockets. Unlike metals, carbon composite parts fail catastrophically without a lot of forewarning since they do not really deform before breaking. They just get not visible micro fractures and suddenly they fail. Metals on the other hand will deform first which gives them a little bit of extra time to work and hopefully fix before a part breaks. So if a rocket lands an inspection should relatively easily find parts that are about to fail and can be replaced preemptively.<br><br>Disclaimer: That said I&#39;m not a metallurgist either.

The main booster engines were in the shuttle, but the fuel tank was this massive balloon thing attached to the belly. And the retrievaL And retrieving the drowned SRBs and reconditioning them was nearly s expensive as new ones. Also, the Shuttle could not achieve high orbit, and the payload was ridiculously small.

Not sure what you are talking about. SS has a very low infrared (IR) emissivity (&quot;low e&quot;) which means it does a poor job of radiating heat. Thus, if a surface is getting hot (due to, say atmospheric heating during re-entry, for example), giving it a lower emissivity will cause it to get hotter since it can&#39;t radiate off the heat as well as a &quot;high e&quot; (e.g. black) surface (per the Stefan-Boltzman law, heat is radiated proportional to emissivity). Now, if your SS surface is not the one being heated but some other surface nearby is being heated, then making your surface low e (like SS) will help because the low e means it also is a poor absorber of heat (per Kirchoff&#39;s law of radiation, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_law_of_thermal_radiation)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_law_of_thermal_radiation)</a>. This why extremely shiny surfaces (like highly polished SS), which have low e, are used as thermal shields; see, for example, <a href=\"https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=914418\">https://ws680.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=914418</a> where they are trying to used highly polished SS to shield something from a nearby hot surface.<br><br>So, if SpaceX is using SS on the outer surface of the rocket, it&#39;s going to get hot due to atmospheric heating (which happens independent of the surface finish), and making it low e means it would get hotter than making it high e (black). See for example, pg 184 of <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/584728main_Wings-ch4b-pgs182-199.pdf\">https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/584728main_Wings-ch4b-pgs182-199.pdf</a> which talks about the heat shields on the Space Shuttle, where it states &quot;Several types of Thermal Protection\r System materials were used on the Orbiter. These materials included tiles, advanced flexible reusable surface insulation, reinforced carbon-carbon, and flexible reusable surface insulation. All of these materials used high-emissivity coatings to ensure the maximum rejection of incoming convective heat through radiative heat transfer.&quot; The last sentence is the key. And note that the space shuttle heat shields are all black (which is high e).<br><br>Anyway, not sure what you are trying to say here, so might to re-phrase it. Bottom line is: black/matte colors are good for rejecting heat, (they are actually other non-black surface finishes that are also high e, like optical solar reflectors (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_solar_reflector)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_solar_reflector)</a>, but let&#39;s keep it simple) and &quot;shiny&quot; metal like polished SS is the opposite and hence terrible at rejecting heat.", "comment_date": "2019-02-01T11:13:56Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Mike Bevan", "comment_text": "Material scientist?

First, I grew up in the 1960s and 70s. What was drummed into my head by all the B-films of the era, especially the Italian films, is that all rockets were to be shiny, have massive fins, and not many other interesting features. Then films like &#39;2001 A Space Odyssey&#39; and &#39;Star Wars&#39;, screwed all that up! I took years to retrain my brain, to go scribble new drawings and doodles in my notebooks, instead of learning in school(!) I had to toss all of my old drawings of space alien saucers being blasted by Raygun wielding, shiny, finned rockets.  At my age, retraining my brain again, to think in 1950s era, Willy Lee rocket styling is just too much to ask!<br><br>Also, on a more serious note, I can&#39;t help to think the carbon fiber to stainless steel comparison a bit off. Is the pricing of the carbon fiber (with wastage) a determination of finished prices? Or is the measure of a measly $3 a kilo of stainless steel, raw or in machined pricing? If that&#39;s the case, I smell a bit of used car salesmanship going on. Although I&#39;m sure it would be still way less than the cost of manufacture of finished product.<br><br>What is interesting is that the manufacturing of stainless steel components is a well known technology in which very little, specialized manufacturing processes would be required in-house. Heck, I bet the Chinese could knock out the components in no time withe their manufacturing resources. This seems to lead to another interesting thought.

To make a rocket the size of the Starship with aluminum, the metal would have to be quite a bit thicker than when built with stainless steel.

Carbon fiber composite could still come in lighter than aluminum or stainless steel for the big rocket, but its thickness would have to more than using aluminum. Given the cost and complexity, carbon fiber composite&#39;s advantages VS stainless steel rapidly declines as the size of the rocket increases.<br><br>Volume increases x3 as size goes up while surface area only increases x2, which roughly equals the rate that the amount of material required goes up with rocket size. Thus for smaller rockets like the Falcon 9 or Blue Origin carbon fiber composite saves a lot more weight over metal per unit of rocket volume than it does on a big freaking rocket.

Also, the fatigue life of stainless steel is well understood.  Not so much for carbon composites, which haven&#39;t been around as long.  If you cyclically load something, like you would pressurizing and flying a rocket, its fairly well known how that would affect stainless steel.  Not so for carbon composite.

Just a couple of things to note;<br>First, cold forming is just shaping a material without heating it up, no need to cool it down to cryogenic temperatures. Think like bending a hair pin.<br>Second, cold forming steel actually increases its strength because you&#39;re adding energy to the material and takes all that energy and deforms plastically. Plastic deformation is when you bend a material beyond the elastic point, I.e. the point where it won&#39;t return to its original shape. Think again that hair pin, bending it is easy but unbending it needs a bit more energy to do, you feel it stiffening up.<br>I haven&#39;t read up on what SpaceX is doing, but I&#39;d assume they&#39;re cold forming it to increase its strength. It&#39;s easier to shape steel when it&#39;s heated up, but depending on how you cool it down, it would have the same strength as before shaping.<br>The problem with cold forming is that your essentially damaging the material to make it stiffer. But stiffening it would make it more prone to cracking.

I believe the composites talked about in the video are what is known as PMCs, or polymer matrix composites and as Tim mentioned, these do degrade at lower temperatures due to oxidation, cracking, and debonding, which ultimately weakens the bonding of the materials. There are another class of carbon composites called CMCs, or ceramic matrix composites. These materials can last up to 4000F before oxidation occurs, provided their is a good coating around the matrix itself, but that depends on the type of fiber being used. I won&#39;t delve too much into that and just stick with Carbon based CMCs. Thus they don&#39;t have the limitations of 301 Stainless Steel, which has a melting point of 2500-2600F.<br><br>The type of cooling that Tim talks about is called transpiration cooling and has been considered for a variety of uses for a little while now. The main reason why you don&#39;t see it employed often is because its considered a waste of mass on aircraft. The sole purpose of the fluid being used for transpiration is to be carried off of the aircraft. Other options of cooling currently being investigated for the purpose of cooling are using heat pipes or circulating fuel/other fluid around the aircraft. Each has drawbacks and advantages.<br><br>Finally, just because stainless steel can survive reentry doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t have heat shields. The main purpose of BFR is to be reusable and that isn&#39;t necessarily possible if the ship looks like the photo presented within the video. Heat shields aren&#39;t only for protection of the vehicular structure either. There are many subsystems that must be below a certain temperature to perform and in addition, it isn&#39;t comfortable for humans to sit in temperatures anywhere near what the surface undergoes so they also limit the temperature penetration within the cabin of the vehicle.", "comment_date": "2019-01-30T22:06:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "thibaud drion", "comment_text": "Still have a question, if they knew it before, why didn\u2019t they made stainless steel rocket in first hand?

Making huge things out of carbon fiber is REALY hard to do and no one realy did it. We are getting there at some point, but the time does not seem to be here atm.<br><br>Your price comparison is quite unfair since they are not going to use household stainless steel. They have to use austenite steel (these are the ones not getting brittle when cooled down - regular steel will just shatter) with high chrome and nickel contents wich are quite costly. I guess it&#39;s still going to be cheaper than carbon fiber (due to the high manufacturing cost of CF), but not the huge difference some may expect. <br><br>Steel is also good for the BFR because of it&#39;s size - I am very certain, that steel would not be a good option for smaller rockets. <br><br>The only real contender for steel would be a titanium alloy - but these do have their own share of problems at temperatures above ~800\u00b0C. It&#39;s either going to oxidize or (due to the lack of an atmosphere since methane is bleeding out of the structure) hydrogen from the methane is going to diffuse into the titanium - and that&#39;s even worse. I still think the tanks could be lighter (but certainly not cheaper) if made out of titanium, but I am also certain that SpaceX has run the numbers and came to the best conclusion with the system as a whole in mind.<br><br>For someone without much knowlegde of metallurgy you did a realy good job!

If steel(stainless including) has higher hardness it will get a lot less though(the ability to withstand sudden shock) which means it gets brittle, as shown in Cody&#39;s Labs example the cast iron is the hardest of all steels but it will even shatter in room temperatures because of it&#39;s high hardness. If cryogenic temperatures  increases hardness of stainless steel will mean it gets brittle where it might not withstand the vibration of the rocket.", "comment_date": "2019-01-30T20:28:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Christopher Pardell", "comment_text": "So... at re-entry temps, methane vaporizing out the pinholes is mixing with ordinary air, which has oxygen... is it not going to simply ignite like a spaceship shoes Bunsen burner?

I also followed the X-15 flights avidly. I knew back then that the Atlas was very different from its cousins, the Thor (which became the basis for the Delta series) and the Titan missiles which were made from Aluminum. <br>While I understood that the aluminum construction of the Titan was rather heavy and similar to what became the Saturn V, itself an outgrowth of the german V-2 construction techniques, I had to wonder for quite a few years how the Thor/Delta managed to have such a smooth outer skin, while corrugations and riveted panels composed the the others. Sometime near the end of the 20th century the method used for the Thor was declassified, and the extremely expensive machining of internal wavy channels that rendered 0.5&quot; thick aluminum tank walls into very thin, but very strong tanks was revealed. <br>In some ways, the Atlas and the Russian R-7 stories also tell the story of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each country&#39;s early ICBM efforts. The original design for the Atlas program would have had the same &quot;throw weight&quot; and a similar arrangement of booster engines and sustainers all lit on the ground that both rockets used. The R-7 of course became the Soyuz because the Russians could not afford to start over when hydrogen nuclear weapon size shrank significantly for both programs. So they went ahead with the bigger rocket. The Alas was revised downward, possibly allowing for the stainless balloon structure, or at least allowing it to be much thinner for the same capability. <br><br>While during that period, post sputnik, where the Russians seemed to be one step ahead of us every time we announced a new effort to utilize space for something not related to weaponry, something more practical for human civilization&#39;s continued existence, the Atlas did one amazing thing its stainless balloon tank technology allowed for. With no payload atop it and only a small radio transmitter and tape player shoehorned into one of its side fairings, in December 1958 it lofted itself entirely into orbit (minus the booster engines, but the whole tank assembly) with a message of peace and goodwill from President Eisenhower to the world. For the first time we had orbited more mass,(and had nearly achieved a single stage to orbit) than the Soviets could with their stronger, but heavier missile. <br>Of course, the Soyuz booster system was also more robust, as we know so well today.", "comment_date": "2019-01-30T19:55:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "855MAGICAD", "comment_text": "GREAT presentation!!", "comment_date": "2019-01-30T19:55:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "pHoEn|}{-GR", "comment_text": "meteorologist", "comment_date": "2019-01-30T19:54:47Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kalle Bengtzon", "comment_text": "Jetengine hot components tend to be titanium alloy since it is better when hot than stainless Steel.

The cost savings alone is a game changer for Starship. With a Falcon 9 costing almost $99 million (weight * $180 / kg, yes, not exact as not everything is made of carbon fiber but this illustrates the point), swapping that for stainless it would cost only $1.6 million. $99 million vs $1.6 million. Yeah... that alone completely alters the equation for rocket manufacture. Throw in the weight and cost savings for a heat shield and it&#39;s even better. I had missed his tweet about the cold forming of stainless... but the ease of doing that with stainless is another solid win. And how utterly simple it is to get your hands on the material and work with it... there is literally zero downside to this. And once you look at the math and physical properties of it all it really becomes a no brainer. They aren&#39;t really compromising here at all... every single aspect of this is firmly in the win column.
