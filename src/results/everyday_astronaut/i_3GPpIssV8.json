Contrary to popular opinion, Wernher von Braun was actually the first person to address the idea of landing rockets for use in Mars travel, and NASA has been toying with the idea ever since. You see, landing a rocket on Earth after launching it from earth is one thing. The 4 phase dispersion/correction algorithm necessary to accomplish this was finished in the last decade, and is used to above 60% reliability by SpaceX. But launching a rocket from Mars and landing it on Earth is a different matter entirely. Not that it is at all impossible, but it will require a long series of experimentation with autonomous deep space navigation systems, in addition to other problems, like radiation shielding, thermal breakdown, and TEI injection from millions of miles away. Falcon X missed their trajectory with the Tesla roadster from low earth orbit, and they will have to make some serious progress to be able to &quot;shoot accurately&quot; from 60 million miles away.

It is still experimental at this point. The savings of reusabiliy have yet to be proven.The question really is: how reusable? What will the REAL costs be? This has to take into account recovery failure rate (10%? 30%?), the costs of refurbishment, the number of times the engines can be reused. Remember, the space shuttle main engines had to be completely rebuilt after each use. The &#39;airliner analogy&#39; is deceptive. Going into space is a vastly different proposition from flying place to place on earth. In order to reach earth orbit, the fuel is at least 80% of the take off weight. The engines must be about a 1000 times more powerful than an airliner engine of the same weight. Items such as the engines and the vehicle structure are under many times the stress of these components in  aircraft.
