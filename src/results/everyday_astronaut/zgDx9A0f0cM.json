[{"comment_by": "Andrew 13579", "comment_text": "The possibility of an unmanned Starship going to Mars in 2022, I would say, approaches zero.  There&#39;s still a major amount of development to be done.   Super Heavy...not even a mockup or intitial test article yet.  Still waiting for a hop of the full Starship tanking system body.  I know development is fast, but it&#39;s too slow and failure-plagued for 2022, or really even 2024.  Would be lucky to see orbital flight by 2022.  And manned rating?  I&#39;m just not sure that can ever happen.  Need like 100 perfect Starship reentry and landings in a row, in my opinion.  They are still describing Falcon9 booster landings as, &quot;hope to have a landing&quot;.  If they could get Starship to orbit by 2022 with functioning, but unoccupied crew section, then I would say build a fleet of 5 and launch one of them about every 3 to 5 days for a year, with no more than one lost vehicle, and only within the first 15 launches...just to rapidly  build the necessary confidence in the vehicle design.  Would it take several on orbit refuelings of a Starship, just to have it do a circumlunar mission?  If so, not sure this is the way to go.  I think Starship might be a shuttle craft.  Keep a dozen on Earth and send a dozen to Mars to serve as Martian shuttles from Martian surface to Mars orbit and back.  Maybe something that never touches atmosphere should make the trips from Earth to Mars and back.", "comment_date": "2020-07-20T23:22:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Megattron", "comment_text": "if you have 10 gig why does your stream keep jumping?", "comment_date": "2020-07-20T21:52:06Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kelly Teacher", "comment_text": "I love how you just explained orbit.
