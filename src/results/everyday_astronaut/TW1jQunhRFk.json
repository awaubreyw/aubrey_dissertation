Currently, the fact that about 12,000 satellites are put into orbit is viewed with suspicion, filling the skies with more space junk. On the other hand Spacex keeps arguing that the albedo of their satellites is quite low and that once they occupy their orbits, they will be quite difficult to observe, just in the mornings or in the evenings... I for my part see that even though in space there are already several thousand satellites in orbit, the skies are still relatively clean of that kind of pollution, I think Spacex is aware of the impact of their project and they are taking it quite seriously. But what if Spacex could pay its debt to the astronomical community in a very original way? Imagine if each of those starlink satellites were equipped with a pair of small optical telescopes and a small radio telescope, one of the optical ones to take images of the earth, the other to take images of the firmament and the radio telescope to &quot;see&quot; in the radio spectrum...could each of these telescopes be put to the service of the scientific community...these telescopes in spite of being small and very similar to those that anyone could buy for their personal use, already put in space, would give much better results than on earth...and if they could be used together to perform interferometry?...imagine the level of resolution that would be had if they could be put to work together, it would be like a planetary scale telescope...it&#39;s just an idea...as an added value to the simple fact of providing the internet service...", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T02:29:25Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Boombozling !!", "comment_text": "Can i hug you Tim?", "comment_date": "2020-02-12T00:33:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roy Wessbecher", "comment_text": "Yes, Soyuz <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TW1jQunhRFk&amp;t=17m57s\">17:57</a> can&#39;t be mentioned enough - and usually isn&#39;t...", "comment_date": "2020-02-03T04:29:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dilip Sharan", "comment_text": "Did I hear you say Ultima Thule was the first binary object every observed up close and personal?

I admire your detailed discussion of each topic that you touch on in your videos! This is really cool!<br><br>I offer you a topic for a new analysis: make a video about the mass excellence (the ratio of the mass of the empty rocket to the mass of the filled (in Russian: \u043cassovoe sovershenstvo\\\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e)) of a rocket and a spaceship. There is little simple information on this subject; everything must be read in the special literature. And the parameter is very important. For example, if the ship\u2019s mass was near-zero (of course, it\u2019s impossible, but imagine (or simulate in the KSP)), then when there is very little fuel left in the tanks, the thrust to mass ratio will increase and the main supply of delta-V will be at the lowest supply fuel. That is, a decrease in the dry mass of a spacecraft directly increases its energy supply, although this is not obvious, because when the rocket is completely filled with fuel, the dry mass seems insignificant.<br><br>That is why Musk constantly talks about the mass excellence (the ratio of the mass of the empty rocket to the mass of the filled) of new ships (in general, I heard this phrase from him for the first time). To popularize space, I think this video will be very useful, especially if there is animation and demonstration (I just cheatfully reduced the mass of some details in the KSP to check what this leads to. The effect is not noticeable in the beginning, but it has a huge effect when the fuel on outcome). And I know, this is all described by Tsiolkovsky. But I didn\u2019t read it until I wondered ...<br><br>Somewhere I saw criticism of the Merlin engines, saying that it makes no difference how much the engines weigh, if compared to the mass of a full rocket, this is half a percent. And such articles are misleading. When the rocket is almost empty, the weight of all components is of great importance, including and the weight of the engines, especially if there are a lot of engines on board.<br>Thank you and hello from Ukraine!", "comment_date": "2020-01-07T11:01:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Starseed-bb", "comment_text": "Amazing video!! thanks for letting us space nerds live vicariously through you for another year lol", "comment_date": "2020-01-07T06:39:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thorsten Berg Content Creator", "comment_text": "Hi.

I had the opportunity to get amazingly drunk with Alexi Lenonov is in 1996. There was an Astronaut/ Cosmonaut convention in Quebec City. The whole group of them came down to my ship to hang out with a group of Canadian  Naval Sailors. Alexi spent the whole evening telling us stories about his career. After every story he would shout CHEERS (in Russian) and down a shot of vodka. I kept up to him drink for drink. I DOWNED HALF A BOTTLE OF Johnny Walker Red. He kept us entranced with story after story relayed through a translator. Fascinating man, he told one story about building a still on-board one of the MIR stations and brewing some sort of weird alcoholic beverage out of tomato juice. Great story. I escorted him ashore and saw him and his friends into their Limo. I then proceeded to barf all over the St. Lawrence river. It was the worst/ best hangover I ever had.

It&#39;s a charity stream going on for 12 hours, and features many popular German YouTubers and Streamers. It takes place in early December, and I happen to know that the manager and planner for this event has to start planning everything in *February*! Just as a heads-up on how much work it actually is to set up a live stream event with multiple live guests.<br>So although I really dig the idea of creating an actual award show, for 2020, especially since it&#39;s the first year, I&#39;d advise you to start off with a semi-live stream having you and your crew prepare live moderation, but with mostly pre-recorded, non-live interviews, maybe even just recorded over Skype if an actual meetup is impossible to arrange. It&#39;s much easier to have you and a your crew visiting them with the setup, than bringing 10 people to the studio, and have flights, accommodations and catering work for 2 days and studio space and tech equipment all working in a critical moment for an hour straight.<br>I do believe in your hard work, but live shows are harsh. Streams can lag. Microphones fail. Flights get delayed or cancelled. I really want the awards to become a thing, and it&#39;d be a shame for its reputation to become &quot;that thing where tech team tried to fix a sound issue for 25 minutes and 3 out of 5 award winners couldn&#39;t show up and comment on winning the award because life happens.&quot; So do yourself a favor and plan a show, but do the critical stuff that does involve other people beforehand so you have a second and third shot if something goes wrong.<br><br>All the best, I love your channel. In fact, I&#39;ve been recommending it to any person that is maybe just slightly interested in spaceflight (and to many who I suppose aren&#39;t even into spaceflight, or maybe weren&#39;t but now are thanks to your content).

In fact the 70mm film used back in those days is equivalent to the film used in the very large &quot;IMax&quot; film cameras for the studios which first used IMAX film over 15 years ago.<br><br>              In conclusion, the &quot;far side of the Moon&quot; was first visualized by NASA Apollo Lunar CSM space vehicles which carried extremely hi-res 70 mm film.  <br>             Just ask yourselves.  Why did Buzz Aldrin need to make a special trip on the return flight home from the Moon during Apollo 11 in order to retrieve film canisters from the belly of the CSM only to bring them onboard the &quot;Command Capsule&quot; and back to Earth?  Very few people are aware that Buzz had to make a very important EVA in order to retrieve those 70mm hi-def film canisters of the &quot;Backside&quot; of the Moon.", "comment_date": "2020-01-02T21:25:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Guy from Poland", "comment_text": "I have a question for &quot;why don&#39;t they just&quot;:<br>Will SpaceX use sort of beacons to guide starship during Mars landing?", "comment_date": "2020-01-02T21:21:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Colby Jones", "comment_text": "Awesome work Tim!

What makes SpaceX, in general, so exciting is that they&#39;re shaking up the status quo. I think Starhopper was the point when a lot of the public first thought that they might actually get to see people on Mars in their lifetime. It was putting action and funding into something that&#39;s been all talk and no action up until that point. In other words, it wasn&#39;t the feat itself that was so inspiring, it was the fact that the feat meant things are changing in a way that they haven&#39;t since the space race. It&#39;s inspiring because they said they were going to do this, they put the money into it, and then actually started on the path.

But there is something that you need to address instead of dismissing it with &quot;Space is hard!&quot;. <br><br>The trouble with the Starliner failure is that it points to underlying systemic problems within the Boeing. First, there was the failure to properly attach a parachute during the abort test and then there was the Starliner clock error. Both of these are unforced, quality control issues, that just shouldn&#39;t happen. For a company that spends billions of dollars of taxpayer money, this is very troubling.   This was supposed to be a full rehearsal for the eventual human flight and the QC should have been as strict as if there were astronauts on board. What if something even more serious slips during the manned flight? <br><br>Yes, the SpaceX Dragon exploded - on a surface a much more serious problem. But this was a complex, engineering problem - something the tests are indeed for and can be rationally solved. Also, it happened during a situation that is on its own extremely unlikely - a launch abort. Both Boeing failures happened during procedures which will be a part of every flight - something that is scary as hell and Boeing should be held responsible for it. Saying that everything else went well is a poor argument - during the last flight of Columbia everything before the re-entry went well too.  <br>The argument that space is hard just doesn&#39;t cut it here either, because the failures are human-related, not space-related and you should address that.", "comment_date": "2020-01-02T17:47:41Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Paulo Gandolfi", "comment_text": "Well done Tim.
