The whole \u201cgrass fire\u201d thing had me in a state of absolute shock and stupor!

Tony Stark smoked weed, right (not Robert Downey Jr. The entire world knows about his younger days!\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u26c4\ufe0f\u26c4\ufe0f\u26c4\ufe0f\u26c4\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f\u2744\ufe0f!!!!!!!

That COULD have ended SpaceX, Tesla and The Boring Company right there and cost thousands of people their jobs, or at the very least made their futures very shaky. He should have just waited for the final hour (I think that\u2019s how long they had left) to be up and then toked up! Lots less drama and a lot lower lawyer bills for that month!
