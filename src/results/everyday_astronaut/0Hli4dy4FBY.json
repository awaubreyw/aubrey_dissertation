Quantised inertia explains inertia, for the first time, by combining relativity and quantum mechanics.<br><br>    According to relativity, an accelerating object will see a Rindler horizon in the direction opposite to that of its acceleration vector. This is because information travels at the speed of light.<br>    An accelerating object will see itself surrounded by so-called Unruh radiation. The horizon splits virtual particles, so that they become real radiation.<br><br>Quantized Inertia combines these two predictions by saying that the horizon damps (reduces) the Unruh radiation on one side of the object. The resulting gradient in the quantum vacuum pushes the object back against it acceleration, explaining inertia", "comment_date": "2021-11-20T02:37:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Don Graham", "comment_text": "NASA will pay a staggering $146 million for each SLS rocket engine.

I&#39;m familiar with the Saturn V so will discuss that. In the S-IC first stage prior to launch, helium was bubbled through two of the long LOX ducts that led through the fuel tank. This had the effect of starting a flow of LOX up those two ducts and therefore down the other three ducts. This constant LOX flow had the effect of constantly replenishing the cold LOX within the ducts and therefore inhibiting the formation of gaseous oxygen (GOX) bubbles on the duct walls as heat leaked in from the kerosene fuel tank. If GOX bubbles were to be allowed to excessively form in the ducts, then at some point one would detach, join with other bubbles and form an ever growing bubble that would suddenly erupt at the surface of the LOX in the tank. This is the same mechanism at work on a volcanic geyser (like that at Geysir in Iceland, where the name comes from) except LOX is substituted for water and GOX is substituted for water vapour.", "comment_date": "2021-11-18T15:23:53Z", "likes_count": 5}, {"comment_by": "Jimbo Bimbo", "comment_text": "Great stuff!
