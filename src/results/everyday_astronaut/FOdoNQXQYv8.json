I have learnd a ton og rocket &quot;science&quot; from you as well as from other space enthusiast like you.

But i just wanted to let you know that you&#39;re channel is viewed all the way north in Iceland. Now you keep on doing videos and ill keep waching. And hey. If you want to make me feel &quot;special&quot; you can say in a video that it is being viewed in iceland by David (who keeps the lights og at nights hehe)  best wishes (btw neil Armstrong and buzz aldrin practised for the moonwalk here in iceland", "comment_date": "2019-02-13T00:52:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Garrison Boyd", "comment_text": "I bet that spacesuit smells terrible, he wears it in every episode", "comment_date": "2019-01-18T23:33:04Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Elgoog", "comment_text": "@<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOdoNQXQYv8&amp;t=14m55s\">14:55</a> I just noticed that the renderings show a less simultaneous landing than what actually happened :)", "comment_date": "2019-01-15T02:45:21Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Peter Payne", "comment_text": "Great video, we know how things turned out with Falcon Heavy, but I still really enjoyed coming back to this.

The pivot point of the left and right boosters will hopefully cancel each other out (to a degree - will never be the same).  Im guessing you dont want the top ones releasing one side booster with any time delay in relation to the other side.  Those bottom middle connectors look awesome and rather strong.  Would love to see one closeup.  Im guessing if there is any differences on the inward forces of each of the booster 1 and 3 release at the bottom middle connectors, could be adjusted on the middle booster after the release of the two side boosters.  Worst case scenario, the inward force of 1 and 3 do the old squash the base of number 2.  This may happen if the boosters 1 and 3 are released early in a denser atmosphere for what ever reason.

But I would not really count on all three stages landing correctly either - So my predictions are for a successfull launch but the destruction of at least one of the stages at landing.

It mostly depends on how robust the ignition is for each engine, if they can all light off as they should, and depends on the structures of the first stages, whether they can withstand the loads. I&#39;m sure that SpaceX has done their best to model all of it, and have probably over built the attaching structures in hopes that it will hold together long enough to get good data on shock waves, and aerodynamic load interactions. Even if it blows up soon after liftoff, it will be valuable to get the data, and I doubt they will blow up more than a couple of them in the DEV process. I&#39;m sure they have it wired to the hilt with telemetry, and sensors, to maximize data collection for this flight.  Will be exciting to see the launch, no matter what.  I&#39;m also suspicious that it will be successful, as they have had lots of time to try to get the modeling right, and they can over-build it, to try and get the data for the first flight, then start shaving off mass in successive flights.

Which may be followed by a decimal point for each launch to clarify which usage... so B1021.2 would be the second flight of first stage booster 21.<br><br>The Falcon 9 has seen major upgrades twice, has hinted in this video, and the comment that Falcon Heavy was not needed due to those upgrades..... with the latest version (1.2) being the final version.<br><br>There are however, &quot;minor&quot; tweaks to the 1.2 version rocket, which are designated Block 1-5, with block 5 apparently being the final update before work switches to BFR.<br><br>The first F9 v1.2 booster was B1019, so this was block 1, however it&#39;s very unclear when the switch to block 2 was made.<br><br>B1029 was the first &quot;block 3&quot; booster, and B1039 the first &quot;block 4&quot; version.<br><br>The last core made is B1045, which is also &quot;block 4&quot;, so no &quot;block 5&quot; boosters have been made to date.<br><br>Falcon Heavy is constructed from the only as yet un-flown &quot;block 3&quot; core, and 2 earlier recovered boosters which come from the &quot;unknown&quot; early period. so may be either &quot;block 2 or block 3&quot;.<br><br>It&#39;s interesting that SpaceX have recently announced that they will not try to fly any &quot;block 3&quot; boosters more than twice... which means that they have 1 more remaining, and I predict that when it comes to launching the PZA/Starlink payload on B1038 at the end of January, they will not attempt to recover the booster.<br><br>After that the only remaining flight worthy &quot;block 3&quot; booster if B1035, which has already flown twice, so will probably be stripped for parts and scrapped.<br><br>Falcon Heavy is a wildcard since it is built with block 2/3 boosters which might otherwise never fly, but only the centre core is significantly modified, and since this will be it&#39;s first flight, you might well see a second flight of the same &quot;Falcon Heavy&quot;, and I would guess they would build a new &quot;block 5&quot; core for commercial flights of &quot;Falcon Heavy&quot;, using at least &quot;block 4&quot; side boosters.<br><br>I also think the &quot;too many boosters&quot; meme is a bit over-stated.... since there are actually only 12 active cores, plus 11 retired ones some of which are being used for destructive testing or being displayed at museums etc.... and after January, the number of active boosters will drop to 8 or 9 depending on the outcome of the FH test... and all of those will be &quot;block 4&quot;.", "comment_date": "2017-12-24T14:15:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "magnus pym", "comment_text": "Can&#39;t wait!", "comment_date": "2017-12-24T14:07:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Sebastian Simbeck", "comment_text": "I think it will launch at the beginning of 2018 but I dont think it will be an succed", "comment_date": "2017-12-24T14:05:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Hale", "comment_text": "FYI a 737-100 max take-off weight.", "comment_date": "2017-12-24T13:53:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DOUG.
