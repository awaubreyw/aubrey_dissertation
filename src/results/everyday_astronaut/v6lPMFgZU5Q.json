And use a Starship lunar-commuter to go to and from the moon. So on the return journey, just power-up the Dragon already in orbit (or plugged into ISS), transfer crew, and to take them down in the Dragon capsule? Eventually, you&#39;d have 1 Dragon mission: (a) taking a new lunar crew up, and (b) a returning crew down. HOW EFFICIENT IS THAT! Who knows?

We&#39;ve got two solid rockets on the shuttle. Why aren&#39;t THEY our escape system? Because if we can get this thing to 200,000 feet it&#39;ll fly.

In the case of rockets, they tend to simply explode so you need one hell of a system to be able to save your crew.<br><br>I&#39;ve often wondered about simple parachute systems bound to the frame of these larger aircraft, I mean if you can make a parachute for a 70 ton tank then why not a couple for a 200,000 lb aircraft? I would understand the frame would be under some weird stresses so because of this the frame may have to be bulked up a little more adding more weight, which means less passengers and more fuel. Placing four across the top of the aircraft from the nose to tail to deploy in case of a nosedive situation might work no?<br><br>The other issue I found was that is it worth the expenses? Personally if you place yourself on a plane that&#39;s about to nose dive into the ocean wouldn&#39;t you be wishing for one? But when you have something like 4 billion people fly per year and only have 534 deaths for example in 2018, this goes to show that aircraft are far more safer than vehicles, then a lot of things. You have a higher chance of getting struck by lightning than you do dying in an aircraft.<br><br>So at that point I suppose it doesn&#39;t warrant this type of safety device because the amount of deaths from nosedives on commercial aircraft are virtually zero compared to how many people have successfully flown", "comment_date": "2021-08-06T17:02:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "bigwhiskey83", "comment_text": "What if humans where on board?

NASA will only use it as a Lunar Module returning to LEO for refueling after every mission. There are two main safety problems with the Super Heavy and Starship that I can see. The first one is the huge number of engines on the Super Heavy (28 to 32) that could create problems such as thrust instability due to engine malfunctions. The Soviet N1 failed because it had too many engines and an engine malfunction led to the rocket exploding on it&#39;s pad. The second one, involves the elongated shape of Starship, relative to it&#39;s landing base area when used as a Lunar Landing Module. The Lunar surface is not flat like a landing pad on Earth, so an elongated landing craft with a small landing base might be prone to tilting over.

So Starship using its upper stage engines is not a viable form of abort, you even mentioned that using the vacuum engines at sea level could cause catastrophic issues. This also applies in the case of using it in flight, if a Starship has to escape, not only does it have to escape from a booster that is exploding but now it also has to land with far more fuel than was intended for landing with, possibly with a TWR of  \u2264 1 depending on how early the abort was and how far the ship needs to boost back from. I also do not agree with the argument &quot;some thrust is better than no thrust in an abort scenario.&quot; Unlike Shuttle where the issues weren&#39;t realized until it was long operational, Starship is early enough in its design phase that this problem should be worked around, it should be built with a launch abort system from the very beginning and there isn&#39;t really an excuse otherwise other than just pure negligence.", "comment_date": "2021-06-04T09:30:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ian Randall", "comment_text": "The fact that NASA didn&#39;t send up a rescue crew for Columbia. while Columbia was in orbit .

With the renaissance of manned spaceflight hopefully well underway for the upcoming 20ies and 30ies, the number of incidents where lives would be saved will go up dramatically.

And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T06:53:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "RAMON Medina", "comment_text": "How spacex can save astronauts fron a starship EXPLOSION MISSING UPDATES!", "comment_date": "2020-11-24T01:56:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Allie Gottuso", "comment_text": "&quot;My car engine died 4 seconds before I got to my house, but I was close enough to walk the rest of the way.

I\u2019m wondering if they are planning on using redundant \u201celectric motors\u201d and probably gears, gear reduction systems to make the \u201ctorque\u201d requirements which I\u2019m guessing are pretty high to actually move those huge flaps against the air\u2019s force while acsent and reentry. I would think there would need to be a \u201ctransmission\u201d type device for each motor to up the torque, enough to have enough aerodynamic force and speed to effectively alter the spacecrafts; landing site especially in a emergency situation where quickly choosing an alternate landing site, also effectively changing the spacecraft\u2019s attitude and spin control during acsent and reentry. I\u2019m guessing at first they will use redundant motor\u2019s speed to more important torque, although electric motors do create much more torque than a gasoline engine (when comparisons are done in cars) although I wonder if they would have to use some kind of \u201ctransmission\u201d to reduce the speed in creation of more torque and reaction speed needed to work fast and reliablewould be a concern among other things but I believe Elon was quoted saying approx. \u201cThey changed the control systems for the flaps of the Starship to \u201cTesla electric motors\u201d I hope he is not just sticking those @car\u201d electric motors that are rated for well, cars...and use those same motors to directly and only using one or less that what would be considered more than twice the redundancy. (If that all makes sense, I apologize for any grammatical, spelling, and thought consistency; as I would like to write something worthwhile one day.) well I hope I covered every major possible issues with this change that frankly doesn\u2019t seem to be getting that much attention. <br>Love your work, great content, execution, and completion. Your ending production value is very nice, including your perfect video transitions and great overall audio. I\u2019m not much of an audio person, but just by pure comparison the quality is there.

I bet during accent when the Space Shuttle\u2019s S.R.B.\u2019s light on the pad and the whole vehicle is \u201cblasted\u201d into space almost like its being shot out of the barrel of a gun! (Even though I believe it\u2019s actually moving even faster than that when it\u2019s entering orbit) anyways watching your videos it so makes me want to try to get some good equipment and do some videography/photography/video editing/effects/audio etc. and maybe I could actually put some of my graphic design and multimedia courses could actually do something worthwhile.

Challenger likely would not have failed if they had not launched outside of operational limits.  albeit the o-rings didn&#39;t leave much room for error.  I doubt they ever tested the SRBS to see what the limits were other than in the lab.  How many fully functional unmanned shuttles launched, or equivalent without a real shuttle to test operational limits?<br>Doing so would mean accepting possibly losing 2 SRBS, and 3 RS25&#39;s, not a cheap loss.  SpaceX has already lost 2 Falcon Heavy boosters, one in testing limits.  Then going back and seeing what can be done to improve that.  At the very least they know for sure what is the limit.<br><br>I wonder if they are prepared to accept 1 or 2 failures of the starship before putting crew on board, just to test operational limits.  I hope they learn from the failed shuttle missions and fully investigate and test any anomaly during real flights, make necessary changes before a disaster involving crew occurs.

My last manufacturing job I was a safety auditor.  As such I learned about safety ratings on equipment.  The rule of thumb is that in order to say something is rated for a specific number, it had to be able to withstand up to five times that number.  For example.  A winch could not be rated for 1000 lbs unless it had a breaking point at or above 5000 lbs.  You can&#39;t say a chair is rated for 300 lbs unless the breaking point is at or above 1500 lbs and you can&#39;t say a bolt is rated for 50 lbs unless it has a breaking point at or above 250 lbs and so on.  This is standard with all manufacturing.  So to say that something should be designed at 1.5 times the expected load or stress is a very poor substandard design and explains why NASA  had three catastrophic failures resulting in loss of human life.

I think ideally space vehicles will have not just automated but, especially where automated systems may not be appropriate or useful also pilot options for even unlikely catastrophic failures but accomplishing these throughout the envelope will take time beyond initial deployment of the vehicle type, so can never really stop being a work in progress in terms of safety. For example an automated launch pad escape system has some predictable problems with specific conditions where a manual operation would be preferable in order to avoid the kind of situations seen in Airbus disasters with pilot lockout automation that would not have occurred in a Boeing where the pilot has more immediate vehicle control in priori to completely understanding the nature of the in flight failure, where time to determine and intellectually respond to the failure through the management system as opposed to direct control simply isn&#39;t present before loss of the aircraft occurs, where even redundancies of the automated flight system giving over limited pilot control also failed due to the nature of the original system failure, operator equipment variations and crew unfamiliarity with hands on vehicle control in that type in the first place. There&#39;s been a few automation related air disasters, typically Airbus and from things as mundane as incorrect calibration of the radio altimeter or the ground crew forgot to remove a sensor cover and the safety systems killed the plane whilst cockpit voice recorders relate the screams of crew frantically trying to manipulate the controls and being overridden by the automated systems, then crash investigators wondering how on earth a pilot manages controlled flight into terrain in perfect flying conditions and visibility, without any mechanical failures of the aircraft whatsoever. Certainly far fewer direct control circumstances exist in relation to space flight beyond the realm of orbital manoeuvring however at least at the pad a fully automated escape system has already demonstrated the cost of treating crews like monkeys in space suits even if, for the most part in space flight that&#39;s what an astronaut has to be.<br><br>But it does seem counter-intuitive to use a rocket escape system because of the inherent dangers associated with rockets. An ejection capsule like the F111 doesn&#39;t seem practical for a capsule type of spacecraft but for a vehicle like Space-X&#39;s it&#39;s not unlike an aircraft layout as an ultra lightweight, flying gas tank with some people and cargo crammed inside and it&#39;s really the people and gas tank part that ought to have some kind of separation, I feel if just for a sense of well being. I don&#39;t want to be in that super unlikely case of a static pop followed by a sudden sense of freedom. I&#39;d want an F111 type escape capsule on a purely manual operation that won&#39;t help at all in most cases but that part where you&#39;re on the climb and ground control is radioing Oh My God No! I can pull it and ask what&#39;s up on the ground later, or I&#39;m just not feeling real good about this re-entry breakup I can separate in a shielded section and sacrifice the reusable spacecraft that, well it&#39;s not coming back anyway. You get the idea. I mean I&#39;m not going to sit inside a V2 either, put a separable capsule in it. Well, this one kind of reminds me of a V2, the Redstone actually where the skin was the tank. I&#39;d really like a separable capsule.<br><br>Also they&#39;re planning extended missions in this thing, talking months inside. As it is it won&#39;t cut it and is really just a short duration space shuttle type of vehicle. Crew will get microgravity tumors otherwise. Going to have to centrifugal it for that so final case is going to be much heavier and more extensively equipped anyway, since cost recovery involves extended missions down the track, they&#39;re already spending big on a lunar lander version and mass production is based on that and gaining the Mars project, not just servicing satellites and transferring crews to LOO stations.

Trains have not been engineered like cars have and do not have onboard emergency management and passenger protection systems and look how bad that result has been!  Almost any train accident is fatal to a large majority of its passengers.  True the complexity of airbags caused some problems initially with too had deployment and baby seats or accidental deployment in some rare cases but all of those issues were worked out early in the game.  They have saved magnitudes on order more lives than they have taken.  So taking from those two examples of crash management and passinger protection systems, it&#39;s fair to say that despite the increased complexity added by the systems, its&#39; vastly  better to have one than not to by a large margin.. because future accidents can largely not be anticipate or you would have avoided them if that were the case, so knowing that they will happen, it&#39;s better to be prepared with an automated system for sensing accidents and handling them in real-time than to automatically do nothing and not mitigate the risk to the passengers.

Through the header tanks. Through the lox tank. Right out the bottom of the spacecraft. Then weld 8 fuel baffles from the center passage to the outer skin. Remember the first stage of the Saturn v was actually 8 separate rocket fuselage connected in an octagonal fashion. These baffles inside the starship are thin steel with 2 and half inch dimpled holes 6 inches apart. Very light structures for what they&#39;re supporting.  If there&#39;s the passageway. Then the nose cone could be built like a ginormous cork. With the cork inserting the length of the methane tanks. The passage below the methane tank through the lox tank would have thicker steel to compensate for the single walled construction. And the fuel plumbing of the methane tanks run through lox tank passage way. <br><br>During launch the crew climbs into the passageway and sits in hammock lawn chair deals that fold out of the wall. 8 people in a circle stacked three high 24 people. Then before launch. The passage below the capsule, lox tank passage. Which is the airlock. Pressures up to whatever pressure is needed to eject the entire nose cone up and away from harms way. At 2atmosphere pressure that would be roughly 30psi inside the lox passageway. That would provide an instaneous 488,000lb thrust to the capsule alone. So that could be too much considering the entire loaded starship is suppose to weigh in at roughly 500,000lb. Once the nose of the starship is realeased and is accelerated up and out. The nose cone passageways bottom is its own component and falls away. Exposing the astronauts inside the passageway to the outside. The chairs they sit in are attached to small 2inch web x 2inch ibeams 2ft apart running the vertical length of the nose cones passageway, with rollers. And then the astronauts simply slide out 9f the nose cone 8 at a time each with their separate chutes attached to their chairs.<br><br> It&#39;s only a six foot passageway. I&#39;m a bit concerned about it be crushed. But the baffles are attached to the interior passage way roughly every two feet. So it is much closer to a 2ft diameter passageway once you figure in the baffle support, I figure. <br><br>Personally once the core is proven they should begin lightning them and wrapping them in carbon fiber... Pressure vessels and providing tension rigidity to semimalleagible metals is where carbon fiber shines. Carbon fiber by itsself is to bendy and flimsy. It needs to be attached to a substrate to activate the strength to the carbon carbon bonds. When welding and attaching the bolts for the ceramic tiles, weld wire 1/16pins at every cubic ft intersection or more. Then they&#39;d protrude through the carbon fiber. Each one of them pins will need a little washer that has carbon fiber strands stitched onto its perimeter. And the the little washer gets spot welded onto each of the stainless steel wire pins. Once again wrap it some more sandwiching the washers between the carbon fiber layers. I just don&#39;t know what it&#39;s going to take to make something the size of this to be able to withstand reentry and be safe and reliable. There&#39;s a alot of testing to go on.

Today&#39;s reactors use solid fuel pellets and liquid water for coolant. Problem is that the COLDEST temperature you can operate a reactor and still feasibly generate electricity is about 300\u00b0 Celsius. Problem is, the water must be kept liquid even at that temperature, which forces intense pressurizing. Even after an emergency shutdown, a nuclear reactor still needs continued cooling to manage decay heat of the fission-products (the &quot;ashes&quot; of a nuclear &quot;burn&quot;). This is why nuclear power plants have so many redundant diesel-generators to run coolant-pumps after reactor-shutdown. A proposed system called a &quot;Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor&quot; (LFTR, pronounced &quot;lifter&quot; for short) uses fluoride salts as fuel, and is designed to use them MOLTEN in routine operation. They have to be heated to about 450\u00b0 Celsius to melt but they then have 1000\u00b0 Celsius of liquid range WITHOUT needing to be pressurized. In routine operation you have a frozen plug of salt that you keep frozen by blowing cold gas across a flattened section of drainpipe. If the reactor overheats or the reactor building loses power, the frozen salt plug melts, draining all the reactor&#39;s fuel into a passively-cooled drain-tank designed to stop the nuclear-fission from continuing. Now while today&#39;s reactors have 5 or 6 redundant diesel generators to power those emergency coolant pumps, remember: at Fukushima Daiichi, a tsunami knocked out ALL of those Diesel generators, and as a result, once the batteries for the emergency coolant pumps went flat, those reactors had NO workable cooling. A LFTR only has one safety system with no redundancy, BUT! that one safety system is powered by THE FORCE OF GRAVITY. If <b>gravity</b> stops working at a nuclear plant?

It clearly and undoubtedly shows that the culture at NASA was sick, very, very sick, even to the point of incompetence. Apollo one is a good example. All kids who have an interest in science know full well what happens when you take a wooden splint, light it, then blow i out, then stick it in a jar of oxygen gas....it re-ignites and burns much faster with that extra oxygen ! So, why was it so damned difficult for these highly educated engineers and designers, many minds aware of the system, to not see that a cabin that had an atmosphere of one hundred percent oxygen, that had electrical systems a frightfully bad idea ? Where those electrical systems stress tested in that atmosphere ? I don&#39;t know, but I doubt it. Could the crew get out in a reasonable time on the launch pad ? no.

I think mechanical abort systems are, and will continue to be, important because they don&#39;t just represent an alternative path to the safe end of the mission, they provide a fundamental shift to the end-of-mission objective. when operating a vehicle like the starship, or space shuttle, or f-16, the standard end of the mission necessarily entails the landing and recovery of the entire vehicle; this is (obviously) challenging, and there is a very large margin between success, and catastrophic failure which requires dozens to hundreds of systems work perfectly. safely landing a human, by comparison, is pretty easy: you set down a 200 lb sack of meat softly without cooking it. the launch abort system gives you a way to say &quot;well, we cant save the big expensive vehicle, let&#39;s just save the people. so, while mechanical abort systems DO represent an increase in complexity for the few seconds that they&#39;re active, they also represent a drastic decrease in the complexity of the remaining mission: run away from the explosions, wait to float back down to earth.", "comment_date": "2019-12-23T09:09:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Wayne Herman", "comment_text": "This story is about FLAWED thinking of a moron.

Of course, that leaves out initial boost to the speed/altitude that allows the lifting body to...err...lift. At initial boost, there might be a rocket with enough engines to spare the loss of one or two at launch to reach that speef/altitude. The Starship and Superheavy appear to be two such rockets, but that leaves out the rest of the possible failured. So, again, reliability becomes the only answer to the problem. <br><br>If I were flying it, I would want to have myself encased in a lifting body capable of reentry and horizontal landing, but that isn&#39;t going to be possible for 100+ passengers, or is it. Anything that provides transport at a speed fast enough to create g-forces strong enough to kill is a risk to its passengers and we are certainly familiar with such risks as we ride or fly in various systems that are considered safe for public transport. Anybody who has seen a vehicle burn after a less than fatal crash knows what riding on a fuel tank means. Again, reliability with reasonable safety standards plus huge usage history are the only answers that will get most people on a particular vehicle type. <br><br>Think how many people state that they will not now fly on a 737-Max and you will have the long term answer to your question. When the FAA takes responsibility for the full recertification is my answer, but I&#39;m not sure what others feel. I know that Boeing cannot survive the permanent grounding of all 737-Max&#39;s, so they are going to have to find a solution that is palatable to the flying masses. <br><br>Having even a small percentage of customers refusing to fly on available machinery is unacceptable to most airlines and they will seek compensation. That would put Boeing into bankruptcy and completely disrupt our modern flight system, so we had better find that answer and that answer should be instructive to SpaceX &#39;s plans to fly 100+ passengers on point-to-point flights. <br><br>Current airplanes cannot survive any but the most minor crashes in ordinary landings. Any other crashes are almost inevitably fatal to all involved, so the only way airlines stay in business is to have a mode of transportation that is orders of magnitude safer than any other mode than trains and trains take too long for most transport further than 100 miles.<br><br>There is the standard that rocketry must closely approximate if it is to be acceptable for more than inherently risky things such as trips to the Moon/Mars/the rest of the Solar System.

In the event of a catastrophic failure of the booster, exploding bolts detach the pod and eject it in an intended direction.  The pod swings on the tether, either at a length where it won&#39;t strike the ground, or into a pool of water.  There would be a mechanism to detach the tether, perhaps with a quick-reel system to avoid hitting any control surfaces or puncturing the hull.  The tether would detach presumably as soon as the engines are lit.

It\u00b4s worth to wait for such videos! One topic I have missed in this video: Is it even theoretically possible for Starship to have an abort system and what would be the performance costs vs. safety gains? e.g. could Starship have a pair of very strong yet short burning solid rocket motors down in the engine section just intended to work the 2 or 3 seconds needed before the Raptors on Starship are realistically fully up and running? I just tried now to search a bit and answer myself and see that answer is most likely &quot;NO&quot;!:-) For pad abort of a fully fueled Starship weighing about 1300 tons, you would need 2 solid rocket motors with a thrust of maybe 700 tons each, which brings us close to the performance figures of the new European SRB P120 ... which has 800 tons of thrust, but with a diameter of 3.4 meters!

This caused people\u2019s tempers to flare, causing a spontaineous unruly civil war to breakout. Gandhi was in despair, so he jouneyed to Calcutta to fast unto death in the home of a Muslim friend. It was only when both sides understood that Gandhi was on the verge of death, that both sides of the war ceased hostilities. That\u2019s the power of love, which is the opposite of fear. Had Gandhi said that he wouldn\u2019t give up his vision, and didn\u2019t allow the division of India, people wouldn\u2019t have started the mass migration that provoked the feared civil war. Even if war had broke out, Gandhi would have fasted, and it would have ended. If India had remained whole, there would not be today two nuclear powers rattling their nuclear sabers at one another.

It could be argued that in a case like SpaceX which is a &quot;for profit&quot; company, that yes, there is always a constraint on resources, but do we really know that if Elon wanted there to be an abort system, that he would take resources away from other aspects of the rocket design and therefore would end up with a less reliable rocket, or would he dedicate a new team to the abort system and pay for that by increasing the price of the launches?

I wish all of them the best of luck, and I look forward to all the data that all of those flights will present to us.  <br><br><br>In a separate category, SpaceX (and others) will be sending professional astronauts on a lot of missions into space over the next decade.  <br><br><br>After a decade or two, I think we will have plenty of data to answer the questions posed here: &quot;Do we allow civilians (you or me) to ride on a rocket that does not have an abort system.&quot;  And by then, I expect the answer will be &quot;Yes.&quot;", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T13:33:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Tim B\u00f6gel", "comment_text": "What about Apollo 1?", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T13:32:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "T4L0N57", "comment_text": "I haven&#39;t watched the video yet but I believe the answer is it would be redundant.<br><br>SS is the launch abort system.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T13:28:40Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gary Morrison", "comment_text": "Excellent video, as always!

However, it gets more complex when comparing different sample sizes.<br><br>For example, if engine A has flown a total of 100 times, and failed on 5 flights, we would say it has a 95% success rate. If engine B has only flown 10 times, and failed on 1 flight, we would say it has 99% success rate. So, we would be tempted to conclude that engine B is more reliable than engine A. However, this is not necessarily true, because of the different sample sizes. <br><br>To compare these two sample sizes correctly, we need to do some statistical analysis, and then determine if the differences we observe in engine success rates are statistically significant.

Starship has the largest crew capacity of any launcher with it&#39;s 100 passengers. Secondly it flies private citizens not astronauts and will largely be self guided with nobody on board trained to do any sort of manual abort. If I remember correctly the Soyuz has a maximum number of crew members of four or three and offers limited control to it&#39;s passengers in the event that something goes wrong that&#39;s not outright catastrophic. The way I see it these factors means that measured in sheer number of launches it doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of sense for SpaceX to have an escape system. However the PR fallout of having 100 people dying in your product means that if they can somehow abort, even if it takes the place of say 40 crew members in terms of weight, a system would have to be there. At least when they are ferrying private citizens to space. After all part of the reason why the relatively few shuttle accidents was such a big problem for NASA was because of the large crew of seven. The PR fallout of loosing so many people in one flight was pretty devastating. Especially for Columbia when news broke that the cause of the problem could have been found had NASA simply looked through their own footage from the launch as a similar accident had occurred in the past and the crew could have been saved by launching another orbiter or even Soyuz capsules to rendezvous with the damaged shuttle in orbit.<br><br><br>PS: The new and improved shuttle escape system of merely jumping out with a guide tube is pretty laughable. From what I have seen and heard in various documentaries nobody really thought that would be practical and work in a real emergency. NASA simply had to do something to appease the populace and perhaps more importantly the politicians.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T01:07:01Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "The Geeky Gardener", "comment_text": "I love me some Little Joe!", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T01:06:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cole Johnson", "comment_text": "Absolutely loved this video, thanks Tim!", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T01:04:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SUCH Developments", "comment_text": "As Elon says, design it with minimum parts, less to go wrong.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T01:02:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Cole Smith", "comment_text": "The footage of the Soyuz abort in 2018 is just such a cool shot.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T01:01:55Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mostly Peaceful", "comment_text": "would i get on a rocket without an abort system? depends on the mission and the rockets track record, but that&#39;s exactly the same for a rocket with an abort system.", "comment_date": "2019-12-17T01:01:20Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "scientious", "comment_text": "Not bad ... except for all the errors.

Some things to think about when looking at reliability are the difference between system and component reliability. Basically what component reliability is would be your 99.88% reliable engine but your system reliability takes into account all failures. With most systems they have components that are in series with eachother meaning if one thing fails the system fails(similar to series circuits vs parallel circuits) now you can stack components in series and in parallel. Your fuel tank would probably be a single thing so there is no redundancy but your engines are in parallel with one another so one can fail but your system will still work successfully. Now you can consider a more complex model for the engines since if you lose more than maybe 2-4 engines your rocket will stop flying up which is a failure, basically you enter that as a threshold of the failure of those redundant parts. In general anything in series can have it&#39;s reliability multiplied to the rest of the system to calculate the system reliability. Your subassembly with the parallel parts has a different equation to calculate that subassembly but then that can now be factored in like anything else in series. <br><br>Also what should be considered is what you consider a failure. Like you said in the video landing the rocket is not necessary for success so failures that only impact that won&#39;t be considered when determining primary success, but you could have a system reliability that is just for landing but that would include failures up until stage separation and down to landing and ignoring failures on the second stage and beyond.<br><br>Hopefully this is interesting to someone!", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T22:24:15Z", "likes_count": 62}, {"comment_by": "hoofed", "comment_text": "If all else fails, rapid unscheduled disassembly is always an option.", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T22:23:58Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Maurits Spijker", "comment_text": "Here to increase the engagement rate", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T22:23:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Enrico Sacchetti", "comment_text": "Fantastic video as always.<br>Topics well explained in clear and enjoyable format.<br>Congrats again!", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T22:22:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Thaddeus Walker", "comment_text": "I am wearing full flow staged combustion hoodie 1 of 2.", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T22:22:29Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Norman M.", "comment_text": "SpaceX envisions flying up to 100 people per ship for interplanetary flights and even more than that for Earth point to point flights, so there is no realistic way to design an abort system for such a large spacecraft.", "comment_date": "2019-12-16T22:22:16Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Kimball Goss", "comment_text": "Man, he does such a good job with these videos.
