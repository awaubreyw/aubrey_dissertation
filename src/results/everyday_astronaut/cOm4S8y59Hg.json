I was the same as you, loved space and everything around it, but wasn&#39;t clued in at all with what was happening. That was until I stumbled across  that video of the 2 second raptor test about a month or so ago... I was hooked immediately on the space bug and started looking things up, came across your &#39;biggest booms in rocket history&#39; and since then, you&#39;ve quickly become one of my favourite internet people. I&#39;m sad about all the exciting stuff I missed last year, but I&#39;m absolutely hyped about this year as it&#39;s going to be even bigger, and sooo glad I&#39;ve got such a great source of information on this stuff; you! I also really love Our Ludicrous Future, you guys gave me quite the insight into Tesla and because of that, I now think they&#39;re super cool. It&#39;s because of you I took notice of Elon outside of the memes and gained more respect for him. One day, I hope to become a patreon and support you and maybe someday, get to meet you, even though I&#39;m all the way down in Aus! You are seriously an amazing, humble, genuine person and I deeply appreciate all the time and effort you put in just to share your passions with all of us, creating this very excited community. I didn&#39;t watch this live, but I&#39;ve still had it playing all day while I do stuff because I find the conversation you make really, really interesting and I love learning things from you! Even your most &quot;boring&quot; stream has been enjoyable and interesting because of your great personality.
