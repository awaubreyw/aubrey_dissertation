This is sometimes called a growth phase.  Basically it is companies dumping a ton of money into something they think will pay off.  Sometimes this (and this terminology is used) when a market is undersaturated (grab as big of a marketshare as possible it will grow) or in some cases it has to reach a certain critical mass to function.  For example, ride sharing companies like uber offer subsidies for customers, even under their bottom line, because with more people using the service, more drivers can do it and expect to get paid a reasonable amount leading to more drivers leading to happier customers because drivers are everwhere and wait times are short.  OR as another example elon taking a loss on battery tech in order to get a leg up, feeling in the future it will pay off.<br>TLDR: This is because money is not the only resource that can eventually be converted into money.  But you still have that resource for a while (marketshare, tech advance, etc) and it hasn&#39;t been converted yet.  So the question &quot;Do space companies need to be profitable&quot;  implies &quot;at this time&quot;. And even furthermore it implies that they probably havent been (and this makes sense for a new industry).
