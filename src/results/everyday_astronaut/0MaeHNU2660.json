Boeing tends to go by the classic prototyping model, meaning that they will test to destruction.

The system was referred to as the Abort Solid Rocket Motors or ASRM. It could be described as a pusher-type since it was comprised of twin rockets attached to the sides of the orbiter&#39;s aft fuselage and when fired would carry the orbiter away from a malfunctioning stack. <br><br>The ASRM&#39;s weight was initially considered acceptable since when the Shuttle reached a point where it was no longer usable, it could be fired off, the thrust boosting the stack and countering the dead weight, then jettisoned. So what&#39;s the big deal? Aside from cost there was another problem that kept rearing its ugly head; an abort scenario where the ASRM was used invoked heavy stresses on the orbiter airframe and so to keep the vehicle from breaking apart due to the aerodynamic load, the frame had to be beefed up structurally to the tune of a whopping 9 metric tons! In addition, this would not save the orbiter or its crew and payload in the advent of an exploding SSME, so its usefulness was limited to failures of the ET or SRBs.<br><br>Since NASA was under a great deal of pressure to make the Shuttle meet the DoD, CIA, and NRO&#39;s payload requirement of 65,000 lbs (29 tons) to LEO, and with costs for the program rising, ASRM was deleted from the design. <br><br>Skip over two decades later and the design of the HL-20 lifting body that was the inspiration for SNC&#39;s Dream Chaser was also going to use a pusher type abort system. However this was a separate system not directly integrated into the craft and was a part of the cone-shaped launch vehicle adapter. The crewed variant of Dream Chaser, HL-20&#39;s successor, uses an integrated pusher system that also doubles as the orbital maneuvering system. Cargo Dream Chaser could in theory use this, but being stuck under a fairing makes its use impossible.", "comment_date": "2020-11-18T12:47:00Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Trust Jesus our Savior", "comment_text": "Who is watching also The Angry Astronaut channel?", "comment_date": "2020-11-18T11:18:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Awesome", "comment_text": "Hey<br><br><br><br><br><b>Vsauce Michael here</b>", "comment_date": "2020-11-18T05:01:05Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Ghostly", "comment_text": "Well, commercial airlines doesn&#39;t have abort systems, wtf should these have something that can save 3.-10 lives, when airplanes doesn&#39;t even have something that can save 300 humans lives?", "comment_date": "2020-11-17T14:57:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Hozo Hoco", "comment_text": "Man i miss the old 2019 tim intro", "comment_date": "2020-11-17T05:46:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Blazeww4207", "comment_text": "Why not put the parachutes at the top of the escape tower and make it strong enough to hold the capsule.

The system was referred to as the Abort Solid Rocket Motors or ASRM. It could be described as a pusher-type since it was comprised of twin rockets attached to the sides of the orbiter&#39;s aft fuselage and when fired would carry the orbiter away from a malfunctioning stack. <br><br>The ASRM&#39;s weight was initially considered acceptable since when the Shuttle reached a point where it was no longer usable, it could be fired off, the thrust boosting the stack and countering the dead weight, then jettisoned. So what&#39;s the big deal? Aside from cost there was another problem that kept rearing its ugly head; an abort scenario where the ASRM was used invoked heavy stresses on the orbiter airframe and so to keep the vehicle from breaking apart due to the aerodynamic load, the frame had to be beefed up structurally to the tune of a whopping 9 metric tons! In addition, this would not save the orbiter or its crew and payload in the advent of an exploding SSME, so its usefulness was limited to failures of the ET or SRBs.<br><br>Since NASA was under a great deal of pressure to make the Shuttle meet the DoD, CIA, and NRO&#39;s payload requirement of 65,000 lbs (29 tons) to LEO, and with costs for the program rising, ASRM was deleted from the design. <br><br>Skip over two decades later and the design of the HL-20 lifting body that was the inspiration for SNC&#39;s Dream Chaser was also going to use a pusher type abort system. However this was a separate system not directly integrated into the craft and was a part of the cone-shaped launch vehicle adapter. The crewed variant of Dream Chaser, HL-20&#39;s successor, uses an integrated pusher system that also doubles as the orbital maneuvering system. Cargo Dream Chaser could in theory use this, but being stuck under a fairing makes its use impossible.", "comment_date": "2019-04-29T01:39:04Z", "likes_count": 53}, {"comment_by": "Super Grafx Engine", "comment_text": "I have a question :<br><br>Are the windows made in transparent aluminium ?
