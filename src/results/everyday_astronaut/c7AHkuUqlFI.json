So effectively that mean control surface will have the completely opposite effect when under super sonic flow compare to sub sonic, IE tilting the wing downward will actually increase lift instead of decrease lift. When a plane is near trans sonic speed, part of the airplane&#39;s control surface will be under subsonic flow while other control surface will be under super sonic. So half of the plane&#39;s control surface will operate &quot;normally&quot; while the other half will operate in the opposite direction. So it&#39;s incredible dangerous for a pilot to stay in trans sonic region, since the airplane can easily become uncontrollable.
