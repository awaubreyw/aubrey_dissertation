They happen when something <b>GOING</b> supersonic passes such that its sound waves reach you all at once.  Ironically something travelling directly away from you (as the rocket basically is when it takes off,) is always &quot;streaming&quot; sound waves at you (loud ones at that - frickin&#39; ROCKET sound,) so you don&#39;t hear the sonic boom. You&#39;ve been inside the &quot;sound cone&quot; the whole time.<br><br>Coming <b>BACK</b> though, it left where its sound waves could reach you (space,) and when it came back, it was going supersonic.  So all of the sound it had been putting out (mostly just wind noise) gets all bunched up and hits you all at once.  *BOOM*!", "comment_date": "2017-08-15T10:22:42Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Tommy", "comment_text": "So it takes off, leaves the satellite in space and comes back all in Like 15 min?

All of these laughable &quot;launches&quot; and complete fakery and fraudulent CGI bulls^&amp;t  (and not even as good as Hollywood), is absolute nonsense to any intelligent human being with an above-60 IQ level....anyone who believes that this is &quot;REAL&quot;, needs to get their eyesight and mental health examined by a professional, and go back to their fantasyland existence . Its comical how they just keep making each &quot;launch&quot; look more and more ridiculously absurd, and less and less viable or realistic in ANY overall &quot;quality&quot; of production, with these little poorly CGI faked &quot;movie&quot; hoaxes they keep fooling and mocking the human masses with. <br><br>-why NO forward looking cameras on the &quot;launch&quot; so instead of staring backwards at the ground, we were actually able to see what the &quot;where-Im-headed&quot;  view actually looked like? Strap an iPhone on the tip of the nosecone for f%&amp;k&#39;s sake! geez! why would we want to see the Earth, and not get a rare glimpse up into &quot;space&quot;?!<br><br>so they will show the &quot;camera view&quot; from the second stage &quot;looking up into the inside of the top stage as it detaches&quot; so we can all see how perfect the &quot;deployment of the dragon (haha)&quot; appears to be -GREAT job guys! (cue the next round of ridiculous clapping, cheering, and high fives, guys!)...yet they won&#39;t then go BACK to show us the view from that SAME camera we just saw video from,  as the &quot;dragon spacecraft (HA!)&quot; is moving forward away from the camera on the stage it just detached from so we could actually see into &quot;space&quot; as the Dragon, in all its glorious perfection lol, slowly disappears into the distance on its way to &quot;orbit&quot; Earth and &quot;rendezvous with the ISS&quot;??? hmmmm?!???", "comment_date": "2017-08-15T02:51:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Speddy Taghetti", "comment_text": "&quot;sonic boom&quot; sounded like nothing more that $1 chinese firecrackers...and where was the &quot;stage 1&quot; coming down for a landing?
