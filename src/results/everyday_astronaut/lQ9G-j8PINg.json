Let me explain. You always use this on your outros, and your videos are so good, first of all I love rockets, and also seeing the progress (primarily) SpaceX is making towards a new space age that your videos make me feel optimistic about life, a life with a multiplanetary species, where space travel is common, and I probably feel similar than people felt with the first space race and the Moon landings. And your videos just make me feel like there&#39;s a bright future ahead. So then there&#39;s this song. As I said, you always play this song in the end of your videos, and by that time I&#39;m always happy for the aforementioned reasons. And I recently realized I ended up associating this song with happiness. That&#39;s a beautiful thing, because now that I&#39;m listening to it I feel so happy for no apparent reason, and now I realize I&#39;m so glad this channel exists, the positivity you bring is incredible.
