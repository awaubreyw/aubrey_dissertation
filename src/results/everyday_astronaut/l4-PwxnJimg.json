This dude, with the glasses is so unprofessional that i can&#39;t even put into words how he is ruining the total experience of watching the launch/es. (This is the second time i mentioning this). I get the excitement the guy is having. Because I am a space nerd as well. Though he does not look a child, but he sure do behave like one. Too bad, i did enjoy the launch and everything except his mouth running CONSTANTLY. Couldn&#39;t decide to either mute the launch completely or not? Because if i would have muted, i would&#39;ve missed the experience of the sound the rocket has to give out. Too bad, don&#39;t think I am going to give it another try for launch of the S10. Going to watch it from a another YouTube channel. (Sorry guys, less money for your channel/pockets). And that this dude thinks he is going to Mars, he is not. Future man kind is, and the Elites. But not him! (That&#39;s only a wishful thinking). Or maybe he means mankind, who knows? Personal message to this dude: &quot;You are not going to Mars. Elon does do not want yappie children on board&quot;. Only mature candidates are going to pass the test. Get this guy to shut the &quot;F&quot; up, or i will decide to watch the next launch on another YT channel. Or wait... He might be a virgin? That would explain the yappyness. (And even if he paid someone to take his virginity, that would not count as not being a virgin anymore). Last but not least...

Something had already been torn off and thrown out of the engine compartment. The automatics decides to swing the motor to absorb some torque.

Yes, the same force from the gyroscopic effect, which at such speeds of rotation and rolling could reach tens or even hundreds of kilonewtons.
