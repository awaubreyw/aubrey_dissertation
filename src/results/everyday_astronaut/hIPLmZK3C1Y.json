Suppose a spaceship bursts the hatch and everything goes flying. In reality, the vacuum did not pull anything, but everything loose was pushed from the area of \u200b\u200bhigher pressure to the area of \u200b\u200blower pressure.<br><br>The same effect is achieved if we connect the atmosphere to outer space by means of a gigantic tube, and thus suck out the pollution, all the greenhouse gases along with the pollution would be expelled out of the earth into space, where they do not harm the Earth. ozone layer. By connecting outer space with the earth&#39;s atmosphere a bridge would be created, this bridge is the gigantic tube that allows the expulsion of greenhouse gases. <br><br>The space vacuum would have a system of chambers and valves that open and close to control what is ejected into space.

Can you create a video about ion thrusters and methalox engines working on the same Starship? I&#39;ve thought about using combustion engines to overcome the earth&#39;s gravity then firing up some kind of ion thruster once the engines are maxed out ever since I discovered ion drives. There must be some fundamental problem with this idea because no one is talking about it. The only problem I can come up with is transporting a nuclear reactor on a Starship to power the ion drives. I&#39;m hoping there are enough requests for this subject matter to justify taking your valuable time to address it.

There&#39;s not going to be a colony on Mars in your lifetime.<br>We spent fifty years not going back to the Moon. It cost too much and it had no benefits which could offset that cost. Elon Musk has no viable economic plan to get to Mars. He spent the last ten years making up fake claims and failed deadlines.  <br>He can&#39;t even make a self-driving car.  He couldn&#39;t even make the hyperloop work and all that was was a tunnel Underground.<br>And he wants to put a million people on Mars?<br>Do you really want to trust the man who failed at the hyperloop and who failed at self-driving to build a rocket to another planet?<br>It&#39;s not going to happen.
