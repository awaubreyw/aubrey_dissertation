Methane can of course be imported to Mars, either as liquid methane directly or indirectly in the form of liquid ammonia (this also has the benefit of importation of nitrogen - which will be needed in quantity for life support). The argument that we can create methane locally, from mining/harvesting water ignores the fact that this will involve large scale mining/extraction and processing and all of this has to be imported from Earth. There is little to be gained in doing this. In the end, direct importation of methane or ammonia is likely to be the least complex and therefore least risky approach. Also direct return from Mars (aka Elon&#39;s Starship) requires industrial scale activity. Strip mining of large quantities of soil, industrial scale machinery and of course mega-scale power supplies. All of which has to be imported to Mars in the first place.

When you take rock samples on earth, it isnt just taking the sample. You have to take images, geo-locate it, and store it in containers. That takes a lot of mass and warrants a specialized rover. A smaller rover which just has to pick up a sample container just has to do that and nothing else! Landing a sample return rocket and a Perserverence 2 would be even harder because of an increase in mass but a small fetch rover and rocket is more tractable. We might as well send another Perseverance to do the whole thing in advance.<br><br>2) Perseverance is going far in advance of any other craft and can take advantage of a time delay because we haven&#39;t build Mars Sample Return yet and it takes time to wander about and capture a large area. <br><br>3) Perseverance will be able to expand a sample range! Because it has more time and more power than the fetch rover, it can cover a large area! <br><br>4) Its also good to handoff because we dont know what Mars Sample Return looks like yet. In order to load the samples, we&#39;d need a robotic arm to do so, but its hard to design a robotic arm or loading system without knowing what it does.

It&#39;s a very recent series with apparently updated info (designated v2 in the title descriptions) and I&#39;ll tell ya, I&#39;ve had some of these same reservations about Elon&#39;s claims about Starship myself.  The 2nd video in the series deals with the interior passenger and cargo portions of the ship, and is the most concerning to me.  Namely is the whole thing big enough to hold and support as many people that Elon says it will...100 people.  Because this video claims that NASA&#39;s own recommendations of just 17 are more reasonable.  Please take a look at this series and do your own analysis and rebuttal of them.  I&#39;d be interested in hearing the other side of the argument.  Like I said, I&#39;m a big fan of the concept of the Starship, I&#39;m just worried that Elon&#39;s being a bit too optimistic with his predictions.  As well all know that he does.
