And I haven&#39;t found any with my same ideas. I think we should set up a moon colony on earth. We should have inflatable domes, which we cover with 3D printers with simulated moon mortar. The domes should be connected to each other by inflatable tunnels covered with simulated moon mortar. There should be living quarters, hydroponic green houses, gardens with garden soil for recreational gardening, a 5 acre pasture with one inch of garden soil and one inch of grass turf, a park with artificial turf and with small sections of real grass turf, and maybe even a very small zoo. All the domes will have plastic floors so no water is lost. Condensation forming on the ceilings will be drained into the water supply.  All the domes will be blown up with compressed air from earth and will have a refresh system, which will refresh the air and maintain the air pressure. Humidity, Temperature will be maintained by humidifiers, heaters, fans and coolers. Light will be provided by multi-color LEDs, mostly white. Power will be supplied at first by solar power, and later by nuclear or fusion power. All water will be re-cycled, almost zero loss of water. There will be a bull, a cow, two sheep, and two goats, two chickens, two turkeys, two fish, and two rabbits. There will also be pets, two dogs, two cats, two bunnies, etc. (and maybe a small zoo) All of this will be set up by astronauts and robots before the colonist arrive.<br><br>The first colonist will be 5 fathers and 5 mothers, and 90 babies. The parents will be good parents, gardeners, farmers, zoo keepers, teachers, etc.. During the first two years an exact duplicate facility will be built on the moon. When the babies are two years old, they will move to the moon and live on the moon. Or if it is proven that they will be too young to travel to the moon than the facility on earth will be added to, to accommodate 10 more parents and 90 more babies. The two year olds would move into the new addition. Every two years the facility will be either added to, or 100 people will move to the moon. This plan will allow the kids to grow up in the isolation of the colony, and will make it easier for them to live in the isolation of the colony on the moon. And will allow them to grow up on the moon and be better able to adjust to the lower gravity on the moon, although some artificial gravity maybe eventually provided. This artificial gravity will especially be good for the parents. The kids will have everything in the facility to keep them occupied and entertained. Also they could have some books, movies, games, etc., especially adapted for them, being careful not to give them anything that would make them feel isolated. <br><br>After 20 years there could be 2000 people living on the moon, most of whom grew up on the moon.  This program could be speeded up so in 20 years there could be 4000, 6000, or 8000 people living on the moon.  <br><br>This program could be simultaneously done to colonize Mars so we could have 2000 people on the Moon and Mars at the same time.  For the moon we could send supplies every month, but for Mars we could only send supplies every 26 months.  So I suggest we send 10, 20, or 30 rockets to Mars every 26 months all at the same time.<br><br>We could have several refueling stations along the way to mars and orbiting mars so rockets could refuel along the way to mars and right before landing on mars so the empty rocket would have enough fuel to take off again, refuel in space and return to Earth.  Eventually the colonist could grow trees, bamboo, and other plants for raw materials that could be used for making things.  Eventually the moon and Mars could export minerals or small expensive items that were assembled on the moon or Mars, like jewelry, iphones, iwatches, etc.  Or grown on the moon like caviar, marijuana, etc.<br>What do you think ?  :-)", "comment_date": "2020-11-21T05:29:09Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Robert Morton", "comment_text": "Your talk with Musk.

The boosters tend to want to topple so why not take advantage of that with Starship. Using the same tech they use for the boosters let it descend until it&#39;s near the ground. Then extend three sets of landing gear on one side of the rocket. That will make it tend to fall to that side and thrusters can then take over and level the craft horizontally, much like a jump jet, so it can land on its side on the landing gear. A stairway can then be lowered from the crew quarters to the ground instead of the long elevator they are currently envisioning. Resting on 6 landing gear in two rows of three they can slip a flatbed beneath the vehicle to take it for refurbishment or raise it back vertically for relaunch.  The long elevator to the ground seems to be the vulnerable portion of the plan as an astronaut risks getting stranded on the surface without any way to get back on the ship.  A Harrier jet was about 2.6 tons landing vertically.  Starship is about 260 tons near empty and that&#39;s like 100 Harriers.  On the moon the Starship would be about 41 tons.

Then to follow up on that, this guy actually actually knows his stuff before asking questions. The sheer enthusiasm being shared between 2 people is wonderful. Such an insightful side to Elon I have not seen before. Thank you for this lovely uncut version of Elon and yourself.

Este homem ser\u00e1 o respons\u00e1vel por salvar milhares de pessoas. A Nasa vem a anos estudando pra explorar um planeta e chega Elon Reeve Musk em pouco tempo j\u00e1 conseguiu reaproveitar\u00a0 seus foguetes de lan\u00e7amentos. Fazendo com isso a viabilidade de explora\u00e7\u00e3o deixar de ser um sonho e tornar realidade. Hoje estou aqui escrevendo a minha opini\u00e3o sobre esta\u00a0 realidade. Elon Reeve Musk voc\u00ea vai passar por v\u00e1rias\u00a0 barreiras, mas nenhuma delas ser\u00e3o o suficiente para que fa\u00e7am desistir dos outros planetas. No universo existe sim vida al\u00e9m de n\u00f3s. Podem ser iguais ou diferente de n\u00f3s, mas isso n\u00e3o importa o objetivo e migrar para outro planeta porque o nosso aos poucos esta se modificando com os passar dos anos. N\u00e3o podemos dormir e esperar que tudo sempre continue como esta a cada dia que passa modifica\u00e7\u00f5es acontecem. Precisamos buscar outro caminho al\u00e9m das estrelas. Neste imenso universo existe sim vida igual a nossa sim! Apesar de que algumas pessoas defendam que isso \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel. Voc\u00ea Elon Reeve Musk acredita que existe vida em outros planetas? Ent\u00e3o acompanho sempre seus passos sou super f\u00e3 admiro sua coragem em perder seu tempo precioso em busca de uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o para humanidade. Quero lhe agradecer e lhe dizer que voc\u00ea vai encontrar o que procura em breve neste universo imenso. A humanidade s\u00f3 tem a lhe agradecer por nos ajudar. Talvez eu e voc\u00ea Elon Reeve Musk n\u00e3o estaremos aqui pra ver a conquista espacial no futuro. Mas estaremos na hist\u00f3ria eu Luiz Paulek por escrever esta carta a voc\u00ea Elon Reeve Musk por conquistar o espa\u00e7o e salvar a esp\u00e9cie humana. Bom meu amigo Elon desejo todo sucesso do mundo a voc\u00ea e nunca desista v\u00e1 em frente. Precisamos de voc\u00ea lembra disso. O primeiro passo voc\u00ea, j\u00e1 deu o segundo ser\u00e1 pousar em Marte com seres humanos a bordo de uma nave que voc\u00ea vai construir. Marte \u00e9 s\u00f3 o come\u00e7o da explora\u00e7\u00e3o espacial de longa dist\u00e2ncia. Lembre de mim quando for lan\u00e7ar as pessoas rumo a Marte.

There are different types and levels of annealing, but 301 stainless can be annealed by heating it to as little as 500 \u00b0F and then slowly cooling it. Higher temperatures would be more effective at annealing the material, of course- I believe annealing is related to the temperature squared or something like that. Every trip would raise the steel to at least 500 \u00b0F- likely much higher- and slow cool it, removing the strength of the material. How could SpaceX avoid this issue of annealing?

I think in general we find that people end up being more productive using simple programming languages. But people too often get pulled along by the sirene song of more features ending up choosing more complex languages, libraries etc. People always seem terrified of the prospect of not having enough features.

Annular throat designs like the J2T, in particular, have huge cmopressive loads on parts loaded in buckling, requiring lots of stiffening members- which adds even more mass.

Personally I think close to vacuum nozzle sizes and water injection at low altitudes, possibly with injection in such a way as to  provide a thick film of cooler lower velocity but high mass flow to keep the nozzle away from flow separation and provide a shield of lower velocity flow to reduce sound and vibration, much as the outer flow of a high bypass jet reduces noise (maybe scallop the edges of the nozzle too).  Note the purpose is not so much film cooling as keeping the volume of flow high enough.  More thrust at low altitude at a penalty of lower isp, with the mass flow of water reducing to nothing at perhaps 10 or 12 km altitude.  More vacuum engines and fewer SL engines.  If injection is into the throat area and a bit downstream the water could come from pressurized tanks at much lower pressure than in the turbomachinery.<br><br><br>michael", "comment_date": "2019-10-03T07:13:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Justin Brown", "comment_text": "Love him or hate him without Elon musk the world has no Tesla cars and no space X.

That design philosophy basically stuck and I guess the thought is that it allowed for an extra level of safety (two layers), perhaps calculating volume was easier when the volume was already built to suit, and it permitted different components to be manufactured separately.<br><br><br>I&#39;d be curious to know more about the structural integrity of this rocket... without adequate internal pressure, the lighter you make the craft, the greater the possibility of the rocket collapsing or bending... is there an interior structure that makes it rigid enough to survive all the different kinds of stresses that it will encounter?

You did the right thing letting him ramble and it is sad you didn&#39;t get a full hour to ask him all the questions you undoubtedly had but trust me, anyone with half a brain can see you did the best with what little time you had and this interview is without a doubt the best piece of footage from this amazing night that many of us have been counting down the days to witness for the last few months, going to work day in day out for just to pass the time for this amazing night.

I&#39;m sure he likes making money, and I think profit is a great thing, but it&#39;s clearly not his chief concern. He also has a point of view about engineering that I wish most companies shared.

It is, if I am thinking this though correctly, atmosphere dependent to adapt its flow shape, and when that atmosphere becomes to small a proportion  of bell analog in inverted form, it is now wasted mass.  The attainable  specific impulse, should an aerospike ever be tested to its full altitude potential may be much less than the fixed combo of sea level and vacuum bells used in Starship. I am especially impressed with the specific impulse SpaceX has achieved with the methanol formulation this early in the program. Also frankly I wonder that since an aerospike seems mostly suited to lower atmosphere conditions if it can be throttled well enough for SpaceX landings.

So an aerospike engine could be ideal for both purposes provided it has a high enough level of efficiency and could be on gimbles or use thrust vectoring for propulsive landings.

The line of questioning about aerospike was spot-on: we got to see how Musk considers alternative possibilities. It helps clarify why the shift to methalox was a bit scary but worthwhile. Enough research had been done on methalox to show that it is feasible and at least 98.5% efficient, but most tech experience has been with the fuels on either side of methalox on the efficiency/manageability trade-off: kerosene on one side, liquid hydrogen on the other. Proving feasibility is  big &quot;sunk cost,&quot; it has now been done for methalox, but not fully for aerospike (X-31?). His openness to a substantially different tech was fascinating to watch. Aerospike might never prove out in practice, but Musks willingness to seriously consider it is backed up by his actual choice to shift to stainless steel AFTER building that huge mandrel for the carbon-fiber design.", "comment_date": "2019-10-01T16:15:54Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MrT3a92", "comment_text": "So awesome that you&#39;ve got this opportunity!

Two people who like to chat about the same passionately.\r<br>\r<br>My thoughts:\r<br>\r<br>1 - I&#39;m surprised that Musk believes that the power of his engines is directionally straight. Since both Newton and Kepler and Einstein have shown that the reality of the Universe is curved. And in curvature the energy moves.\r<br>\r<br>In the same drive of Raptors engines we see how the light diamond is formed. Irrefutable proof that the enegia arrives in a curve to that maximum climax point and continues to curve in the above-mentioned diamonds of light.\r<br>\r<br>2 - The ability of the SkyDiver style flight is the future. Impressive to see how SpaceX is heading with notable chances of success to fly this way.\r<br>\r<br>The Starship MKs will encourage redesigning the SuperHeavy to a SkyDiver approach which will be the resolution of a true beast of transport in the history of mankind.\r<br>\r<br>3 - Although the performance of the Starship was presented as limited, its base is incredibly potent. It is likely that we are facing the first fully efficient SSTO, at least for crew transport.\r<br>\r<br>Only the different models that arise through the implementations and tastes in the design will suffice.\r<br>\r<br>4 - The humility with which SpaceX approaches the community is remarkable. Something that should be imitated in all contexts of life.\r<br><br><br>5 - I believe that the efficiency jumps of this type of machines are likely to come from greater growth in engineering design but also from the use and cunning that we are able to take advantage of the systems already in play.<br><br><br>The work of EveryDayAstronaut and other influencers is really wonderful, hopefully the mainstream media will be encouraged to support you. I mean it from the bottom of my heart.\r<br>\r<br>The future of our civilization depends on the success of SpaceX, so with the desire of my heart it is only enough.

I think you could have had a really good long chat had not someone intervened, because clearly, your enthusiasm and level of understanding fed into Elon&#39;s excitement.
