Looks like about two metres off centre. If Space X can do that time after time on a seriously heaving barge on the ocean, they should be able to land the &quot;BFR&quot; booster on its very fixed launch pad (I would expect a precision of centimetres being needed). Whereas the Falcon 9 first stage has a dry may of around 20 tons, we can expect the BFR first stage to be over 100 tons. The Saturn V first stage weighed about 130 tons, but its engines had a low thrust to weight ratio and composites were not widely used in those days, but BFR will need to be more robust to withstand re-entry and re-use.", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T18:29:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Project Space", "comment_text": "Thank you jeff", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T17:12:38Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheEEStudent", "comment_text": "&quot;I knew we&#39;ve lost ze war once I saw unpainted Mustangs above Berlin, cause this means ze Americans were making them faster than they&#39;ve had paint!&quot; (unknown German general, WWII).", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T16:16:21Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "WheatleyOS", "comment_text": "The dirty look on the rocket makes it feel like we&#39;re in the future, where launching a rocket is no biggie", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T14:55:37Z", "likes_count": 26}, {"comment_by": "Daniele Marinelli", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3FNr-WiTIQ&amp;t=46m15s\">46:15</a>  loss of pieces", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T13:33:18Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Good Daddy", "comment_text": "WoW!!!!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "comment_date": "2018-12-04T12:46:06Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Peter Arnold", "comment_text": "Thanks for another entertaining webcast, Tim.
