Around the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5M8hfCituk&amp;t=5m00s\">5:00</a> minute mark you put the blame on the supplier for the part that failed on the SpaceX CRS-7 mission.  But  NASA&#39;s Independent Review Team&#39;s published report (March 12th, 2018) has a different, somewhat more nuanced take on it.  It seems to me that this is the relevant quote from that report:<br><br>\u201cIt is important to note that the IRT\u2019s conclusions regarding the direct, and immediate causes are consistent with the determination made by the SpaceX AIT investigation findings. Where the IRT differs with SpaceX is in regards to the initiating cause. SpaceX in their AIT report identifies \u201cmaterial defect\u201d as the \u201cmost probable\u201d cause for the rod end breaking. However, the IRT\u2019s view is that while \u201crod end breakage due to material defect\u201d is credible, the IRT does not denote it a \u201cmost probable\u201d since the IRT also views \u201crod end manufacturing damage\u201d, \u201crod end strut mis-installation\u201d, \u201crod end collateral damage\u201d or some other part of the axial strut breaking as equally credible causes to have liberated the COPV. Lastly, the key technical finding by the IRT with regard to this failure was that it was due to a design error: SpaceX chose to use an industrial grade (as opposed to aerospace grade) 17-4 PH SS (precipitation-hardening stainless steel) cast part (the \u201cRod End\u201d) in a critical load path under cryogenic conditions and strenuous flight environments. The implementation was done without adequate screening or testing of the industrial grade part, without regard to the manufacturer\u2019s recommendations for a 4:1 factor of safety when using their industrial grade part in an application, and without proper modeling or adequate load testing of the part under predicted flight conditions. This design error is directly related to the Falcon 9 CRS-7 launch failure as a \u201ccredible\u201d cause.\u201d<br><br>If you could comment on this in some future video, that would be great.
