They seem to be growing and shrinking with the rumble of the engine. I think it&#39;s caused by the intense sound of the engine condensing the water out of the air. Sound is just pressure waves, with high-pressure peaks and low-pressure troughs. Sound waves change the pressure in the air by up to \u00b120 Pascals (Pa) at 120 dB (the threshold of pain). This is about as loud as a concert or an ambulance siren (right at the sound source, that is). When the pressure of a gas is reduced, it&#39;s temperature also decreases. When the temperature drops below the dew point, water condenses out of the air either as droplets on surfaces or as a cloud suspended in the air.<br><br>Rocket launches are around 190-200 dB, which is 10,000,000 times louder than  120 dB. Atmospheric pressure is only 100,000 Pa, so the lowest pressure drop any sound could realistically produce would be 100,00 Pa, at which point the pressure is 0. I&#39;m not really sure what the lowest pressure near a Falcon 9 rocket would be, but I&#39;m pretty sure that it would be low enough to drop the temperature below the dew point if we assume the pressure change to be adiabatic (that is, the temperature changes so rapidly that it doesn&#39;t have time to be warmed up by the surrounding air).<br><br>The air also heats up at the high-pressure regions, so that my be why the clouds seem to quickly pulsate, as they condense then immediately evaporate.", "comment_date": "2020-07-24T06:07:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DanDeMan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMtn4nECOcg&amp;t=1m06s\">1:06</a> Laminar flow going into turbulent flow from the engines", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T09:04:27Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "111danish111", "comment_text": "Music reminded me of blade runner movies&#39; music", "comment_date": "2020-06-14T00:13:24Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pyrus Rex", "comment_text": "That was the Debbie Does Dallas of rocket porn.

I have<br>For a long time I have been of the opinion that most people are their own worst critic, even those who are difficult to train or those who lack the ability to except constructive criticism when people presenting the criticism are only attempting to help many take it as a jab or as a put down . However, when they watch their actual performance when they are alone and they are not hearing, &quot; you&#39;re doing that wrong or you don&#39;t know what  you&#39;re doing&quot;. That hurts more and teaches less. ONLY WATCHED BY THE WELDER! Not a supervisor , not Elon, NO ONE! I have used this method many times with great success. Install a very small camera and recorder  inside the helmet then ask each welder to review their own work at least 2   Or more hours per week. I can almost guarantee the welding will end up noticeably better. I say this knowing that the problem(s) not with bad welders.

I understand the sensitivity of magnified movement unless you have a a few hundred thousands of dollars for a specialized camera to track smoothly.

There are features for FCPX and Premier that can track and corrects but it does have to crop in a little as the editor uses the range of motion and then averages the movement to be fixed or at least less shaky. But nice music and great effort. I watched a few Space Shuttle launches during my time working on the program for 32 years.
