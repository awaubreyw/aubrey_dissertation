I mean obviously he needs SpaceX to get there. But once you are there you need energy and you need to be able to store it (Solarcity), you also need vehicles to move around on the surface, that don&#39;t use combustion engines and can cover great distances without charging (Tesla). And of course since Mars does have a very low gravity, you cannot use cars or even normal trains for regular transportation, because the friction of the wheels is very low. You would need 3 times the distance to break and accelerate and fly off at every turn, at much lower speeds than here on Earth. So a maglev is basically the only solution for fast transport, and since you don&#39;t want to vent the entire platform everytime the train leaves the station, you need a sophisticated airlock (Hyperloop). Furthermore, since Mars has a very thin atmosphere and virtually no magnetic field, solar and cosmic radiation is much stronger on the surface. It was suggested quite often that habitats should at least partially be covered by martian soil, or built underground and connected via tunnels (Boring company). I know, I know, pareidolia, but it would make a lot of sense. Has Elon Musk ever mentioned something about using his other companies for his goal to reach Mars?", "comment_date": "2017-10-10T01:08:19Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Ray B", "comment_text": "&quot;Bloostar&quot; is doing balloon launch research and has a functioning prototype.
