You actual put real emotion into your content and show the highs and the lows, which is exactly how I feel when following SpaceX&#39;s journey, because Im emotionally invested in their success as well. Others are so robotic and carefree about it. But, then I remembered you saying in the past that you most likely wouldn&#39;t go on a trip like this and I immediately got disappointed....... So, to see that you have actually posted a submission and you&#39;re really down to do it has gotten me extremely excited! As far as your chances of being selected go, I think they&#39;re a lot higher than you think! I genuinely believe that Felix would have gotten the YT&#39;er spot if you hadn&#39;t submitted, but now that you have, I&#39;ve got a pretty strong gut feeling telling me that you&#39;ve actually got this! If I were you right now I&#39;d be both super excited and super nervous at the same time, but you&#39;ve got a few years to prepare and a few years to let Starship evolve! Go Tim Dodd!

He lacked David Brinkley&#39;s dry wit, but he set the standard for decisions regarding the type of news that would be investigated and reported, and the manner in which it was presented. I imagine you&#39;ve seen Cronkite&#39;s real-time commentaries on Gemini and Apollo flights, but I doubt you&#39;ve seen more than short clips from his nightly news broadcasts - which I saw in real time throughout the 1960s, 1970s, and very early 1980s. He was a different man on those nightly 30-minute broadcasts, and certainly in the 1970s, he understood those broadcasts as one of the great responsibilities of his time, since the world would take his words as unimpeachable and factual recitation of the most important matters of the day. If you go to the Moon, you will gain financially more than Walter Cronkite ever did, as a percentage of income pre- and post-Space Race. I believe your zeal for space-related developments is probably greater even than Cronkite&#39;s, but I don&#39;t see your commitment as being driven by journalistic standards, as Cronkite&#39;s unquestionably was. The comparison, then, does not stand up to scrutiny, at least for me. But Cronkite was the news broadcaster who most emoted on space-related matters, so perhaps you can get away with the comparison. But please keep in mind, the major reason CBS gave Cronkite the first chair in reporting space news was that he had demonstrated mastery of news reporting in general. News was not a money-making venture back then. Certainly it was a consideration, but it was understood by the networks more as a *responsibility*. The networks maintained bureaus in all of the major world capitals, and they lost money on most of them, but they were ethically bound to maintain those bureaus. Now the networks maintain only a handful of bureaus and rely almost exclusively on &quot;freelance&quot; journalists living on Raman noodles, because it saves money. Cronkite lived and worked in a very different time. Keep in mind that his careful calculations and sober sentiments informed even his space reporting. Now that you&#39;ve made this awkward comparison, perhaps you would do yourself and your followers a service by researching Cronkite&#39;s WWII and 1950s reporting, and his famous work on the Vietnam War, and become a bit humbled by this unequaled giant of American journalism - and then reporting on what you find. You will not only be humbled into the dust, but you may become a better reporter of space news by learning from the master.
