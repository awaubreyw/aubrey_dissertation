However, I feel that the Artemis Program may have a lot of potential. I understand that  SLS is not reusable and would probably have been a lot more useful if it launched in 2017 as planned but as far as I know it may allow us to go back to the moon a lot sooner than any current option. I do not think it is the best vehicle for lunar exploration but it seems like a good start. They may even start using Starship/Superheavy for lunar exploration\u2014 a task I think it would be better suited for than Mars exploration.

So, SSO&#39;s use a combination of inclination and altitude that makes the rotation rate of the orbital plane = 360 degrees/365 days. Each full day it will rotate a bit, about 1 degree, just enough that, as the Earth moves around the Sun, the Sun will be exactly over the same point of the Earth when the satellite passes.

Putting fuel in orbit from the moon is much easier than doing it from the earth.  The problem is how much fuel can you really make on the moon?  Is it economical, feasible and efficient?  Putting fuel into orbit that matches the speed of a ship in the lunar orbit plus the speed of the moon&#39;s orbit makes a lot of sense, but it might be even better to send that fuel ahead of the ship on the way to mars and refuel on rout so the mars ship doesn&#39;t have to slow down and then speed up again to orbit the moon, just shoot by it.  It&#39;s like that baton race, with 3 tandem runners passing the baton, as the first runner approaches the second runner, the second speeds up to get into a position that doesn&#39;t lose any velocity for the baton.    The tank could then use a small left over bit of fuel to go back to the moon and land to be refueled.  Similar to what space x is doing with it&#39;s first stage booster.

The limit is bound to the structural integrity of passengers or payload or combustion pressure.  I am working on a concept engine that uses 1000 bar pressure at lower volumes of fuel but spi of over 1000 seconds so this would be good for space travel with one engine burning at high pressure but low volume over a long time.

If you gradually slow down all the way to the ground, you are simply spending more time falling, so that 9.8m/s compounds more. That&#39;s it. You just want to get there as FAST as possible so that the surface is supporting you instead of your thruster. There&#39;s no inherent benefit to making one big fast burn vs. one long slow burn, in relation to any given acceleration.

When the engines are burning, you&#39;re effectively cancelling out the kinetic energy, but you really want the vehicles overall energy to be zero.  So by burning higher up, you aren&#39;t cancelling out the potential energy.  By burning as close to the ground as possible, the potential energy is very low, as it has all been converted into kinetic energy, so you are able to counteract much more energy than by burning higher up.
