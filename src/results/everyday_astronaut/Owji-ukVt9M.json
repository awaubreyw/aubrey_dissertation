This struck me as unphysical and like a recipe for a perpetual motion machine -- connect the pump output to the gas input.<br><br>However, I realized that a pump could use mechanical advantage to allow the lower pressure gas input to create a higher pressure output -- but at the cost of needing a greater volume rate of flow in the gas input than the pump output will have. No perpetual motion machine possible. That greater volume of gas is available since when the liquid propellants become gaseous, the same amount of propellant at a given pressure occupies a much greater volume.

The lower surface to volume ratio of larger engines is generally working against you cooling-wise.

The only thing I&#39;d add is that the choice between a fuel rich or oxygen rich closed cycle is not based on corrosion or coking.  It is based on the chemistry of the propellants you choose.  For instance, A Methalox engine uses the chemical equation CH4 + 2O2 -&gt;  CO2 + 2H2O.  For our reactants 2/3 of the moles (and hence volumetric flow and hence ability to do work) is in the Oxygen.  Therefore you use an oxygen rich preburner closed cycle.  A Hydrolox engine uses the chemical equation 2H2 + O2 -&gt; 2H2O.  Now the fuel is 2/3 of the propellant flow by volume so a fuel rich preburner would be chosen instead.  <br><br>Also, since temperature is proportional to the kinetic energy of the molecules (=1/2 M V2), the lighter the molecular mass of the reacted products, the higher the specific impulse for a given chamber temperature.  The higher the pressure of the chamber, the more of that potential to do work can be extracted (to the point where the fuel starts to turn back into a liquid as you covered already).", "comment_date": "2022-05-01T23:40:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Aidan", "comment_text": "I think this served to remind me the future headaches I&#39;ll get while studying to become an aero engineer.

It sounds impossible: fuel first flows from low pressure to high.  So far so good, because it does so under the influence of a pump.  Then the same fuel goes from high pressure to medium, driving a turbine -- the same turbine that powers the pump, not only for the fuel but also the O2.  Less mass-per-second of material going through less of a pressure drop, to power more mass-per-second going through more of a pressure increase?  That&#39;s what sounds impossible.  But power isn&#39;t mass per second times pressure difference.  It&#39;s volume per second times pressure difference.  A smaller volume of cold fuel gets pumped, and then turns into a larger volume of hot fuel as it goes through the regenerative cooling system.<br><br>It seems as though you could sort-of get around the size limit by having one turbine drive one pair of pumps to feed one combustion chamber, and then get enough area for heat exchange by having it go through multiple nozzles.  But I don&#39;t know where the benefits of having a larger engine show up.  Maybe it&#39;s all from a larger nozzle, in which case you wouldn&#39;t gain anything by having the nozzles technically be part of the same engine.", "comment_date": "2022-05-01T17:50:17Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mark O'Connell", "comment_text": "How about directed gravitational field engines?

Would like to add some extra details on turbine design for the turbo pump. As you have beautifully mentioned that staged combustion cycle require more mass flow in pre burner than in gas generator, the turbine type called as  \u201creaction turbine\u201d is used which allows less pressure drop in turbine and the flow through turbine is subsonic and is achieved by a subsonic nozzle upstream of turbine. Whereas in gas generator cycle since the flow is not coupled with chamber, we can afford a huge pressure drop in turbine/nozzle of turbine. This case requires another type of turbine called an \u201cImpulse turbine\u201d which works on momentum transfer principle. All the flow is expanded in a de laval nozzle just before turbine which creates a supersonic flow. Pressure drop in turbine section is negligible. The amount of gas expanded in turbine section compared to total expansion in nozzle and turbine is called as degree of reaction. Reaction turbine has high degree of reaction and the shape of blades is similar to an airfoil. Impulse turbine has very low degree of reaction and the design of blade is very simple.", "comment_date": "2022-04-29T04:13:49Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Juan Ok", "comment_text": "there should be a tip button here, he deserves it", "comment_date": "2022-04-29T04:08:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Random Indiana Guy", "comment_text": "Tim, how long ago did you reach 1M subs?
