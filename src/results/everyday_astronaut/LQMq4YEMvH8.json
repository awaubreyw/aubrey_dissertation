I should feel comfortable in going on some place and saying not only is Jane very attractive but she is a brilliant scientist as well what a delight to see her doing so well in her career. Now I&#39;m sorry anyone that would take offense at that needs to go home and grow up for a while before they come back out into public. Some astronaut is sitting on a panel a male astronaut and he&#39;s in short sleeves and he&#39;s got huge biceps and somebody makes the statement of with guns like that he could probably pick the rocket up and throw it into space and not a whole lot would be thought about it it&#39;s not a big deal it&#39;s a compliment it should be taken as such and move on grow up! Being politically correct is a disease it&#39;s a mindset where mountains are made out of molehills, tempests form in a teacup! Once again grow up! I don&#39;t know what the original comments were they could have been really off base or crass in which case certainly the people that posted them needed to be knocked down a peg but I felt that a comment on the other side balancing things out a little bit was needed in these days of PC", "comment_date": "2022-01-30T12:48:46Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Rocketron Evolve", "comment_text": "hi Tim can i use this music in my video ?\ud83d\ude01", "comment_date": "2021-12-12T10:49:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nihat Savmaz", "comment_text": "And i am back again.
