What&#39;s insuring that the Crew Dragon ends up in the ocean after the parachutes deploy, especially if there&#39;s an onshore wind?   I mean, I can understand aborting a mission if the wind is wrong, but the pad abort happens BEFORE the clock is zero, and those &quot;flight rules&quot; would have to be in place from the moment the astronauts strap in.  I&#39;m assuming a parachute-to-land landing would be pretty catastrophic.  <br><br>But if the Super Draco thrusters are throttleable, the abort system could specifically steer the thing WAY out to sea, before opening the parachutes.

The entire point of using the thrusters was because there is 0.087 psi 6.00 mbar about .6% earth&#39;s sea level pressure. During reentry to earth there is a atmosphere to slow any object or craft. Yet what is suggested is ridiculous. The idea that the body of a craft will slow the object down just will not work. We even have crafts that are sent to mars but only 40% have successful landings. That is a very bad number to be going on and there using a similar tactic of using the little atmosphere to slow the craft down. It is and has been a massive blunder with 60% failure. Would you go in a craft that had a 60% failure. How about going on a jet with these number.  When you check how many flights a year you get around 38.1 million flights a year. In 2018 there was over 500 deaths do to airline crashes. If you do the math the values of 0.36 per million flights, or one fatal accident for every 3 million flights. With landing on mars as SpaceX is suggestion is only going to increase there vailure to another 20% because the math tells you it will. SO they will have a 20% successful landing  with a high percentage of landing on water on mars. Yes There testing landing on water on earth but if you are looking to land on mars you should be spending more time covering that part as back in the 1960&#39;s tests that are public show how other space agencies did the earth landing part. Now the mars landing has been a blunder of rolling the dice. I don&#39;t know about you  but I only flight on a airline because I know there percentage of flight is well in the 90 &#39;s % something that Mars missions can not state. I think this is going to be a very bad idea.

However NASA and big contractor behavior is often NOT an example of this fallacy, and YOU are the one engaging in the Sunk Cost Fallacy in those cases...<br><br>If you&#39;ve already SUNK enormous amounts of money into a project and it is close to completion, then those costs are LOST already.  The only things that matter are costs going forward- and if you are close to completing a project then finishing it often comes with far fewer additional costs than starting over on a newer project with the same capabilities.  For instance, the Shuttle was INCREDIBLY expensive to develop, but by the time they realized they were going to end up way over-budget the future costs to finish the Shuttle were lower than they would have been if they had stsrted over on a new super-heavy lift rocket like SLS.  There was no recovering those costs, and despite your ignorant mocking, ABANDONING the Shuttle at that point and stsrting on a new auper-heavy lifter would have costed even MORE money than just finishing the Shuttle.<br><br>If you&#39;re 90% of the way into a $200 Billion project and only have $20 Billion to go, and a new option cones along that would have the same performance and cost only $40 Billion to develop you SHOULDN&#39;T abandon your current project and begin work on the alternative- that would be exactly twice as expensive.  Your already-expended costs are lost and you can&#39;t get them back- this is what it means for something to be a &quot;Sunk Cost&quot;...<br><br>Industry, interestingly, gets away with abandoning projects all the time because they can just write failed projects off as a loss on their taxes- and pay less in taxes several years into the future by crediting those losses towards their USA tax obligation.  It&#39;s a messed-up system, and one that Trump abused all the time in Real Estate to avoid paying taxes.  It&#39;s an option available to defense contractors and private corporations like SpaceX, but it&#39;s NOT an option available to NASA.  In short, abandoning a project is often still the more expensive choice even for private industry, but they can EXTERNALIZE part of that cost by writing it off as a loss for tax purposes, shoving off enough of the financial burden of abandoning the project (in ultimately higher total R&amp;D costs) to the rest of society in the form of reduced tax contributions that abandoning a project often becomes the profitable option for a business- but the more expensive choice for society as a whole due to ways the government ends up subsidizing this decision...", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T06:31:29Z", "likes_count": 3}, {"comment_by": "jdgregson", "comment_text": "It&#39;s highly annoying that you&#39;re looking slightly left of the camera.", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T05:40:59Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "ADANTHEGIANT", "comment_text": "Your a joke", "comment_date": "2017-09-25T04:46:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Roy Sherfan", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NW8G446MG4I&amp;t=6m10s\">6:10</a> Wow Elon.

There are tons of examples where he just claims fantastical-sounding concepts with ZERO technical/engineering/scientific expertise to back it up, and then inevitably has to backpedal when eventually enough experts who actually know what they&#39;re talking about tell him his idea is not technically possible or safe. The hyperloop is another example that is destined to fall on its face - so far out of the billions of dollars spent, they made a sled travel a length of 80 metres at just over 100km/h. It&#39;s a pathetic money-wasting exercise according to literally any engineer or physicist who actually knows what it would take to achieve the claims that the various hyperloop companies are making.<br>To make it a little more sinister, he has successfully convinced NASA (a government agency) to give him money for these harebrained ideas, almost without question. Pay attention to the wording he uses. Remember earlier in the year when he said that he had &quot;verbal approval&quot; from the government to start his next project?<br>No government representative has come forward to say they&#39;ve given him such approval, and Musk has failed to be specific enough to give any names.<br>It&#39;s because all he cares about is raising the value of his companies&#39; stock, and talking big is the best way to do it - especially when you&#39;ve convinced everyone that you are the second coming of Christ.
