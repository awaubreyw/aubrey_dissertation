Why would a one way Starship cargo lunar lander need sea level Raptors? 2. As someone who lived through the Apollo era I wonder if a one way lander needs more than ONE vacuum Raptor for trans-lunar injection in addition to the upper descent engines? and 3. Would a rearrangement of tankage for these permanent landers to the forward sections and crew/cargo area to the levels closest to the Raptor not improve balance and C/G as well as surface access? Tankage would be almost empty at landing. Use of remaining fuel/oxidizer followed by venting to vacuum and repurposing would seem to be a good thing. In my future dreams I see Raptors being returned after removal through access panels down the gravity well for a free ride back to Earth on orbital Starships.
