Today you should turn it around. Multistage single use rockets have a &#39;reusability penalty&#39;, which drives up the cost of space operations. Reusable systems have an operational cost benefit. So it doesn&#39; t really matter if they need more missions to bring the same total mass into orbit because your total cost can still be lower. When you do the math and trade space on single stage rockets and stages and a half, they are actually so interesting, and have always been defended in the literature as the best concept, that it is the route we are going down on with our little company. Forget multistage space systems. With reuse demonstrated they are no longer needed. New materials limit the mass creep more than before. To optimise for cost you just need to avoid the design decisions taken on the Space Shuttle. That means: no wings, no sideboosters, space ship on top, and engines above your propellant drop tank and a good heat shield + using a toroidal Aerospike. Some mass is used to protect the propellant tank against the engine exhaust, but it is still less than what is required to build wings. Maybe Kerbal is smart enough to calculate it correctly.<br><br>Eventually our proposal looks like sci fi but it only uses existing tech. The industry having stopped looking at it because of competing programs, while it was actually doing all the groundwork in our direction, is to our benefit.<br><br>So your calculation rule of thumb is correct for a Falcon 9, but not for a single stage or stage and a half using aerospikes. You can have your 30 metric ton payload to orbit in a volume much smaller than a Saturn 5 or Space Shuttle System and be reusable with vertical landing.

The solution is simple: do not discard the fairing. Yes, that would mean that you can&#39;t put in orbit as heavy payloads, but it might prove financially a good idea anyway (besides, 90% of what SpaceX puts in space, it has a huge margin in terms of weight -- and satellites become lighter with time, not heavier). So, you carry the fairing all the way through to the deployment (by opening it up like an upside down umbrella), and then you close it back and you use it as a heat shield on the way back (obviously it&#39;d have to be enforced for re-entry). And then you open it up again a few kilometers high to act as breaks, and after a small burn to change the orientation of the vehicle, you deploy parachutes (forget extra thrusters, fins, and legs, just splash it down in the sea). I think that&#39;s the only way that makes sense to bring the second stage back down (and bring back the fairing too, in a single step): by utilizing the fairing to do what it does best: protect the rocket and payload from pressure and heat. So if you use it that way to go up, why not use it to come down too? To me, it&#39;s the obvious solution.

Upon reaching a successful orbit the 2nd stage will release it&#39;s payload further greatly reducing mass. Third; The fairings. Soon after 1st stage separation the fairings are released to reduce mass and therefore fuel for a successful orbit also saving potential energy for a reentry burn.  Finally, atmospheric drag.

Jason Wentworth", "comment_text": "There are three other possibilities that I can think of off the top of my head (and I&#39;d wager that there are others as well):<br><br>An inflatable conical heat shield, similar to NASA&#39;s IRVE test shield, would be lightweight and could completely enclose the second stage.  (McDonnell Douglas engineer Philip Bono designed Saturn-derived [using up to 8 F-1 engines], SSTO--Single-Stage-To-Orbit--reusable rockets that used similar--but much larger--inflatable heat shields for ocean landings; the rocket wouldn&#39;t have gotten wet because of the way the heat shield would have been oriented in the water.<br><br>Another option (which would permit rocket-braked landing of the second stage without needing a second set of landing engines) would be to use an aerospike rocket engine on the second stage.  Aerospike engines have &quot;inside-out&quot; nozzles that automatically compensate for changes in the ambient atmospheric pressure, and they often utilize multiple combustor modules, which permits a wide throttle range (this is useful for landing a very light stage whose propellant tanks are mostly empty).  They can also serve as &quot;base (bottom)--first&quot; heat shields (which can be actively cooled by circulating a relatively small amount of one propellant--usually the fuel--through them during re-entry and then venting it through the combustors).  Philip Bono utilized aerospike engines in his many later designs for small to very large SSTO reusable spaceships.  A recoverable &amp; reusable second stage of this type is much easier to achieve than a SSTO ship, because SSTO vehicles--especially smaller ones; very large ones are not so difficult due to scaling effects--require very lightweight structures in order to achieve Earth orbit using just one stage (achieving SSTO on the Moon is easy, as the Apollo Lunar Modules demonstrated).<br><br>Even the existing Falcon 9 second stages could (with relatively little modification) be left in orbit and used as space tugs, even to help support the establishment of a lunar base.  Plus, the stages could serve as DIY habitat modules to begin such a base; landed on the Moon with temporary, removable landing gear (their Vacuum Merlin engines would permit soft landings there, with properly-timed burns), the stages could be laid down horizontal and covered with lunar regolith (for radiation protection and for regulating their internal temperature) to serve as pressurized housing and storage modules.", "comment_date": "2017-06-24T07:22:15Z", "likes_count": 32}, {"comment_by": "Mike", "comment_text": "Nice.. subscribed! :)<br><br>OK, now for the silly question:<br><br>Could the second stage get back into the atmosphere enough to deploy a high-speed parachute that would slow it enough to deploy a wing type parachute (maybe one that deploys in stages) like those used on paramotors?<br><br>The body of the stage could lay horizontal, and have two rear skids deploy and a front skid (to keep weight minimal compared to landing gear but set up friction to keep the vehicle pointed straight at touchdown and roll).<br><br>The stage would be under autopilot and able to use its kinetic energy converted to forward motion to steer to a runway, then flare to wash off speed and generate lift when touching down.<br><br>Now when I say paramotor wing I&#39;m not talking about one with the usual glide ratio; it&#39;d be something yielding performance more like the flying-pair-of-pliers space shuttle.", "comment_date": "2017-06-24T07:16:35Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Adams", "comment_text": "inor nitpick, at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rC2Z5El-8E&amp;t=2m08s\">2:08</a>, you show the max speed of GTO at 9.8km/s.
