I&#39;ve been binge watching anything space x related of yours. One humble critique, I really love your music and the fact its all home made but sometimes I feel it might be a little loud and perhaps doesn&#39;t allow us to here what the in game sounds are etc. I&#39;m sure you spend a lot of time thinking about how you want the audio in your videos, just my two cents! I cant complain though its great music.", "comment_date": "2018-03-23T06:27:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Michael", "comment_text": "Wow, the quality difference (and the room) from todays videos to this are incredible.

Get into a slightly higher orbit, circularize then adjust your PE to be on the final orbit. You can still intercept within one orbit, but is much more precise and more forgiving if you do mistakes.<br><br>With such a high intercept velocity, if you have a low TWR rocket, you&#39;ll have to burn for minutes, risk the chance of missing the window and costing you more dV in the long run.<br><br>Also you need to learn some tricks in regards to burning anti-target to intercept. You don&#39;t burn on anti target, you don&#39;t burn on retrograde, in fact you burn on the other side of the retrograde marker, aligned with the anti-target, to &quot;push&quot; it onto your anti-target marker. That&#39;s the most efficient way to burn for a intercept.", "comment_date": "2018-02-07T08:40:08Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "lextacy_2008", "comment_text": "You live near SIoux City?!
