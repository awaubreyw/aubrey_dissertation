Then they could install all three of them on SN 5 and use that for both the 150 meter hop and 20 km test flight later this year. This is cause SN 5 seems to be progressing rapidly towards a flight worthy standard and is so complete that it would make a lot of sense to take everything learned from SN 4 into that one instead of doing whats basicly a repeat of Starhoppers test but with SN 4. After all the only thing they can learn from a hop test with SN 4 is how to handle a Starship with its full length and I can easily see that being done with SN 5 and three raptors instead.
