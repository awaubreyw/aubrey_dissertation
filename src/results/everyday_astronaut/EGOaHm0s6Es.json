I happened to be on the street after the sun had fallen below the horizon and spotted the air show. I was hoping for a flying saucer but rats it was just another rocket. We have many rockets flying around here. I recognized  the signs pretty soon. I don&#39;t usually catch them in flight. They typically leave a multicolored contrail due to exotic rocket fuel chemistry. This was an exciting flight. The timing was great for observation. Yes, there were 2 lights, and yes, they did appear to hover. I thought that a bit odd so I scrutinized them carefully. Turns out movement could be discerned but very slow. I think the explanation here is the angle of observation. Nobody throws a missile over LA but North Korea, and it is early in their season. It had to be sent over the ocean so it could fall harmlessly. So what I observed was the view into the exhaust as it moved due west of me. It was drifting to the south slowly. The photos don&#39;t do it justice. The cloud was so high up the sun could still light it and it was 4th of July colorful. The 2 glowing objects drifted slowly to the south and the northern one slid down almost to the horizon when it flared cherry red and winked out. The other one travelled on and became too faint to observe. We do get some good saucer action around here. Our thinly populated wasteland nearby the fleshpots of LA has it&#39;s attractions, I suppose. Over in San Bernardino County George Van Tassel set up camp and had a few powwows with saucer crews. Today that is illegal. At March AFB Eisenhower is supposed to have met some saucer crewmen. They exhibited some cloaking tech that alarmed him, so he told them it was too soon for formal relations. An acquaintance who is kind of dumb went camping in the hills to the west one night and had a saucer fly over him so close he could have hit it with a rock. Rivet counting close. One night when it was too hot to sleep inside I spotted something advanced fly from horizon to horizon at a brisk clip. That is, 2 or 3 times normal jet traffic speeds. I might have brushed it off, but as it reached the March tarmac approach it stopped and as it hovered it waggled falling leaf style and moved upward. It was already quite high, at least as high as that rocket and a little more and it dimmed as it rose until it faded out. I would say it entered outer space and departed for fur parts. YT has a GVT video that is more revealing than the current disclosure whistle blowers, and he did it in the 1950s. It&#39;s like something you would see on Outer Limits. In the early 1950s there was an undercurrent of expectation that saucers would be the next aerospace development. Alas, the notion was pretty well crushed by 1960 by hostile propaganda. I suppose the PTB have their reasons and await developments.", "comment_date": "2017-12-23T13:04:48Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Mami Wata", "comment_text": "Wrong!", "comment_date": "2017-12-23T12:59:16Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Sharman Klinefelter", "comment_text": "looks nothing like you were showing", "comment_date": "2017-12-23T12:42:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "\u2d49\u2d5c\u2d54\u2d53\u2d4f\u2d30\u2d53\u2d5c", "comment_text": "It&#39;s just Santa who&#39;s testing his hypersonic delivery vehicle.", "comment_date": "2017-12-23T12:39:15Z", "likes_count": 61}, {"comment_by": "Don Hinds", "comment_text": "Tim, you have really been kicking butt lately and I can\u2019t wait for your video on Falcon Heavy!
