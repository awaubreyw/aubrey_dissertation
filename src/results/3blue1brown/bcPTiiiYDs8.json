Once I taught her how everything works in tao then she had a massive lightbulb moment and suddenly it made sense and it only took an afternoon, because it does make sense in that context, 1 tau radians = 1 revolution around the unit circle. This makes everything else fall into place much more naturally. Once she understood this then the traditional way made more sense, but there\u2019s this awkward extra step in thinking when using pi, especially for students.

Otherwise, I believe engineers should use Pi (=3.14...) because diameter and circumference are direct measurements while radius is an abstract concept relative to diameter, however, I believe mathematicians should use Tau because the concept of a perfect circle in some space comes about from a given center and radius, hence the length of the border line should be taken relative to its radius.

He can bring beauty out of the ashes of lost dreams. He can gleam Joy out of sorrow, Peace out of adversity. Only a Friend who is the King of Kings could accomplish this divine alchemy.
