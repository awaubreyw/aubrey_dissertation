TL;DR, given the spirit of the question it should have also specified that f(x) &gt; 0 for all x, and I&#39;m clearly prone to deep confusion while trying to juggle the many balls of live broadcasting.<br><br><br>The question asks about a function f satisfying f(a + b) = f(a)f(b).  The relevant part of the question was whether f(-1) must be 1 / f(1).<br><br><br>- It was originally graded in a way to suggest that this <i>does</i> indeed need to be true.<br>- While &quot;explaining&quot; it, I realized that the explanation required that f(0) = 1, and questioned whether this is necessarily true.  I even said, &quot;oh, you could just scale it&quot;.  This thought of scaling is not correct, since (c*f(a))(c*f(b)) = c^2 f(a + b), so the lhs and rhs doesn&#39;t scale the same way.<br>- At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxYOEwM6Wbk&amp;t=27m48s\">27:48</a>, Sam points out that the constant function f(x) = 0 doesn&#39;t work, which I misread as asking about whether f(x) = 0 for some x (sorry Sam!).<br>- Crispin points out that f(0) must be 1 because f(x) = f(x + 0) = f(x)*f(0).  This is true, as long as f(x) does not equal 0 everywhere, but at that point, I was still weirdly blind to that edge case and enthusiastically accepted this as a reason that the question was originally graded correctly.<br>- At <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxYOEwM6Wbk&amp;t=49m07s\">49:07</a>, more of the discussion that has been happening on twitter is brought to screen, where Eric correctly points out that Crispin&#39;s proof doesn&#39;t work for the constant function f(x) = 0, which  Sam had said all along much earlier and I misread.<br><br><br>Thanks for the good discussion, and the tolerance of some live befuddlement.", "comment_date": "2020-04-29T16:04:12Z", "likes_count": 770}, {"comment_by": "Tensor Tab", "comment_text": "We&#39;re we paying attention?

I give the full explanation of i along with everything else that has been misunderstood for over 100 years in mathematics and\u00a0 physics in a full Grand Unified Field paper that explains, unifies, solves and fixes everything in physics. That was unlocked by the simple common sense inequality that solves the double slit experiment.  Perhaps the proof will help physicists understand the solution to the double slit experiment and why the model of travelling particles is impossible they are waves, always waves moving through spacetime which is a physical, transparent (dark), lattice of particles (dark matter) held together by elastic pipes. The particles oscillate as passing waves of energy move through the fluid that flows within spacetime. Moving through trillions of field particles a second gives us the optical illusion that they are single particles (another optical illusion held back by human beings slow to embrace new truths, just like the round Earth was resisted for 2,000 years then when Columbus broke the wall the heliocentric model was resisted, let&#39;s hope this time enough is enough).

Our sun goes nova in varying degrees of magnitude periodically, the evidence known as the 3 metre problem shows the dinosaurs were dead and buried under 3 metres of rock with radioactive material (from a supernova), millions of years before the Famous meteorite that was incorrectly blamed for their extinction hit the Yucatan Peninsula. Space weather stations are doing everything they can trying to get NASA and other scientists in power to listen to, understand and show the real evidence but they are being suppressed, the evidence and the theory of Everything shows that our sun will go nova again and unless we are prepared in some way we are sitting ducks like the dinosaurs, if it is a micro nova we will get all our electric systems wiped out waking up to no electricity, communications, fuel at the pumps, no food supplies, no piped water etc. We wake up alive but in a zombie type apocalypse, if it hits with the magnitude of a supernova it will wipe out us and 99% of life on Earth like it did to the dinosaurs and their buddies.

Probability that I win was (1 - (1^j)/(2^j)) but we know 2^j = N so probability of essentially doubling up is (1 - (1/N))^N = .367. Why in a coin toss am I getting this number. The above compound interest formula tends to e but the one below tends to 1/e. I don&#39;t quite understand why it&#39;s not .50? I know we are looking at the probability of going on a streak of wins or losses but in the long run shouldn&#39;t it just be 50%. Also, how does this relate to the Expected value of flipping coins where I am being laid 2:1 odds. I am sort of confused. Also this function N = 2^j can be written as j = Log base 2 (N) so with 100$ i will go busto in 7 trials if I don&#39;t win. 1000$ ~ 10 times. 10K ~ 13 times. 100K ~ 16 times and 1M ~ 20 times. So I could lose 1M if I go on a streak of 20 losses in a coin toss when doubling my bet each trial (starting with 1$ &amp; I get this is just geometric progression).

Possibly, a number of people did not know how to apply any of the choices given (let alone start testing them and get it wrong by stumbling/creating an error). If Grant (I feel awkward calling him by his first name) knew a number of people struggled with the question, he may have explained how to think about the question in greater detail. I say all of this, without viewing the answer to Q2 yet, so maybe he does exactly that. Often times after viewing a solution, I can understand the steps, but that does not mean I would have known how to start the solution in the same manner as the solution writer. This is the second instance of this. The first instance of this occurred while trying to answer cos(75), there were four options, all specific not-rounded values like sqrt(6) - sqrt(3) / 2 or sqrt(6) + sqrt(3) / 2, ect, and I was not able to come up with any of those choices because I used an incorrect approach to the problem. I should have made the connection to use the complex number notation involving cos and sin, but I didn&#39;t.

It essentially tells us that any given quadratic equation can be solved for the two solutions, and then by noting where they are on the complex plane (for example) one can use what Euler&#39;s formula says to express them in terms of real numbers. This is interesting because we know that life exists in our Universe as a result of natural selection working upon random mutations combined with genetic recombination.<br><br>If we trace the path of life on Earth, it becomes apparent that there is a certain non-randomness about its course.

In fact there are two distinct paths: one for bacteria and another for everything else (that is, multi-cellular organisms).

So we realised that the derivative of the exponential is proportional to the exponential itself and then our teacher went further with the idea &#39;can we find a value for which ln(a) = 1 so that the derivative is equal to the function itself?&#39; That&#39;s how we derived Euler&#39;s number and I think that is still the most elegant way to explain &#39;it&#39;s origin&#39;. <br><br>Taking that a bit further, I find it also a bit weird that you&#39;re stating that e^x should not be seen as e.e.e.e.... x times. But that it is rather a shorthand of the exp(x)=1+x+[(x^2)/2]+... function. <br>Somehow this is for me the most strange &#39;assumption&#39; that I ever saw you making while explaining something. <br>e^x of course should be seen as e.e.e..... x times! <br>And of course, it loses intuition when x is not a natural number (or integer if you will). But that goes for basically all functions and other mathematical concepts.

You have such a great video on what Taylor series are. Namely a &#39;tool&#39; to work with &#39;complex&#39; functions by approximating them as &#39;simple polynomials&#39; because they are so &#39;easy to manipulate&#39; (to derivatize, integrate, ...). Of course, using its Taylor series here enables use to explain in a nice way what is going on for different values of theta and so on but I find it still odd that we should just look at e^x as just being &#39;that polynomial&#39;. :p<br><br>Either way, still awesome to watch. :D", "comment_date": "2020-05-16T11:51:48Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Matthew Reed", "comment_text": "I&#39;m 2 weeks behind, and I&#39;m not sure if anyone else has said this...<br><br><br>if f(x+y) = f(x) * f(y) and f(1) != 0<br><br><br>f(x) = f(x+1) * f(-1) = f(x) * (f(1)*f(-1))<br>=&gt; f(1) * f(-1) = 1<br>=&gt; f(-1) = 1/f(1)<br><br><br>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s bound to be edge cases that I missed, but my brain tells me this should work.", "comment_date": "2020-05-14T16:38:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "claudius peterson", "comment_text": "Man your lessons are incredibly good.

The problem of course is a byproduct of calling the power an &quot;imaginary&quot; in the first place.

So we &quot;proved&quot; that 0 =|= 0, which means that such function f cannot exist.<br>(phew)<br>so yes, assuming that f is not a zero function is enough. and once we have that, this f(a + b) = f(a) * f(b) property automatically implies that our function cannot attain the value of 0 at all.<br>cool!<br>(excited)<br>what else can we prove about this function f?<br>well how about the fact that if we already know that f(0) = 1, and assume that f(1) &gt; 0, i.e. that f is positive at 1, then we can show that f is positive for all of its arguments, and if we assume that f(1) &lt; 0 instead, then we can show that f is alternating in sign like so ..., f(-2) &gt; 0, f(-1) &lt; 0, f(0) &gt; 0, f(1) &lt; 0, f(2) &gt; 0, ...<br>and how about the fact that if we already know that f(0) = 1, and we assume that f(1) &gt; 1, then f will be monotonically increasing function, and if we assume that 0 &lt; f(1) &lt; 1 instead, then f will be monotonically decreasing function?<br>(mindblown)<br>anyway 3blue1brown. please don&#39;t take it too personal. if i were to sit where you have sitten, that would have been a mathematical disaster. ;) and lastly but not leastly thank you dearly for putting so much love and effort into this channel. you&#39;re amazing.<br><br>edit. ok, so i&#39;ve read this and basically all of that middle part was really intended by me for some math-young 3blue1brown channel viewers, and not so much for 3blue1brown himself. i just wanted to make this clear, as otherwise it just reads itself really dumb and pretentious. ;)", "comment_date": "2020-04-29T19:36:19Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Schrodinger's Cat", "comment_text": "@3Blue1Brown can you please explain the cauchy integral theorem", "comment_date": "2020-04-29T19:34:53Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Uplifting Community", "comment_text": "Woah!

This will give you 180 degrees or PI radians depending on the mode you are using. <br><br>What is interesting with this is that we can also say that <br>e^(iPI) = (1,0) dot (-1,0) = cos(180) = cos(PI). This works for another reason that is related more towards simple geometry and basic algebra that pertains to the properties of lines themselves. All straight lines have an angle of either 0, +/-180 degrees or +/-PI radians, or +/- 360 degrees or +/- 2PI radians.<br><br>Did you know that all of this above is embedded within the expression (1+1) and that when you apply the operation of addition of 1 onto itself and end up with a result of 2, that it actually generates the unit circle which includes every aspect of all branches of mathematics? This includes all numbers from 0 up to and including infinity, the other operators such as -, *, /, ^, roots, logs, all other expressions, equations, and functions. It also contains every aspect of algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. It even includes calculus. The equation 1+1 = 2 gives you the basis for the equation of the unit circle centered at the origin.<br><br>The general equation of the circle is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. In these cases, circles will be fixed at the origin (0,0). This then becomes x^2 + y^2 = r^2. Doesn&#39;t this equation look familiar, just that it uses different variables? A^2 + B^2 = C^2. We have the Pythagorean Theorem.<br><br>So how does the equation 1+1+2 give us the Pythagorean Theorem or the equation of the circle? Well, it&#39;s not the general equation of the circle, it&#39;s the equation to the unit circle fixed at the origin.<br><br>We know the unit circle has 1 for its radius and 2 for its diameter. I&#39;m going to use the vectors A=(1,0) and B=(-1,0) from above. We can state that A^2 + B^2 = 1^2. If we take the sqrt of 1^2 we end up with 1. If we take the sqrt of the other side we end up with sqrt(A^2 + B^2) = A + B. So if we plug in the two vectors we end up with (1,0) + (-1,0) = 2. This doesn&#39;t make sense... because (1,0) + (-1,0) = (0,0) as these vectors would negate each other and would point at the origin (0,0). Since we took the sqrt of the radius we know that when it was squared it&#39;s positive. Also, we know that before we took the sqrt of the A^2 + B^2 terms they will be positive. So, within this context, we have to use the magnitude of these vectors, not their directions! We can try this again |(1,0)| + |(-1,0)| = 2. And there you have it! 1 + 1 = 2! And this proves the Pythagorean Theorem and the Equation of the Unit Circle fixed at the origin. <br><br>In my opinion, this should be changed from a Theorem to an actual Law of Mathematics. It should be called The Law of Addition!

To show that the terms of exp(x)*exp(y) have\r<br>the form x^k*y^m/(k!*m!), one can write the expression as\r<br>(1+x+x^2/2+...+x^k/k!+...)(1+y+y^2/2+...+y^m/m!+...)\r<br>By expansion, we can choose one term from the first bracket\r<br>and another from the second bracket, and the power of x and y\r<br>would be unique, so the term is just x^k/k!*y^m/m! or x^k*y^m/(k!*m!)\r<br>\r<br>2. To show that exp(x+y) have terms of the form 1/n!*(n choose k) x^k*y^(n-k)\r<br>Just write exp(x+y)=sum_{n=0}^{infty} (x+y)^n/n!\r<br>Use (x+y)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} (n choose k) x^k*y^(n-k)\r<br>Again, the powers of x and y are always unique. Hence, the coefficient of x^k*y^(n-k) is\r<br>(n choose k)/n! (remember division by n! from the exp function). Thus, proven.\r<br>\r<br>3. To show that (1) and (2) imply that exp(x)*exp(y)=exp(x+y), see (2).\r<br>Let n-k=m. We can always pick n=m+k such that we have powers x^k*y^m in the expansion.\r<br>Additionally, we have the coefficient is (n choose k)/n!=((n!)/(k!*(n-k)!))/(n!)\r<br>=1/(k!*m!), which is the same as 1. Hence, each term of exp(x+y) corresponds with a term\r<br>of exp(x)exp(y). Thus, they are equal.\r<br>\r<br>4. For real numbers, this is evidently okay.\r<br>For complex numbers, we can easily justify that (1) and (2) work because of commutativity, associativity, and distributivity,\r<br>because then we can do the algebra quite well like with the real numbers.\r<br>As of matrices, we can define power of matrices and division by scalars, and so exp(A) is defined, given A is a square matrix.\r<br>However, the property exp(X+Y)=exp(X)exp(Y) holds usually when XY=YX (they commute), such that the binomial theorem can hold\r<br>(terms in the binomial expansion are stuff like XY and YX, which we could add together if they commuted, but that&#39;s not always the case for matrices)\r<br>Consequently, exp((a+b)X)=exp(aX)exp(bX), where X is a square matrix, and a and b are scalars.\r<br>Moreover, exp(X)exp(-X)=I, where I is the identity matrix that behaves like 1 in sense of multiplication (behaves like exp(0)).\r<br>So yes, we can extend the definition for many different objects if we need to, like complex numbers and matrices, and these can benefit us in\r<br>electric engineering or differential equations.\r<br>\r<br>Great homework, great lesson 3b1b!
