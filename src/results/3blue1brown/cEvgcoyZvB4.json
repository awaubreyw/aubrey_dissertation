I imagined that first would have been some more practise to use logarithms and some more insight why they were usefull.<br><br>Here&#39;s a brief look of history of logaritms and you can find more concise versions from youtube (IIRC mathloger has ones) : Napier made first logarithms by using clever calculations on the intrest rate function, seen in previous lecture, to come up with the list of logarithms. They were e-based because the interest rate function gives you the exp()-function but no-one is sure if Napier knew this. What he did know that these new numbers changed multiplication (hard) to addition (easy) and he published them and seafarers were delighted. Then Briggs realised that 10-based logarithms would be easier for tabulation and using the base-change property of logarithms he calculated the numbers from the Napier numbers.<br><br>So logarithms were there to ease numerical calculations. Tools using logarithms, slide rule is one example, were made to quickly do multiplication and exponentation. These were wildly used up to 1970&#39;s when pocket calculators started to make them obsolite. As a curiosity, I have always wondered why do pocket calculators include 10-based logaritms and antilogarithms. I think they were there just for nostalgic reasons as they are not really needed as ways to do calculations anymore. Natural logs come up in math solutions all the time so they are needed, but 10-based logs were only used to do the calculations when you didn&#39;t have a calculator to do them.", "comment_date": "2021-08-04T05:38:05Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "David Wilkie", "comment_text": "My brief qualification for Teaching Assistant was to help someone else&#39;s applications of techniques to practical teaching and learning, &quot;by the book&quot;, which is fine for standard rules and one kind of efficiency. <br>So hunting for an efficient curriculum for direct learning.., that is a Metastudy, suitable for metastable pulse-evolution differentiates and experience integration Intuition development sequences.

Everything&#39;s going well for most of them, but eventually two of the snakes come back and tell Noah they&#39;re having trouble.  &quot;We can&#39;t seem to get in the mood,&quot; they say.  Unsure how to motivate them, Noah prays for guidance.  God says, &quot;Go to the mightiest tree on the mountain, fell it, and chop it in half.  Then, the problem will be solved.&quot;  This only confuses Noah more, but he doesn&#39;t doubt God&#39;s wisdom, and does as he is commanded.  As soon as the tree is felled, Noah is amazed to find the snakes immediately hop on top of one of the halves of the tree trunk, entwine their bodies, and, well, you know.

Mind you, I&#39;m paused at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEvgcoyZvB4&amp;t=52m29s\">52:29</a> so if he already said this later in the video, then my bad for commenting too early. log(a+b) is a pretty weird one to think about, but try to imagine each stretch from the powers of the base being proportionate. For example, just think about the graph of f(x) = log(x) where the base can be anything. Let&#39;s say the base is n. Look at the graph from x=1 to x=n. I&#39;m looking at 1 to n because this translates to x=n^0 and x=n^1. If you look how the graph grows from x=n^0 to x=n^1, you&#39;ll notice that the graph grows at the same rate between x=n^1 and x=n^2. You&#39;ll notice that the y-value&#39;s decimal places look very similar at midpoints. You begin to notice that each section of this graph from x=n^(k) to x=n^(k+1) look exactly the same, and that&#39;s because it&#39;s is (at least proportionately)<br><br><br>So how does this help, intuitively? Let&#39;s look at an example of log(8+16) using a base of 2. We know that log(8) = 3, and log(16) = 4. But what about this pesky log(24)? 24 isn&#39;t a nice power of 2 so this feels pretty weird, but it just so happens that 24 is the midpoint between 2^4 and 2^5. So the answer of log(24) is going to be between 4 and 5, and we know that the graph of f(x)=log(x) between x=16 and x=32 is proportional in growth rate to that same graph between x=1 and x=2 (because that&#39;s x=2^0 and x=2^1). So all we have to do is figure out how deep into the section between x=16 and x=32 we went. We went half way, to x=24. So what&#39;s the value half way between x=1 and x=2? Well it&#39;s going to be the y-value at x=1.5 because that&#39;s half way. Another way of writing that is the y-value of (1+b/a), which is (1 + 8/16), which is 1.5. Take that log.. log(1.5)... or log(1+a/b)... and add it to log(16), and that&#39;s your answer. Yes! log(8+16) = log(16) + log(1 + 8/16). I should also note that you can write it the other way around: log(8+16) = log(8) + log(1 + 16/8).<br><br><br>Generally, log(a+b) = log(b) + log(1 + a/b)<br>AND you can even swap the (a) and (b) on the right side: log(a+b) = log(a) + log(1+ b/a)", "comment_date": "2020-05-06T05:40:19Z", "likes_count": 29}, {"comment_by": "squibble", "comment_text": "the triangle thingy is what helped me remember what a logarithm is in the first place :D", "comment_date": "2020-05-06T05:36:32Z", "likes_count": 19}, {"comment_by": "Varun Raju", "comment_text": "Grant, I think a lecture on Conic sections and Hyperbolic functions would be very useful for us high school students.
