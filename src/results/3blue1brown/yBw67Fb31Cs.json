I never wanted to learn sine, cosine or anything related because it just didn&#39;t make sense. So, today I was like, well, what IS IT? So, I went looking for people who might make sense of it and found a lot of videos that didn&#39;t, I nearly lost all hope and then I saw this video! With renewed hope and fresh coffee I dove in and now it makes all the sense in the world.<br>Sine of the angle is the y coordinate and the cosine is the x coordinate of the endpoint of the radius. Why don&#39;t they just start with that instead of telling people to memorize all kinds of stuff without telling them what a thing is?<br><br>Now I only have to memorize what it is and I can figure out the rest. Slightly slower than the rest of the class because I didn&#39;t memorize any shortcuts, but I&quot;m not in class and I don&#39;t use trigonometry on a daily, weekly, monthly, or even yearly basis. So I need something far more basic to remember than: this mnemonic will help you calculate a thing without you knowing what you&#39;re actually doing. If I don&#39;t know what I&quot;m doing, how am I to figure out with zero experience how to go from that to the distance between two stars? Then I&#39;d have to look all that stuff up. Then I might as well just look up the distance and skip all the extra work. What&#39;s the fun in that? With the equilateral triangle in my head I can figure out all the steps I need to calculate any distance or angle.<br><br>And as an alien, I really appreciate the radians. Degrees make no sense whatsoever, although, they did pick a fairly good number for the total degrees of a circle. The amount of factors it has is pretty brain friendly. <br><br>But, why don&#39;t teachers just start with explaining what sine and cosine are so that it makes sense to students so they&#39;ll be motivated to learn how to apply it to triangles instead of telling kids how to apply it and not giving a damn if they&#39;ll ever work out backwards from there to how and why it actually works, if they even can? I wasn&#39;t able to. Partly because I refused to memorize shit I didn&#39;t understand.<br>I still got plenty of A&#39;s to outweigh the trigonomtry failures. I passed my exam with an A- and got an A- on my diploma, which cost me a cake. Had I just messed up the tests better and gotten an A- for my exam, I would&#39;ve had the largest difference between my grade and exam result and I would&#39;ve won the cake the teacher gave as a prize for that. That seemed unfair to me. I think she shudda given two cakes, one extra to the dillweed with the highest of all grades, me :D Then again, that would only encourage me further to never do any homework, but getting away with everything already did that, so that woulnd&#39;t make any difference for me.<br><br>PS I said:&quot; what sine and cosine are&quot;, and that&#39;s not how it&#39;s defined. I looked up the definition earlier, in the hopes it would make me understand and the definitions didn&#39;t help me understand much of it and made little to no sense to me without their relation to a circle; they seem like rephrasings of: just memorize this, don&#39;t ask how or why it works.", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T11:45:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Setekh", "comment_text": "&quot;It will go on and on no matter how far you walk.&quot;<br><br>I think it&#39;s directly related to how far I walk actually. <b>*stops walking*</b> See? <b>*dies*</b> The things i do, just to make a point, no pun(s) intended. :p", "comment_date": "2022-05-15T10:05:34Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "DreamWalker886", "comment_text": "This is why we call it the beautiful mind.", "comment_date": "2022-05-11T23:39:13Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Joseph Salmans", "comment_text": "amazing.

Since period is, informally, the length of the interval required for you to &quot;start over&quot; the repeated pattern a periodic function has, this means that the graph needs half as long of an interval to begin repeating with 2x as the input. <br><br>Similarly, if you have x+1 (say) as your input, your input&#39;s y-intercept is now 1, so that 1 is placed into the function if you put 0 into the independent variable (that&#39;s the definition of y-intercept). In fact, the function receives now a value that is always 1 greater than you intended to put in when you set the variable x, the same as if your roommate moves the thermometer up one degree each night after you set it to your perfect temp. So, just as you would eventually figure out to &quot;trick&quot; your roommate by putting in one <b>less</b> degree than your perfect temp in anticipation of your roommate moving the thermometer one degree higher, so too must you shift the input variable one degree to the left on the number line to compensate for the x+1 adding 1 to the independent value you originally intended for the function. Thus, &quot;counterintuitive&quot; shifting right with x-1 and left with x+1 is in fact quite intuitive if you realize that the independent is messed with FIRST, BEFORE the base function is executed!", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T05:24:50Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gabriel Carvalho Bergoc", "comment_text": "Awesome!!!", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T02:04:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Pimegouleon", "comment_text": "Merci pour la r\u00e9v\u00e9lation sur la tangente \u00e0 la minute <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=58m58s\">58:58</a>", "comment_date": "2020-12-15T01:01:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Pillinger", "comment_text": "Illustrating exact values of sinx and cosx is crucial", "comment_date": "2020-12-14T15:19:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Nathan Pillinger", "comment_text": "In highschool, I thought trig was triangles and waves.

This makes sense numerically but conceptually I do not agree that the tangent is undefined. The tangent in this representation will be the line y = 1 and for the next interval y = - 1 and so on. The tangent line itself still exists but it is parallel to the x-axis. So if one asks for the tangent of +/-90  or +/-270 degrees it should be +/- infinity...? It could be either as the tangent has two limits at those angles. <br><br>Another way to confirm that the tangent of +/-90, +/-270 is not undefined is by looking at the tangent of the angle in regards to the angle that is generated between the x-axis and the line generated by y = mx+b. We know that m = (rise/run) = (y2-y1/x2-x2) = (dy/dx) = (sin(t)/cos(t)) = tan(t) so we can say that y = tan(t)*x + b. If we look at this in the form of y = (sin(t)/cos(t))*x + b and we watch the limits of both the sin(t) and cos(t) as the angle approaches 90 degrees or PI/2 we can see that as theta increases sin(t) approaches 1 and cos(t) approaches 0 on the unit circle when theta approaches 90 degrees and the line y = mx+b becomes vertical. <br><br>The limits of both of these functions exist: sin(90) = 1 and cos(90) = 0. Both limits are real. Yes, numerically it is undefined because of division by 0, however, let&#39;s look at this from a calculus perspective with the use of limits and what is actually happening in these functions as theta approaches 90 degrees. We can see that y = (sin90/cos90)x + b we know that b = 1, so we know that y = (sin90/cos90) + 1.  We know that when theta = 90 the tangent line itself is parallel to the x-axis as it is defined by the line y = 1 so we can say that 1 = sin90/cos90 + 1 which would indicate that sin90/cos90 = 0. Yet this doesn&#39;t make sense because sin90 = 1 and cos90 = 0. This would imply that 1/0 = 0. Well in a sense it does, but simultaneously it also represents +/- infinity. Why and how? <br><br>The tangent line has a slope of 0 that is equivalent to the line generated by the equation (y = 1)  when the line y=mx+b rotated to generate the 90-degree angle. However, the line that generated this 90-degree angle above the horizontal or x-axis has now become parallel to the y-axis and also coincides with it. This line above the horizontal that was rotating as theta increased and approached 90 degrees is now defined by the line {x = 0} when theta is at 90 degrees. <br><br>There are always 2 lines that are involved when it comes to the trigonometric functions and these two lines always exist even at 90 degrees, both the sin and cos functions always exist as their domain is all reals and even all complex numbers and their range is [-1,1]. Both limits exist at 90 degrees, so why shouldn&#39;t the tangent exist? It does. It&#39;s just that the two lines or vectors that are at 90 degrees and being perpendicular are causing the tangent to go out into infinity. This limit exists. Because of this, I do not tend to think that division by 0 is undefined. Yes, it may be ambiguous as n/0 could be 0 or it could be +/- infinity. <br><br>The slope of the tangent line itself when it is defined by the line y = 1 has a slope of 0. The line y = mx+b that rotates around the origin that approaches +/-90 or +/-270 degrees is vertical and going towards +/- infinity. If you look at the triangle that is generated by the XY plane: x-axis, y-axis, the line y=mx+b, and the tangent line where that tangent line intersects both the y and x-axis and the line y=mx+b we have a triangle with a defined area and with 3 interior angles that add up to 180 degrees or PI radians. We also know that the angle of a line itself is 180 degrees or PI radians. <br><br>Now, take into consideration what happens to this triangle when theta becomes +/-90 and the tangent line becomes y = 1. We now have 2 parallel lines the x-axis and the lines y = +/- 1 depending on the interval of the tangent. There is no longer a triangle generated with a bounded area with 3 interior angles. We now have 3 horizontal lines that are intersected by the y-axis giving us an infinite amount of area because this is now coinciding with the x-direction of the plane while the line y = mx+b is coinciding with the y-direction of the plane. <br><br>If 1/0 = infinity and -1/0 = -infinity we know that perpendicular lines have slopes where their products = -1. Take the line y = x, for example, it has a slope of 1 and it is 45 degrees above the horizon. Now take the line y = -x as it has a slope of -1 respectively. These lines are 90 degrees from each other and we can see that the products of their slopes are indeed -1 since 1* -1 = -1.  So if a horizontal line such as the tangent line y = 1 has a slope of 0 which is defined by y = (sin(0)/cos(0))*x + 1 we see that y = (0/1)*x + 1 = 1.  <br><br>I claimed that sin(90)/cos(90) = 0 or +/- infinity. Let&#39;s check to see what happens. We have the line x = 0 which is defined by y = mx+ where b = y since x = 0 then m must be 0. So sin(90)/cos(90) should = 0 by this expression or does it? Where does the +/-infinity come in? Well, lets put these into the reciprocal equation for slopes: -1 = sin90/cos90 * sin0/cos0 === -1 = 1/0 * 0/1. From above, if the slope is to be 0 then this would equate to 0 * 0 = -1 and that doesn&#39;t make sense as 0*0 = 0. So it can&#39;t be 0. It&#39;s not! <br><br>This is where +/- infinity comes into play. Don&#39;t forget that the tangent has two asymptotes that are given by the two lines y = +/-1. There isn&#39;t just one but two lines. Now at 90 degrees itself, there is just one, but again at 270. So we have to consider that 1/0 = +/- infinity and we know that -1 = +/-infinity * 0 doesn&#39;t seem to make sense, yet people use to argue the same exact thing about sqrt(-1). We could dive deeper but that would extend into higher-level dimensions, lower-level dimensions, complex numbers, and complex planes involving integrations and derivatives, etc. <br><br>I tend to think of this as being a phase shift which makes sense because when you look at the cosine and sine graph they are both 90-degree or pi/2 radians horizontal translations of each other. Both functions are continuous so even when we divide by one the other doesn&#39;t stop being continuous so neither should the tangent. If we look at the limits of the sin(t) when t approaches 90 this is the height of the slope as it is approaching 1. Here we are at the state of having only vertical linear translation with 0 horizontal translation. This is equivalent to climbing up the rungs of a ladder on the outside of a building or the ones that are seen in water towers, etc. You no longer have XZ displacement with XZ being the horizontal plane. You only have Y displacement relative to the XZ position that you are climbing up from. This is evident since cos(t) = 0 when t = 90. It&#39;s all right there in the limits. I also tend to want to think that this phase shifting of the cosine and sine wave functions is why electrons and other wave particles appear to go in and out of existence. How they can be at one relative position while being observed, yet can be superimposed to an infinite amount of positions when no observers are present. This is phase-shifting happening in plain sight and we only have 3D eyes that see in 2D that allow us to perceive 3D. We don&#39;t have eyes to see in an infinite amount of dimensions to see that the tangent is wrapping in on itself and back out into our 2D and 3D planes.", "comment_date": "2020-04-22T09:32:35Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Andrew Kemperman", "comment_text": "im tripping and this is so lit, I took me hella long to solve all of it but I feel like I have a very mathmeticianesque understanding of it all finaly, Thank you so much you are a great teacher and if you keep making videos like these imma solve all your equations pretty soon, lol", "comment_date": "2020-04-22T09:29:37Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lika G.", "comment_text": "Thank you so much for the stream, it really helped to think deeper.

The final step is knowing that we are in the 1st quadrant, the cos, sin, cos and their reciprocal functions are all positive in the 1st quadrant.

We know that the Pythagorean Theorem is:  A^2+ B^2 = C^2. Let&#39;s keep this in mind.<br><br>I will show and prove 4 - 5 different things that most math classes never fully express and these are the following:<br>    *  The Pythagorean Theorem and the Equation to a Circle are symbolically similar, also The equation to the Unit Circle centered at the origin is, in fact, the Pythagorean Theorem! It&#39;s just that one is in terms of right triangles and the other is in terms of a circle with a radius of 1.<br>    *  That there is a direct relationship of the Trigonomic Functions and linear equations in regards to their slopes.<br>    *  Without considering the use of limits and applying them, the Tangent Function is, in contrast, the definition of the slope function that is used to define a derivative within Calculus.<br>    * That vector notation is symbolic of both linear and trigonometric calculations. For example \u27e8a,b\u27e9=\u2225a\u2225\u2225b\u2225cos\u03b8 which states that the dot product between two vectors is the product of their magnitudes multiplied by the cosine of the angle between them. So if you know the lengths of two vectors you can find the angle! After you calculate the dot product, then you would have to take the arccos of that value, however, make sure you are using the right system (degrees, radians) to get the correct result you are looking for.<br>   * All of this is rooted in the simplest of all mathematical expressions, not even an equation or a function, just a simple expression, being the very first one we are ever taught: (1+1) and that the operation of adding one to itself satisfies the construction of both the Unit Circle and defines the Pythagorean Theorem. Also, when we turn this into an equation (1+1) = 2 we will see that there is perfect symmetry, reflection, and rotation that is embedded within this. <br><br> The comparison of the Pythagorean Theorem and the Equation to a Circle:<br>    The equation to an arbitrary circle is defined by (x \u2013 h)^2 + (y \u2013 k)^2 = r^2 where (h,k) is the 2D coordinate of the center of the circle. <br>    Let&#39;s center this at the origin (0,0) and refer to the unit circle with a radius of 1. We now end up with:  (x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 + 1^2 =  x^2 + y^2 = 1.<br>    Let&#39;s compare this to the Pythagorean Theorem. x^2 + y^2 = 1 == A^2 + B^2 + C^2 when C = 1. So for any circle that is centered at the origin, it&#39;s equation is the Pythagorean Theorem.<br><br>The direct relationship of the Trigonometric Functions and Linear Equations:<br>  We will use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation: y = mx+b.  We know that m is defined by rise/run or (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) where can use the coordinate points to find the slope. The value of this slope is a proportion of how much change in height over the change in the horizontal. All angles will be relative to the line y = mx+b and the x-axis.  In other words, it is the angle that is above the X-axis or the Horizontal axis up to the line itself. Here I mentioned the rate of change. We can take rise/run or (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) and rewrite this as dy/dx. We know that we can make a right triangle from the x-axis up to the line in question. By doing so we can see that the dy is also sin(t) and dx is cos(t). We can see that the slope of the line m is also the tangent of the angle above the horizon to that line. So we can rewrite the slope-intercept form y = mx+b to y = tan(t)x + b or sin(t)/cos(t)x + b. This will lead us to the next section about derivatives!<br><br>The Tangent Function and the Derivative: We know that when we have a curve that its slope is not constant. We can take two points on that curve that are relatively close and get a good approximation of its slope near that point, however, the farther the gap the more margin of error this is. This approach is what is referred to as finding the secant slope. If we make smaller and smaller incremental steps where we get closer and closer to that point where the limit of the size of that step approaches 0, we then end up with a line that has the slope of that point which is tangent to that curve at that point. This is seen in the difference quotient in Calculus to find a derivative.  f&#39;(x) = lim dx-&gt;0  (f(x+dx) - f(x))/dx  Which is basically taking the slope form of a line (y2 - y1/(x2-x1) and rewriting it from point notation into function notation with respect to x, changing the difference in points to rate of change by using delta x and delta y, which is still all algebra, and the only part that is Calculus is when you actually apply the limit! So in a sense, we can see a direct relationship and similarity of (f(x+dx) - f(x)) / dx  and tan(t). If we substitute tan(t) as sin(t)/cos(t). We can see that cos(t) = dx which is straight forward. However, if we look at f(x+dx) - f(x) it isn&#39;t quite obvious but this would be equivalent to sin(t). Where t is the angle above the x-axis and up to the point on the curve whose slope is the tangent of that angle produced by that linear equation.<br><br>The vector portion should be self-explanatory as I had already mentioned the most important piece and that is the dot product in relation to the cosine of the angle between those two vectors. Not much more needs to be expressed about this here, but will be referred in the last section. <br><br>(...continued in a reply to this post)", "comment_date": "2020-04-22T06:20:48Z", "likes_count": 72}, {"comment_by": "EpiCuber7", "comment_text": "Is anyone else finding the audio very quiet?", "comment_date": "2020-04-22T06:20:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "TheWtfness", "comment_text": "Why is the audio volume so low in these videos ?", "comment_date": "2020-04-22T06:13:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "nivekastoreth", "comment_text": "Boy it&#39;s hard to keep thinking in radians while also talking about 90 degree triangles instead of \u03c0/2 radian triangles (and who ever talks that way)", "comment_date": "2020-04-22T06:00:00Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "PRANAY GHOSAL", "comment_text": "sir make video on legendre transformation  intution  pleassssseeeeeee", "comment_date": "2020-04-22T05:57:36Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "AK", "comment_text": "When is the next live stream?", "comment_date": "2020-04-22T05:53:03Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Delta Nebula", "comment_text": "Your content is SUCH HIGH QUALITY.

It helps build that intuition for where sine and cosine are -1, 0, or 1... and also what sign to expect the value to be in which quadrant. I then extend it to tangent as being the slope/gradient of that rotating radius vector which explains why the rotation by pi has the same tangent value, because it&#39;s part of the same line that goes through the circle&#39;s centre. :)", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T21:17:39Z", "likes_count": 8}, {"comment_by": "BlauesSerpiroyal", "comment_text": "Timestamps:<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=9m15s\">9:15</a> Grant comes to the stream<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=12m17s\">12:17</a> What will we talk about today<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=14m36s\">14:36</a> Graph of cos(x)\u00b2 <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=17m59s\">17:59</a> equation for cos(x)\u00b2 <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=19m40s\">19:40</a> the new music<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=25m59s\">25:59</a> trigonometry basis<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=34m49s\">34:49</a> leaning tower of pisa<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=39m45s\">39:45</a> the functions on the unit-circle<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=43m04s\">43:04</a> computing special values<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=55m00s\">55:00</a> negative angles<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=56m10s\">56:10</a> reality breaks<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=59m30s\">59:30</a> using cos\u00b2(x) for computing values<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=1h03m31s\">1:03:31</a> reality breaks (again)<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=1h09m03s\">1:09:03</a> where is tan(\u03b8) on the unit-circle?<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBw67Fb31Cs&amp;t=1h16m20s\">1:16:20</a> where is cos\u00b2(\u03b8) on the unit-circle?", "comment_date": "2020-04-21T21:16:24Z", "likes_count": 43}, {"comment_by": "S1m0ne", "comment_text": "Yeah I&#39;ve been out of high school for almost 20 years and you&#39;re making me as excited about math as I was when I was a freshman.
