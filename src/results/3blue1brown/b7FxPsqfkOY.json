[side note: having a circle on a sphere is one of the most natural curves that can be cut (with a plane) from the sphere.] and also the opposite of not having a clue for a solution from a certain circle does not mean that there is no solution - it only means that the number of solutions on either side is &quot;balanced&quot;. in the majority of cases its likely that one side might have zero solutions whilst the other side has 2*N solutions. many other pairings are possible. the down side is: we have gained no helpful clue with that circle - looking for other more circles with better clue values might help - and yes, that&#39;s a start problem, and it has a non-mathematical brute force nature which in real world empirical attempts will often happen. if you are able to find a sign change then you are at the starting point. having the right &quot;slide&quot; on the color plane to &quot;circle&quot; your first sign change might be a (video) story of its own.", "comment_date": "2019-11-23T08:56:30Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "M", "comment_text": "<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7FxPsqfkOY&amp;t=30m13s\">30:13</a> now THAT surprised me", "comment_date": "2019-10-21T20:50:23Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Ondrej Hrdy", "comment_text": "Can anyone here please explain to me why are there always n outputs in complex equations with x^n in terms of the colour spectrum used in the video?", "comment_date": "2019-10-20T08:07:14Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Lyons Den", "comment_text": "Why did you choose your channel name?", "comment_date": "2019-10-19T19:24:15Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Gast\u00f3n Haro", "comment_text": "Man you are taking this animations to another level!

But in this case, the enclosing object must be a surface volume. And covering that whole surface volume which since it is a cubic region I assume would take O(n^3) for each iteration which is no faster than Gaussian Elimination. What would become of the idea of winding in such a domain? Maybe I should drop a dimension and think of 3D systems.<br><br>If you build a box in 3D space and draw a vector field on its surface representing the output vectors that the surface points correspond to, those vectors no longer cycle in the same sense as in 2D. One could have a loop on the surface that passes through all flat 2D angles but which contains only a vertical vector (or cowlick if you know of the hairy ball theorem) and not a zero at its centre. If we check to see if all 3D angles are represented we run into the same problem as we had in 2D.<br>But one thing that we can do is look at flux. Since I am taking a class in electromagnetics right now, I know that you can tell how much charge there is in a container but how much flux or field lines pass through that container and since a point charge is essentially a singularity and singularities tend to be found by bisection just as well as zeros, I think that something analogous to flux integration might work for finding zeros. And it also makes sense in the 2D example since the winding example was essentially just integrating the changes in angles as you travel along the loop. But on the other hand, integrating the electric field only works because the electric field is conservative because it is the gradient of voltage. So maybe one needs to integrate the gradient of the output of the function that you want to find roots in. And then if the integral of the gradient is non-zero, then is a zero/singularity guaranteed inside the surface? Well in the case of a dipole, couldn&#39;t the root hide? Doesn&#39;t a double root normally escape the bisection method anyways even in 1D which is why even powered examples tended to be avoided in the video?<br><br>Anyways, If the integral of the gradient along an enclosing curve works in 2D as shown in the video, and I suspect will work on enclosing surface in 3D, why not an enclosing volume in 4D or even higher?<br><br>Anyways, towards a proof for 3D. The gradient of a function is the &quot;slope&quot; including both its direction and magnitude (like a derivative but in more dimensions). So the 3D function f=(x^2+4,y^2,z^2) has a value of x^2 in the x dimension, which changes 2x for every sufficiently small change in x and similarly for y and z, the gradient of f is gradient(f)=(2x,2y,2z) so far so good. But now I see the problem, the gradient only finds minimums and maximums, not roots. It works with electric fields because the point charges are maximums, not because they are singularities.<br><br>So I guess that didn&#39;t work for finding zeros.<br><br>So what did it really mean to count the winding in the 2D case? The winding only cares about the direction, not the magnitude, so it obviously normalizes the field, and then it integrates not the actual angle, but the change in the angle. And the integral of the change in the angle over the loop. But isn&#39;t the integral of a derivative just undoing the derivative or averaging the angle somehow but without any constant offset because the derivative removes things like that?<br><br>Anyways, I didn&#39;t solve the problem and I am getting increasing sick with a cold and tired because it is late, but that was a fun little hour of thought.", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T02:32:41Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Matthew McMurry", "comment_text": "Is the winding number just like a path integral?", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T02:30:26Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "columbus8myhw", "comment_text": "Why is 3B1B consistently high art", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T02:27:15Z", "likes_count": 7}, {"comment_by": "Gilberto Geraldo", "comment_text": "hi, i have a question, in the example. min @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7FxPsqfkOY&amp;t=21m30s\">21:30</a> the problem have 5 zeros,  but the algorithm broke when found a zero on the edge, how can we fix this kind of behavior?<br><br>Btw, i love your videos, and i want to know how do you make them, which kind of software do you use in order to graph that kind of examples?", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T02:19:56Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "comelypepper", "comment_text": "I feel some ideas I have seen before on wikipedia connected to this in a deep, visceral, way but in a way that feels inarticulable and unconfirmed because I currently don&#39;t have the practiced words/names/learned concepts/subject area proficiency to check if they truly are. Some things I&#39;ve seen that I feel might be related are:<br><br>Cauchy Argument Principle: This is a statement about a contour integral of the logarithmic derivative around an area of a complex function tells us about the number of poles and zeroes in the image of the area. Even the fact that it seems to be called &quot;logarithmic derivative&quot; feels very close to the idea of winding number because I know with complex numbers, instead of a+bi, we can write them as re^i(theta), so in some way, just as taking the logarithm of a complex number might tell us about theta in the imaginary part, perhaps taking the logarithmic derivative tells us about infinitesimal changes of the direction/argument given infinitesimal nudges of the image/point of the complex function given infinitesimal nudges of the pre-image? I&#39;m thinking now we can write any complex number as f(z) = r(z) * e^itheta(z) where r and theta have as their codomain the real numbers, and if so, we have that f&#39;(z) = r&#39;(z) * e^i theta(z) + r(z) * e^ i theta(z) * (i*theta&#39;(z)), which when we use to evaluate the logarithmic derivative f&#39;(z)/f(z) = r&#39;(z)/r(z) + i*theta&#39;(z), which seems to have a change in the argument given a change in z, which would integrate to a winding number for traversals around things that map to the origin of the complex plane. Perhaps the r&#39;(z)/r(z) part is related to the poles part of the argument principle, and encircling infinity in the codomain, but I wouldn&#39;t even know where to start with the idea of encircling &quot;infinity&quot; unless we can use the orientation of a loop, or a special type of loop. The r&#39;(z)/r(z) might just go to zero because the argument principle states no real part, and perhaps this is due to a closed loop.<br><br>Other ideas that seem to connect/be related as offshoots are stability criteria/anything in control theory that makes use of results from complex analysis to get information about poles and zeroes for characterizing systems when you have the laplace transform of the system&#39;s time domain response.<br><br>Other things that seem related in a less rigorous/demonstrable way (for me personally) is the concept of holonomy which is the difference in angle of a tangent vector and the resulting vector when you transport it along a loop on a  manifold/smooth surface back to where it started, monodromy (this I don&#39;t get, but I imagine the picture of going around the origin of log(z)), and for some reason, DeRham cohomology.<br><br>If anyone is familiar with complex analysis, control theory, and differential geometry, any direction would be great.", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T02:19:32Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "logicalfundy", "comment_text": "This does make me wonder if there&#39;s a way to resolve the zero winding problem so the search can potentially continue in those areas.", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T02:15:58Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "SexDrugsNpostprod", "comment_text": "&lt;3", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T02:05:29Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Benjamin Wilson", "comment_text": "If Welch Labs hasn&#39;t seen this he&#39;d love it.", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T02:05:18Z", "likes_count": 1}, {"comment_by": "Penny Lane", "comment_text": "Couldn&#39;t the range of all colors also surround a pole?", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T01:57:57Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Dannyu NDos", "comment_text": "How should we deal with infinite discontinuities?", "comment_date": "2018-03-25T01:57:12Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Eli Pregerson", "comment_text": "Ugg in my engineering class CCW=positive and CW=negative.
