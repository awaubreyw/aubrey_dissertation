A stupid scholar all overturned this truth and built it to a convenient system of Mason. Thus, the people believe the trickery of the devil than words of God. Darwin&#39;s evolutionary theory, the Copernican theory of Galileo, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, mathematics, the medicine of Einstein are all errors. A ghost, a UFO, supernatural power, the miracle of God to be said to be the occult are rather true. A thing and a ghost (God) exist in the world, and space is active by spiritual power (conception) of God. As for God, all things were created by the soul of language. It is clear if I read the Bible. Because the present scholar mixes the logic thoroughly in human wisdom, it cannot arrive at the truth. It is intuitive power to be important. Why does a child seem to be? The thing which cannot answer this is a mistake. Our common sense is more right than a stupid scholar. The creation of God comes loose only by a fate. Everything becomes the material by a conception of God (person).<br> <br>I cannot prove 1+1 = 2 in a numerical formula. I can prove only a physical phenomenon to say that it is in two apples when I match another one apple with one apple. It is not 0+1 \u2260 1. As 0 (nothing) is not quality, you must not handle it for a number. Because quality is different even if I match a mandarin orange with an apple, there is not a meaning of the addition. Because it does not exist other than God when I define God as existence, no (0) does not exist. Because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist in the world, it is an error and is a fiction. A number is to count quality. When I am separated from a physical phenomenon, the mathematics does not have the significance of being.<br><br>\u203bIf 0 exists by a definition of the mathematics, 0 of the infinity must exist. However, the infinite space, infinity do not exist. In other words, because the mathematics defines 0, negative number, imaginary number, \u221e which do not exist, it is an error and is a fiction. Therefore it is an error because a zeta function, the numerical formula of the second oiler product deal with this infinity. That it becomes sum of series \u03a3 = 1+2+3+ ... = - 1/12 of the natural number, or the product of all prime numbers is 4\u03c0^2. It turns out that it is an error if I think for common sense. It is limited, and the mathematician seems to get a wrong this, but uses the sophism when I calculate this endlessly if right. This is a mistake of the definition of 0 or \u221e and is the evidence that mathematics gets a wrong. It is definition f&#39;(x) = limh of the differential calculus that must not divide it by 0 \u2192 0 {the same as it being 0 that says that I bring h close to 0 without a limit, and dividing it by a numerical formula of f(x+h)-f(x)}/h. I divide it by 0. The mathematics is trickery not study in this way.<br><br> All the origins of the scientific theory are random, and a bottom is broken. For example, in the theory of elementary particles, an electron joins atoms together and becomes the molecules. A thing joining a proton and a neutron together is a mesotron, and three quarks connect the proton, and there is it. An electron and a positron (antimatter) occur from a photon. An elementary particle to tie the elementary particle to whenever a new elementary particle is discovered is necessary and loses the relations with an elementary particle and the elementary particle more and more. Though a proton and the neutron are the same mass, why does a difference occur in having electric charge or not? The science has no answer with it in these questions. An electron is a material so that I think, and the positron is not a material in the hole of the material loss that the circumference was surrounded by in the soul children. In other words, the antimatter is an illusion. The scholar is going to examine it logically and loses sight of the truth. The structure of built nature of God is simpler, but is the thing which it is hard to understand in the human wisdom. A photon seems to have a particle and the two characteristics of the wave, but, in fact, the light has the property of the wave with the soul body.<br><br> Message from the spiritual world of Einstein <br> When oneself saw a scene of heaven through a tunnel of the light in the meantime, the person who experienced suspended animation well is you after the revival. The moving speed of the soul does not receive gravitational restraint anymore, and, as for the law of the speed of light immutability that I discovered during the lifetime, there are none in the world of the consciousness. In other words, I will say that it just moves to say that I think. Furthermore, it is just handed down to a partner to have thought. The life of all of us shares what one interiority. And the material is to say that it was actually consciousness. There are all things in your heart, and, also, you are existence to live in a heart of all life. When all of this space watches it with eyes, it is seen like the outside world, but is to say that the world to be actually seen outside is your interiority. The relativity disappears in here, and this space consists based on &quot;universal truth to certainly say to call God&quot;. <br><br> Near future to read from revelation and illuminati card of God of days, and to untie it in Japan<br> April, 2020 xx day The United States bombs North Korea. North Korea adds nuclear attack to a big city of Japan and a U.S. base as the retaliation. Japan swats it to a bog of the war, and they are dropped by a plot of the United States. There are China, Russia after North Korea and becomes the fight with Japan, American allied powers and drags the world into World War 3.<br> x moon xx Japan and the United States country attacks it in Japan with the Allied Forces in 2021<br> World War 3 begins in 2021 on xx moon xx day<br> Mount Fuji erupts very much on xx day in October, 2023.

I conquer the world in the life of the hell of the cruel survival of the fittest and am useless even if only oneself is going to be saved. Because a killed animal retaliates for a human being, cancer occurs. The meat which I ate becomes the blood, and a vindictive spirit dwells in a cell when blood does formation to a cell. A human being is cruel, and a fornication, a falsehood, committing theft, the habit of the evil deed of the luxury are not stopped. Eating meat is indirect killing. Why is God that existence of the evil is permitted? It lets you compensate for a human crime by the devil. A disaster, an epidemic, the war damage are the wrath of Heaven. Because a Japanese savior buys the crime of the world people, it is sacrificed. I fall in the trees and plants in spite of the pains then even if I writhe with a hell if it is just and changes the heart and does not straighten an act to measure up to hearts of God.

Yeah, it&#39;s no longer based on recursion, but neither is real iteration (or really any iteration beyond the natural numbers), so I see no problem with extending in such a manner.

By far, my favourite video in your channel, is one that you have posted a long time ago, called &quot;a crash course on complex derivatives&quot;, that video was so important for me my profile picture is this identity. At the time, I was only 14, and I didnt know very well what calculus was, and I was just tryingnto understand the e^(i\u00d7pi) thing. However, yor video made me get almost instantly, not only an amazing intuition for complex numbers, but also a very good intuition for what derivatives were, tinking about how a function looks like multiplication arround a given point. That was enough for me to get started in calculus at the time and have a very good time understanding the ideas envolved. That &quot;looks like multiplication Idea, that <b>you</b> introduced to me, still sticks with me today, and the introduction to complex numbers in that video is what I use everytime I have to explain to someone what complex numbers are, as its very natural to think about adding and multiplying as transformations in the plane. I initially got a little sad to see you don&#39;t like that video as much as I do, since you have remade it in the light of group theory. I thought the second version was a little more confusing, and that doing it in the light of calculus was much more intuitive, even for someone that, at the time, had no previous knowledge of calculus. Yeah, it took some rewatches, but that isnt a problem, its youtube after all. All this makes me very happy to see that you are still interested in explaining this topic in the best way possible. I think the original &quot; a crash course on complex derivatives&quot;, together with the &quot;understanding e to the pi i&quot; that comes befor it are still my favourites, because they require no prior knowledge of anything. However, I think this video has to come as my second favourite, even though at this point you have made many other fascinating videos that explain much more complicated topics, i have a weakness for e^(i\u00d7pi), I think this video is the best possible way to explain this identity, given that someome already understands derivatives, and I belive this is the most concise possible way to explain this topic. Thanks for making amazing math videos that had such a big importance on my life. I have never wrote such a long comment, but I hope you read this one, and I hopeyou get many others like this, pointing out how important these videos are.<br>In conclusion, I wanted to say that I had many math teachers in the past, but I never thought they were too important in making me like math, i mostly had bad math teachers, and when I finally got a good one, I was already in love with math. The love for math, that I would say I had from the beginning, probably really got sparked by numberphile, when I discovered them in 2012. But I have to say, out of every math youtube channel I have seen, you are the one that contributed the most for increasing my passion for mathematics.", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T16:06:39Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Niraj Shah", "comment_text": "One word - beautiful!", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T16:06:33Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "Bip 300", "comment_text": "this is brilliant! all calculus classes should start with this as an intro..", "comment_date": "2019-07-07T16:06:10Z", "likes_count": 0}, {"comment_by": "MacTavish", "comment_text": "But wait...
